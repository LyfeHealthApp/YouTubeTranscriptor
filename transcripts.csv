Strange & Weird Niacin (B3) Deficiency Signs and Symptoms	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k	Dr. Eric Berg DC	now there strange very unique different symptoms with a B3 nice and deficiency that you need to know about um because you might have these you dermatitis really bad skin reactions diarrhea dementia and the fourth one is death other than that you through the subclinical symptoms okay and this might shock you and we talking about subclinical we about not a major deficiency you deficient to a certain degree number one you might lose this sense of taste and number two um you might have a metallic taste in your mouth or rancid taste in your mouth that could be a nice in deficiency and the good thing about that is just by taking it within a week that could resolve it depending on how deficient you are uh the next one is a loss of smell normally we think about zinc being a deficiency of smell but it can also o be niin or you might have a change in your smell things don like they should next one is when you looking in the mirror your face is moving a little bit okay that wild it might not necessarily be moving but it could be changing shapes when you read a book you notice that the words and the page tend to move a little bit when you ground seems to be a little unstable or could be moving a little bit you may also have fatigue or just the feeling like you can subclinical nin deficiencies now the major deficiency is called pgra and just so you know um to correct these deficiencies you can normal rdas which is like 20 milligrams you can take niin or n acetamide which is the non flush version but you need amounts like six gram per day that correct some of these deficiencies one big reason why we need niin is for our mitochondria it you extract electrons from foods which is your energy currency B3 directly is the precursor for this and also having a sufficient amounts of niin you can produce more energy from the food that you eat you can support something called cerin which is involved in longevity and DNA repair I mean if you think about most diseases they really originate from the mitochondria in all these degenerative diseases you see a great deficiency of this NAD and especially in diseases that are related to aging okay because as you age your NAD gets less and less and less tryptophan can actually turn into niin tryptophan also converts to serotonin and then melatonin for your sleep but B3 is super important for your skin I mean think about what a deficiency will create severe scaly damaged skin so it super beneficial for the skin for acne psoriasis if you take uh the form of B3 as niacinamide that can actually help you more with inflammatory conditions like rheumat arthritis any of the arthritis is but the nasin version greatly helps your lipids cholesterol LDL HDL it was really really popular before um we came out with statins and of course now with res research uh we found out no longer has any benefits right well if someone told me that niin doesn what happens when you become deficient in nasin and if we take a look at what foods um are high in B3 you find high levels of B3 in animal meat products as well as liver organ Meats but definitely red meat for sure at the top of the list it but not to the degree that it animal foods but you can also get it from nutritional yeast if you to get it from nutritional yeast I would recommend getting it without the added synthetic vitamins that they normally put in there you can also um get it from spirulina as well there amount of research on nin for cholesterol the heart um and many other conditions I was surprised on how much research there is on this topic and even for schizophrenia depression uh bipolar all sorts of mood disorders how do we become deficient processed foods can create a B3 deficiency processed corn processed grains wheat cereal things like that the more protein in carbs that you eat the more the requirement for B3 is going to be because B3 is intimately involved in help helping you um extract energy out of food but of course if you the right Foods you that refined Foods or the ultra processed foods uh pregnancy being an alcoholic covid-19 can increase the demand for B3 therefore explaining a lot of the symptoms with a lack of smell and taste yes it can be a zinc deficiency but don if you medications boy your your need for B3 goes way up as well and I think a lot of people might be concerned with the flushing of the niin um well you can use the nonf flush version um unless you have a specific problem with um cholesterol and you want to lower the cholesterol you need the flushing version but you can just start off very small and then gradually over time increase it to the point where your body will adapt to the flushing I personally don dangerous but sometimes people think they people take nasin also for a fatty liver and overall there increase the demand for nin like I talked about or it could just be you have a deficiency in your uh diet now since we are on the topic of nutrients if you have not seen my video on zinc it you should check that one out as well I put that up right here	Success
B3 (Niacin) and Schizophrenia	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwGHf22kHmE	Dr. Eric Berg DC	let schizophrenia now there fascinating information on this topic schizophrenia is a combination of having hallucinations delusions paranoia mixed with feeling disconnected loss of interest in life and feeling emotion list which basically is your apathetic now the medical theory of what causes schizophrenia is you have dopamine excess and so you certain drugs to help regulate that the problem with those drugs is it has certain side effects that cause metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance which has been shown to worsen these symptoms because of what it does to the brain so as a side note there links down below of how ketones going on the ketogenic diet can help reduce those symptoms but that video it there was a doctor named Dr Abraham Hofer some years ago who had a different Theory and that theory was called the adrenal Chrome Theory adrenal Chrome is basically the byproducts of adrenaline and in his research he found that the chemical structure of adrenaline was very similar to LSD and so it had certain types of effects on the brain if it was in higher amounts so his whole theory was that schizophrenia comes from excessive amounts of adrenal Chrome in the brain which is toxic now normally you clears that chemical out and people with schizophrenia have a defect with this enzyme so he found that by taking large doses of B3 and I straight niin I time relase niin the one that doesn give you the flush um there effects with that one rather rather than just take straight B3 niin but anyway he found that by taking large doses of niin you can prevent the conversion of the precursor for adrenaline called noradrenaline thereby making less adrenaline so it will help clear out adrenaline it helps you produce less adrenaline which can be toxic to the brain especially if you have a defect to this enzyme but also B3 will reduce liver toxicity it reduce oxidative stress in your mitochondria as well as help your DNA repair there were several double blonded studies that were done one of the studies showed a 79.5% Improvement in symptoms now he died some years ago but recently there were some other additional studies that were done to show improvements with schizophrenia using high doses of not just B3 but other B vitamins as well I before you go if you have a question about a product or you and you want to know how to begin keto or you because it a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the US hopefully in the future we to answer everyone number down below so you can call and get some help	Success
Subclinical Pellagra (Vitamin B3 Deficiency) ï¿½ Dr.Berg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVXUdhH7z0M	Dr. Eric Berg DC	so today we subclinical pellagra okay soap Allegra is a vitamin b3 deficiency and when you have pellagra it classical b3 deficiency and then it called the three DS dementia diarrhea and you get dermatitis okay usually around the neck in the hands can be a pretty serious condition but there is also a subclinical pellagra where you not you don deficiency but you are deficient okay and I would create as far as symptoms there a neurological condition called neurasthenia which is exhaustion of the central nervous system so the energy reserves of your nervous system in the mitochondria is exhausted so you mentally exhausted you headache irritable intracranial pressure digestive issues fainting if you get up too fast also you have different neurological perception changes as well let the mirror at yourself and you just see that the your face is changing okay or let a piece of paper and the words are moving or you is moving or you at the picture and you see it going back and forth it can also affect your taste you lose the sense of taste and smell and sometimes you actually smell something that so b3 or niacin is really a coenzyme involved in a lot of different chemical reactions inside the body especially in the mitochondria the energy factor of the cell and the way you could become depleted is by drinking a lot of alcohol like in college right chronic diarrhea excessive leucine that inflamed gut gastric by-pass consuming too much corn corn has a protein that can block the absorption of vitamin b3 also refined carbohydrates and refined sugars will also create a vitamin b3 deficiency niacin which is b3 has the ability to protect against diabetes especially type 1 so it helps counter the destruction or the oxidation of the cell that makes insulin nice and also can lower your cholesterol so you can see that vitamin b3 is very very important in a lot of different functions I recommend getting your b3 from nutritional yeast but if you have any of these symptoms right here start taking niacin in higher amounts and you can safely take nice and at 10 to 15 X the normal amounts all right guys I you the next video so to prevent me from running out of content I have a new survey I want to find out what you are interested in so please fill it out the links down below	Success
Is a Niacin Flush Harmful or Dangerous?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BafsDqvqf3w	Dr. Eric Berg DC	had a recent question from someone that wanted it now is the niacin flesh harmful or dangerous well the answer is no it is not harmful or dangerous what massive relaxation of the muscles inside your blood vessels it occurring because niacin increases something called prostaglandins now what is a prostate glandin it lipid or fat compound that has a hormone effect and prostaglandins increase vasodilation they help reduce blood pressure it helps blood clotting it involved in headaches and fever this is why when you take an aspirin which blocks prostaglandins and it can reduce a fever so that you red response some people don they think it something some people like it i actually like it myself i like that flushing response but it dangerous at all the thing you need to know about niacin is that it therapeutically has been used over 50 years and it is the most effective natural agent for increasing your hdl the good cholesterol by 20 to 40 percent it also can decrease the ldl specifically the small dense type the damaging ldl and it can has the potential to decrease your triglycerides now of course if you did the ketogenic diet and your intermittent fasting that would help your cholesterol greatly but if you cholesterol you should be on niacin for sure but you would have to take higher amounts of it one to two thousand milligrams a day now if you take the type of niacin that is non-flushing it doesn those cholesterol lowering benefits now the other thing that niacin has been proven beneficial for is by reducing schizophrenia there this i below but niacin has many other benefits but these are two big benefits if you haven niacin i right here check them out	Success
Niacin vs. Niacinamide	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFW5dB3G-0c	Dr. Eric Berg DC	I between the two different forms of B3 we have niin and we have netmite the two big differences are this niin will give you the flush okay that flushing response the vasodilation response but nicomide won effect of B3 other important distinction is with niin you get all the lipid benefits okay so you have all all these great benefits with um lowering cholesterol lowering LDL increasing HDL decreasing inflammation inside the artery whereas niacinamide does not have those benefits so if you lower your cholesterol niin is the one you want to use now both of these vitamins chemically work in a similar way especially in turning food into energy Now nasin is really effective for fatty liver not just a fatty liver but a liver that developing Scar Tissue like in therosis and so nasin is a really good to remove fat from your liver now what interesting about this B3 both nin and niacinamide is the amount of research that is done on this compound I mean it just curious like why would they do all this research on something that a vitamin it competes for certain drugs I mean they found nasin to be a standalone effective remedy for managing your cholesterol and doctors used to use uh nasin before Statin came on stage but if you dig a little bit further you um quite a few articles and uh internet links to the dangers of nasin so I want to talk about that you know it of discouragement from using nin because it could be dangerous to your liver can create liver toxicity and if you actually read some of these articles you would never take niin well if you dig a little further you that it with a certain percent of the population like 20% of the population that is taking very high doses over a long period of Time and Time release nin it actually not as common as you might think I mean when you think about even watching a commercial a drug commercial in the US I mean may cause projectile vomiting suicide it might put you in coma and you might die I mean think about the side effects from medication and then you compare that to some rare side effect from a vitamin it just does not compare I mean you know any medication that doesn commonly now there is one article I want to bring up just right now um related to ni and increasing your liver enzymes right which again is rare but one doctor had an interesting um commentary on that that point because when you start to increase niin and you start to increase this co-actor of making energy not just in your liver but in all the organs apparently there demand for liver enzymes to make that happen so one potential possible reason for an increase in liver enzymes is just that you giving more energy to the rest of the body so now that I got that out of the way let nin apparently it has been effective for schizophrenia now there is some data related to certain genetic variations or problems which can put someone at risk for having schizophrenia and apparently this Gene which is n a p r T1 is the enzyme for making niin interesting coincidence so if any of you know anyone with schizophrenia definitely haven watch this video and there another uh condition that I want to bring up called drug induced discinesia which is a condition where you these involuntary abnormal movements of your body and there research on adding nasin and manganese for that condition so if you have discinesia you may want to use those two things so now let talk a little bit more about that what other conditions has this been shown to be effective in well number one acne dermatitis rosacea and even psoriasis both taking in capsule form as well as in a crane there it can help you with that I to get into but basically it your histamines it will reduce uh certain immune inflammatory factors it plaques on your skin and for acne it can actually help decrease sebum which is the oil in the SA gland which is inflamed Nomine has also been effective for arthritis it certain facial creams for preventing aging and hyperpigmentation Nomine is also good for the person who has a temper uh you can give it to your kids that have have a temper tantrum and it anxiety okay and so is B1 but B3 is also good as I was reading the side effect from n you know I was just thinking what if you became deficient in B3 what would be the side effects of that right people don that is a serious condition where you have diarrhea you have depression uh you could die you can get dementia and develop a really serious skin disorder but you can develop a B3 deficiency by drinking a lot of alcohol by consuming a lot of refin F Foods especially corn apparently corn tends to bind up uh tryptophan which is amino acid that turns into niin and so the early Indians when they used to um use Ma or corn in their food they had a technique they would soak it in lime and that would alkalize this corn meal and that would free up the nasin that was necessary to prevent pgra but of of course nowadays we don the corn and we just eat it in corn chips and all sorts of foods but if you chances are you probably are going to develop pgra in summary nasin gives you the flesh Nomine won flesh nasin is really good for cholesterol all aspects of cholesterol your lipids and a fatty liver it for all that it schizophrenia discinesia and then nicomide is really good for um everything related to the skin and inflammation and arthritis and anxiety now since we touched on these lipids and cholesterol I did an exclusive video on the relationship between taking niin and what it can do for your cholesterol in more detail you should check that out I put it up right here	Success
