I used to be in so much pain	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2okQ-Q0KuVo	Bryan Johnson	this is building brain tree I think for me the the thing this image does more than anything is I had come down with a chronic depression I say come down because not sleeping with children and working very hard as an entrepreneur I just kind of cracked and depression was upon me and so when I look at this I can see Brian I can see how much pain he it moment and he just wants to die and so even though he dying	Success
Growing up Mormon, being different was really hard	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDVIUKt6aZI	Bryan Johnson	yeah I was born into a rural Utah area my grandpa had a farm the community was deeply religious so everyone believe the same thing so little Brian here he doesn about to enter a situation where he told that only one reality in existence is true because we were all Mormon there was very little opportunity to be different in any horizontal way like you know you we all believe the same thing we had the same morals we had the same ethics we went to the same church we beli the same things and so to be different was really hard you had to do other things to be distinct and unique and so my friends and I we cut lines in the side of our head as a style I also got braces oh I guess I	Success
f**k it. i built the perfect meal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfGqIonL26c	Bryan Johnson	hi friends so blueprint has a product out that I because I haven to say go buy this thing because my relationship with the world over the past 3 years is giving everything away for free so 3 years ago I asked the question can we defeat death and that process included me hiring 30 medical professionals I became the most measured person in human history and I shared everything for free all the time and then it went viral and people said make it easy to do it and that that people would say things like now you you and so I line I and just say this is fantastic it probably the best thing you can buy in market and I you think I have ulterior motives that fine cool go do your thing but for those of you who trust me which you should CU I am trustworthy I think it is legitimately the best health protocol ever built it 74 Active Health therapies built upon over 1,000 clinical trials it a day a specially sourced extraversion olive oil a longevity protein and a longevity drink it takes about 3 minutes you can consume it all in one go you can separate it out when I compare compare this to what existed 3 years ago doesn and that controls we have in place like now that I how dirty stuff is you didn knew but now you know I know I alarmed if we like broccoli powder and lentils and we get these things back we get the heavy metal test back and it something else the food supply is very dirty so I would say if you can buy the entire thing and make it part of your daily protocol now again if you skeptical go back to my free version evaluate my data criticize it find a better path do you that I do want to say with in no uncertain terms that this is really worth it one of the most common responses I get is people say but that you actually it personalization I do at blueprint is pretty small there are some things which I share on my website which I based upon my individual results but these things are B based upon population level studies like for example everyone benefits from exercise everyone benefits from eating vegetables people overweight personalization and underweight population level studies and that where the majority blueprint has been is mastering the basics of sleep diet exercise and nutrition the thing that I find most compelling is I results work in me I have 3 years of data and I continually get better what compelling is there are tens of thousands of people who are doing the blueprint protocol and the effects are very similar I can circumstance where someone did blueprint and they didn meaningful way it just works and as far as I can tell for everyone now sometimes people are already in a pretty good spot so the improvements are minor sometimes people are coming from a really bad spot and the improvements are major there not this open question in my mind whether it for almost everybody so you several options one is do the blueprint stack like I do number two is don from blueprint and go look at the protocol and buy everything on your own don actually more expensive this is lower cost than what you can buy on your own three you can disbelieve me go do your own thing if you do that share your buyo markers and show us all of us that your protocol is better don your bio markers and then we going to listen to you four is leave a hateful comment I do love them just make sure it friends I love this journey we are at this special moment in time where we are evolving into a different thing what we don the basics going to bed on time exercising eating well having proper Oral Care the basics of Life the Fountain of Youth is not going to be found as some exotic thing anytime soon it basic things we do on a daily basis this is one part not all parts but get this one nail it down as a habit and then incorporate the other things too again sleep diet exercise and stop the bad habits the funny thing about being human is we are more like each other than I think we dare admit so by being good you help not just yourself but everyone around you let	Success

I put on 30 pounds in one summer	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04Iv5sVsdpg	Bryan Johnson	when I was 12 years old I had been really skinny and then in the summer from being 12 to 13 I remember I ate so many peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and I just thought I just can enough of these guys yes yes I ad I think I added maybe 20 to 30 lbs in one summer and this was before I went to sixth grade and so I became quite large and I didn people at school would start to call me fat and I started becoming self-conscious of my weight and I remember telling my mom this and she said Brian you husky so that was like the frame of my mind is like I high school back to when I got larger because I was bigger or as my mom would say husky I started lifting weights and few months I became the strongest kid in the school I could bench press more than anyone	Success
We can do this thing together	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxmlPKO6Zk0	Bryan Johnson	if you say to somebody Live Well everyone if you say don reject that you have to revisit everything you understand about reality and that this moment I think that we are going to need to revisit everything we understand about reality because we to Super intelligence and I play a helpful role in society that can prepare all of us to get to walk into this new era with some degree of confidence that we can do this thing together	Success
I've never wanted life as badly as I do now	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szVt1mUz1xg	Bryan Johnson	when I say that I in my entire life I sincerely mean it I dishonest like I have been in some really bad spots in my life and I don think life has ever been better that is not to say that I don day-to-day basis with a variety of things like all of us do it is to say that I I do now as a kid you just don appreciate the situation you you become an adult it realizing how hard it is to navigate life on a regular basis and over time you kind of get beat down and so typically someone like myself who 46 I would probably be pretty beat down I might be jaded a little bit on this and that but I feel like it gone the other direction where I have this briy appreciation for existence like I	Success
The World Is Making Us Sick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HTn0T21k0U	Bryan Johnson	if you lived in the year 1870 and the future could whisper into your ear it might say something like this there are these things called germs they can and can lead to death now if you most people in the 1870s you going to believe that craziness you telling me that things beyond the resolution of my eyes are the cause of disease infection and potentially death that is how the future always works it presents ideas that we find to be bizarre and unintelligible that the case throughout history is the earth the center of the universe or does the Earth orbit around the Sun so if we imagine the 25th Century Whispering into our ears what might they say and when they say it how might we control our knee-jerk reactions so that we don think the 25th Century might say is that for the first time in human history death May no longer be inevitable now that does not mean immortality it means that we have a horizon of extending our health spans and lifespans to degrees that are previously unimaginable to us in this moment we know that things are changing very fast technology is progressing at speeds that makes it hard for our minds to comprehend we don want to miss out in not knowing the big thing that that observation that the singular Insight that will dominate our time and place as the future looks back at us they will say that is the moment when humans acquired the technological ability to dramatically extend their lifespans so don things in life and it expansive philosophical contemplations we can have as intelligent beings practically speaking we can say smoking two cigarettes shortens your life by 30 minutes so we can assign cigarettes a die score let same principle to something else let take a look at a typical American School lunch a piece of pizza some chocolate milk and some canned vegetables what would we assign for a die score should we say just 7 minutes for sake of contemplation so we die and the reason why this example is useful because when adults speak to themselves about these ideas of die adults have a infinitely long list of reasons why they should justify their vices it long YOLO live fast Die Young death is a positive thing but when you frame it as us feeding die to kids it shows how pernicious this thing is don attention to the embedding in our society that we have built a society around die think of it fast food algorithms that make us do bad stuff we are surrounded by things that accelerate aging and increase the probability of death and then we justify these things as living our best life and when someone like myself defies those Norms I get heaped upon with hate don effort that all of us can rally behind and say this is the most consequential observation of this moment and we can begin working on don that about 3 years ago I posed the question what is our proximity to being able to slow down and even neutralized the aging process 3 years in we now have the answer it way I did that I measured every organ of my body getting a biological age of each organ and then we use the best science to try to slow down my speed of aging and reverse that aging damage you can take this same process and apply it to almost anything it whether it school lunch they looking at Baseline measurements you look at what the healthy uh parameters would be you look at the science and you implement a protocol if you overwhelmed with these ideas or if you and you want to tell me why I and why you understand I conversation at my house in dinners for 3 years now I know with 99% predictability what people say when they say it and how they say it to understand this you have to dig pretty deep into the assumptions if death has always been inevitable we build our existence around justifying our behaviors around that inevitability if death is no longer inevitable you are invited to reconstruct your entire reality and this is why I don Well or some other positive statement that a lot of people encourage me to say because if you say those positive things literally everybody is going to say yep I circumstances in life if you say don die it forces the person to reconcile with everything they understand in existence so if you want to die you need to justify why die is a virtue for you and for everyone else say you don to die you need to confront that death has always been inevitable how are we possibly going to overcome this unimaginable challenge don Concept I said the words from for the first time in late 2023 since I and now there are hundreds of gatherings in over 58 countries people organically getting together around this concept of don would catch fire this fast and be this strong I think it strongest movement of this early 21st century that this is something that we can all rally upon if you think about it don game by every human on this planet every second of every day don more than capitalism it than any religion it is the most played game in existence you right now I the single thing that every human on this planet can agree upon so when we talk about goal alignment or trying to get our priorities synced as a species this is the one thing that we can agree upon and it not even don don look both ways before they cross the street while be smoking a cigarette but I would encourage you join this movement be part of the cause be don your life go to bed on time eat well exercise try to overcome your vices and bad habits be the embodiment of this thing teach your children or other children and your parents and your siblings try to shift their mindset from Death being inevitable and therefore justifying debauchery and vices to call them back to say no we actually can live a better life I that is very similar to a nation state it has different characteristics where it but Bound by Network characteristics that you together with a common objective and so in this case we would band together and we would work on individual don initiatives so some may do this with personal health some may do it on planetary Health some may apply to school lunch others to politics relationships auto emissions like you take any domain in society you can apply the same Concepts I people together and we will work on these ideas together so take your given idea and then walk through the process how do you define death how do you measure it how do you actually minimize it and or eliminate it and repeat that process continually I Don together as a community it will be social first and we will encourage each other there we are like our closest friends and those we exposed to instead of algorithms that entertain us until we uh become stupified this will be friends in a community encouraging everyone to be more healthy we be gamified it will be a lot of fun to try to systematically lower die scores and increase life scores so there three things for you first is become familiar with the sources of D around you number two is join the app when it live to be part of the community to both benefit and contribute to everybody well-being and third if you interested in pursuing a don Endeavor and being part of our initial group I description below include your name and your project and other details so that we can try to expand our working groups to help everybody work on their don die initiatives just like democracy don thousands of follow- on questions that will pertain to ethics and morals and wh ifs and all kinds of problems and most likely problems that we haven anticipated which will probably be the most dominant ones the ones we imagine probably won that this solves all things it to say that if the future could whisper into our ears and if we wanted to hear it and be part of the future that this would be the starting point [Music]	Success

it was 5:00 p.m. but we were in for a long night when your baby steps away from Super intelligence what do you do if you piece these things together and you say okay we humans own knowledge we are first principes thinking we have dominated this planet we are the ultimate Alpha on this planet besides mosquitoes now there intelligence that kind of time scale that at us on all these different domains and it kind of seems inevitable it to be better at us at most if not all things almost pretty soon and when that happens it knowledge and it knows more than we do so we are now removed from

My Anti-Aging Travel Essentials	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Al-CG7ULYtk	Bryan Johnson	it millions of dollars a year to slow my speed of Aging keeping up my protocols when I things I do so today I you all the stuff I pack in my suitcase to not die I going to pack So today we it together let Oral Care the first thing is I have an electric toothbrush when I grew up I had a manual toothbrush and then when I was 20 something I used electric for the first time it was amazing I why this was not part of my childhood but electric toothbrushes are great so we electric toothbrushes one I keep for trips and one I use at home because I don time pack it and unpack it I just have things that I take when I travel so it very easy then floss we use this particular floss because there was a study that showed 25% greater plaque control with this floss I was using Oral B which has a finer thread so we switched to this floss and then we have this toothpaste everything is fluoride free I have two other versions but these were travel size so I then blcks I recently learned that keeping the lips moisturized is a good idea not a practice of my childhood so basically I you as I pack because these are things I wish I would have learned earlier in life and so now I hope you can too all right then the tongue scraper this was also another thing this didn until I was in my my 30s why in cleaning the tongue is one of the best things you can do for oral uh cleanliness and also uh bad breath because the tongue holds is that true um actually I just said something I don perception is it tongue leavs a bad breath a clean tongue is a clean mouth so I with it so tongue cleaning morning and night all right that is Oral Care uh the bag is already kind of full so I taking you can see in here I let extra virgin olive oil the snake oil and I party on this coming Saturday and we going to share with everyone a whole bunch of blueprint food so I the bottles of olive oil the other stuff is being shipped next is hair care now I normally would not bring this light cap if it were for a day or two uh it much to bring especially for a carry-on but given that I don day 6 minutes a day in the morning so I a new formulation this is a company roots and I did a genetic test to see which things I would be responsive for CU you are responsive to certain things on the scalp for prevention of hair loss and hair growth so this is a custom formulation for me which has minoxidil and a bunch of other stuff toide melatonin so I will wake up I will apply this and one more more which is not here and then I will wear my cap for 6 minutes uh every day so because we going on a trip we gr7 this is on my website that I use for oh you can see it settled in the bottom which has really helped on gray hair uh this is my shampoo I it shampoo makes a huge difference in our hair protocol it men big difference but we still use it anyways we shampoos over the years so this is now I suspect will probably change and oh here we go okay I take back my statement so in the morning I will apply this custom hair growth RX with this car factor and then I will do the red light therapy a comb which you know $8 on Amazon some gel if I typically don anything on my hair so this is just in case it gets wild and then I use this guy which is great uh I of these but you put it on the head and just like massage your scalp and so when you apply these things to your head you can uh rub your scalp for a minute or two it increases blood flow which also is helpful for hair so I have this routine morning and night and it pretty easy once you get the hang of it and then I tote here in a minute so I guys up in a second let me jump to face deodorant is in face which is not does not should not be in face all right so more face routine is I use this cleanser actually I use one with h what one for acne control um I dose low dose um Accutane for the past 4 months it laser treatments will cause these breakouts and so it blemishes are awful and so I doing lowd dose Accutane two pills a week they started I been wonderful so uh but yeah this is my face wash I exosomes uh exosomes are something that people are familiar with when that have been coupled when you go to the dermatologist and get a facial treatment they will sometimes pair it with exosomes this company has built one for daily application I and uh I just reached week 12 from applying morning and night and I was going to measure this week on my week 12 anniversary to see if it had reduced my UV damage and improved scores like Reds and Browns we have this multi-spectral imaging technology where it measures 10 biomarkers across the face and so TBD I we efficacious or not but um we about this and then I mentioned this before this adap pooo this helps in feeding the fat cells on the face so it and then I dab the matap Poo around the face this is again uh night time and in the morning when I wake up it leaves the face greasy and if you see some videos from me before I was applying this daily it would leave my face very greasy no one told me I probably should have noticed it myself but now I apply it in the morning and then I work out and then I shower so it still works because you apply this you leave it on for seven minutes and is done so you do not need to wear it all day then we recently tring this one skin peptide uh there interesting so we are a few weeks in triing this they have that face and then also for under eye then some sunscreen Ela MD and some shaving cream and that is it for facial care so now we can pack these guys up I have been trying to get better at not using plastic you know plastic is so convenient it amazing technology such a great material but I really tried to find other ways to transport my items all right next we do sleep so I take a pillowcase with me when I travel I like this this is copper infused and it feels really lovely on the skin uh sometimes I I don Linens at the hotels I stay at so having this it this I when I get there and then a mask when I first had the scare with my internal jugular veins where we found that I wasn outside because I have these genetically narrow veins I was so scared about the situation that I would take my pillow with me because we measured my blood flow from my brain to my body uh when I was laying down on my side on my stomach on my back my left side right side and we found that it was significant differences and there was a significant difference in terms of how I positioned my my pillow and so I was so concerned about my intracranial pressure that I would take my pillow with me when I traveled because I knew that I could achieve these flow rates and so uh I now have situated this where I I with the hotel pillows and achieve the same effect sometimes it other times but I do ahead of time check for the pillows at the hotel because again I from my brain to my body it honestly I wish everybody knew like I I feel fortunate that I know these things if I hadn way I would have ever been able to pinpoint why I was getting these piercing headaches headaches why I was having these other symptoms and it was causing major damage to my brain and so there for all of us and we don detected and so it sad State of Affairs in the future we just going to have measurement tools they easier uh they lives so yeah I hope we can get there and we can all enjoy the benefits of robust measurement all the time for electronics uh because it taking two converters this is what I place next to the bed it different Outlets so I can charge my phone uh my wearable device and then I have two different phones so phone one phone two and then another device and then this is actually really interesting this is a a neuros Sim device it of expensive it the Vegas nerve but it the technical name of it but this was cool because we found early on of course stimulating the Vegas nerve uh it your left side you you hit it here in your tragus it also goes out your neck and into your chest that when I started feeling sick ever I would immediately put this on for 60 minutes and it would like almost wipe out my sickness so we found was very powerful and then when I got covid in November of 2022 I used it then too uh to reduce my symptoms so I never travel without this guy uh I think it is incredibly effective at avoiding sickness Andor lessening sickness and I friends so I think it all right let important that everything is organized and properly situated then also I have a a travel packing list that I print out and uh you know it blueprint on the road like okay like let extra taking me on the road is extra extra and so you can see this is like this is a pretty big ordeal and so when I get on the road and I find that I miss something it I want everything there because we built a protocol to be precise and when I so I don maybe 75 things or so uh when my kids pack it their toothbrush and they and look at the I so the pack list let so I have a few things here this is blueprint nutty pudding this has made things so much easier before I would take all the raws which is doable just like one powder it collagen peptides this is 25 g a day this is the longevity mix so I used to take over 100 pills a day and then we collapsed these into powders and pills and we got control of our own supply chain so now I take just over like 40 I think and having longevity mix I think this one has 26 pills equivalent in one scoop of powder that tastes very good and then I also put it in here these are what I normally have my Mills in so this is the first time I container and I hope that it holds up I mean the seill is pretty good so I think it should hold up let guys situated you know I should probably I should probably tape these I just put that in there did you see that that this thing snapped up and that would be a disaster so let real quick thank you this is probably a much better situation yeah okay cuz this is the first time with these guys that think that increases the likelihood how much room do you think I need is that enough is that going to be secure enough probably and then I need to bring the tape with me so that when I come back well actually I won and then this guy cuz this could be when that came up I just had these visions of opening my suitcase and everything covered in powder super veggie longevity mix all right that looks pretty secure what do you think should we do a drop test yeah all right I think we on that one then this is a screw top so it fine cuz often times you know the first lesson doing these once that pain happens oh then I take these for electrolytes yeah I drink mineralized water so I never drink water by itself so I week I started something new where I doing uh Ginger so I cut it up and then I add mint and then I just put boiling water and so I make a ginger tea so I can avoid tea bags and it was really good so successful week on doing the ginger tea now the pills this is morning when I wake up and this is lunch 11:00 a.m. and then these so oh damn I and I do uh okay these are nighttime pills so before bed I not correct okay so I take my thyroid meds I got diagnosed with hypothyroidism when I was 21 years old so I take levothyroxine 112 mg and I take Armor Thyroid 30 mg I take a Statin and melatonin oh what aspirin so my assistant packed uh for me and often times this happens where there time that is hard to keep track so yeah I need to double check these things but the error is I need to include the turmeric and the aspirin 81 mg to this and then I also started a new supplement today that just arrived in the Mel and this is uh Lumber kyes and we this because when I got covid in November it increased my lung age by 19 years so using uh spirometry my biological age of my lungs were 26 in 20 01 and then in Co happened in November of 2022 my lung age went to 46 and so we long age back down and just recently this uh this week I tested at 36 I believe so I gained some ground back but I we were trying to find ways to potentially increase my lung capacity and address the underlying issues and lumber kyes is one of the things we triing to see if I can do it so this is uh one one pill twice a day morning and night so I will start that tonight so I need to add this to these guys and then the final thing is oh then we have the scoopers for the proteins and the Mills and then I with ketones so not to get into ketosis necessarily but we did this at kernel where we were measuring kernel is my brain interface company oh is this okay okay kernel is my brain interface company and we were looking at the effects of ketones on the brain and specifically as it changes with your default mode so basically there literature that shows that the brain is younger can be in a younger state with ketones I do not follow a keto diet and I don ketones so I ketones uh I subjectively feel like I sleep better but when I look at my stats I don see the we the packing we things like two or three things at any given time and I know which one is which because of the pill color so I don have these labeled as morning or night if my bag gets pulled and they start going through it they answers what is happening here sir This is highly unusual this is don bag that my clothing and I better lately my when the morning happens and I and it something that is relevant to the future of the human race and and it me to redirect my attention to clothing but I love to wear pretty clothes it my favorite I just have this constant conflict of allocating the time to decide to do it and then it it just takes time to like manage clothing you have to make sure it and taken care of properly so it of a thing I just got a bunch of new things I you think you thought I was crazy and eccentric before did that increase or decrease with this process hopefully helpful for you when you about your practicing maybe there few things I and um maybe there you can make in the comments of what I can do to improve my process all right wish me luck and I hope that security doesn [Music]	Success

Same brand as the one currently in last place. Yeah, I anymore. Flavinol 141 mg. Uh-oh. heavy metals 10.6 micrograms for a score of 13. Yikes. What we things. One, marketing and packaging mean nothing. It does not matter what they say. It doesn words they use, what how pretty their pictures are. It does not matter. Second is not knowing is very dangerous. We now looked at 10 popular supermarket brands and scored them on good stuff and bad stuff. I have one more for you. Blueprint Coco. Because I learned how dirty the food supply was, I started sourcing my own food, including cocoa because of its benefits. Now, to give you context, this is not an applesto apples comparison because this is a powder. These are bars. However, if we look at the score, this has 537 milligrams of flavinols and 2.9 of heavy metals. If we were to give it a number, it position. This is why it to know what you quantified data on the cleanliness and the positive benefits. As always, I don you the resources to go out and buy your own. I want you to be healthy and happy. If Blueprint can be part of that, great. If not, do your thing. Now, a last note on the companies that we tested. This is not a takedown. This is not to shame them. This is just simply to say transparency and our food supply chain is a good thing for everybody. Nobody wins when our food supply is dirty. Nobody wins when we time we change the world from a die economy to a don	Success

How To Make My Blueprint Stack	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rioVRj7uSRk	Bryan Johnson	hi friends I prepare the blueprint stack 74 powerful Health interventions built on over 1,000 clinical trials the first thing I do is get my pills ready three of the essential capsules three of NAC Ginger and kumin one red yeast rice and odor free garlic and one Soft gel there you eight pills we tried very hard to have the most health interventions in the fewest number of pills possible I will then get my longevity mix ready that scoop one full scoop and you can choose how much water you level of taste I 8 oz I like mine a bit more concentrated and I like this little device for stirring it ready to consume note if you wait too long it will settle at the base then I will prepare nutty pudding this is Two Scoops that was like a scoop plus a little one scoop of the nut and Berry mix there it is in dry form I add about 6 to 8 oz of nut milk you can do less or more according to your preference and stir this up I want to eat this for sure I am wondering whether I should have my own cooking show and there you can also use the nut and Berry mix as a Topper instead of stirred in like I have it next is extra virgin olive oil it MLS let and there you have it so what I like to do personally is in the morning when I wake up I mix I eat nutty pudding and I a tablespoon and a half of extra virgin olive oil I consume it all in one sitting but I only do that because my body is acclimated to it I don any side effects my stomach is just fine my sleep is great for for those of you starting I start slowly and you can do this by introducing one item per day you may choose to start with longevity mix and then you may do nutty pudding you may start with one pill at a time for example a soft gel but one thing per day allows your body to adjust slowly next for longevity mix if you heartburn you can add more liquid maybe 20 oz otherwise you can have a more concentrated taste which I have here you can also add more liquid to nutty pudding you can see the texture here but if you feel free to do so many people add additional things chia seeds honey berries so make this your own and something you enjoy next with extra virgin olive oil you can consume the tablespoon and a half in one setting or you can do half a tablespoon three times a day your preference I would also recommend that you consume both the pills and the extra virgin olive oil with food that will prevent possible side effects and stomach upset and finally I would encourage you to consume the blueprint stack earlier in the day as there are many energy promoting ingredients and that will allow you to then be ready for sleep later on I think the blueprint stack is the most nutritious food program in history your body is going to love it buddy buddy it oh but that works too pretty good f	Success

my body and each joint stem cells are the body those healthy young Swedish cells should multiply in my body future proofing all of my major joints and taking me one step closer to age 18 [Music] we are in the Bahamas we landed safely we were pretty concerned we were going to die we were in a Boeing so when when they when they came on with the instructions I was like I listen this time when they talked about how to fasten the seat belt I was like check good instructions evacuation I was checking the manual so now we see my dad he didn sure what kind of airplane he flew today we five of us so somebody needs to take the couch maybe we will just look at people has the worst sleep score gets the couch like they they that big of a deal and we anyone know what is going on right now are you guys in a golf cart we your golf cart hey you guys walk all the way from LA or what come this way what just you hey buddy good to see you how are you good to see you I heard all your snide comments in the background imping Brendon and mind and car Integrity okay come on let upstairs well [Music] see it now this is our place oh there not enough room for you guys full view of the courtyard this way Yachts the whole N9 yard yeah Rich give us the tour man is this nice full kitchen I for 3 Days wow gorgeous look at the Aesthetics of this place yeah man I this before is it amazing yeah yeah is that amazing real estate rich is my favorite but this is amazing this is insane I didn I had no idea it was here yeah our driver coming in say yeah you know I had tiger last week just in the week before I told him well now you can say you had r [Music] all right Rich where are we hey we nassa in the Bahamas how are you feeling about it are you I am uh you know I really assured uh I you know I have all the confidence in the science and in what Brian apprehension you know if there if I don itself like I that kind of thing so it of respon responsibility seriously here is Brian is taking extraordinary efforts to help me how was your General Health prior to Brian swooping in with all these interventions uh it was terrible not anything that know we had a lot of that but the most terrible thing is my mind and that thing that I just can without the ability to do what I do I in the legal biz uh I was writing a complex paper wrote about a half a page and then looked at it as I usually do and it was gibberish I manufactured a half a page of type gibberish and uh and frankly I think uh my Panic alarm to Brian that look what have you got uh he still remember that he sent me three four five supplements uh specifically for the brain he was on me almost every day are you doing this are you this and uh and I quickly I saw a reversal and these interventions have each one of them have helped me okay let off to the clinic to get the the stem cells Dad into the vein my into the joints let this way go the wrong [Music] direction have we thought through the situation that we have a four person golf cart and there baby oh you little Prius hey Scott Size Doesn Matter just quit it I love it oh you oh we could fit we can all CR on here yeah we can do it if I could be here God don right let me try it okay you try it oh yeah that suggestion does anyone know where we going yes I so I have I have the map and left side of the road I just have Noir orientation turn left turn left and I on the left side of the road yep left side of the road yeah we [Music] situation definitely a status associated with your golf cart is this uh is this the right feels like I loop guys this is awesome okay is this driving past the new construction I don the right path yeah this is a dead end yeah all right the the problem is if we be so because once the stem cells leave the lab they then they start to deteriorate very quickly and we lost and so this entire Endeavor may be a failure if we can few minutes and figure out where we at no one has any idea where they going this is like last night we got dropped off we didn so it chances we light we arrive in the clinic without three or four more errors is unlikely there see if it says Wellness Center on there this might be it where is the wellness center Wellness Center wellness center oh it Christina safely [Music] arve hey good morning how you doing good to see you how you doing good how you doing how is your trip you had a 40 lb ultrasound machine you it name is Dr Steve Samson I Angeles California I physician in physical medicine and rehabilitation my specialty is in non-surgical Orthopedics and Sports [Music] Medicine but part of this trial includes all this necessary documentation you understand this is a patient sponsored ongoing open label single arm safety and efficacy Phase 1 and 2A study for the purposes procedures and risk of the research described in you understand you permission to your doctors including and other health lab thanks doctor you bet on to the next steps my objectives are a little bit different I think a lot of people I understand a lot of people probably see you when they dilapidated situation and they can function in a normal fashion and so with this project we rejuvenate my entire body back to age 18 which is by current medical f is not uh it wouldn objective so it trying to Pioneer and so I think more specifically the things we can address today that are more practical is I do have some discomfort in my right shoulder I grew up playing a lot of sports baseball I use my arm a lot and I think over time it out and so lately I weakness in my shoulder where if I do a bench press or a push-up or even some movements I shoulder otherwise my joints are uh I don at the Imaging there is Meaningful deterioration in my joints like there various things that I have that are problematic so it feel anything I can there happened and so I both the discomfort in the shoulder and also rejuvenate what has been lost with wear and tear of my joints okay I think what MRI on anybody who we active lifestyle and wear and tear and the question is do those correlate with day-to-day discomfort and in medicine standard in the United States it we treat as injuries come right so hey my shoulder hurts so we treat it and perhaps a new way of approaching this in the future is more from a disease prevention point of view and to be honest we don these cells are going to affect any potential Imaging the cells have traveled 5,000 mi from from Sweden to the Bahamas kept in cryo tanks filled with liquid nitrogen now they thawed and are just 30 minutes away from the clinic once they arrive we limited window of opportunity to inject them into my body before they expire okay the cells just got here we have 2 hours before they expire let [Music] the cells have just arrived the sooner we can get them into my body the better all right Brian so right now we prepping the area to keep it clean and sterile I the goal is to this be as comfortable as possible [Music] so first what I your knee a little bit and then I going to give you a little local anesthetic I his left knee there could be a little Trace amount of fluid so do you see on the machine there Brian that black track so ultrasound is great at showing soft tissue and fluid and that tunnel pathway that kneecap into the Patel aeral joint and that plane I through that little path and you able to see if you want Dr Patel if you want can you grab that you tapping here 3 2 one it I theory is out with the bad in with the good and watch that little area and see if it drains see it kind of shrinks see the fluid kind of coming up on the screen doing great it huh so the body creates its own lubricant called sovial fluid and if you look at it in a microscope in a patient with discomfort or arthritis it has a pro-inflammatory imbalance like that yinyang symbol where there breakdown and not enough repair just give me feedback it I injection so I just looked it up [Music] wow that this is really cool like it viscous in nature do you see that oh man that it in a microscope there imbalance of inflammatory proteins in there and so what we do is reprogram so we do things in the US like PRP bone we the body to an anti-inflammatory state okay thank you and we stem cells that um have been called medicinal signaling cells they like mobile paramedics and so if you think of our body is made of 37 trillion cells approximately just coursing through our body and when we have an injury like if I were to get off this chair and bang my knee that would trigger an injury response where these mobile cells um they and they release and they travel to the area of injury and so we mimic that response and what we found is that in the published literature these msc tamper or lower inflammation this is an intricate procedure the doctor has only got 4 Millers of the solution which is Tiny and he has to balance getting that liquid exactly where it needs to go with working quickly so the stem cells don expire before entering my body so watch see the flow of the cells Brian it confirms an accurate placement and also I have no resistance I hitting anything which makes it less painful for you oh wow okay little pinch three two one so that knee you did great that was that was so much easier than I thought I was expecting a lot more pain it bad date you keep the expectations managed that was I think simpler than any procedure I easier than a blood draw well we still got another knee to do yeah as the doctor injects my second knee I which will be more [Music] painful yeah okay so both knees are done and now we just do the right hip okay you need a break for a couple minutes I want to go try dunk dunking not advised yeah correct so we can check you have your knee has what called a Bersa called the super patella Bersa which means above kneecap Bersa and usually we already yeah you can see the msc that the cells just a way to confirm the injection is accurately placed [Music] [Music] if you get freaked out by needles this would be the point to turn away from the television set let it I warned you usually in my practice I will conceal this so the patient I talking and they won will feel a little pressure cuz again I don you just sharpen you up just try to relax yeah just do your best I know there still hips more sensitive you for the [Music] cells that spot okay doing great that one a little more pressure than the knee or it was yeah it depth that we go I felt the depth but you need it to get into that structure one more injection and we have 28 minutes left before the cells expire [Music] not too bad not too bad okay doing okay yeah okay thanks you feeling any significant discomfort right now you feeling any major pain or no okay job thank you well well done team I know that there was a lot of effort that went into this yeah a ton so very smooth thank you everyone so Briant next we do an ultrasound of both of your shoulders gives us a little more real time look at your tendons so that tomorrow we can be dialed in and have a game plan ready to go because it will be a little tighter on the clock because each shoulder will be injecting probably three spots and so

tomorrow so success on day one when you you know you body can react and potentially have some inflammation which may not be uncommon postprocedure so you want to take it easy for 2 to three days you can be weight as tolerated but I don exercising for a few days now it was time to check on my dad who was getting just one stem cell injection straight into his bloodstream you look absolutely magnificent I mean I hamstrings oh thanks oh you notice I work on them so hard I know this is really really important yeah I doing this Dad so my my Dad 100 million uh bone derived mess and commel stem cells injected in the vein so this is called a systematic treatment where when you put it in the vein it can go throughout the entire body and what we injecting the cells directly into the joint so it say that they can but the majority of the cells do stick in local yeah what AKA what the things that are near and dear to me that I monitoring every day and that one cognition well here it is the end of a huge journey I almost think I don to sleep anymore do I no no need to eat thank you good job dad try up new joints buckle up [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Welcome to My Crib

[Music] I think you want to get the white ball in the pocket which I did so I got a point so these are ears uh I have them from my friends and my family they not going to be for me I to die we and Stir It Up all right now this room this is primarily where I watch videos on myself I watch my own YouTube videos and put up images on my SC on the screen here and just I invite friends over so everybody can view it at the same time I just thought it was a really nice Vibe I usually take this seat here I put everyone else in the then we just watch my videos over and over again everyone loves it this is what we call the Kingdom Come On In all here this is where all the magic happens I have seen my videos I have talked about my techniques I have told them exactly what to do how to do it how to do it with others but here is my 100% sleep score 8 months in a row right there you see it in the evening I made my first mistake I went out to give a talk and socialize and by the end of the day I was feeling pretty rough hey what the day so we did both my knees and the right hip and no one joints in 24 hours we split it up three and three and turns out it entire body it just feels like it stiffened up and it can when I get up and walk it feels like I aches so I think I I to bed was it the right decision to do six joints in 24 hours we out and this hip this hip especially they went in right here and they went in right here so this whole thing is just pretty Frozen up but you know I was in a car crash once and I remember what it feels like your whole body just aches like everything just hurts hurts so all right bedtime all right night night night night we messing comel stem cells injected yesterday was both knees and the right hip today is the left hip and both shoulders I quite the adventure I didn therapy was that big of a deal then last night I was tossing and turning all night long it was I think one of the worst night sleeps of had in a long time my resting heart rate which is normally around 49 was 64 it was my first time in the red zone of my recovery so I feel great uh my body is hobbling a little bit I stacking three more on the previous three I don going to be a tough one so this is Project keep dad alive how we doing Dad hey it it levels one is I get time with him two is he get to share that he it yeah so kids at home take care of your parents yes they they took care of you when you were a baby so when returning to a similar State dad you wear a diaper yet I [Music] saying where are we going to slow I really worried actually yeah the the cart might die any minute this is look this is full speed I don going like 4 M hour we clinic the golf cart is going to die any second look at this that speed yeah this is full speed we barely crawling the stem cells are going to expire in 2 hours time the walk to the clinic is probably 20 minutes from here everyone don Shing oh no no yeah we this it [Music] second yeah my knees don not I lost bending capacity in my knees is that a good thing or a bad thing maybe you can jump really high now oh that morning how was your sleep then uh you were off yeah not great I got one of my worst scores in like six months wow yeah and how do you feel today h i feel fine I can probably expected yeah but I feel great we can check your knees too today just to see if there procedure just to be curious just to check yeah how about your hip uh that feeling a lot better yeah I I was trying to just bend my knee my further than that yeah what I tell my patients is you know you yourself but your body responds as if it healing process and typically with these cell treatments they and they take time I tell my patients it took years to develop these issues it takes weeks to months to improve them so it filling all this I thought this is good we something believe that this could be like a really good like maintenance type thing that you do once a year or something long term to prevent progression over time do we just accept that arthritis is inevitable or can we intervene early and eventually cut it off yeah so it way of thinking that currently in the Penalty Box I doctor I just made myself some peppermint and that my dad let doing hey hey talage this is an aend call yeah I therapy I to you then I I there hiding there in the bushes and look at this this is the garden what the world look like from your Vantage Point so unpredictable yeah I I can anything about where I next couple years where A at in the next couple years which is both scary and exciting a town which has um kickboxing lessons right now he just did his first kicks yesterday and it makes sense he whole life so his legs are unusually strong and he found that he has a superow and his ability to kick and so he yesterday last night he said dad I kind of want to figure out a way to fight you I hip and two shoulders to do the cells we have are only good for two hours we need to get the entire thing done in two hours or the cells are expired so we under a very tight time frame we have to jump so I know you do too so great seeing you thanks for saying hi to everybody have a good day Tage I my favorite thing in the whole world everything about it my best life my best time I love the team I love the project it [Music] best 3 2 1 okay yes okay now we proceed with the shoulder perfect not too bad not too bad do you want to see the big needle show them the big needle we use local numbing first so the patients typically won feel this but that it you feel it most of my patients prefer not to look at their procedure Brian again is atypical and wants to see everything we have one final injection left this is the most complicated one it shoulder yeah 30 minutes before the cells expire Save The Best For Last that need you so I guidance as you can see it be precise and the procedure is complete you okay you did am amaz you see how we saved that last when I started doing this we didn uncomfort are unpleasant we early and the patient would say like how many more of these do we need to do yeah so of all the areas your right shoulder will be more sore than the other because a you had more symptoms and B that area it uncomfortable so it days up to a week just listen to your body yeah it feels like it feels like I broke my shoulder oh my God what we can you actually rejuvenate the joints to a more youthful state in these kind of proactive measures and it because it scales it will become lower cost and so if this can work and we can demonstrate that it is efficacious then more people do it the cost go down whether it joints or whether we speed of Aging or blood biomarkers anything we can show that slows our aging damage and reverses it I think would be positive so okay we mission was don yeah that finished up this groundbreaking treatment six joints 300 million stem cells in my joints nothing had ever been done like this before I I apparently I wasn in doing this is to make it is to do the experiment for you if it works to then scale it and make it low cost and accessible for you I with my dad this is also project don die dad and we his third therapy first we did plasma second we did the gene therapy and this is the third the mes com stem cells he got 100 million yesterday so dad is getting access to the best Therapies in the world so kids again a reminder to take care of your parents they took care of you when you were you know not able to take care of yourself so it thing to do to be mindful of others and their needs so hopefully you continue to follow along and let

Before and After My $2m Anti-Aging Routine	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSkfk_Snygo	Bryan Johnson	hi friends recently I shared a few pictures of my face and a war on the internet broke out I was trying to share how much I years before starting blueprint and now and people were commenting whether I looked worse or better there was a lot of comments and so today I thought what I pictures of my face because all of our faces tell stories maybe more so than we realize and I wanted to show that I have lived many lives and those lives have been captured in my face let right with this first picture I was born into a rural Utah area my grandpa had a farm the community was deeply religious so everyone believed the same thing so little Brian here he doesn going on but he is about to enter a situation where he reality in existence is true so you better get ready for it and that everyone else is wrong so here you go Brian when was 12 years old I had been really skinny and then in the summer from being 12 to 13 I remember I ate so many peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and I just thought I just can enough of these guys and sure enough they showed up I I think I added maybe 20 to 30 lbs or maybe 20 lbs in one summer and this was before I went to sixth grade and so I became quite large and I didn people at school would start to call me fat fat and I started becoming self-conscious of my weight and I remember telling my mom this and she said Brian you husky so that was like the frame of my mind is like I think you uh I was trying to compensate for my weight for quite some time I we of I some challenges early in life and I didn was really special because we went to kauwaii and my mother was like we had very little money and uh quite Frugal my father was uh he kind of lived large in some ways and so to fly to kauwaii to be on an airplane and then to go to an island was just unimaginable to me and so being there this is the night before we went out to dinner I clothing that my father bought me this is when I started playing around with several things you can see the lines on the side of my head we started cutting our hair in unique ways in my little town because we were all Mormon there was very little opportunity to be different in any horizontal way like you know you we all believe the same thing we had the same morals we had the same ethics we went to the same church we believe the same things and so to be different was really hard you could you know become a stoner or a jock like small differentiation like that but it was very hard to be different and so you had to do other things to be distinct and unique and this is the first time where I started to play around with this idea and so my friends and I we cut lines in the side of our head as a style I also got braces oh I so I guess I school this is my sophomore year I remained a nice person I guess that maybe subjective but I nice to other people it principle that has been taught to me and I pretty nice person here this is when so back to when I got larger because I was bigger or as my mom would say husky I started lifting weights and few months I became the strongest kid in the school I could bench press more than anyone and there was another kid who actually beat me at the last part of our senior year so he got the crown for end of year but I turned my size into an asset and I became very large and very strong and I focused a lot on Athletics so here this is like the uniform in my little town where hat backwards uh Spartans I sure where I got the hat but it was always a hat always backwards and always a shirt off we and you can see my skin is pretty tan we were always in the Sun and never wearing sunscreen with my size I started mapping out what kinds of things I could do and started playing football and it turned out I was pretty good at football this is my sophomore year of playing football I was middle linebacker occasionally ran as a fullback and I love football it was just like this opportunity to go out and engage in Warfare like physical Warfare by just being tough and rough and that was consistent we were pretty rough and tough growing up and football was the sport in my town like nothing was bigger than football so it was really enjoyable to play something that everyone was so into After High School I decided to serve a mission for the Mormon church this is where you spend 2 years basically pring trying to convince people to join the Mormon church and that what they believe is wrong what you believe is right and so this is me when I receive the mission call so you get a letter in the mail and it know dear um Elder Johnson that name they use and so I I read this letter and I learned that I would be in Ecuador and so we pulled out the globe in the house and we said where on the globe so everybody could see it but all of my closest friends and family showed up for the event it great Community occasion and it was also like the beginning of probably one of the most transformative events of my life this is me uh getting ready to serve a mission so I hadn the mission but I new suit I remember that suit was $99 it was the most we had ever spent on a piece of clothing and my mom was like we this right and I think that tie was something like $1 999 we just didn on anything but my mom wanted the best for me so that was my first suit you can see here I Ecuador I lost around 60 lbs when I was in Ecuador the food made me terribly sick I must have had something in my GI track but it was terrible like the first few months I was constantly throwing up I had diarrhea all the time I couldn food my face broke out into to this rash SL acne jungle is just awful I thought I was going to have scars all over my face and it was really unnerving I couldn get help from anyone and I needed really serious medical help but it just wasn there for me so I had to just fight through it so you can see I ton of weight my brand new suit is taken a punishing uh it was in TS when I when I came home this is a few months in I still wearing that same tie and you can see my face is just annihilated it I I to be scarred the rest of my life and on Ecuador you index is pretty high so I blasted with high UV rays all day every day being out in the sun and then this is going on so yeah so I can sick it really trying to be my best self you can see here I really really try to to be a good missionary and I of the kids that you know the families we used to hang out with this is an example my sister came down to pick me up after Ecuador she also served a mission in in Chile and that skinny I was but looking back to where I started at 60 lb heavier I was so scared of eating the food because it would wreck my face and make me sick that I basically just didn for for the two years coming home it was a great time to rebuild my relationship with my dad I guess we did a video about this that we will be sharing soon and the journey that I relationship with my father but being reunited with him was wonderful I had my first baby when I was 24 years old what an exciting moment that was I mean to have this person in your life that you need you every second of the day for their own Survival and that the kind of person they going to be influenced by how you raised them and I took fatherhood very seriously I was endeavoring to really be the best father and so I be a wonderful dad and I would do anything uh really for my children this picture I think captures my ideas I really cared about being a good father and I think I had some carryover Concepts I chose this photo because my oldest son and I are at McDonald this was a date night once a week I take one child on a date and this is Jefferson night for date night so we would do what they wanted to do we went to McDonald have a looks like a happy Mill or or something like that you want what for your children you don eating fast food also it was his preference to do so because he had grown up in a culture where Edan McDonald was okay Andor the reward for a given thing and so I remember feeling so conflicted of wanting to give my children what they wanted to make them happy then also wanting what was in their best interest and it constant tension because you you can really force them to do things and when they come into a culture where eating healthy is just not the norm my partner didn she would have things at home that I just didn really big divide in our home of like dad is trying his very best to be healthy mom things and so he the middle and so this is me trying to be a great dad in an environment that has inherent conflict on what the children are learning to do this is my third child geneveve this is the day that I gave her a blessing so I was in the Mormon church until about 34 I left the church when I was 34 years old I believe I building brain tree I think for me that the thing this image does more than anything is I come down with a chronic depression I say come down because working very hard as an entrepreneur I just kind of cracked and depression was upon me and so when I look at this I can see Brian eyes and I can see how much pain he like it moment and he just wants to die and so even though he dying this is at the tail end of brain tree so I started brain Tree in in 2007 I sold it in 2013 and O uh that was such a dark moment because I had been building that company and being chronically depressed and having challenges with my partner and been trying to relieve the religion for all that all that time and I was really at this break point where I didn I could carry on another step and you can see here I eyes I tell end of brain tree I started doing several like I was trying to re make my life myself in life like I just had this really challenging 15-year run of Entrepreneurship ship from the age of 21 through selling brain tree and it was a very difficult time in my life and I was trying to remake myself and like get a breath of fresh air I just made money for the first time in my entire life I was broke uh for the first uh 34 years of my life and so I started doing some adventure around the world uh this one I believe I was climbing Mount kilamanjaro and same thing I depression but climbing the mountain and trying to clear my head but this was a candid shot and I think it does capture my essence of like I I feel really heavy with existence I upright but I don how to this was shot in a hotel in New York so I had sold brain tree I was trying to remake myself this was for the Wall Street Journal and they wrote an article about I had established a venture fund with $100 million that I was endeavoring to try to bring the future into the present and so I was focused on deep Tech which is a word that describes like synthetic biology genomics computational Therapeutics and as a novice I was trying to see if I could go fund and do things that were missed by the normal channels of venture capital so this was me of like hey I trying to rebuild myself from the world of finance and payments of brain tree into this new world of science technology Inc magazine took this picture and I did an interview with them and I forget what the topic was like after I had achieved some success with rry for the first time Publications were like Hey we have to say about a given topic and so I was like oh that don interesting to say at all but okay I try and so this is I think me trying to Grapple with this new thing that I was like somehow I had achieved some status in society where people would care to take my picture and would care to listen to what I say and I adjust how I understand reality based upon that not knowing if you know I was like worthy of that situation but I thinking through it so I got married when I was 24 years old and I had a girlfriend in high school I didn have a girlfriend in my early 20s so basically like I married without a whole lot of dating experience and after I got a divorce I was dating for the first time in my life and this is me trying to like clean up to be presentable to a potential mate and I hired a photographer to take these pictures it was the first time I was pretty camera shy I mean like after when I was 12 years old and became big I became self-aware and I was always self-aware because you know I my friends had said I was fat and so I was always on my mind and so I still I being taken I of like do I look okay am I embarrassed of myself um you can also track this back to when I was a missionary where my face was destroyed so I guess I probably have had this insecurity my entire life and here I I possibility that can find somebody that would want to date me uh shortly after that is when I really started to get into health I had destroyed myself I mean really as a kid you know eating junk food and soda and sugar like that just that was the norm that was bad also 21 years old on I was destroying myself with stress and lack of sleep eating junk food too much food being OB Beese and so I really was trying to turn the corner to say can I optimize for my health and I uh a test looking at my heart function and so first efforts this is like beginning blueprint of we the direction of health and wellness and I what to do in this time period I did I approached it I think how many people do which is like what cryo tank so you jump in and you get excessively cold and it help with healing and recovery and inflammation and so I was starting to do this but I was basically riding the cultural Trend not knowing what worked or didn measure biomarkers so this is me of like Yay jumping in doing things for my health but I had no idea what I was doing I guess I about myself with this image I remember thinking that I I have some degree of control over my health so I guess I is my home in Virginia after I sold brain tree we moved to Virginia as a beat and I had this house in the middle of the forest it was spectacular just dead quiet trees all around I loved it it was such a beautiful environment so I had a gym there so I good about myself in that picture so this is when I started building kernel this is our first office that was a contemplation I was making where I sold bran VMO I made a couple hundred million dollars and and the pressing question of my mind was what to do now and I was obsessed with this question and I had decided that a brain interface was potentially the highest value thing because as we evolve with AI we want this Evolution to be fast and Quantified and I thought if we could build a high bandwidth brain interface and connect ourselves with AI we ourselves with much greater accuracy and do so in a methodical way this is my first year into blueprint in that picture with me is my my oldest son Jefferson he and I were working out together and I so happy because I got a divorce their mother stayed in the religion I left the religion and so the kids were in a tough spot do they believe in dad or do they believe in mom and the kids kind of split my middle son town which came with me the two others stayed with their mom and so Jefferson spent the summer with me and here he with me and we worked out every day together and I with my son I feel fantastic about my body and my health and so so throughout my entire life I insecurity and now I on it I feel great I look great I my son I world so like this is starting to become like Peak life experience where I had been born into this very myopic narrow religious mindset and now I of it and I big world of trying to do really fun stuff so I life this is really good and you can see my son Jefferson here on the left I asked him to train me he was really into uh Athletics and health he had been overcoming a personal challenge of his own so he had gotten into it out of necessity and so I asked him to take me on as his project and the thing I love about this Pro this picture is not my body I love my son so proud of me and it felt deeply rewarding that my son would be proud of me because you know the relationship had been i then to have it reciprocated back to me was joyful blueprint got in increasingly rigorous at this point I was doing one mil a day 1,977 calories so you can see that is my entire day the left hand side is 10,000 lucks light which you do I did in the morning and then there the food and then a mat where I would stretch and eat but this is a happy place my face here to me says like I in the zone I and uh yeah one of the happier moments of my life that and I our relationship continued to evolve and develop and I got him on blueprint I think he was in a pretty bad spot and I laid out the entire protocol for him and he turned turned his health around and here I think he had lost something like 40 lbs and so he feeling bullish about life like he he has it back you can see it on his face so good job Dad this is a a photo that was taken by the most talented photographer I had worked with up until that point he worked for all the big magazines I remember just being excited that we were doing this he was shooting for uh a publication that did a piece on me and so he had me do various activities we kind of walked around this is one of the earlier moments in Blueprint publicity where we people show up and I was getting familiar with how do you pose what do you do what do you not do and what incentives do they have who dunk on you who actually can you trust it this is one of the pictures he took we are upstairs in my home you can see how lean I something like just under 10% body fat thereabouts and uh like a year or so into blue print I is the image that was in the Bloomberg article I have the kernel brain interface on my head so we built a wearable fmri so you those big machines that you get in it kind of like a coffin like environment we built that same Tech that you just put on your head like a helmet and so in deciding what to do on this photo shoot this is the same photographer as that previous photo he suggested this be the shoot and it was the first picture of me that went viral this is the summertime Jefferson my oldest son second son is on the right and we hiked this Trail in Los Angeles T Mescal Trail it over 1,000 ft and we would race it together I had been doing that quite some time my best time was just over 33 minutes there was a time when they were young uh I think Jefferson was something like maybe uh 14 so 14 and 12 and I told them one day I said boys just so you know I my entire life even when I I tough stuff I front of your partner I you and they love that so much they talked about it all the time and it became this thing where you when they started putting a muscle or they grow a bit they going to beat you up and so this was kind of the continuation of that same discussion we went hiking and I said okay boys here we go how go today and of course in their minds Jefferson is 18 and talage is 16 they like Dad we okay great and so we started the trail it turns out I smoked both of them they were panting so hard I had to stop and so that was a humbling day for them it was a wonderful day for me and the camaraderie that we have we have such great banter and to this day they still talk about me beating them up so it good one for us to play with this is year two in doing blueprint this is after I did uh what intense pulse light it put on the body you just stamp out these big bursts of light and it leaves these tracks on your skin and I just done the entire body and we were being transparent with blueprint a lot of people will do things for their health and wellness that they won publicly if they for example if they have a surgery you know they surgery recover and then make a public appearance so you don we were doing all these Rejuvenation therapies like light therapy laser therapy and I just made everything public and I didn awful you can see here I got tracks all over me we were very transparent which was different than what anyone had ever done before they had really tried to curate their image very careful placement of how they let it go and so this is an example of like hey we did this therapy today here do full body IPL this image I love I would never would have guessed that my body would have this kind of muscle structure I was doing pull-ups one day in the gym and with talage and he Dad I need to take a picture of your back it he showed me the picture I was like wait a second what I have these back muscles so this was not something I was trying to do I was working out an hour a day and so I much discipline to eat a minimal amount of calories to work out every day to sleep every night like I was really trying to hit perfect health as part of this blueprint protocol and so to achieve that kind of definition was great also getting that lean I lost a lot of fat in my face and it turns out when you lose a lot of fat in your face you look older and so this is in part why when I shared a bunch of images of my face on the internet a war broke out cu people were like hey you had so much more fat on your face before you have much less fat I want more fat you know so like there when you wellness there that trade-off space and so we trying to explore the frontiers of Science and we data but learning a lot as we go that like face fat is important If you eliminate it it back so I photo for the discipline that represents we started to play with Concepts where when I started doing blueprint it was really about this scientific experimentation but it was also this first time where I didn any other authority in my life so growing up the religion is the authority it will tell you what you can say what you can do what you can think and if you violate those rules you and you go through this confession process where you have to you and you have to then repent to God and so you of sin repentance you know and trying to like do restitution then when you building as an entrepreneur you are owned to some extent by your investors and by Market expectations like you don harm of your company well at this point I had made a BN of a bunch of money I was doing a scientific Endeavor and nobody had power over me so I could start playing for the first time in my entire life and this image is one of the first moments so in Mormon theology there Jesus is the good guy and he wants to give all all of God will the devil to take away people there basically I was now like the devil incarnate doing blueprint because I was building this algorithm to take better care of me than I could myself which is basically what Satan was arguing in Mormon Mormon mythology and so I thought the irony was so good that I had become what was told to me to be the most evil thing in existence and so I was taking a picture of being like hey I can play with these ideas and that the future of existence we may want to take the most sacred ideas of existence and start pulling them in and bringing them close and playing with them so this is me for the first time trying to say I I when people hate on me which they will it I to say let Some Fun so Kate did the clothing selection Kate comes from the world of fashion she has great taste and we decided to do this this photo shoot she put together five outfits that were spectacular this was one of them I never in my wildest dreams would have you be able to select this kind of clothing I didn sold anywhere but Kate put these things together I put them on and it was so fun one of the first image that we put out there and a lot of people were like WTF like what is this situation people would look at this and be like this dude is so weird cuz they couldn the entire situation but also in this you can see my hair another restriction I had in my entire life was you must have short hair that was the expectations as a kid then as you grow older as you become an adult your hair becomes shorter just like normal professional guidelines and here I grown my hair out as really part of this thing of like I can do anything and I to do everything I never could as a kid so this captures me as a human expressing myself to say I want to play in every way like clothing appearance thoughts mythology all of it the entire thing is in now Playfield and it was the most liberating experience in my life we would do a lot of things through blueprint like this is one where we documenting my skin we used every measurement we could on my body I became the most measured person in human history so this is just part of the protocol we this is part of our routine measurements this is the probably the most recognized image of my Endeavor my son gave me uh his plasma and I gave my plasma to my dad so we did this fun photo shoot yeah it representation of blueprint it was really special I think it was one of the best things I it controversial but uh for my son and my dad and I we had a great time for my father it had significant results so it really was effective and my son this was a really nuanced thing as his father toal is 17 years old in this picture and before this I was having a discussion with him said talage I can bring you into this project and you recognized publicly and you be associated with me and this project that could be a terrible idea it could backfire and you could hate me for it like you may grow up and be like that involving me at this young age was terrible and at 17 you know it challenging to make those kinds of life decisions so I said I what to do here I don to do it I don do it I don wisdom to know what to do so I just kind of want to say I don know what do we do and we had a long conversation about it and we ultimately decided that it was going to be something we wanted to play with and he said all right Dad I so I really applaud tamage for carefully thinking this through acknowledging he doesn would regret it or appreciate it and but really saying yes to like this is a journey let has stepped into this and I with him as 17 to be in this kind of Spotlight and to have that kind of scrutiny is not easy but he very well and I think that he thinks it so that talage and I at this point had become best friends we just did everything together and it was the most fulfilling relationship I especially rewarding because you know because I invested so hard on my children and then I kind of was blocked out of their lives for a while after the divorce for tal much to be back into my life and for us to have this relationship was just like Peak life I was swimming as part of my protocol tal much came out and grabbed the picture I love this because it captures talage and my relationship where we just were flowing with such great rhythm in our lives so to me this is not about me or the situation this is about Tage and I being so fluid in in each other every week for a while I was running the Tesco Trail the one I told you about previously where Jefferson and Tage And I Ran So This is a Sunday morning which is like my sacred time after a Fun Run and this is just a few months ago where I introduced the concept of Don Die For the First Time it culmination of I have been working to do something meaningful for the human race for 25 years so when I came home from Ecuador I was 21 I felt this Burning Desire inside to do something that would help others I didn so I 25 years and it crystallized and don die and so if I think about my life in its entirety and if my life were to be boiled down into one sentence or two words it would be this that I hope my contribution to the human race is that in this moment in time when we transitioning from understanding that death is inevitable and a Pursuit Of Life in that vein to something where death is not inevitable and we may be able to dramatically extend how long and how well we can live that we era of Being Human that don pinned as the moment that started to happen and if that could be the case I would be thrilled about life journey and even if not I grateful for the challenges I what a precious thing it is to be conscious there have been moments in my life where I was desperate to not be conscious I wanted with more than anything to not exist and so I on both sides of the spectrum you can see after looking at these pictures you know when I say that I happier in my entire life you can see where that I sincerely mean it I cover up I have been in some really bad spots in my life and I don been better that is not to say that I don with a variety of things like all of us do it is to say that I life as badly as I do now as a kid you just don you an adult it how hard it is to navigate life on a regular basis and over time you kind of get beat down and so typically someone like myself who pretty beat down I might be jaded a little bit on this and that but I feel like it direction where I have this spry appreciation for existence like I never had before and I I what you get from me in this relationship is that you can feel the same way that even though life does present a continuous stream of challenges that we can make the conscious choice to step into a to this moment and the future first with gratitude and two with this eagerness and courage to say you know what we can make things better it it what This Moment is don conception like if you say to somebody Live Well everyone I want to reject that you have to revisit everything you understand about reality and that this moment I think that we are going to need to revisit everything we understand about reality because we to Super intelligence and I play a helpful role in society that can prepare all of us to get to walk into this new era with some degree of confidence that we can do this thing together so there you have it life through faces I hope you enjoyed it I hope it resonated and I hope we can all be our best selves together	Success

Could not retrieve a transcript for the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMKpLIQax6s! This is most likely caused by:

YouTube is blocking requests from your IP. This usually is due to one of the following reasons:
- You have done too many requests and your IP has been blocked by YouTube
- You are doing requests from an IP belonging to a cloud provider (like AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure, etc.). Unfortunately, most IPs from cloud providers are blocked by YouTube.

There are two things you can do to work around this:
1. Use proxies to hide your IP address, as explained in the \"Working around IP bans\" section of the README (https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api?tab=readme-ov-file#working-around-ip-bans-requestblocked-or-ipblocked-exception).
2. (NOT RECOMMENDED) If you authenticate your requests using cookies, you will be able to continue doing requests for a while. However, YouTube will eventually permanently ban the account that you have used to authenticate with! So only do this if you don't mind your account being banned!

Could not retrieve a transcript for the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loH5ko0iqc0! This is most likely caused by:

YouTube is blocking requests from your IP. This usually is due to one of the following reasons:
- You have done too many requests and your IP has been blocked by YouTube
- You are doing requests from an IP belonging to a cloud provider (like AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure, etc.). Unfortunately, most IPs from cloud providers are blocked by YouTube.

There are two things you can do to work around this:
1. Use proxies to hide your IP address, as explained in the \"Working around IP bans\" section of the README (https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api?tab=readme-ov-file#working-around-ip-bans-requestblocked-or-ipblocked-exception).
2. (NOT RECOMMENDED) If you authenticate your requests using cookies, you will be able to continue doing requests for a while. However, YouTube will eventually permanently ban the account that you have used to authenticate with! So only do this if you don't mind your account being banned!

Could not retrieve a transcript for the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_mRAfgitXU! This is most likely caused by:

YouTube is blocking requests from your IP. This usually is due to one of the following reasons:
- You have done too many requests and your IP has been blocked by YouTube
- You are doing requests from an IP belonging to a cloud provider (like AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure, etc.). Unfortunately, most IPs from cloud providers are blocked by YouTube.

There are two things you can do to work around this:
1. Use proxies to hide your IP address, as explained in the \"Working around IP bans\" section of the README (https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api?tab=readme-ov-file#working-around-ip-bans-requestblocked-or-ipblocked-exception).
2. (NOT RECOMMENDED) If you authenticate your requests using cookies, you will be able to continue doing requests for a while. However, YouTube will eventually permanently ban the account that you have used to authenticate with! So only do this if you don't mind your account being banned!
