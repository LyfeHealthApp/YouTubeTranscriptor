SulforaphaneÂs positive effects on brain health and autism | Jed Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCKFRfm-6zA	FoundMyFitness Clips 	we inflammation and I mean obviously there suffering in the brain yeah so this is an area where we lot of our time now is is partnering on clinical trials that are looking at just that so it turns out that the neurologists and and those who have been studying the brain and diseases of the brain for a long time in I guess the fairly recent past have determined that inflammation is a huge component of a number of those conditions schizophrenia autism Alzheimer we can you know we can speculate as to how that inflammation has an effect as far as I in brain volume it inflammation but but markers of inflammation clearly are up in people with these conditions and can be reversed in some cases with with anti-inflammatory drugs and so people people have come to us recently with the question okay we know sulforaphane reduces inflammation you know can it possibly help with autism Alzheimer and and schizophrenia or the the three that we back up that one say that sulforaphane has many and isothiocyanates like it have many effects they do affect many pathways we talked about nrf2 I may have made it seem like that was you know the best thing since sliced bread and the only thing it also mentioned an Tobias selective antibiotics against Helicobacter what we haven that sulforaphane actually inhibits the NF kappa-b pathway which is one of the main inflammatory pathways in the body and so and there it to pathway and the NF kappa-b pathway so the inflammatory and cytoprotective pathway cell forming also sorry up regulates the the so called heat shock response and I these together in a second but but but there are a number of other pathways in which it another so with with all of these biochemical pathways that self or vein targets many of them seemed to come together in a few of the neuro neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental diseases and so autism was really the first one that that I I guess I can say was put in our lap or came to our attention so dr. Andy Zimmerman a colleague at who was at the time at Harvard Medical School in the Mass General Hospital came to Paul Talalay back I don exactly when two thousand eight or nine or ten or somewhere in that range and Andy Zimmerman had shown previously this was published in 2007 that the fever the so-called fever response of children with autism was was real another he sort of codified it and and and got it and got it in print apparently psychiatrists and caregivers had been commenting and anecdotally for a long time that some of their their charges their kids are there they to who had autism when they got a fever they got they got better their symptoms reversed or relapsed so autism is characterized by a number of things including repetitive motions not making eye contact the social behavioral impairment if you will and so a lot of these characteristics got a lot better when kids had fevers and so back to dr. Zimmerman he knew that we and others had shown that sulforaphane was effective in up regulating the heat shock response and so his question to Paul was hey why don sulforaphane also helps autism because in half of the kids when they get a fever the fever the the symptoms go away or they they don rillette they they improve and that likely related to this heat shock response wouldn sulforaphane has an effect now as all of us got thinking about it there were there were clearly a number of other mechanisms by which the sulforaphane could be acting including reduction of inflammation and enhancement of the antioxidant enzymes clear you know more effective clearance of oxidative reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species I never thought about heat shock proteins putting a role in autism that very interesting I mean I quote neurodegenerative diseases for sure but and this was an interesting connection he was making that I wouldn but I see I can see how he yes so paper is 2007 currents you are are a and as the first author will get you a copy so so yeah it fascinating potential connection and so that was that was sort of that was what got the collaboration started so we supplied broccoli sprout extract and and they up in in Boston looked at I guess it was about 44 subjects all men all young men boys men as you probably know autism is about four to one male to female in terms of its incidents in this country anyway and less than or more than one and a hundred kids now are born with autism so it problem I don about why it because they on autism among other things oh really but we we did this trial it was published in 2014 we for various reasons biomarkers of inflammation of the nrf2 pathway and a heat shock response were not evaluated in blood from those subjects but what we showed was rather dramatic reduction in many of the symptoms of autism in about half of the subjects compared to placebos those who were given placebo instead of broccoli sprout extract in which there was no detectable change I think it was like a 37% yeah it was very very robust for a small amount it was dramatic they were right that n was small the number of subjects was small but it was a dramatic improvement I am so sad that we never got the biomarker data from the subjects although theoretically it result of that trial a lot of people got interested in the possibilities and so dr. Zimmerman and his team including including the Coleman chemo Protection Centre here have a follow up grant from the Department of Defense to study a younger cohort male and female boys and girls about 50 subjects but a similar trial design and it is going to be but it is biomarker rich so we done a pilot study with 10 subjects in which we evaluated we refined our ability to collect samples and to process the biomarker samples will be we were collecting blood from all of them and this is a trial design where half of them half of the subjects are getting actually a v the supplements the dietary supplements the one with with glucoraphanin and my Ronnie half of them are getting a placebo for I think it the same amount of time as we gave subjects in the previous trial biomarker rich there and then everybody goes on a bra the the sulforaphane product the AB McCall for another 15 weeks we i she here at Hopkins she and I were just up in Worcester Massachusetts the team is now at UMass Medical Center in Worcester Massachusetts there they about 1/3 of the subjects so we a third of the way through completing the trial and we obviously about about what we may find and about getting to the task of processing these biomarkers very exciting and what was a dose difference from the first trial the first trial the dose of well it but if you bear with me the first trial delivered sulforaphane rich broccoli sprout extract okay remember that bioavailable okay those trials delivering glucoraphanin plus myrosinase it the same amount as the previous trial so the between a hundred and 150 micro moles per subject per day is there a reason why you response or doing trying higher doses as well to see if there was a more robust effect the next trial will okay so that is that in yeah yeah so I mean look after a tile like this especially one where we were not able to publish biomarker results there are many people saying wow that really interesting but it repeated so we and others are trying to repeat it just essentially as closely as possible to the way it was designed right yeah it does make sense and it unfortunate if these trials weren damned expensive I mean try all it very very exciting it but it intensive and and it also you know you desires and tears of a lot of people involved these are these are conditions that that you know that that hurt to see people going through and so to do a whole bunch of trials with a whole bunch of conditions might also make the people who are suffering from these conditions really think that you know this is that that we already have the answer this is why I prevention trials that are being done you know people people get on their high horse and that don talking about I think you know again one of the most frequently heard things for me is Oh John Hopkins say this this cures cancer I mean I things not just certainly not just our work it ain same thing with autism that if we if I guess if it were cheap and easy to do and nobody cared about the subjects involved there lot of them would be lousy trials and you know a lot of people would have their hopes raised only to maybe 10 or 15 years down the road find out that yeah those trials weren that well so all the oversight all of the the self-criticism and the peer criticism is probably worth it because I think I think it does serve a purpose anyway back to the story enough philosophizing so so we have this follow-up trial underway interestingly there are four other for additional autism trials all using AB McCall and and this is you know if it doesn I something that that looked like it was the best of what was out there and I got available for people right now it available we know that it that it produces sulforaphane and we know that it through all sorts of Quality Assurance but so you know when when people who came to us and said we would like to do an autism trial would like to model it after Andy try to replicate the findings we want more of that sulforaphane that you produced for it and my answer has had to be I don you as my witness I freezer and show you that we don any more in our clinical freezer so we more and so we had to suggest that people switch to something to something commercial so for other studies one of them has finished its patient accruals that UCSF and we of evaluating biomarkers and they they biomarker so they molecules produced by the various metabolic pathways that are either induced or up regulated or not and hoped to be able to make some correlations with symptom reduction and biochemistry there is a trial just starting at University of North Carolina there is a trial at Rutgers that not sure how far along they are pretty far along I think and theirs and all three of those trials are about the same order of magnitude as our original trial thirty twenty twenty to fifty patients or subject the the other trial is in China and there are I this wrong they subjects and that study drug or supplement is there and this is this is at an autism a school for autistic kids in Changsha China and you can you can read the descriptions of most of these trials I think all of them on clinical trials.gov which is the government trials so again all these studies are looking at biomarkers of inflammation as you say il-6 as one of the key markers that people are looking at cox-2 tnf-alpha the supposition is that those markers are going to go down the supposition is that markers of nrf2 activation are going to go up and heat shock protein markers are going to go up we in people that don are given sulforaphane at least I guess it has been shown yeah the heat shock protein that really caught my attention I came across it when I was reading about sulforaphane and how it can be neuroprotective for Alzheimer Huntington diseases of protein aggregation of which heat shock proteins play a major role in repairing you know and preventing both they do both so I was very surprised I guess not that it wasn found out that so for a faint activates because it is a stress response pathway heat shock proteins do respond to stress like heat stress so I guess I wasn that shocked but I was I was a little surprised first to see that it plays a role and possibly that prevent and protect against some of these neurodegenerative diseases it very possible yeah yeah you	Success
Jed Fahey discusses the longevity compound Sulforaphane	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6_Y-MXweaQ	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so there are collections of people who age of a hundred and more aren beautiful cohort to look at the nrf2 induced genes in and I surprised if this hasn already we and I know we in animals but doing precisely as you suggest you know that here cohort of very old people who are quite healthy do they have something you know everybody wants to know is there something magic about that but are the nrf2 inducible cytoprotective genes part of that equation and we suspect that they might be the the the the prolonged lifespan experiments will pretty much have to be done in mice and again there colleague that I know we the Institute of Aging who was interested in doing that I that ever does that ever happened we I had a I had a high school student who wanted to do a project here yeah number of years ago and we got her working on nematodes senior Abdus which is a which is a common experimental vehicle for those interested in looking at lifespan because its life span is so short and it cycles quickly well we ought to get together and do this experiment again if it hasn problems with so forth in research nowadays is I can no one can really keep up with it all because there are two or three papers a week coming out on sulforaphane and quite a few more on the nrf2 pathway I mean if you try to be be a renaissance person and know all the literature in this field it there are thousands or I think a couple of thousands of papers a year on nrf2 C so it them on it and it someone has done those lifespan experiments will see elegans again we we started we only we didn muscle in it we had high school student who then had to go back to I didn urge her by the way I look for sale yes I don I wasn preliminary data from that student we also had I binder it may not still be here we we had a colleague who was who was a bona fide expert on C elegans who was going to do some studies and I that ever happened or if those were ever published so yeah sorry I mean I wish I wish I could jump up and down it me I mean we about you know how how sulforaphane it is as you mentioned the most potent dietary that we know of activator of the nrfu system and knowing what we know we do know that nrf2 does play a role in delaying aging and brain aging in you know tissue aging you know there there inflammation and reducing oxidative stress these things cause aging right many people seem to think that by understanding a bit more about how we can reverse this phenotype in people with acute aging that this may also be applicable to normal aging and to perhaps slowing down normal aging it turns out that all of us have some small amount of pro jaren this this protein in our systems and i believe the evidence is that it increases somewhat as we age not certainly to the acute levels that you find in kids with progeria so so we since we got our grant there interesting and I think quite important publication from Thomas Telly the NIH showing that in fact nrf2 is very intimately related to this / to this process in progeria and that what happens is that projet are in the sticky protein that i told you on the inside of the nucleus actually binds nrf2 as it enters the nucleus to do its signalling thing and and it it gloves it up against the inside of the nucleus so to speak so that perhaps one that among the chores of sulforaphane are among the functions of sulforaphane are to increase the amount of nrf2 that but it may also enhance clearance of mutant proteins and and even pro jaren from from the nucleus so there amount that we don an exciting it like even just the the mutant perjuring would seems like it two from being activated and that you know essentially it and you know so that part of the pro aging effect as well yeah so yeah it I was reading somewhere maybe you can confirm this that so sulforaphane you know does increase the activity of nra up to like nrf2 i think it something like sixty percent like enter up to you know is activated every 180 minutes or something like that and so for feign bumps that up you know a sixty percent increase and it being activated so i don yeah i can but but i mean it for sure correct yes so that and that for me what I want another question question it it up regulates its production so if you look at RNA levels for nrf2 or for keep one it cytoplasm after treatment with sulforaphane you see those those levels going up so sixty percent but I think that was a translocation in the nucleus yeah that was the increase it was okay okay yeah I unfortunately I can comment on that just don right I you	Success
Importance of myrosinase in supplements for the conversion of glucoraphanin to sulforaphane	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73ddddTuN5M	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so a couple of years ago I went to a small number of supplement companies and said help and challenge them to take the supplements that they were making that we had tested and verified were contained what they said they had and to offer to supply them for clinical trials that that we were approached about about partnering on and not only to supply the material free of charge but to supply all the documentation and paperwork that would go along with an application to an institutional review board or to the FDA in fact for an investigational new drug application for permission to work on that disease with that compound and a few companies did come forward one of them called nutramax and and they have a product called AB McCall which they sort of took a page from our playbook and they they make something with gluco rafen n actually been used in a number look quite a large number of clinical trials now and so I don people of course I don anything ready to be published yet but those publications will be coming along very short and and that actually does contain the glucoraphanin myrosinase and you validated that yes we would certainly not recommend something to anybody without checking it and we checked every batch that that they put on the market and because we don want to be in a position I don have egg on my face and recommend it to a friend that this is a product worth using and then and then have it turn out to be a dud so you mentioned this wilfer frame one which is the the prostate the AB AB McCall which has the glue carafe and plus some arrows anaise and then there glucoraphanin I think you mentioned it was by thorne they competent that have a decent that I shouldn they this on our webinar they be ten companies that say I we we a medium or large size supplement maker and their product is called crew sera SGS but that only has glucoraphanin and right and this actually kind of brings me back to I kind of want to get back to this and that is the the microbiome and so you know if you supplement that only has group glucoraphanin and does not have the Myra sanae on what you possibly potentially have in a species of bacteria and the gut which may be you can illuminate what that species of bacteria is or if there ways we can increase it probiotics obviously wiping out the gut bacteria so people with you know chronic antibiotic use may not be able to convert Luca rafen in very well to sulforaphane I would presume right you must have read one of our papers so so in fact we did we did show that this was this a number of years ago now we showed that if volunteers took a fleet anima self-administered anima which which reduces the number of bacteria in there certainly in their large intestine by I don magnitude and took a preoperative antibiotic course in other words something that one would take prior to having intestinal surgery they essentially wiped out most of the bacteria in their intestines and those people went from whatever their level of conversion of glucose even to self for a vein and its metabolites was which was as you heard earlier ten to 70 percent yeah to nothing so they they lost their ability to to convert glucan and to sulforaphane and then over the course of a couple of weeks I think we as I recall we followed them we one or two subsequent challenges with glue carafe and in two weeks and four weeks later I think they gradually regained their ability to to do that reaction clearly residual bacteria or new colonizers in their guts had myrosinase activity so we have net we people and nobody can everybody that appears to have myrosinase producing bacteria in their gut but as we said earlier obviously it levels just as clearly although we don do bacterial sequencing here and this is a this is a new and very exciting field that the field of microbiome the microbiome but it there are certain strains or certain species of bacteria that do have myrosinase activity others have shown that there are believed one of them is in enteric aqus there are lactobacilli that have myrosinase activity there are bifida bacteria my believe that habit and i again this is not my this is not my field of expertise so i may have misspoken okay the bottom but the bottom line is that there are a number of species of bacteria that do this but not all certainly not all bacteria in your gut this whole incredibly fascinating field of the microbiome has has certainly shown that each of us has very has different populations and different ratios of different types of bacteria in our guts and certainly to the degree that this is true that the amount of myrosinase activity in our guts i can tell you that we haven studies with with mice in which we challenged them with with glue carafe onon on a regular basis over time and we the goal was to try to push them by natural selection to try to push them for her to have more bacteria with myrosinase with more myrosinase activity the fact that we haven means we didn enough or reproducibly enough to have a good story to tell but certainly that what we believe might happen having said that when we look at real people and we query them as to their habits there evidence to date that people who say they eat you know a pound of broccoli a day that exaggeration but people we whole lotta broccoli don or a fan and better than people who don some other selective pressure on the gut on myrosinase containing bacteria yeah I would think that even just eating a healthy diet in general when you eating a diet high and in vegetables and fermentable fibers and things that are growing bifida bacteria and lactobacillus and you know all these in these species of bacteria that are commensal bacteria that even that itself would potentially then you know increase your chances of being able to have more myrosinase because you this you know commensal microbial backed by own but I guess we don you know we don our hunch both of our hunches are correct but the proof is the proof is in the pudding this this whole issue of probiotics yes my next question that would be interesting well it fascinating you know in Europe there there is a lot I think the regulatory climate in Europe for probiotics is a bit more receptive than in the u.s. you may you probably know more about it than I do but I know that in the that the use of probiotics is is seems to be increasing in the US and studies by those who are expert in the field of probiotics are are mixed right I mean well it same case as the glucoraphanin sulforaphane supplements a lot of the probiotics on the market there of dead bacteria garbage a lot of garbage I mean this is ubiquitous in all supplement you know it there was even a study showing something like 70% of like a lot of these supplements on the market are not actually what they say they are they don so but yeah I think that the there is a lot of mix data and and that comes down to not not having quality probiotics and also been numbers that too low numbers live as 10 billion yeah that dropping the pool it move the needle so but there are there is a probiotic out there that I at least two dozen publications including clinical trials and humans and then there studies and animals using BSL number three it their sachets and they have 450 billion probiotics per session and they have a mixture of lactobacillus and and little bacteria and some other ones but showing efficacy and treating IBS you know Crohn you can find quality probiotics but it just again it you right one absolutely I think you know the the issue the issue of the numbers of cells I mean bit to it to a non-scientist consumer billions sounds like a huge number oh yeah it is but it bacteria on a on a pinhead probably well maybe a teaspoon anyway the the issue there though is a lot of the issue is survival so if you if you boast about having billions of bacterial cells of a certain type in yogurt for example and you are not on proton not on proton pump inhibitors so you have an acid stomach and you send that yogurt through your stomach how much of those back how many of those bacteria actually make it through the acid environment of the stomach so I mean people studied that certainly but there are studies as you say with with a small number of specific strains showing showing effects I think some of the more some of the more striking effects have to do with childhood diarrhea and and there even studies showing effects on asthma so I mean excel brain it uncredible yeah yeah yeah so I absolutely a believer that what goes on and they got matters to the rest of the body there think as you say a lot of the studies suffer from the fact that what given probably isn expected to be efficacious anyway because it just died or didn but speaking of probiotics wouldn be cool if someone came up with a myrosinase containing strain and put it in a probiotic formulation so that you could take that along with you cruciferous vegetables all like and it good I believe that there are companies that are working on that now because certainly it strains of bacteria have myrosinase activity there may be issues of getting that activity maintained you know when you when you grow up that bacteria to freeze-dry them to put them in a formulation but I I hope it a matter of time before we see formulations that contain myrosinase and that are safe I mean obviously safety of these probiotic formulations is something that is a concern to the regulators and it should be so we we there but I hope we you	Success
Considerations for choosing sulforaphane / glucoraphanin supplements | Jed Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J0_6EG-SSQ	FoundMyFitness Clips 	and in fact there are now companies that are selling glue carafe and and plus myrosinase you have to be careful if you buy those supplements because it given that they as you know multivitamins and things that you can just leave on the shelf for years and and so so you need to pay attention to the expiration dates on those products that have live active enzyme most I business but I familiar with it most supplement makers it appears don has to be refrigerated or put in a freezer I think it increases their cost and so most of the supplements that I aware of are made to be shelf stable but I I think it won supplement that has active myrosinase or that says they have active myocytes I think it wouldn refrigerator treat them as you would treat a probiotic supplement and you actually measured the content of glucoraphanin and/or sulforaphane and some of these supplements that are found on the market that correct we we have we found that there amount of supplements that actually contain what they say they contain yeah I think one of them you mentioned was a French company that has actually has sulfur fame in it procced of fame yes so I I think it was someone in the industry that told me this that there are something like a thousand supplements that claim to have broccoli sprouts or broccoli extracts in them that are on the market now I certainly it would you know it would take me all of my waking hours to try to vet that statement and and validate the content of each of them but in our lab we have looked at a number of supplements some of those that are more more prominent or that you see advertised or some of those that we just we people that have asked us about them and many of them you know 20 years ago there were a bunch of supplements that said they they you know have sulforaphane and sulforaphane cures cancer because John Hopkins says so this is highly inaccurate and they should have been taken to court but you can make statements like that nobody has shown that any of these supplements prevent cancer or cure cancer we certainly hope to be part of the group of scientists who are able to put some teeth behind that evidence and eventually I think one day it will it may be shown that in people cancer can be prevented by by taking something like sulforaphane but that has not been proven to date so anyway we to get back to your question we have looked at a variety of supplements 20 years ago when they started coming out there were many supplements that we could demonstrate we were not even broccoli sprout or broccoli had no broccoli in them yet they said they were broccoli supplements people were selling what they called broccoli seeds and when you actually grew them out and grew plants from them you grew cauliflower or you grew canola or rapeseed from them or something else or in some more egregious cases we found stuff that was sold as broccoli seeds that that was really alfalfa seeds so there were a lot of liberties were taken a lot of shysters were on the market I think that now there are a ton and I you know as I say I was told a thousand but many many many supplements that say they have sulforaphane or gluco rafa and in them we have analyzed a small number of them those that are made by labs or companies that you know we things about that haven challenged by the FDA for for sanitation problems or for labeling miss labeling and there are supplements that contain gluco Raffin and alone there are a few now that contain glue carafe and and plus myrosinase and there are a few that contain sulforaphane right we are we should be out in the next week or two a paper in which we actually looked at the bioavailability of sulforaphane from a French supplement that is it called prostate it was there have been a there that looked at its ability to change the the PSA trajectory in in men with prostate who have had prostate cancer and that biomarker for prostate cancer return right and so those tablets they they refrigerated to prolong the life of the sulforaphane in them the bioavailability of the sulforaphane from those tablets was essentially identical to that from powders that we made in the lab by extracting broccoli sprouts and treating him with marcin ace and freeze drying the method so we were we were delighted to see that that that they worked yeah yeah unfortunately they being sold in the US i I hope that one of the supplement companies can I hope that somehow or another business the business of supplements gets them to this country you	Success
NRF2 pathway as the mechanism behind sulforaphaneÂs protective effects | Jed Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoKGcsRH0Mg	FoundMyFitness Clips 	one of the main protective mechanisms would be the nrf2 pathway yeah so I I have a feeling that sulforaphane would be just another interesting phytochemical if at almost the same time we and I use the term we loosely because I was only very peripherally involved with this but a number of people at Johns Hopkins and in Japan discovered and in Japan and England I should say but a small number of people discovered this nrf2 pathway and really fleshed out all the details of it and this happened in parallel to the interest in sulforaphane and broccoli and it turns out that the nrf2 pathway is an extremely important pathway for up regulating the protective enzymes and protective proteins including perhaps the heat shock proteins in cells so that they can protect themselves against various insults it protection against a variety of chronic diseases and as I say Tom canceller Paul Talalay al-banna denkova Kostova all at Hopkins masya mimoto and Japan John Hayes in England excuse me and I a few people but small number of people initially put this pathway on the map and it turns out that the nrf2 pathway controls something between 3 and 5 percent of our cellular proteins so it very important Wow yeah and and you know why is it important it recognizes molecules like sulforaphane through a system of biochemical system that I hesitate to to explain without props and graph and also because I the world it recognizes sulforaphane or other similar molecules as they enter cells in the cytoplasm of the cells then there there is actually a chaperone Pro team that keep one that molecule when it binds to solve for a fan or vice-versa changes in conformation and it releases nrf2 which then migrates to the nucleus and turns on or up regulates the antioxidant response element which is responsible for for the transcription for initiating transcription of a whole series of of protective genes or genes encoding for a bunch of protective enzymes so it and this happens very quickly this this protective response and it efficient so to get back to sulforaphane sulforaphane was discovered and then everybody started searching for the mechanism by which it acted and rf2 the end the keep one in our f2 mechanism was discovered and they sort of both developed a following if you will in parallel and it turns out that sulforaphane is still probably the most potent activator of nrf2 to be found naturally and you know from from the natural world there have been synthetic activators that are more potent that that have been been produced been made chemically but sulforaphane still sort of takes the takes the cake in terms of its protective ability and ability to upregulate protective enzymes you	Success
Introduction to sulforaphane and its precursor glucoraphanin | Jed Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5I9UiPCheY	FoundMyFitness Clips 	sulforaphane is a small molecule that was discovered in broccoli by Paul Talalay and you sh and Zhang his student at the time in 1992 or so they published on it and it was it was of interest in particular because it was a huge inducer of protective enzymes in in people of course it wasn occurred in people at the time but in cell cultures and in animals they showed that it up regulated the protective enzyme cytoprotective enzyme system known by some as the phase 2 enzyme system and Paul then who is one of the grandfather has it really helped make people stand up and pay attention to the fact that you could potentially prevent diseases like cancer Paul asked me to join the group in 1993 and the challenge was can can you get broccoli with with more sulforaphane I came from a background in plant biotechnology and of course I said yes we should be able to and we started trying to trying to breed and cross broccolis to get to get higher levels of sulphur pain quickly became obvious that it was very difficult to predict how much sulforaphane a broccoli plant would have based on things like smell touch color and you pretty much had to run it through an HPLC to measure levels of sulforaphane what that sulforaphane is not what in the intact plant so what the plant is something called glue carafe Ihnen and that is a thio glucose conjugated molecule not to get too heavily into the biochemistry of it but it and it not at all stable it and so at any rate it turned out that the the intact broccoli plants had a Lucca rafen in various levels ranged all over the map couldn out exactly how much one had without doing chemical analyses and we were going out to the field in the Eastern Shore of Maryland and eventually winter came along and we couldn shore to the fields and get broccoli anymore so we started growing them in incubators in the lab starting from seeds and lo and behold it turns out that broccoli sprouts had much higher levels of sulfur of the precursor of sulforaphane glue carafe and then did the the mature plants the the heads of broccoli that you buy in the market so we then determined that if you grow broccoli sprouts all the same way which you pretty much do if you sprouter or a commercial sprouter you add a certain amount of light you add fresh water you grown for a certain amount of time at a certain temperature so if you did that with a whole slew of different cultivars that sub varieties of broccoli you got a range of different activities different amounts of glucagon anyway bottom line is by selecting the appropriate genotypes the appropriate broccoli genetics if you will we identified some varieties that had very high levels of glucose often and we made a paul and i made a conscious decision at that time that we were going to promote the use of broccoli sprouts not broccoli seeds because it turns out the seeds have the highest amount on a per gram basis of glue carafe odden but at the time no one had eaten broccoli seeds you know they weren of cachet or the appearance of you know eating healthy green vegetables so we focused on sprouts which had much higher levels than the mature plants although lower levels in the seeds and it turns out that then there is an enzyme that the plant tissue contains called myrosinase and that enzyme converts glucose and in the precursor which is stored in vacuoles in the plant cells to sulforaphane and typically in nature the plant does that as a protective mechanism if an insect starts chewing on the leaf of a broccoli plant for example it breaks open cells right and so those cells then release their glucomannan and the enzyme that site hydrolyzes glucoraphanin and form sulforaphane and so for a feign repels those bugs or is in some cases toxic to those bugs so they go bad and they fly away or they crawl away but it turns out that sulforaphane is also a foreign a foreign compound for our cells but in the process of being recognized and chucked out of the cell if you will it up regulates the protective enzymes in those cells and so that special like automatic effect a hormetic effect yeah yeah so clearly you could you could if you if all you ate would sell for a fan you you the same you know the same with just about anything you can you can suggest so it protective mechanisms of the cells you	Success
Sulforaphane supplements vs. broccoli sprouting | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgYzgQVqyA	FoundMyFitness Clips 	I sulforaphane I know that you know here gosh wet it when you first started doing videos and posts about the benefits of sprouting broccoli seeds and this miracle compound call sulforaphane and where are you now with all that I about it sulfur fame is it formed from a precursor called glucoraphanin and glucoraphanin is found in a variety of what are called cruciferous vegetables things like broccoli brussel sprouts cabbage daikon you know watercress all these things cauliflower these things are all from a cruciferous family of vegetables so gluco rafen is the precursor to it when the plant tissue is you know crushed to torn apart it activates an enzyme called myrosinase which turns glucoraphanin into sulfur fame so fer fame has about 70% bioavailability if you orally ingest it the precursor glucoraphanin only has about 10% bioavailability to be converted into sulfur f---ing so there been tons and tons of intervention trials where people are given either a broccoli sprout broccoli sprouts by the way have about up to hundred hundred times more of the precursor to sulforaphane called glucagon then the mature broccoli plant which is kind of why I sprouts because that can eating so many of them I was eating like tops of those a day and they don good and I them I just I had to go to the supplements yeah well so here thing the supplements so there there have been you know scientifically validated to really have what they say they have so for free and not is not a very stable molecule it and it know in a supplement form there two supplements that are really I would say have been clinically validated and but have been used in randomized controlled trials that have been pure you know peer-reviewed and published one is I way I have no affiliation with any of these supplements or sample but companies at all you don have any yeah it have any affiliation with any something I don that because people don no I don neither do I yeah good to mention I been taking you know there supplements one I think AB McCall has around three point five milligrams of sulfur refrain in each tablet and the recommended dose on their bottle is two tablet so that would be about seven milligrams of silver Fang the other supplement is called prostate Pross the fame is unfortunately not available in the US I shouldn say that yeah it because sulfur vein is so unstable like the company just didn with like the whole shipping it to another country and all that and dealing with all that right but you can buy like I buy pasta fain there pharmacies you can have it shipped shipped to you oh really yeah like I arriving arriving tomorrow also even you stopped with the broccoli so each processor vein tablet has around 10 milligrams of silver in it there are trade offs you know verse you know for doing broccoli sprouts or vs. supplements I would say first and foremost the supplements are expensive prostitution is really expensive they like fifty fifty dollars a Packer something like ninety something dollars for a pack of sixty for reprocessing it has how are you taking a day one 60 day supply we each one has ten milligrams in Episode four a fan and I get to that dose babe maybe I should talk about some of the clinical I mean there have been really exciting in the past couple years cool yeah please do let me just finish with the sprouts they cheaper and you get a ton of sulfur so like 400 grams of fresh sprouts use something around like 40 milligrams of sulfur refrain you know can be bio you know basically you can get something around 40 milligrams of sulfur that lot right for a lot cheaper now the trade-off is its pain you have to like work right have to make them I mean they there very they can easily be contaminated and I and it kind of gives you some you know it there you should bleach the seeds first and then and I don comfortable bleaching the season do it I just don that been doing the processing for one simple reason I running found my fitness and trying to do all this research and stuff and and also trying to like exercise and there just I just this too much you know this is too much for me so I found it easier for me to take the prostitutes implement I would like to get back to the sprouts and I will probably mix that up again but for now I way that seriously am i keeping my fridge looked like a little mini farm like it was like Farmville up my fridge it was like there was sprouts everywhere and yeah some of them are going bad like me and I was freezing some of them and yeah you	Success
How freezing and freeze drying affects myrosinase in broccoli sprouts | Jed Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PqziTSrKaU	FoundMyFitness Clips 	[Jed]: Well, if you eat fresh sprouts, they Oh, you mentioned that your freeze broccoli\\nsprouts. [Rhonda]: I wanted to ask you about that. [Jed]: So as you freeze them, this is interesting,\\nyou freeze them, you take them out of the freezer. If you put them in a blender and make a smoothie\\nright away, then the myrosinase is going to act in that liquid, and so you If you let those sprouts thaw out, there They So, by the time you see that juice and either\\npour it off, or pour it in your container, probably most of the myrosinase activity has\\noccurred and sulforaphane has probably started to bind to proteins and macromolecules in\\nthat vegetable mess. And because what happens is when you freeze\\nthe plant tissue, when you thaw the plant tissue, I guess, you So the lignin, the structure on the outside\\nof the plant cells is still there, but the cells are trashed. [Rhonda]: Is that why freezing increases sulforaphane,\\nit [Jed]: Well, ice crystals are forming, yeah,\\nit allows the enzyme and the substrate to come into contact, form sulforaphane. So it throw it in the blender right way, which is\\nprobably what you do. But it We have a freeze dryer. We have a beautiful freeze dryer that we were\\nactually given by a Japanese sprout company as sort of thanks for what we sprouts. And this freeze dryer has trays. And you can put, say, five pounds of sprouts\\non the trays. But what you have to do is you have to freeze\\nthe sprouts first and then put them in the freeze dryer, pull a vacuum, and it winds\\nup pulling off all the moisture. If you stick the trays in a freezer and freeze\\nthem and then move them into the freeze dryer, basically what you a vacuum. And when we looked at those freeze-dried sprouts,\\nthey had no glucoraphanin, and no myrosinase, and no sulforaphane to speak of because it\\nhad all reacted and then it was just a mess. So there is value in thinking a little bit\\nabout how that enzyme behaves before your start making a thing. You can actually freeze dry broccoli sprouts\\nvery nicely as long as you deep freeze them, or quick freeze them and maintain them in\\na frozen state when you go to dry them. [Rhonda]: And that will retain the sulforaphane. The myrosinase. [Jed]: The myrosinase is not coming in contact\\nwith the glucosinolate then. [Rhonda]: Okay.	Success
Broccoli sprouts as an unconventional treatment for H. Pylori (gastric ulcer-associated bacteria)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDbPfIwkmsA	FoundMyFitness Clips 	you actually showed something very interesting about the effects of sulforaphane on a certain type of my microbe species h pylori yes so so h pylori is a known it Helicobacter pylori he triple RI is a very interesting organism i exclusively in the stomach and it occupies that niche in a very unique fashion it apparently has an enzyme that is called urease but an enzyme that allows it to neutralize the ph in a little micro environment around the bacterial cells in the in the stomach i shouldn also use the term gut to refer to the intestines so stomach is very acid extremely asset that it does its job and Gila compactor tunnels into the mucous layer inside the stomach and creates with enzymes creates his little zone of neutral pH which allows it to thrive otherwise it would be it would be killed as are any other or almost any other bacteria that enter the enter the stomach and it interesting critter if I can use the term can I call it a critter yeah it raised in critter because some people some very well respected and well known microbiologist for example Martin Blaser at NYU maintains and I happen to I happen to drink this kool-aid I happen to believe this that he been around all during our evolution of the evolution of humankind certainly for tens of thousands of years people have had Helicobacter in their systems and something like fifty five percent of the world Helicobacter in their systems in some areas recently in Japan and and certainly some areas and in Africa and Asia almost all people have Helicobacter and some areas of South America and it a it would appear it may actually confer benefit on its host in other words you the person if levels of Helicobacter get too high if the number of bacterial cells per square millimeter per square inch or per square mile or however you want to you want to quantify them gets too great then they start to have clearly pathological effects they can cause ulcers they do cause ulcers and they can eventually that can eventually lead to stomach cancer I believe the the last estimate I saw is that the World Health Organization considers Helicobacter to confer a four I think of three or four to six fold increased risk of stomach cancer if you but the question is if you are colonized with Helicobacter can you reduce the levels of colonization keep it down to a low roar as it were in other words what a few of them hang around in your stomach as long as they don the system and so the the the the prescription for someone who has Helicobacter in this country and I believe in in Europe I gastroenterologist but is to wipe it out so to treat it with so-called triple therapy three separate antibiotics and kill it so you can alternative and I should say about 15 percent of people who are given that treatment either can doesn people find appealing is is a dietary approach to controlling Helicobacter in other words if and we don to these questions but if so many people around the world are colonized and it been with us for so long and humankind is still humankind are there perhaps benefits to having it so for example it Martin Blaser who showed this a number of years ago that there correlation between Helicobacter infection and childhood asthma so you know it may protect due to stimulation of the immune system other mechanisms it may protect against certain diseases but we just don so maybe reducing the levels of Helicobacter in the stomach again keeping it to a low roar where it can cause inflammation or where it doesn cause major inflammation doesn you ulcers maybe enough to reduce the risk of it some point in the future if it doesn cause inflammation and there are only a few cells here and there that are sort of hanging on maybe that so that can be done by a dietary approach and with that in mind we actually looked at the ability of sulforaphane to kill Helicobacter of course if it had wiped out all the Helicobacter in people who were infected I would have been happy with that also that would have certainly been an interesting finding what we ultimately found and this was done with collaborators in Japan in a in a 50-person trial we found that Helicobacter can reduce the levels sorry that self or vein or broccoli sprouts actually fresh broccoli sprouts we able to reduce levels of colonization in infected people or colonized people and were able to reduce markers of inflammation in those same people that work grew from an observation that I made with a with a different colleague of French colleague who is visiting the u.s. on sabbatical ln-laws nevsky so he and I discovered and published in about 2002 that in vitro in a test-tube sulforaphane was very capable of killing Helicobacter not only did it kill natural strains but it killed strains that were that he had recolored from some of his patients he gastroenterologist and had killed singly and EE antibiotic resistant strains so as you know antibiotic resistance in bacteria of all sorts in all settings is a huge problem and Helicobacter is no different once Helicobacter in people start seeing a bunch of antibiotics some of some of them develop resistance including resistance to two of the of the commonly used antibiotics that are used to treat it so the fact that sulforaphane was equally effective in killing them was we thought quite significant and interestingly sulforaphane is not as potent li antibiotic against a whole variety of other bacteria but do you know why the H pylori is so sensitive to it you know we don some clues we think we thought we had some clues and actually out dr. le hacen lo zfg some work on that which was never published he this colleague for reasons that we need not get into here is no longer in the business of science and so that paper never got published and we never really finished the finished the proof so we potently antibiotic one thing that I can tell you is that in in the quest for that answer quite recently Kitty Stevenson who works works here with us and I started looking at the ability of sulforaphane to inhibit urease which is that enzyme that I told you that creates that neutralizes the pH in the mucus of the stomach and we found that indeed sulforaphane is quite an effective inhibitor of that enzyme but so again we thought we had a real Eureka moment but it turned out that wiping out that enzyme wasn because strains how do I put this strains of Helicobacter that had been engineered by others to be to not contain urease we sulforaphane so it wasn so inhibiting urease might be important from a disease prevention standpoint but it bacteria sorry to present such a complicated story but that things roll yeah for sure but the also very not surprising to me results of it lowering inflammation is one of my obsessions with sulfur fain generally speaking I anything in my diet and my lifestyle that I can do that will lower the amount of systemic inflammation that I have in my body and so far it and you shown that you know even broccoli sprout extract powder given to people can lower c-reactive protein levels but as much as 20% other inflammatory cytokines il-6 can be lowered by something similar you know so it measurable effect in people you know that different studies that I of the reasons I is because well inflammation really you know plays there won like cancer but it really seems to be a driver of the aging process and I don know if you this to you briefly but I actually think that sulforaphane may be a anti-aging compound one of the reasons I sprouting and taking it I think it actually not only is it preventing these diseases like cancer but also maybe actually delaying the aging process by activating nrf2 which then activates all these anti inflammatory genes activates anti oxidant genes including all the good of found related enzymes I don know if you think I also mentioned you that I would love to see some lifespan studies done and animals I know those are not easy to do they take a long time but there was a study that was done in this red flower beetle have you seen this study no okay so let me tell you so there flower beetle yes it they have an error they have an nrf2 gene that humans also there the FOXO gene as well so they the scientists fed these red flour beetles different doses of broccoli sprout extract and the doses were ranged from it was hot low to high I can and what they found is that at the I think it was at the highest dose these it extended the life span of these beetles by 15% and on when they put it when they exposed these beetles to a high oxidative stress all the time by keeping them in a warmer environment constantly it extended their lifespan by 30% and it was totally dependent on nrf2 so that they knocked down nrf2 the lifespan extension went away so I was like this is a great teaser yeah right because if it obviously it they have a homologous gene you know and if it critter that has the same similar gene that we have then I feel like there potential there that fascinating no I wasn haven ask you is this a red beetle that likes flowers or be like red flowers okay flower you	Success
Stability and heat sensitivity of myrosinase enzyme in cruciferous vegetables | Jed Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLpXGh3Dip8	FoundMyFitness Clips 	you made a really important point for people and that is that the Meyerson is enzyme is heat sensitive and as you pointed out most people like to cook their caliphs lower and broccoli or slightly steamed it and their trade off for that is maybe it tastes a little better but also it inactivates the myrosinase ends brew so they actually getting as much so for a fame from the glue carafe and as they would if they were to just chew on that raw broccoli yep but but what about the the myrosinase enzyme is the stability the same throughout all the cruciferous family so like if you look at the broccoli sprouts versus the mature broccoli or you know is their kale so myrosinase appears to be about as stable throughout the family there are difference there the to the protein composition of myrosinase and different cruciferous vegetables to be sure subtle enough so that I can mean they they they certainly must confer increased or decreased stability or catalytic ability on those on those molecules interestingly if you don you ingest glucoraphanin or glucosinolates without myrosinase at all you then can count on the bacteria in your gut I mean your intestines primarily to do that to make that conversion and you know sometimes scientists think they we we just - back up back up just a little bit we observed that when you deliver just glucoraphanin to people just give them one dose one reasonable amount that which they would get in a serving of broccoli and then we collected their urine for 24 hours we asked them to collect their urine for 24 hours so you get a full 24 hour collection which pretty much spans the period during which the enzyme myrosinase acts sulforaphane goes into cells gets recognized turns on nrf2 get spit back out and then gets excreted in the urine so by collecting a 24-hour urine we can pretty much we can get a very good idea of how much bioavailability there is how much metabolism and availability and it turns out that if we looked at a hundred different people and we did after giving them one dose of glucoraphanin their bioavailability the amount they gave back to us in their urine was all over the map it ranged from very very little but always something to 40 or 50 or even 60 or 70 percent of what we gave them but the mean was pretty low was about 10 percent so most people converted and metabolized and excreted only about 10% of what they were given so when you give sulforaphane itself the end product the active ingredient if you will we get more like 70 75 80 % bioavailability still a bit of variability person-to-person but since we appeared to be not as great and well it was not as great in terms of a percent of the whole so that little convoluted but essentially most sulforaphane came back at us in the urine and was available so in our infinite wisdom we thought if we do if we co deliver myrosinase if we give these people active myrosinase in addition to glucan they to give back 70 to 90 percent of the metabolites and we variability person-to-person didn happen that way really really it didn happen that way what did what did happen is that we moved the bar up so that instead of 10 percent bioavailability or 70 percent we had about 35 or 40 percent so the average moved up substantially it was about 3 times 3 or 4 times more but there was still quite large person-to-person variability and you know so we have to sort of step back a little bit and say yes this is this is due to intrinsic myrosinase activity in the gut because certainly we hadn that was still acting on these molecules but also just innate mammalian genetics differences between you and me and the way we process these metabolites once once they absorption differences in distribution and metabolism those a lot we still don don sort of cocky thinking that we could we could abolish this variability and at least have a very predictable amount delivered to people we did learn that we can greatly increase bioavailability by delivering it with myrosinase and in fact there are now companies that are selling glue carafe and in plus myrosinase you have to be careful if you buy those supplements because it given that they as you know multivitamins and things that you can just leave on the shelf for years and and so so you need to pay attention to the expiration dates on those products that have live active enzyme you	Success
Seeds of cruciferous plants contain the highest levels of isothiocyanate precursors | Jed Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8GJhzYeHC4	FoundMyFitness Clips 	you know when I give lectures to students I frequently makes the point out to them how they carafe and and to sulforaphane conversion so I webinar when you chew an hour on a red radish you that the first sensation is cool and crunchy and then within 20-30 seconds you develop heat you start tearing your nose starts running it has a lack remaining effect so what you you insect that I told you lands on the leaf of a broccoli plant you crunching on the radish you you very similar to gluco rafen and it actually called glue carafe anine in radishes it happens to be more of a lacquer mater it inducing effect in people and you letting myrosinase in those radish tissues act on glucoraphanin and form sulfur afine and some other related isothiocyanates that for that category so it happens that fast when you chew on fresh vegetables that contain the system this will for afine also activate nrf2 it does but to a lesser degree in sulforaphane so many of these isothiocyanates also inactivate nrf2 but not to the same degree i sold for fame they do and just in case you about to ask me you you find this system it oil bomb by some twenty or thirty years ago you find this system in almost exclusively in cruciferous vegetables or braska vegetables or coal crops they sometimes called depending upon where you come from where you hail from in Eastern Europe they typically call them coal crops so this happens to be a very large family of I don many many thousands of species yeah I know like maybe ten of them well we know maybe twenty but I mean they many of them and they grow worldwide although the Brassica or the coal crops that were familiar with in the United States are all temperate climate crops they they they there winter or freeze in the winter I wanted to ask you something because you mentioned it really piqued my attention as you said that broccoli seeds actually had higher amount of clicker often than the sprout is it if if I were to say take those broccoli because I sprout if I ever take those broccoli seeds add a little water and blend them in a blender would that activate myrosinase within the seed the crushing of the seed you bet it so I could actually get a higher more potent amount of sulfur faint theoretically if I were to just take the seeds and because yes routing oh that true so interestingly you know when when we discovered that and this was this was published in 1997 so it history it born right so when we discovered that broccoli sprouts and seeds were such a potent source of sulforaphane or its precursor we weren had eaten broccoli seeds people he you know all sorts of seeds poppy seeds and rapeseed or canola seed in fact are used to express oil and they relative but but no one had eaten broccoli seeds and when we tried them you know they but interestingly if you if you bake them just gently don you bake them they get their very nutty taste and they pleasant tasting the problem is if you bake them you kill the enzyme you kill myrosinase right so that right yeah so so you there actually have been some epidemiologic studies and I off topic a bit but some epidemiologic studies suggesting that people who eat certain amounts of cruciferous vegetables have reduced risks of various cancers breast cancer and lung cancer are high on the list of cancers that have been studied excuse me and it turns out that if you eat raw cruciferous vegetables you again based on the epidemiology this isn interventions of randomized clinical trials for example but it looks like the protective effect is greater if you eat raw vegetables but now a lot of people don cauliflower or broccoli or well radishes they do but so at any rate um you asked about the content in broccoli seeds and indeed they have much more self much more glue carafe Ihnen and they have plenty of active myrosinase but I have a feeling I broccoli from raw broccoli seeds I haven let you know because I thought you might you	Success
What is the optimal source and dose of sulforaphane? | Jed Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNmjfTQRK2g	FoundMyFitness Clips 	the first question is what is the minimum daily dose of sulforaphane that has shown that has been shown to provide health benefits how much sulforaphane does a 200 gram serving of broccoli or broccoli sprouts contain yeah so you know i i i have to preface the these my launching into the answer system these questions by saying yeah i you went through the the extensive and wonderful questions many of them as did i uh a number of days ago um this is a kind of question that comes up all the time and um to those of you who are non-scientists um i tend to talk all we we scientists and certainly chemists and biochemists tend to talk in micro moles so if you look at any of our papers we talk micro moles i give you an answer that into milligrams but this is of course complex and something that play and is still being researched by many people so it all depends on the amount of glucoraphanin the precursor of sulforaphane that is in broccoli or sprouts i avoid a long diatribe on glucoraphanin and myrosinase and sulforaphane because i have the feeling that if you or gone to our podcast the podcast that she and i did together or some of her subsequent podcasts most people know about the fact that glucoraphanin is a precursor found in the plants myrosinase is an enzyme found in the plants and in your body your microbiome and they react and they form sulforaphane so i think that have the enzyme in our gut meaning we are meant to get the precursor to convert it into sulforaphane we contain the enzyme in our gut i just love that anyways go ahead so absolutely all of us do and i mean that all however many hundred of you there are in this call all have myrosinase containing bacteria in your gut unless you antibiotics and had a you know an enema and just cleaned out your intestinal system then maybe you don done these sorts of experiments actually with with real people so there are two ways of doing this of hydrolyzing the glucoraphanin that present in broccoli one is when you chew it you release the enzyme from the broccoli tissue or broccoli sprouts or broccoli seeds and the second way is from your micro microbiome and if you take supplements you or there are now supplements with a combination of glucoraphanin and myrosinase and they with just sulforaphane and we that later i we have to so the question was about the dose um and if you the best the best advice that we can give that i can give now is that all the clinical studies seem to be pointing towards a dose of something between about 50 and 100 micromoles of sulforaphane a day um i discussed that a little bit in the sprouting pdf that um rhonda has just put out um but the question that was originally posted talks about 200 gram so let the question a 200 gram serving of broccoli that people i think that serving of broccoli market stage broccoli however broccoli for broccoli sprouts that that i not enjoy cramming down 200 grams of broccoli sprouts so i on a hundred grams of either broccoli or sprouts and based on the amount of glucoraphanin that in them and our knowledge of conversion and yield you might get about anywhere between four milligrams of glucoraphanin to 100 150 from 100 grams of broccoli and that would yield about anywhere from about half a half a milligram to something like 18 milligrams of sulforaphane that why is there a huge range there range because a all of the broccoli is different it treated in the store the way it the genetics of the broccoli and secondly all of you are different and your gut microbiomes are going to yield different amounts of sulforaphane so there and with broccoli sprouts 100 grams would give you somewhere between i don milligrams and three 350 um sorry between about five or six milligrams and about 60 milligrams of sulforaphane so there these are just rough approximations cooking destroys myrosinase so if you cooking broccoli or broccoli sprouts then you bacteria in your gut i mentioned the the person to person variation there you there sulforaphane or glucoraphanin is in broccoli or broccoli sprouts because you have to get them tested in a lab and there are no commercial labs that do these tests routinely so this is still a problem um and you know you i mentioned this in the pdf that rhonda um unfortunately you as a consumer are you know even if you spend say ten dollars on broccoli seeds and sprout them yourself it would cost you 150 dollars to send one sample of those broccoli seeds out to a commercial lab to get them tested to see if they not so uh as i you know i don abide by them or try to but so unfortunately as it stands now it getting so we just have to work we just have to talk in in terms of rough rough averages and and when paul talley and i did our first publication on broccoli sprouts you know our our point was that a serving of say something like a couple of ounces 60 grams or so of broccoli sprouts gave you as much glucoraphanin as um you know a quarter of a pound or a half a pound of market stage broccoli and so these are all quantities one final word just that that the quantity of glucoraphanin and sulforaphane you get from broccoli sprouts from a couple of ounces we think is a reasonable amount to put you in a zone where you protective

How does one identify a good source of broccoli seeds? | Jed Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtJZmS_CeB4	FoundMyFitness Clips 	one of the questions that popped up um as you were talking about variation in the glucorafnic content and see broccoli seeds do you have a preferred seed vendor um for broccoli sprout seeds yeah that i don anymore so when we were doing experiments in the lab we we for a long time bought them from johnny and um they they were a source of organic broccoli seeds and and we had tested some when paul talalay first hired me in 1993 um he had gotten some seeds from them and we tested them and they were high in glucoraphanin we worked with i worked with a plant a broccoli breeder who was a usda scientist for many years and we did a variety of crossing and and we the potency of of broccoli genotypes and yeah we developed some germplasm that was good that was high in glucoraphanin um more importantly i guess i should say that the company that we founded um does uh breed and make their own broccoli seeds and this is obviously a big venture and they they um test their seeds all the time so the very practical answer is when i want broccoli seeds i ask them for some freebies and they give them to me and i ca and i way um but it seeds and um there are you know many companies now that sell seeds for sprouting but i i don them that certify the the level of glucoraphanin in those seeds so again it the consumer to know what they getting um and i i hope that we get to a place very soon where the expectation is driven by consumers maybe that you know a company that sell seeds for sprouting characterizes the glucoraphanin level that would be easy for them to do it it cost them 100 200 to do the test right you	Success
Is sulforaphane present in all cruciferous vegetables? | Jed Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OdZgvEKKrw	FoundMyFitness Clips 	i saw a question um a couple days ago on on the site um from lucy and she said um something the effect of does broccoli rob contain sulforaphane um and lucy that you um and the answer is no it doesn broccoli rob is actually related to broccoli but interestingly it closely related even as cauliflower or cabbage are to broccoli and broccoli rob does not have a significant amount of glucoraphanin or sulforaphane but this is this is an opportunity for me to to stamp my foot down and say look a lot of people in the lay public especially are under the impression that all cruciferous vegetables have sulforaphane or glucoraphanin they do not so if you eat any cruciferous vegetables you getting isothiocyanates which are all closely related to each other they all closely related to sulforaphane but for example cabbage has essentially none it other isothiocyanates that are good for you many of them cauliflower has essentially none kale doesn great extent except as i recall there red russian kale that does have a substantial amount so be careful thinking that all well all cruciferous vegetables are good for you i think that but be careful assuming that all cruciferous vegetables contain sulforaphane because they don you	Success
Sulforaphane increases detoxification of air pollutants | Jed Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD2m-2FRjus	FoundMyFitness Clips 	the next question was if i can how beneficial is it to consume them only after exposure to heavy air pollutants as a firefighter i am exposed to a lot of carcinogens during a fire and i only take them post-fire calls and for how many days yeah another great question and and uh to the firefighter that asked that uh thank you for your service um it out west that so my best guess is that taking them regularly or taking a supplement in order to prime your system and get your antioxidant and detoxification system ready for the regular assaults that you on on on your your body um it would probably be wise um i i think this is a case where you should remember that you you if we or toxins or or oxide oxidant chemicals you never really know when you attacked by those those vicious chemicals and i i there chemicals in smoke from certainly from home fires and even from uh wildfires so there look at the analogy to wearing seat belts uh you know you why you wear a seat belt not because you plan on um getting in an accident but but it think you could make a similar argument if you know you blasting your lungs and your body with the components of smoke you can make an argument that priming your system to get that response uh maximally uh geared up would be a good thing one thing we do know from our work in china with with a study of air pollution and the effects of sulforaphane on that is that you don and this is fortunate but you don fatigue this the biochemical response system so we gave for 12 weeks we gave daily glucoraphanin and sulforaphane and monitored the upregulation of the this protective response um and did not really see any fatiguing of the of the the response of that system so short answer then is uh to the firefighter is yeah i think taking a supplement regularly would be obviously you broccoli sprouts when you fire calls but um so probably supplements in in your case would be a good you know good thing i physician i you but that if i i just could comment as well um your 12-week study was um extremely relevant to not only firefighters but you know people particularly on the west coast in california and you know oregon you know people that are being exposed to wildfires that are breathing in acrolein which is heavily in in smoke and benzene but you know and and your study showed that within 24 hours benzene excretion was excreted by 60 and acrolein study was increased uh actual aqualine excretion was increased by 20 about 23 percent and um so i guess also the question is let you know the firefighter or whoever isn know even within a few days of knowing they whatever do you think that would even be beneficial because i mean it literally wasn hours you yeah yeah so i do i i mean these these obviously there the time you ingest the glucoraphanin or sulforaphane and the time the enzymes are are upregulated or respond it even after a couple of hours some of those enzymes are cranking up um so the answer your question is yes and you know the main the main um sort of situation where i think um you know you might almost have to have it on board before an event is some of the neuronal injury models like when we talk about traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury there is an absolutely pronounced effect of sulforaphane that we we have seen in a variety of studies we and others when i say we i always mean we and other people or maybe maybe i wasn study in this case but we see an effect obviously if if you have that sort of injury and you the rapid response of sulforaphane it would be ideal to have had it on board your body beforehand but one of the things that appears evident is that with neuronal injury even getting it right after the injury may have some value so but with a fire the fire analogy or the fire situation absolutely we showed that the response was upregulated quickly and it was maintained and as you say detoxication of two out of the three major pollutants that we looked at um uh happened uh to a to a substantial degree and i should mention this was work that my colleague tom kensler started a long time ago in china and and um we joined in that work in the i guess in about 2001 and so we many years now and the final studies there are going to be published soon i hope amazing just amazing work i love those studies and the fact that the 12 weeks there was no exhausting of the the up regulation of these important detoxification enzymes um that were maintained within that whole 12 week it wasn it was a short-term effect that went away um also it as we a couple of minutes about um a lot of the pre-clinical studies on the effects of sulforaphane in alzheimer disease um there onslaught of new research that has shown air pollution is contributing to neurodegenerative diseases starting in early life so there was a study in mexico city where air pollution is terrible and children so they post-mortem um you know studies looking in the brain of unfortunately infants and children and young adolescents that have um that have died for whatever reason and they have uh amyloid beta plaques in their brain as early as infancy and other you know pathological changes in the brain going on early early in life which is really unfortunate so i think that the the the possibility of something like moringa or sulforaphane or black sprouts you know to to help with excreting these you know toxic compounds and even in other potential ways improving brain health is really exciting so um you	Success
How long do the health effects of broccoli sprouts last? | Jed Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv3otrV9LiM	FoundMyFitness Clips 	with that i next question which was how long do the health benefits of broccoli sprouts last would consuming them every day be better than every other day or once a week um this is just this is an easy question for me to answer but it but it it white um we think that consumption every two or three days is fine because what you it having a direct antioxidant effect and you use up the vitamin c and it you and they last enzymes or proteins and you know they do work in the body and eventually they wear out and break down and get catabolized and and turned into their component amino acids and then they get remade we know that the elevation of these enzymes lasts for at least hours and certainly in most cases days a few days probably some benefits might be short-lived um you know if when you talk about habits though people diet and with supplements uh if you better to just do it daily if you eating broccoli sprouts um it eat them today and i don going to get bored eating the same thing every day but um yeah every couple of days should be fine i think two or three days i know that the animal studies have shown that the nrf2 protective pathways activated for at least two days um have you looked at any clinical samples uh human human samples is it to see if it similar or yeah yeah so what you were referring to clinical studies when you were referring to any hours to days i we in clinical studies also i mean part of the problem with clinical studies is that you have to pick sometimes unless you have someone in the hospital in a hospital or in an inpatient setting have an indwelling catheter of some kind in them and are constantly taking blood or having them deliver their urine to you all of it on you know for days on end which most people don they when we do clinical studies in an effort to you know sort of have moderate inconvenience for the subject and and reduce the cost of it to a manageable level we wind up picking times to take blood and to look at elevation of those enzymes and frequently it dosing um and so you know we know that a day after taking um sulforaphane we see these enzymes elevated and um and and also i can uh two or three days has been a time point that that we specifically but um but others have i think in the clinic you	Success
Sulforaphane promotes detoxification of heavy metals | Jed Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZiy7O-h2rg	FoundMyFitness Clips 	there krista bluff is there any research around toxic metals and increased detoxification with sulforaphane so we mentioned some of these carcinogens but has there been any evidence on males there i dig those papers out uh for you krista um because i familiar with them and we we haven you mentioned so the answer is yes and uh i find you those those references um but that brings up the question of pesticides and other toxins you know we we have talked about air pollutants and we states and protection against cancer and so on and so forth but others a number of years ago especially have looked at things like um paraquat toxicity um and uh there are a number of other pesticides i can at the moment remember which ones they are right rotenone i think is one yeah people have looked at the ability of sulforaphane to um detoxify them or to enhance the elimination of them so and certainly we done my colleague tom kensler and and that whole team has i mean they started out in china in these china studies looking at aflatoxin which is different than metals and it different than pesticides but it is a potent toxin and carcinogen that is actually present in peanuts and corn in the part of china where we were working and clearly and this is this is sort of a model for the metal and the pesticide detoxification clearly aflatoxin is converted to a derivative bound to compounds which um allow it to be more readily excreted in the urine so um this is something that uh is this this is what we call detoxication or detoxification um and and indeed it um because so this is probably involved in a subsequent question but a lot of this is because of the up regulation of glutathione glutathione is the body most um most predominant detoxification mechanism is present at very high levels in in things like the macula of the eye the back of the eye the retina and it is it of only three amino acids and it is a very potent antioxidant that is endogenous it body but what sulforaphane does is it cranks up the enzymes that are responsible for synthesizing or re-synthesizing glutathione and so it makes more glutathione available and once glutathione is sacrificed and oxidized it remakes it and so that question all my answers are long ways of answering simple questions i guess but that where sulforaphane comes into that detoxification pathway one of one of many ways but it probably one of the most important ways yeah we are going to talk a little bit more about glutathione on another question but i just want to ask you um is that is specifically the you know there has been clinical studies that it increased increases glutathione in the plasma and in the brain i don clinical studies went but you as you were saying previously with the air pollution studies that you had been collaborated with um in your colleagues in china um the the the activation of the nrf2 system did not stop as long as you were continually taking the broccoli sprout extract right so the glutathione levels would keep going up if you were it that just goes away over time right well they won won to you know forever i mean they keep continuing right exactly yeah so if you if you insult your body with a toxin that is detoxified by glutathione um yes there levels what actually happens is the reduced form of glutathione turns into the oxidized form um and then the reduced form glutathione is regenerated so that cycling happens more efficiently and indeed the levels overall levels of glutathione are somewhat elevated you	Success
Sulforaphane increases glutathione in the brain | Jed Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9VdcWHZhfE	FoundMyFitness Clips 	on the kevin rose podcast uh rhonda patrick mentioned that broccoli sprouts increase the production of glutathione in the brain so i was wondering what your thoughts are on continuous supplementation if taken long term would the brain stop producing it naturally so for people for reference that aren familiar the the clinical study that i referred to on kevin the kevin rose show uh was in 2018 and published in 2018 and they found that about 17.7 milligrams of sulforaphane per day for one week increased blood glutathione levels and this correlated with an increased glutathione in certain brain regions um and these were unhealthy people so uh you know as judd mentioned glutathione is one of the main body antioxidant system so um i guess you kind of answered that already but maybe you want to if there any concluding thoughts you want to give yeah yeah so i kind of did answer that um just now and and actually i think i was a co-author of that study you referring to the um if it that that they did they did the heavy work uh on the study i didn healthy people they they showed what you said and um so i think um there stop producing glutathione naturally there and glutathione production what about during age aging process it declines it declines naturally with age and in fact starting as early as in your 20s so rhonda you already uh i you know supplementing with sulforaphane i think apparently helps to restore glutathione back to normal or young healthy levels and i think some animal studies um by that same group have shown the brain i mean that how how freaking cool is that i mean i seen studies i i was just i just it was a small clinical study you know but i was just blown away that you you guys showed that it increased levels in the brain so um i think it is pretty freaking cool and and and i think i think also the the the study that you related study by uh sadlek and saw and and others in radiology at hopkins um showed that they also showed in p in people um they were able to show um to to localize that that enhanced um glutathione by functional mri um or or uh yeah so so i mean the imaging um just is sort of it cake it going to see i hope we lot more functional mri type studies where people say yeah yeah yeah i see this and that in the blood i see this and that in the urine um you know i see conversion i see these whether it see these effects in blood but we don blood except as an index or a marker what we care about is is it doing something in the brain or the muscles or you know whatever and so these now with higher resolution mri um people are able to show these changes and it it reborn and rebranded as a scientist um i i but i way past that but i think i to be a functional mri person because that forward you	Success
What are sulforaphane's effects on cancer? | Jed Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aN2zAOy9i2U	FoundMyFitness Clips 	let was related to cancer the question was are there any studies that that you know of that would suggest broccoli sprouts would be beneficial for a person who has already been diagnosed with cancer if so which cancers yeah um so i caution here i physician and i don advice um i i would in that instance i would certainly eat a vegetable based diet a whole food vegetable based diet um there are certainly clinical studies suggesting that there may be cancer therapeutic effects um but those studies are all in progress and i i don there is not scientific consensus that um sulforaphane is a cancer therapy or therapeutic certainly um so it will be irresponsible to suggest that my bias is that i certainly think that it is valuable in a cancer preventive lifestyle trying to prevent cancers from starting so if you especially if it it may actually not be wise to take sulforaphane or to supplement or to to go heavy on on broccoli um we just honestly we just don enough we do know that upregulating nrf2 protects protects cells and when you think about it metastasized cancers what growing faster than the rest of the cells around them the rest of the rest of the body for that matter if you adult they the products of respiration and oxidation their mitochondria are cranking away so if you support their mitochondria and enhance their ability that enhance their ability to detoxify things including including perhaps cancer drugs um this may be a slippery slope we just don are some animal model studies in which nrf2 is is genetically upregulated or knocked out and i think those studies the results of those studies suggest that caution is is advised um in cases where people have been diagnosed with cancer um hopefully a lot more to come on that from studies that are underway and in progress in various parts of the world and just to add on as a comment you know speaking to prevention i know there preclinical evidence that really excited me was um there was a rat study and i forget the group that um published a study but the rats were given sulforaphane they were given it before they were given a chemical that causes bladder cancer and the other group of rats were just given the chemical that causes bladder cancer and the rats that were given the dose of the sulforaphane um did not develop bladder cancer and one and if they did the tumors were much much smaller in size so again a preventative you know just more evidence that the preventative approach um seems to be stronger there um it seems as though and you this uh jed about you know the the the tissues that sulforaphane may accumulate in more you know the the bladder prostate breast uh versus other tissues or lungs you know i don all the differences um but the prostate seems to be one that at least clinically there a few studies showing that sulforaphane ranging in dose and the higher the dose the more robust the effect so 60 milligrams of sulforaphane a day was shown to slow the the biomarker prostate specific antigen or psa which people with you know early prostate cancer you know or risk of it or whatever have um and so slowing that by 86 is certainly you know a good thing um yeah so so as a follow-up um shame on you i think that first bladder cancer study you were talking about is also one that i was involved in whereas the beginning of the call i said i because you much every study that i cite almost jed fahey dr jennifer he is an author on so i it keep track of all your publications ted mostly a a minor player so in this case a minor player uh uh a group in new zealand rex monday and uh old old colleague actually the the guy uh who with paul tell they put sulforaphane on the map and i um did this did one of the one of the rat studies i think maybe the one you um with bladder cancer and absolutely this was uh this was benzoyl isothiocyanate as i recall that we used her or or sinogram um allyl isothiocyanate um which come from radish or daikon um or mustard seed so it think about what happens with sulforaphane which most of you i don probably too much to my detriment but what happened you ingest it you take it in the body sees it your cells of your body see it um they actually take it in very rapidly they conjugate it with glutathione they spit it back out then where does it go it goes from the blood to the urine then where does the urine go unless you most of us that are reasonably healthy aren uh although i before so your bladder stores urine up what in that urine sulforaphane and its conjugates well what is bladder cancer bladder cancer is the epithelial cells of the bladder that most most of them the tissue lining that bladder um muta you know a mutation forming and ultimately a tumor developing so bladder cancer we i still think is the ultimate target for isothiocyanates because you protective compounds um essentially all the time you know you empty your bladder and immediately it starts filling back up again certainly the prostate cancer is is another example where mechanistically uh or i should say evidentiarily we have there the cause and effect is a little harder to see but the bladder cancer model is just just beautiful you	Success

Potential benefits of sulforaphane for Alzheimer's disease | Jed Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EeyGKTmeRY	FoundMyFitness Clips 	what are your thoughts if any on the potential on the potential benefits of sulforaphane or even other isothiocyanate activators of nrf2 for alzheimer there evidence that amyloid beta you know is decreased and that you know isothiocyanates and sulforaphane seem to have a positive effect on alzheimer yeah so this is a case where uh i i need to give dr patrick of of papers there literature that you know would be fun to post links to from animal models and and cell culture work let me start actually i just found this or i just uh rediscovered this this morning let me start by citing a clinical study and then go back to some of the um to some of the animal studies work so as all of you know animals mostly rats and mice are used to spare having to do some of these experiments on people and so what usually happens what frequently happens maybe covet 19 is going to be an exception but what frequently happens is you have cell culture work you have or in vitro work where you add chemicals to cultured human cells or animal cells in a petri plate you get positive effects or not then you move to trials where you like it or not sacrifice mice to the cause of science and you and if you model of a disease um you get some results and then maybe you safety and then you go to a full-fledged clinical study to look at efficacy so a lot of animal studies i to a few citations but there is one now there china in um uh shang university um and it will be looking at 160 uh 160 subjects with early alzheimer and they sulforaphane it was posted for start date of sometime in may of 2020. i doubt that covid most clinical trials are on pause um i do want to make so you can find this on clinicaltrials.gov that the us-approved clinical trials and many around the world you can find it and read about it yourself if you do that be careful because you know i think this may well be a good and interesting study but when you look at what they they sulforaphane and they say they milligrams once a day and half of the people are getting placebo i won is enough to kill a horse um and so that 10 and 100 closer to 100 times what i would recommend giving to a person so my only guess is that they about the weight 2.5 grams or 2500 milligrams of a supplement tablet and there website that lets us know what they actually giving patients or how much sulforaphane they actually be getting but it uh you know it it may may well be a very interesting study so we should keep our eyes on it but to go back to the um to the animal work um with a former doctoral student anita panchwani we did a review a couple of years ago looking at actually all of the neurodegenerative diseases like parkinson alzheimer and the neurodevelopmental diseases like autism and looking at the evidence for sulforaphane and it like hdac inhibition histone diocetyl sorry inhibition enhancement of bdnf brain derived neurotropic factor certainly uh reduction in um amyloid beta um and um the list the list really goes on and on the things that other people have done i have not been directly involved in that um then there are a couple of reviews from even more recently from last year which i talking about for example uh sulforaphane protecting cultured neural cells from the toxicity of methylglyoxal which is a precursor of ages or advanced glycation end products that are very clearly associated with alzheimer models that show reduced neuronal cell death due to amyloid beta exposure due to activation of peroxisomes these are things that that help detoxify so it the reviews the review articles have pages and pages of evidence so i will share some of that with rhonda but it 10 years ago we were paul talley and i were invited to work with a group in the netherlands that was going to be a big multi-center alzheimer using sulforaphane 10 years ago 2011. um it was a multi-million dollar trial funding never had i don funding started and stopped but it never actually happened and i follow-up studies as i say i just found this study in china that is being conducted i should say by some researchers who have done some some good animal model work and published a bit before a lot before so i have high hopes for the china study but we you	Success

Two-decade phytochemical expert Dr. Jed Fahey responds to carnivore doctorÂs rant | Jed Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWePe_erOTM	FoundMyFitness Clips 	you mentioned and then certainly in this clip they talked about the carnivore lifestyle i actually made notes of a number of things i or comment on in terms of that part of the little clip i watched if if we have time for me to say a few things about it like well let the the the effects that were that have been said by saladino and others um about sulforaphane being goitrogenic in other words having a negative effect on the thyroid um i have some comments there but can you go ahead and speak to that is sulforaphane no it itself but yeah i said a certain isothiocyanate if you want yeah so so it and nor are broccoli sprouts when eaten in moderation nor are glucoraphanin rich supplements um mature broccoli i mean this is a this is this is a long story but mature broccoli broccoli produces different glucosinolates in different phases of its lifestyle and market stage broccoli or heads of broccoli florets do have things called indole glucosinolates when they are acted on by myrosinase they can form they form unstable intermediates and they can form compounds which can be toxic or goitrogenic and maybe even promote certain cancers depending upon if they before or after a person gets exposed to the carcinogen there based on animal studies on that and i think the jury is still out on the beneficial effects of eating of those compounds but the byproducts of indole glucosinolate metabolism are among others are things called indole-3-carbinol and diendolyl it another uh another discussion um but in but i want to bring it back to broccoli sprouts and sulforaphane and so we did this 12-week study in china that i told you about um well uh collaborators i i author of this co-author of this most recent study but they took some of the they took the blood samples from this 12-week study where we gave them sulforaphane from broccoli sprouts and looked at indicators of thyroid thyroid status hormone status and autoimmune status and found absolutely no negative effects on thyroid function so that ingestion of sulforaphane that that thyroid specific potential side effects but this is the first author chartoon pecos and it was 2019 and um you know this is this is someone whose specialty is thyroid uh thyroid function he quietly on it and there was no effect so um yeah yeah that was a great study i mean three months is a long time and you certainly would think that after three months of taking continuous broccoli sprout extract every day if there was going to be a negative effect on the thyroid you would see it after three months moreover in 2018 there was a very long term animal study in rats where there were two groups of rats there were some rats that were that had hypothyroidism drug-induced hypothyroidism um and then there was uh an iodine deficient group of rats and they were they were given broccoli sprouts uh freeze-dried or whatever you know broccoli sprout extract and not only was there no harmful effect on the thyroid even in iodine deficient animals um in terms of their high thyroid homeostasis so their th their their thyroid stimulating hormone their t34 were all the same in the animals they rats that had hypothyroidism there was a beneficial effect from the broccoli sprouts in the thyroid gland an antioxidant effect that was beneficial so to say that it gonna have negative effects on the on on the thyroid it funny because you you see this sort of echo chamber uh meme going around uh particularly in groups that are anti-plant um and they just have it all wrong a complete lack of understanding and and not even looking at actual good data so you know well you know interestingly um this persists in the medical community too so in in one of our studies the the autism study that we published in 2014 the there were questions from the irb which is made up of among other things physicians about the potential for thyroid thyroid issues and were we going to monitor thyroid chemistry and and we did and we had went through the same explanation sort of that i just did with you um and so in that study after the 12-week 12-week study with a follow-up um or 16-week i guess i have to review my own papers but um daily consumption this was with autistic kids not perfectly nor healthy subjects but um there were there were we followed thyroid chemistry and as i recall there were a couple of times when thyroid function was flagged uh and they wound up being in in placebos uh those that are getting placebo so um yeah i mean it keeps on coming up but with market stage broccoli it valid question to ask can you get too much market sage broccoli perhaps yeah yeah but um and there are areas where um goiter is endemic and those people eat a hell of a lot of cabbage right there also are certain things like arsenic in the soils there so the cabbage right exactly i mean there a lot of confounding factors and cabbage is not broccoli sprouts like i mentioned there glucoraphanin in cabbage so uh the the other question also was related to saladino and the question was how do you respond to paul saladino joe rogan sulforaphane outweigh the benefits okay are we do we have from now till close till 11 30 yeah we minutes okay so i have i made a short little list of nine points um i don want to go through them in detail but let me let me just sort of tick them off i guess so um i think on multiple levels it bad advice uh to the the carnivore lifestyle uh is bad advice human beings didn carnivores we we eat a variety um vegetable and and meat um and you know this is this is a product of evolution you can look at tooth and mouth and jaw structure and all sorts of other anatomical things it evolve to be carnivores and i think a self-anointed fitness and or nutrition guru is not going to change the course of human evolution in a generation and you know i call them sensationalist claims or not but the bottom line is there is there certain dogma scientific dogma and evolution our evolution as human beings um is something that they be able to rewrite um uh so anyway there peers so this is i you and i agreed we weren going to talk politics on this but this is i feel like a politician that was first point second point there abundance of peer-reviewed scientific literature showing diet rich in fruits and vegetables and especially cruciferous vegetables are good i long-term studies supporting carnivorous lifestyle uh or the carnivore approach for humans three the risks to eating everything um and certainly for you know varieties the spice of life certainly uh eating broccoli sprouts only to the exclusion of everything else would be terrible for you um so but that advocating um uh point four uh studies of phytochemicals in isolation and in fight in um uh food matrices and in limited combinations with other phytochemicals vitamins minerals etc show almost without exception that yes some things are frank toxins think about nicotine um they level and the toxicity goes up most most many phytochemicals not most but many phytochemicals have a u-shaped effect curve hormesis or a hormetic effect so spanning from no effect at very low concentrations to perhaps benefit or satisfying a requirement to harm or toxicity at the highest level um you know everything level water is sugar is salt is and sulforaphane is um so i think the evidence is overwhelming though that that eating a lot of broccoli or broccoli sprouts is not is is not harmful for you um there extensive evidence of all sorts of pathways that are upregulated protective pathways it documented in the literature and the subject of many clinical studies now good clinical studies and some bad ones number six long-term consumption of sulforaphane-rich broccoli sprout beverages we to have negative effects including on thyroid function number seven let me look at my notes um yeah okay um meat only diets think about it do you get a lot of fiber from a meat only diet duh no um what about fiber and colon cancer do you get a lot of vitamin c from a meat only diet no um think about scurvy do you get too much iron on a meat only diet and therefore more oxidative stress or at least unless you eating only grass-fed meats yeah are is a meat only diet pro-inflammatory well maybe so there are a lot of negatives that i not the world claiming to be but i think on balance they speak to extreme caution and endorsing that sort of lifestyle um and then i just finally one of your one of your members one of your listeners made a comment which i and i agree with it and and it there and you said dr saladino made claims that are many claims that are not backed up by most of the scientific community or gold standard peer-reviewed studies while someday some of his claims may be proven correct he seems to have cur currently have very flimsy evidence there are no long-lived cultures that live on a predominantly meat-based diet um true i think end of story and we actually have time for some other questions so that would be great so we could talk more about it but i i think i think the point you and me that this is not something that uh people ought to flock to you	Success
\"Carnivore doctorsÂ are misrepresenting the goitrogenic activity of sulforaphane | Jed Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fToeHgoL_II	FoundMyFitness Clips 	you mentioned and then certainly in this clip they talked about the carnivore lifestyle i actually made notes of a number of things i rebut or or comment on in terms of that part of the little clip i watched if if we have time for me to say a few things about it like well let the the the the effects that were that have been said by saladino and others um about sulforaphane being goitrogenic in other words having a negative effect on the thyroid um i have some comments there but can you go ahead and speak to that is sulforaphane no it itself but yeah i said a certain isothiocyanate if you wanted yeah so so it broccoli sprouts when eaten in moderation nor are glucoraph and rich supplements um mature broccoli i mean this is a this is this is a long story but mature broccoli broccoli produces different glucosinolates in different phases of its lifestyle and market stage broccoli or heads of broccoli florets do have things called indole glucosinolates when they are acted on by myrosinase they can form they form unstable intermediates and they can form compounds which can be toxic or goitrogenic and maybe even promote certain cancers depending upon if they before or after a person gets exposed to the carcinogen there based on animal studies on that and i think the jury is still out on the beneficial effects of eating of those compounds but the byproducts of indole glucosinolate metabolism are among others are things called indole-3-carbinol and diendolyl it another uh another discussion um but in but i want to bring it back to broccoli sprouts and sulforaphane and so we did this 12-week study in china that i told you about um well collaborators i i author of this co-author of this most recent study but they took some of the they took the blood samples from this 12-week study where we gave them sulforaphane from broccoli sprouts and looked at indicators of thyroid thyroid status hormone status and autoimmune status and found absolutely no negative effects on thyroid function so that of continuous ingestion of sulforaphane that that thyroid specific potential side effects but this is the first author chartoon pakis and it was 2019 and um you know this is this is someone whose specialty is thyroid uh thyroid function he quietly on it and there was no effect so um yeah yeah that was a great study i mean three months is a long time and you certainly would think that after three months of taking continuous broccoli sprout extract every day if there was going to be a negative effect on the thyroid you would see it after three months um moreover that in 2018 there was a very long-term animal study in rats where there were two groups of rats there were some rats that were that had hypothyroidism drug induced hypothyroidism um and then there was a an iodine deficient group of rats and they were they were given broccoli sprouts uh freeze dried or whatever you know broccoli sprout extract and not only was there no harmful effect on the thyroid even in iodine deficient animals um in terms of their high thyroid homeostasis so their th their their thyroid stimulating hormone their t34 were all the same in the animals they rats that had hypothyroidism there was a beneficial effect from the broccoli sprouts in the thyroid gland an antioxidant effect that was beneficial so to say that it gonna have negative effects on the on the on the thyroid it quite funny because you see this sort of echo chamber uh meme going around uh particularly in groups that are anti-plant um and they just have it all wrong a complete lack of understanding and and not even looking at actual good data so yeah well you know it interestingly um this persists in the medical community too so in in one of our studies the the autism study that we published in 2014 the there were questions from the irb which is made up of among other things physicians about the potential for thyroid thyroid issues and were we going to monitor thyroid chemistry and and we did and we had went through the same explanation sort of that i just did with you um and so in that study after the 12-week 12-week study with a follow-up um or 16-week i guess i have to review my own papers but um daily consumption this was with autistic kids not perfectly uh nor healthy subjects but um there were there were we followed thyroid chemistry and as i recall there were a couple of times when thyroid function was flagged uh and they wound up being in in placebos uh those that are getting placebo so um yeah i mean it keeps on coming up but with market stage broccoli it valid question to ask can you get too much market sage broccoli perhaps yeah yeah but um and there are areas where um goiter is endemic and those people eat a hell of a lot of cabbage um right there also are certain things like arsenic in the soils there so the cabbage right exactly i mean there a lot of confounding factors and cabbage is not broccoli sprouts like i mentioned there glucoraphanin in cabbage the other question also was related to saladino and the question was how do you respond to paul saladino joe rogan sulforaphane outweigh the benefits okay are we do we have from now till close until 11 30 yeah we minutes okay so i have i made just a short little list of nine points um i don want to go through them in detail but let me let me just sort of tick them off i guess so um i think on multiple levels it bad advice uh to the the carnivore lifestyle uh is bad advice human beings didn evolve as kind of as carnivores we omnivores that means we eat a variety um vegetable and and meat um and you know this is this is a product of evolution you can look at tooth and mouth and jaw structure and all sorts of other anatomical things it evolve to be carnivores and i think a self-anointed fitness and or

What is the optimal source and dose of sulforaphane? | Jed Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNmjfTQRK2g	FoundMyFitness Clips 	the first question is what is the minimum daily dose of sulforaphane that has shown that has been shown to provide health benefits how much sulforaphane does a 200 gram serving of broccoli or broccoli sprouts contain yeah so you know i i i have to preface the these my launching into the answer system these questions by saying yeah i you went through the the extensive and wonderful questions many of them as did i uh a number of days ago um this is a kind of question that comes up all the time and um to those of you who are non-scientists um i tend to talk all we we scientists and certainly chemists and biochemists tend to talk in micro moles so if you look at any of our papers we talk micro moles i give you an answer that into milligrams but this is of course complex and something that play and is still being researched by many people so it all depends on the amount of glucoraphanin the precursor of sulforaphane that is in broccoli or sprouts i avoid a long diatribe on glucoraphanin and myrosinase and sulforaphane because i have the feeling that if you or gone to our podcast the podcast that she and i did together or some of her subsequent podcasts most people know about the fact that glucoraphanin is a precursor found in the plants myrosinase is an enzyme found in the plants and in your body your microbiome and they react and they form sulforaphane so i think that have the enzyme in our gut meaning we are meant to get the precursor to convert it into sulforaphane we contain the enzyme in our gut i just love that anyways go ahead so absolutely all of us do and i mean that all however many hundred of you there are in this call all have myrosinase containing bacteria in your gut unless you antibiotics and had a you know an enema and just cleaned out your intestinal system then maybe you don done these sorts of experiments actually with with real people so there are two ways of doing this of hydrolyzing the glucoraphanin that present in broccoli one is when you chew it you release the enzyme from the broccoli tissue or broccoli sprouts or broccoli seeds and the second way is from your micro microbiome and if you take supplements you or there are now supplements with a combination of glucoraphanin and myrosinase and they with just sulforaphane and we that later i we have to so the question was about the dose um and if you the best the best advice that we can give that i can give now is that all the clinical studies seem to be pointing towards a dose of something between about 50 and 100 micromoles of sulforaphane a day um i discussed that a little bit in the sprouting pdf that um rhonda has just put out um but the question that was originally posted talks about 200 gram so let the question a 200 gram serving of broccoli that people i think that serving of broccoli market stage broccoli however broccoli for broccoli sprouts that that i not enjoy cramming down 200 grams of broccoli sprouts so i on a hundred grams of either broccoli or sprouts and based on the amount of glucoraphanin that in them and our knowledge of conversion and yield you might get about anywhere between four milligrams of glucoraphanin to 100 150 from 100 grams of broccoli and that would yield about anywhere from about half a half a milligram to something like 18 milligrams of sulforaphane that why is there a huge range there range because a all of the broccoli is different it treated in the store the way it the genetics of the broccoli and secondly all of you are different and your gut microbiomes are going to yield different amounts of sulforaphane so there and with broccoli sprouts 100 grams would give you somewhere between i don milligrams and three 350 um sorry between about five or six milligrams and about 60 milligrams of sulforaphane so there these are just rough approximations cooking destroys myrosinase so if you cooking broccoli or broccoli sprouts then you bacteria in your gut i mentioned the the person to person variation there you there sulforaphane or glucoraphanin is in broccoli or broccoli sprouts because you have to get them tested in a lab and there are no commercial labs that do these tests routinely so this is still a problem um and you know you i mentioned this in the pdf that rhonda um unfortunately you as a consumer are you know even if you spend say ten dollars on broccoli seeds and sprout them yourself it would cost you 150 dollars to send one sample of those broccoli seeds out to a commercial lab to get them tested to see if they not so uh as i you know i don abide by them or try to but so unfortunately as it stands now it getting so we just have to work we just have to talk in in terms of rough rough averages and and when paul talley and i did our first publication on broccoli sprouts you know our our point was that a serving of say something like a couple of ounces 60 grams or so of broccoli sprouts gave you as much glucoraphanin as um you know a quarter of a pound or a half a pound of market stage broccoli and so these are all quantities one final word just that that the quantity of glucoraphanin and sulforaphane you get from broccoli sprouts from a couple of ounces we think is a reasonable amount to put you in a zone where you protective effect and so it most of the clinical studies have targeted because god forbid your clinical studies should be positive and work you want to be able to translate that to something people can eat i think the answers to all the rest of my questions will be shorter rhonda and you jump in and interrupt but i hope that sort of addressed the question you	Success
Which supplements are reliable sources of sulforaphane? | Jed Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX10zjP5SV4	FoundMyFitness Clips 	the question is what brands of sulforaphane supplements do you consider reliable um okay the the story there requires again i i started a company with uh my mentor and his son and the company brassica protection products but and they make broccoli broccoli seed extracts that go into a variety of supplements i know that uh and i also based on my you know grandfatherly love of the company which uh um you know i good things now that i um i know that um the the vendors or the supplement makers that they sell their stuff to um by and large do a good job and make good products and my lab before i retired has tested many of those products and found that you know if they say they have x milligrams of glucoraphanin in their product yeah they and so they as i mentioned there are a lot of supplements that are pure crap that don in fortunately i of uh any of those that are well i shouldn some of them that are widely sold and and probably people are taking but i can so i that i would know that i know and that i would trust on our website uh www.protectioncenter.org um they and you know specifically and i can provide links but they i know that crucera sgs by thorn is good has what it says it has oncoplex which is made by the company called zymogen avmacal which is made by nutramax um swanson has a vision defense product that um orthomolecular has something called mitocore max international has something called max and fuse which is a drink i believe the um uh yeah it is so i mean these are these are mostly gel caps uh tablet gel the first two that i mentioned are gel caps the avma call is a tablet uh vision defense i can it got other things in it um so these are all good i endorsing them in the sense that you know i those companies but i and i used some of their products and clinical studies that we getting ready to publish um i would stick with i would stick with a supplement that someone like me says decent things about and i only say that because if you take some of the shoddy or supplements um you you may wind up just making expensive urine and and meaning you know you spend 30 or 40 or 50 or 60 dollars for a bottle and uh yeah you the benefits you that that you hoped for just to follow up to on that i know of the supplements that you mentioned that avema call has stabilized sulforaphane in the in it um do any of the other supplements are they just all glucoraphanin no it doesn not right correct ab mccall has glucoraphanin in it and it has myrosinase um i think all of those companies are going to move towards adding myrosinase to their to their mixes but i of course don you know i think they products and and we thorns crucera with zymogens encoplex with nutramax is that mccall some of the there are there are a lot of clinical stuff a number of clinical studies that are going to be coming out or are in press using admocal with autism and schizophrenia um but it are the best supplements they i think they active myrosinase that i think um getting you know that we talked about this when we talked about dosing but we probably didn about it enough your your listeners should know that um you know if you myrasin your intestinal tracts myrosinase to do all of the conversion for a supplement you to take a higher level of glucoraphanin and if you product that has myrosinase in it you don because some of that conversion is theoretically going to happen based on what you tablet if you were supplementing with sulforaphane and i know there are a number of questions about this with stabilized sulforaphane so let me jump ahead to that like prostaffing does prostate have stabilized sulforaphane prostate is the only product that i know that reliably has that what they say they have um of sulforaphane the amount they say they have and it is stable um but it it i think it difficult it get it in this country um to buy it um and you know because it is um a european product our f it doesn of our fda so you know you can say all the nasty stuff you want about our regulators and about our fda and there are plenty of negative things that have been said about them but they do have some oversight capacity and and although they don regulating based on the law that governs them they don regulating quality of dietary supplements at least they have um they have some power over over the industry so um you know i wish there were there was more stabilized sulfur vein various people are working on it we there england that has something that a non-natural a synthetic sulforaphane that they stabilized we with that type of sulforaphane and found that there are some adverse side effects so i certainly wouldn recommend that um so yeah it and and companies and universities are looking to ways to stabilize sulfur paint it very unstable molecule inherently which is one of the reasons why it does what it does in your body so it it the plant has you know focuses on storing glucoraphanin and then it converts it when it needs it because after all it defensive plant chemical and we when we take supplements i think are well advised to take glucoraphanin and myrosinase unless and until someone does a better job of stabilizing sulforaphane itself you	Success
Does moringa lower blood glucose levels? | Jed Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrhiViRfxl4	FoundMyFitness Clips 	two two comments jed um one just my own anecdote i powder from coulee in my smoothies and i also feel great but i also feel great without the moringa powder in the smoothie um so uh but the the interesting thing i have noticed with moringa powder and this has been repeatable i wearing a continuous glucose monitor for oh about three years now and um the hardcore hardcore so hardcore you have no idea yeah but my typical smoothie is is some a little bit of kale and uh blueberries avocado and collagen powder and adding the moringa powder in there the moringa powder um the blueberries it doesn much so the smoothie itself without the moringa powder you know brings me to about postprandial glucose like 105 and the moringa powder consistently lowers that by i don don mechanistically i to study it and there interesting research on type 2 diabetes and i don have to get to safety which is a really important chunk of this q a but i thought that was an interesting anecdote um the second comment is there was a live question sorry um go ahead absolutely so you can something like that and not have me interrupt and say um yeah so the biggest medical indication for moringa leaf powder is going to be is i think diabetes and that has that no no no no that is under active investigation blood glucose control no no we have a review that shows uh there are there were six not all good studies at all and they were all tiny showing an effect of moringa moringa leaves or marine leaf powder we can talk about that another time i podcast my n of one was you know actually probably real very interesting now if all if all 100 million of your viewers are wearing glucose glucose monitors we can put them together and have a study you	Success
Is moringa a viable alternative to broccoli sprouts? | Jed W. Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mpX_Rzt7jU	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so let questions relating to the alternatives to broccoli sprouting so the first question is in previous discussions around sulforaphane and broccoli sprouts moringa has come up been mentioned to have similar benefits this person says that their family has six moringa trees in mexico and they consume large handfuls of moringa leaves daily in their smoothie is there any research to indicate that the most bioavailable way to consume moringa for example the leaves dried and powdered frozen leaves etc yeah um i i was glad to see that question and i saw someone else made some comment about that picture of you you and me and your podcast you one of us was holding a bag of uh moringa seeds and they were they were right that it um as you put your coat on to leave um that was god that was forever ago three three years ago four four that was when i was pregnant but didn i was pregnant with my son anyways i i remember learning of that when we met you in san diego um and um so i i was glad to see the question because indeed moringa leaf powder is sort of my go-to i am on the scientific advisory board of coulee cooley which makes moringa leaf powder so i moringa leaf powder from them but but it also means that i know a good bit now about the quality and the supply chain of dried moringa leaves um they tropics they because you can grow the trees anywhere if you don fresh leaves are not nearly as good they don freeze and and travel very or they don refrigerate and travel very well at all so dried powdered leaves are great which is why a number of companies have been able to make a business of selling dried powdered leaves in this country we did a few papers we done a number of papers on moringa we never had any funding for it really but um uh or not any to speak of because this is not a tropical country and the funding agencies aren interested in it but one of the things we did is is experimented with moringa teas and found that both hot and cold teas are are you know are great and it sort of modifies that sharp taste of the moringa leaf powder um in terms of efficacy uh the isothiocyanate from moringa it called mur it long scientific name i won with but in many assays it sulforaphane and in others it it depends on the assay and and so on but because of that i am very bullish about uh moringa on the other hand because it has not been nearly as heavily researched you know there less we can say about it from a clinical perspective but and the the person who asked this question would appreciate this it eaten moringa leaves have been grown and eaten for centuries literally by populations in the tropics around the world very safely so the safety of moringa leaf powder or in moringa leaves is is absolutely well documented there aren clinical studies for specific indications but they coming because the interest has really grown in them so i do use moringa leaf powder make moringa tea all the time and um i recommend it i think there was the i copied down the the the um uh question that was one of the questions that was asked about moringa and that person said they brewing one teaspoon of powder in one cup of water for 30 minutes to great effect i feel amazing after taking it um we are working i should use that as a launching point say we are working on that that sort of comment i feel amazing after taking it that appreciate it and i see it all the time we studies we um to better document those sorts of statements you know i feel amazing and i have way more energy are the ones i hear all the time so we trying to document those anecdotes that are attributed to both broccoli sprouts and supplements and moringa with some some hard hard evidence um so anyway yeah they i two comments jed one just my own anecdote i powder from coulee in my smoothies and i also feel great but i also feel great without the moringa powder in the smoothie um so but the interesting thing i have noticed with moringa powder and this has been repeatable i wearing a continuous glucose monitor for oh about three years now and um the hardcore hardcore so hardcore you have no idea yeah but my my typical smoothie is is some a little bit of kale and uh blueberries avocado and collagen powder and adding the moringa powder in there the moringa powder um the blueberries it doesn raise my glucose levels much the smoothie itself without the moringa powder you know brings me to about postprandial glucose like 105 and the moringa powder consistently lowers that by i don don mechanistically i to study it and there interesting research on type 2 diabetes and i don have to get to safety which is a really important chunk of this um q a but i thought that was an interesting anecdote um the second comment is there was a live question sorry um go ahead absolutely so you can something like that and not have me interrupt and say um yeah so the biggest medical indication for moringa leaf powder is going to be it is i think diabetes and that has that no no no not that is under active investigation blood glucose control no no we have a review that shows uh there there were six not all good studies at all and they were all tiny showing an effect of moringa moringa leaves or wearing leaf powder we can talk about that another time i even talked about it on a podcast so my nf1 was you know actually probably real very interesting now if all if all 100 million of your viewers are wearing glucose glucose monitors we can put them together and have a study you	Success
What is the best way to store broccoli sprouts? | Jed Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSjwmlnLi08	FoundMyFitness Clips 	the last question in this section has to do with storing broccoli sprouts so once they if you grow them in a big batch sorry what freezer the refrigerator how long can they be frozen or how long can they be refrigerated and still be potent um so good question um you grow them how do you harvest them harvesting is taking the jar this jar has water but this is one of my sprouting jars you take this jar and you put it in the refrigerator what does that do it slows the growth rate of the sprouts down to a very very slow crawl so they don they don um i i you would leave them in the refrigerator i refrigerator for a short time a few days two or three days only because after that time there risk that whatever bacteria are associated with those sprouts when you grow them are going to start to proliferate they get sort of rank and gungy after you know certainly a week in the refrigerator um in my experience and you seen that if you the grocery store they get um you know sometimes half of the or three quarters of the sprouts and the sprout the little tiny sprout part of a supermarket or rank and i wouldn to touch them um they just spoil very quickly if you time and you make a large batch by far the easiest way to to preserve them i think is to just spread them out on a cookie tray or a you know a baking tin put wax paper on it if you want and quick freeze them and then when you quick freeze them you can bundle them and put them in a bag or a container and and um then you can keep them for you know weeks or even months um myrosinase will remain active um i mean we haven kill curves to see how many weeks of freezing broccoli sprouts in a home freezer will work but home freezers do have a freeze sauce or a defrost cycle and that may actually allow the sprouts to keep on sort of thawing a little bit and myrosinase may activate and then you may sort of use it up to be sort of uh the 30 thousand foot view of what might happen there so i wouldn keep them for more than a month or two in the freezer but yeah you	Success
Sulforaphane increases detoxification of air pollutants | Jed Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD2m-2FRjus	FoundMyFitness Clips 	the next question was if i can how beneficial is it to consume them only after exposure to heavy air pollutants as a firefighter i am exposed to a lot of carcinogens during a fire and i only take them post-fire calls and for how many days yeah another great question and and uh to the firefighter that asked that uh thank you for your service um it out west that so my best guess is that taking them regularly or taking a supplement in order to prime your system and get your antioxidant and detoxification system ready for the regular assaults that you on on on your your body um it would probably be wise um i i think this is a case where you should remember that you you if we or toxins or or oxide oxidant chemicals you never really know when you attacked by those those vicious chemicals and i i there chemicals in smoke from certainly from home fires and even from uh wildfires so there look at the analogy to wearing seat belts uh you know you why you wear a seat belt not because you plan on um getting in an accident but but it think you could make a similar argument if you know you blasting your lungs and your body with the components of smoke you can make an argument that priming your system to get that response uh maximally uh geared up would be a good thing one thing we do know from our work in china with with a study of air pollution and the effects of sulforaphane on that is that you don and this is fortunate but you don fatigue this the biochemical response system so we gave for 12 weeks we gave daily glucoraphanin and sulforaphane and monitored the upregulation of the this protective response um and did not really see any fatiguing of the of the the response of that system so short answer then is uh to the firefighter is yeah i think taking a supplement regularly would be obviously you broccoli sprouts when you fire calls but um so probably supplements in in your case would be a good you know good thing i physician i you but that if i i just could comment as well um your 12-week study was um extremely relevant to not only firefighters but you know people particularly on the west coast in california and you know oregon you know people that are being exposed to wildfires that are breathing in acrolein which is heavily in in smoke and benzene but you know and and your study showed that within 24 hours benzene excretion was excreted by 60 and acrolein study was increased uh actual aqualine excretion was increased by 20 about 23 percent and um so i guess also the question is let you know the firefighter or whoever isn know even within a few days of knowing they whatever do you think that would even be beneficial because i mean it literally wasn hours you yeah yeah so i do i i mean these these obviously there the time you ingest the glucoraphanin or sulforaphane and the time the enzymes are are upregulated or respond it even after a couple of hours some of those enzymes are cranking up um so the answer your question is yes and you know the main the main um sort of situation where i think um you know you might almost have to have it on board before an event is some of the neuronal injury models like when we talk about traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury there is an absolutely pronounced effect of sulforaphane that we we have seen in a variety of studies we and others when i say we i always mean we and other people or maybe maybe i wasn study in this case but we see an effect obviously if if you have that sort of injury and you the rapid response of sulforaphane it would be ideal to have had it on board your body beforehand but one of the things that appears evident is that with neuronal injury even getting it right after the injury may have some value so but with a fire the fire analogy or the fire situation absolutely we showed that the response was upregulated quickly and it was maintained and as you say detoxication of two out of the three major pollutants that we looked at um uh happened uh to a to a substantial degree and i should mention this was work that my colleague tom kensler started a long time ago in china and and um we joined in that work in the i guess in about 2001 and so we many years now and the final studies there are going to be published soon i hope amazing just amazing work i love those studies and the fact that the 12 weeks there was no exhausting of the the up regulation of these important detoxification enzymes um that were maintained within that whole 12 week it wasn it was a short-term effect that went away um also it as we a couple of minutes about um a lot of the pre-clinical studies on the effects of sulforaphane in alzheimer disease um there onslaught of new research that has shown air pollution is contributing to neurodegenerative diseases starting in early life so there was a study in mexico city where air pollution is terrible and children so they post-mortem um you know studies looking in the brain of unfortunately infants and children and young adolescents that have um that have died for whatever reason and they have uh amyloid beta plaques in their brain as early as infancy and other you know pathological changes in the brain going on early early in life which is really unfortunate so i think that the the the possibility of something like moringa or sulforaphane or black sprouts you know to to help with excreting these you know toxic compounds and even in other

Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFPSSTaLhAA	FoundMyFitness Clips 	um okay so let question and the question has to do with a recent study that uh claimed microwaving microwave microwaving broccoli was able to increase levels of sulforaphane in the process yeah what are your thoughts on that study rhonda i don like being negative about other people studies but i don so respectfully um you know i think they said a number of things that were that are misleading maybe not maybe not wrong but but they sort of get you down the wrong garden path to truth um so first of all when you harvest broccoli sprouts or broccoli you or a farmer they don any sulforaphane in them they don any free sulforaphane it glucoraphanin which is the precursor of sulforaphane myrosinase converts one to the other happens when you start chewing it happens in your gut we that microwaving is merely a gentle method by which one cooks and you can [Music] you can try to minimize denaturing or destruction of myrosinase um with microwaving and and there evidence that there wipe out the myrosinase if you don the internal temperature of the food product up above 70 or 80 degrees centigrade celsius microwaving also gives you minimal leakage of plant juice so you know when you steam the hell out of something or boil a vegetable you know most of the goodies come out in the wash they come out in the pot liquor right so so microwaving is useful there but they state don me they state something like like increase the levels of sulforaphane and broccoli you do not increase the levels of either sulforaphane or glucoraphanin by a cooking method whatsoever you may enhance it you may its destruction you may its loss or limit its loss but the other thing is they have a couple of figures in that paper that um suggest and you know i should talk to the authors perhaps and take my beef to them but um they suggest that the controls have far less glucoraphanin in um in them than the treatments the different microwave times that can impossible um i promise you that you don glucoraphanin out of whole cloth you don magically create it um so so i that worries me about that paper that i would sort of steer clear of it and just say yeah indeed microwaving if you cook broccoli microwaving is probably the best way to do it minimal microwaving make it nice and a little tender and soft and um and minimize the leakage of of compounds into the pot liqueur or else incorporate that into whatever you eating and that broccoli you know rinse it put it in a corning dish put it in the microwave until it just gets a little less crunchy and and and eat it and there nothing in the bottom and i put lemon juice on it i do the same thing i microwaved my broccoli but i put mustard seed powder um and just just a an fyi for for everyone viewing right now and or listening um when that paper came out the first thing i did was email jen and i was like uh what do you think of this paper you weren about it to me but um thanks for your expert opinion on that i think that that could be that is a misleading study you	Success
How can you make broccoli sprouts more palatable? | Jed Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeNenlNJWNo	FoundMyFitness Clips 	um a sort of related question is people are sort of asking about the taste of broccoli sprouts for example you know if you blend the sprouts together and drink it as i have done in the past um it not very pleasant tasting i mean it like a spicy taste i like spicy so um it but um not a lot of people like that and there are some some parents that are trying to give sulforaphane or and or broccoli sprouts in some form another to their children an autistic children who seem to be very picky eaters most of the time is there any recommendations for like making it better tasting in a smoothie something that affect the bioavailability of sulfur or fame yeah so yeah i think there are and i think they come from our some of our clinical studies where we had to camouflage the taste or you know we had to uh incorporate broccoli sprouts um into something that was uh palatable for more people um i i saw the smoothie question in my uh my off-the-cuff response would be hey look at me i come from a generation that didn um were a food group um and you know they weren a lot of people in the younger generations i think think smoothies are a man a mandatory good food i do takes i do eat take drink smoothies uh sometimes and um it is a good uh it is it presents a good option to incorporate the vegetable broccoli sprouts and to disguise it or camouflage it with some other tastes um so a couple of ways to answer your question when we when we did our trials in china we had to come up with disguising mechanisms and first we used mango juice this was a bunch of phds getting together and saying oh how does this taste how does this taste and we picked mango juice we were all americans doing this test in america and we used to very sweet stuff in america we took it to china where they are not accustomed to such sweet tastes and they didn subjects so we then did some rather extensive studies with a flavor analysis company sensory analysis company in new jersey we actually published on this and they helped us identify pineapple juice with a hint of lime juice in it and you can even dilute it with what we did with our next china study was to dilute it one to one with water and it and it turned out to be a really good disguiser of the taste or complementer of the taste of broccoli sprouts and it it mind away from the taste which a lot of people don find very pleasant in terms of the autism part of the question in in a number of the clinical trials we done on autism we we of course had to use um we didn that would have been way too difficult you people with autism have very very rigid food preferences and sometimes very narrow but what we did is give them supplements with a calibrated amount of sulforaphane and then we gave each of the parents um just a five dollar amazon hand pill crusher so they could crush the pill and add it to whatever the favorite food of that child was in the case of the studies we did um so yeah they wound up camouflaging both taste and texture that you	Success

Can you get sulforaphane by eating raw broccoli seeds? | Jed W. Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZD88iK9AzY	FoundMyFitness Clips 	let sprouting logistics the question is many people ask this question in one form another can you clarify whether it or if you can get sulforaphane by just blending and eating the seeds you mentioned in the last episode with dr fahey that you would try to try this i bother sprouting them if eating chopped up seeds works just as well uh yeah it noticed that question echoed a lot in your uh those that have been sent in by you by um listeners um you know it the highest levels of glucoraphanin from just eating broccoli seeds i think there also a possibility of getting an overload of erusic acid although you know people do supplement with omega-9 fatty acids which is what a aerusic acid is but they could have a whole just maybe we should have a whole discussion of erusic acid um uh so you would get a lot of that so broccoli seeds are about a third fat or oils and they acid um secondly they taste awful um some may disagree some people may be less sensitive to them but um if you just grind up broccoli seeds and eat them they don they don when paul talley and i did our first publication on uh broccoli sprouts we very consciously um i mean we we knew that it was broccoli siege which had the very highest levels of glucoraphanin and they declined as you sprouted those seeds on a fresh weight basis um until you know they plateaued for a couple of weeks very low and then they started to climb again when the broccoli plant started to make flowers and seeds and we very consciously decided to try to promote broccoli sprouts first of all because we knew that nobody ate broccoli seeds or sprouts at that time second of all because broccoli sprouts were green and at least some people like the taste of sprouts and eat them regularly not very many but i don or reports of people that eat broccoli seeds regularly and i know there are no clinical trials on the use of them that said the broccoli sprout broccoli supplements sulforaphane rich or glucoraphanin rich supplements are generally made i know that brassica protection products makes theirs from seeds but when you think about that you boil seeds you leave the fat fraction behind and you just get the water-soluble glucoraph in and out and then they they dry it down in various ways and and um and you have a very glucoraph and rich supplement that doesn it so um i know short answer you know sure you could eat broccoli seeds you much you ate and careful you didn erusic acid is a rusic acid um toxic i mean is it is it something that can have negative health effects you know i i i the uh an expert on erusic acid but but certainly there um it mean i believe lorenzo is is is very rich in that um it um uh which certainly people uh people ate for uh many years now they eat canola oil which has had the arisic acid removed um i mean it cardiac toxicities and some animal studies um but i i think the jury is sort of is still out on the effects in humans um i you know can you i i think there chance you could get too much if you if you really just started eating broccoli seeds um and i think sooner or later there be more studies done with them um if you there was a question earlier there list of questions that was that actually itemized i looking at that i that actually itemized the levels of erusic acid in broccoli seeds sprouts or florets sprouts and seeds and they said that the levels are 0.8 320 and 12 000 milligrams per 100 grams respectively this is one of your listeners i didn i didn those numbers as a guideline um they uh again your listener suggests that um you would get a lot more erusic acid than is is in the estimated uh or identity the the consumption guidelines um and so you exposure limit for erusic acid so i didn uh their your listeners facts but i assuming that they yeah i think you might get too much seems like the safe thing to do at least in my opinion would be to to sprout and um because there more more there um it would it seems like it could be easy to take the wrong dose if you up seeds and uh so yeah to sprout to sprout or supplement i mean supplementing supplementing you have the added advantage of um you know again a known quantity in in the best of possible worlds yeah you lousy supplements you get less than a no you that they say they have um because there uh snake oil salesmen selling crappy products out there yeah and we get to that question in a minute you	Success
Potential benefits of sulforaphane for Alzheimer's disease | Jed Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EeyGKTmeRY	FoundMyFitness Clips 	what are your thoughts if any on the potential on the potential benefits of sulforaphane or even other isothiocyanate activators of nrf2 for alzheimer there evidence that amyloid beta you know is decreased and that you know isothiocyanates and sulforaphane seem to have a positive effect on alzheimer yeah so this is a case where uh i i need to give dr patrick of of papers there literature that you know would be fun to post links to from animal models and and cell culture work let me start actually i just found this or i just uh rediscovered this this morning let me start by citing a clinical study and then go back to some of the um to some of the animal studies work so as all of you know animals mostly rats and mice are used to spare having to do some of these experiments on people and so what usually happens what frequently happens maybe covet 19 is going to be an exception but what frequently happens is you have cell culture work you have or in vitro work where you add chemicals to cultured human cells or animal cells in a petri plate you get positive effects or not then you move to trials where you like it or not sacrifice mice to the cause of science and you and if you model of a disease um you get some results and then maybe you safety and then you go to a full-fledged clinical study to look at efficacy so a lot of animal studies i to a few citations but there is one now there china in um uh shang university um and it will be looking at 160 uh 160 subjects with early alzheimer and they sulforaphane it was posted for start date of sometime in may of 2020. i doubt that covid most clinical trials are on pause um i do want to make so you can find this on clinicaltrials.gov that the us-approved clinical trials and many around the world you can find it and read about it yourself if you do that be careful because you know i think this may well be a good and interesting study but when you look at what they they sulforaphane and they say they milligrams once a day and half of the people are getting placebo i won is enough to kill a horse um and so that 10 and 100 closer to 100 times what i would recommend giving to a person so my only guess is that they about the weight 2.5 grams or 2500 milligrams of a supplement tablet and there website that lets us know what they actually giving patients or how much sulforaphane they actually be getting but it uh you know it it may may well be a very interesting study so we should keep our eyes on it but to go back to the um to the animal work um with a former doctoral student anita panchwani we did a review a couple of years ago looking at actually all of the neurodegenerative diseases like parkinson alzheimer and the neurodevelopmental diseases like autism and looking at the evidence for sulforaphane and it like hdac inhibition histone diocetyl sorry inhibition enhancement of bdnf brain derived neurotropic factor certainly uh reduction in um amyloid beta um and um the list the list really goes on and on the things that other people have done i have not been directly involved in that um then there are a couple of reviews from even more recently from last year which i talking about for example uh sulforaphane protecting cultured neural cells from the toxicity of methylglyoxal which is a precursor of ages or advanced glycation end products that are very clearly associated with alzheimer models that show reduced neuronal cell death due to amyloid beta exposure due to activation of peroxisomes these are things that that help detoxify so it the reviews the review articles have pages and pages of evidence so i will share some of that with rhonda but it 10 years ago we were paul talley and i were invited to work with a group in the netherlands that was going to be a big multi-center alzheimer using sulforaphane 10 years ago 2011. um it was a multi-million dollar trial funding never had i don funding started and stopped but it never actually happened and i follow-up studies as i say i just found this study in china that is being conducted i should say by some researchers who have done some some good animal model work and published a bit before a lot before so i have high hopes for the china study but we you	Success
How can Sulforaphane and its byproducts help protect against bladder cancer?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBMzBKT9AvQ	FoundMyFitness Clips 	speaking to prevention i know there been there some of the preclinical evidence that really excited me was um there was a rat study and i forget the group that published a study but the rats were given sulforaphane they were given it before they were given a chemical that causes bladder cancer and the other group of rats were just given the chemical that causes bladder cancer and the rats that were given the dose of the sulforaphane um did not develop bladder cancer and one and if they did the tumors were much much smaller in size so again preventative you know just more evidence that the preventative approach seems to be stronger there the clinical evidence um it seems as though and you and you know better about this uh jed about you know the the the tissues that sulforaphane may accumulate in more you know the bladder prostate breast uh versus other tissues or lungs you know i don we know all the differences um but the prostate seems to be one that at least clinically there a few studies showing that sulforaphane ranging in dose and the higher the dose the more robust the effect so 60 milligrams of sulfurous in a day was shown to slow the the biomarker prostate specific antigen or psa which people with um you know early prostate cancer you know or risk of it or whatever have um and so slowing that by 86 is certainly you know a good thing um yeah so so as a follow-up um shame on you i think that first bladder cancer study you were talking about is also one that i was involved with the call i said i work because you pretty much every study that i cite almost jed fahey dr jen he is an author on so i it keep track of all your publications ted mostly a minor player so in this case a minor player a group in new zealand rex monday and uh old old colleague actually the the guy who with paul tell they put sulforaphane on the map yushen zhang and i um did this did one of the one of the rat studies i think maybe the one you um with bladder cancer and absolutely this was uh this was benzoyl isothiocyanate as as i recall that we used her or or sinogram um allyl isothiocyanate um which come from radish or daikon um or mustard seed so it you think about what happens with sulforaphane which most of you i don probably too much to my detriment but what happened you ingest it you take it in the body sees it your cells of your body see it um they actually take it in very rapidly they conjugate it with glutathione they spit it back out then where does it go it goes from the blood to the urine then where does the urine go unless you most of us that are reasonably healthy aren although i before so your bladder stores urine up what in that urine sulforaphane and its conjugates well what is bladder cancer bladder cancer is the epithelial cells of the bladder that most most of them the tissue lining that bladder um muta you know a mutation forming and ultimately a tumor developing so bladder cancer we i still think is the ultimate target for isothiocyanates because you that tissue in these protective compounds um essentially all the time you know you empty your bladder and immediately it starts filling back up again certainly the prostate cancer is is another example where mechanistically uh or i should say evidentiarily we have there the cause and effect is a little harder to see but the bladder cancer model is just it you	Success
What are sulforaphane's effects on cancer? | Jed Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aN2zAOy9i2U	FoundMyFitness Clips 	let was related to cancer the question was are there any studies that that you know of that would suggest broccoli sprouts would be beneficial for a person who has already been diagnosed with cancer if so which cancers yeah um so i caution here i physician and i don advice um i i would in that instance i would certainly eat a vegetable based diet a whole food vegetable based diet um there are certainly clinical studies suggesting that there may be cancer therapeutic effects um but those studies are all in progress and i i don there is not scientific consensus that um sulforaphane is a cancer therapy or therapeutic certainly um so it will be irresponsible to suggest that my bias is that i certainly think that it is valuable in a cancer preventive lifestyle trying to prevent cancers from starting so if you especially if it it may actually not be wise to take sulforaphane or to supplement or to to go heavy on on broccoli um we just honestly we just don enough we do know that upregulating nrf2 protects protects cells and when you think about it metastasized cancers what growing faster than the rest of the cells around them the rest of the rest of the body for that matter if you adult they the products of respiration and oxidation their mitochondria are cranking away so if you support their mitochondria and enhance their ability that enhance their ability to detoxify things including including perhaps cancer drugs um this may be a slippery slope we just don are some animal model studies in which nrf2 is is genetically upregulated or knocked out and i think those studies the results of those studies suggest that caution is is advised um in cases where people have been diagnosed with cancer um hopefully a lot more to come on that from studies that are underway and in progress in various parts of the world and just to add on as a comment you know speaking to prevention i know there preclinical evidence that really excited me was um there was a rat study and i forget the group that um published a study but the rats were given sulforaphane they were given it before they were given a chemical that causes bladder cancer and the other group of rats were just given the chemical that causes bladder cancer and the rats that were given the dose of the sulforaphane um did not develop bladder cancer and one and if they did the tumors were much much smaller in size so again a preventative you know just more evidence that the preventative approach um seems to be stronger there um it seems as though and you this uh jed about you know the the the tissues that sulforaphane may accumulate in more you know the the bladder prostate breast uh versus other tissues or lungs you know i don all the differences um but the prostate seems to be one that at least clinically there a few studies showing that sulforaphane ranging in dose and the higher the dose the more robust the effect so 60 milligrams of sulforaphane a day was shown to slow the the biomarker prostate specific antigen or psa which people with you know early prostate cancer you know or risk of it or whatever have um and so slowing that by 86 is certainly you know a good thing um yeah so so as a follow-up um shame on you i think that first bladder cancer study you were talking about is also one that i was involved in whereas the beginning of the call i said i because you much every study that i cite almost jed fahey dr jennifer he is an author on so i it keep track of all your publications ted mostly a a minor player so in this case a minor player uh uh a group in new zealand rex monday and uh old old colleague actually the the guy uh who with paul tell they put sulforaphane on the map and i um did this did one of the one of the rat studies i think maybe the one you um with bladder cancer and absolutely this was uh this was benzoyl isothiocyanate as i recall that we used her or or sinogram um allyl isothiocyanate um which come from radish or daikon um or mustard seed so it think about what happens with sulforaphane which most of you i don probably too much to my detriment but what happened you ingest it you take it in the body sees it your cells of your body see it um they actually take it in very rapidly they conjugate it with glutathione they spit it back out then where does it go it goes from the blood to the urine then where does the urine go unless you most of us that are reasonably healthy aren uh although i before so your bladder stores urine up what in that urine sulforaphane and its conjugates well what is bladder cancer bladder cancer is the epithelial cells of the bladder that most most of them the tissue lining that bladder um muta you know a mutation forming and ultimately a tumor developing so bladder cancer we i still think is the ultimate target for isothiocyanates because you protective compounds um essentially all the time you know you empty your bladder and immediately it starts filling back up again certainly the prostate cancer is is another example where mechanistically uh or i should say evidentiarily we have there the cause and effect is a little harder to see but the bladder cancer model is just just beautiful you	Success
Sulforaphane promotes detoxification of heavy metals | Jed Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZiy7O-h2rg	FoundMyFitness Clips 	there krista bluff is there any research around toxic metals and increased detoxification with sulforaphane so we mentioned some of these carcinogens but has there been any evidence on males there i dig those papers out uh for you krista um because i familiar with them and we we haven you mentioned so the answer is yes and uh i find you those those references um but that brings up the question of pesticides and other toxins you know we we have talked about air pollutants and we states and protection against cancer and so on and so forth but others a number of years ago especially have looked at things like um paraquat toxicity um and uh there are a number of other pesticides i can at the moment remember which ones they are right rotenone i think is one yeah people have looked at the ability of sulforaphane to um detoxify them or to enhance the elimination of them so and certainly we done my colleague tom kensler and and that whole team has i mean they started out in china in these china studies looking at aflatoxin which is different than metals and it different than pesticides but it is a potent toxin and carcinogen that is actually present in peanuts and corn in the part of china where we were working and clearly and this is this is sort of a model for the metal and the pesticide detoxification clearly aflatoxin is converted to a derivative bound to compounds which um allow it to be more readily excreted in the urine so um this is something that uh is this this is what we call detoxication or detoxification um and and indeed it um because so this is probably involved in a subsequent question but a lot of this is because of the up regulation of glutathione glutathione is the body most um most predominant detoxification mechanism is present at very high levels in in things like the macula of the eye the back of the eye the retina and it is it of only three amino acids and it is a very potent antioxidant that is endogenous it body but what sulforaphane does is it cranks up the enzymes that are responsible for synthesizing or re-synthesizing glutathione and so it makes more glutathione available and once glutathione is sacrificed and oxidized it remakes it and so that question all my answers are long ways of answering simple questions i guess but that where sulforaphane comes into that detoxification pathway one of one of many ways but it probably one of the most important ways yeah we are going to talk a little bit more about glutathione on another question but i just want to ask you um is that is specifically the you know there has been clinical studies that it increased increases glutathione in the plasma and in the brain i don clinical studies went but you as you were saying previously with the air pollution studies that you had been collaborated with um in your colleagues in china um the the the activation of the nrf2 system did not stop as long as you were continually taking the broccoli sprout extract right so the glutathione levels would keep going up if you were it that just goes away over time right well they won won to you know forever i mean they keep continuing right exactly yeah so if you if you insult your body with a toxin that is detoxified by glutathione um yes there levels what actually happens is the reduced form of glutathione turns into the oxidized form um and then the reduced form glutathione is regenerated so that cycling happens more efficiently and indeed the levels overall levels of glutathione are somewhat elevated you	Success

How long do the health effects of broccoli sprouts last? | Jed Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv3otrV9LiM	FoundMyFitness Clips 	with that i next question which was how long do the health benefits of broccoli sprouts last would consuming them every day be better than every other day or once a week um this is just this is an easy question for me to answer but it but it it white um we think that consumption every two or three days is fine because what you it having a direct antioxidant effect and you use up the vitamin c and it you and they last enzymes or proteins and you know they do work in the body and eventually they wear out and break down and get catabolized and and turned into their component amino acids and then they get remade we know that the elevation of these enzymes lasts for at least hours and certainly in most cases days a few days probably some benefits might be short-lived um you know if when you talk about habits though people diet and with supplements uh if you better to just do it daily if you eating broccoli sprouts um it eat them today and i don going to get bored eating the same thing every day but um yeah every couple of days should be fine i think two or three days i know that the animal studies have shown that the nrf2 protective pathways activated for at least two days um have you looked at any clinical samples uh human human samples is it to see if it similar or yeah yeah so what you were referring to clinical studies when you were referring to any hours to days i we in clinical studies also i mean part of the problem with clinical studies is that you have to pick sometimes unless you have someone in the hospital in a hospital or in an inpatient setting have an indwelling catheter of some kind in them and are constantly taking blood or having them deliver their urine to you all of it on you know for days on end which most people don they when we do clinical studies in an effort to you know sort of have moderate inconvenience for the subject and and reduce the cost of it to a manageable level we wind up picking times to take blood and to look at elevation of those enzymes and frequently it dosing um and so you know we know that a day after taking um sulforaphane we see these enzymes elevated and um and and also i can uh two or three days has been a time point that that we specifically but um but others have i think in the clinic you	Success

Age and gender-specific effects of metformin (animal research) | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPHnF0yE-MY	FoundMyFitness Clips 	you know if you look at male and female mice that were given metformin about a hundred milligrams per kilogram body weight which that dose of like eight milligrams per kilogram body weight so that translates to something like six hundred and sixty milligrams for like one hundred and eighty pound person so that given to mice it decreased the average lifespan of male mice by thirteen percent and increase the average lifespan of female mice by about four percent now the negative effect on male male lifespan could actually be dose dependent so there was another study looking at different doses in male mice so male mice were given either a 0.1 percent or a 1% dose of metformin in their diet starting at the age of like 50 weeks or something 54 weeks their lifespan their average lifespan increased at the lower dose so their their average lifespan increased by close to 6 percent but the high dose it was toxic it reduced their average lifespan by like what I mentioned earlier something between 13 to 14 percent so that consider the dose and then also the age that you know these animals are given their first treatment there was another study and this is in female a lot of studies have been done in female mice because that was female mice have been shown to be the most responsive in terms of lifespan extending effects and female mice that were given again a hundred milligrams per kilogram body weight of metformin starting at the age of three three months nine months or 15 months the most robust effects were happen earlier so at three months the lifespan was increased by 14% if they were given at the age of nine months it increased by only six percent and if they were given it at the age of fifteen months they were the lifespan there was no effect no difference at all now mice live on average around two to two-and-a-half years so it average lifespan so 15 months typically died of just old age it depends you know some of them they get like lymphomas and yeah but they do they die of old age the reason why I ask is that you know some of the life extension things on the human side I to its ability to prevent certain cancers yeah we that human types of I mean humans get lymphomas and but the majority of human cancers are are what cancers not blood based cancers they epithelial based cancers meaning they like solid tumors you know prostate cancer liver cancer breast cancer ovarian cancer right you know these these are all solid tumors some of the human studies which is what you just brought up I mean that kind of like getting to the human data is what to mention that animal study data because it know depending on gender and dose and time of administration I think that all important stuff till I consider right hmm and we don want to say why men why the male mice are so like sensitive to dose in terms of like their their lifespan effects you	Success

Nicotinamide Riboside vs. Nicotinamide Mononucleotide - dosing and effects on NAD+ | David Sinclair	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vik7auA9QC4	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so with the with the clinical studies you know there to my right aside but I guess the you know the the question is what the nicotinamide right aside there little confusion about like you know whether or not nicotine my right asides you inside cells and different organs other than the liver this was this was this nad flux paper that that was done by Rabbo minutes with Rabinowitz Rabinowitz thank you yes that that study he recently published just a few months ago I aside and how orally at a dose half of what typically is used and all the other nicotine my right aside animal studies so typically they do four hundred milligrams per kilogram body weight per day I don they were doing it but nad flux study he did 200 milligrams per kilogram body weight which is significantly less than what all these other studies like the one you mentioned with Alzheimer disease and other studies that have shown improvements in mitochondrial function in mitochondrial mutator - and also muscular dystrophy and all that so we use double that dose yes so maybe you know the this nad flex study that showed nicotinamide rabbits that given orally did in form nad in muscle but it did in the liver could have been a dose-dependent thing it would make sense because we we mice and now in humans and that there a threshold that you need to cross you need to take a certain amount to get over probably the body mechanisms and then you get up to a level that plateaus after about nine days and they may have just been under that threshold so the body was just clearing it out but you have to seemingly overwhelm that clear out system so that makes begin and that right aside the question is I mean that equivalent dose for like 180 pound man that kind of leads me to that my next question which was the most recent clinical study with nicotinamide right aside where they actually used a much higher dose in the original study that was done with basis the Elysium that had pterostilbene in it this dose was like a thousand milligrams a day and they looked at a variety of endpoints in addition to with Oh guide endurance of dead it was dug seal study yes and and there was no statistical significance and anything it raised any levels but there was no statistical significance there was trending improvement and the basilar system and there no effect on endurance and I again well if we go back to the human equivalent dose what was given to the animals that was still less than half I mean so the question becomes is it not even making nad in the muscle tissue at that dose or you know so which brings me to the nicotinamide mononucleotide yeah you know like now that those studies have been done in animals at a much lower dose than 400 milligrams they have yes we in my 11 and at the company metro biotech we different molecules and different we do what there talk for another hour on one of the big questions people ask me is have you ever put n R and n MN head-to-head in a study and we need to do a lot more of those typically they aware of it being done in humans at this point but in mice what we see and for all the N our folks out there please don I don deliver the message that at the same dose n MN will increase endurance and I figure what that dose was it might have been 200 or 250 200 NM n didn in during I endurance but n MN did we do find that for some parameters and met cable line who I mentioned earlier who he works on dog aging now after doing this or - extension lifespan so Matt also has published that comparing n R and a man only n MN work in his his disease model which was a mitochondrial disease where those animals really need a boost of nad so one of the issues could be that in a man is a better molecule in that regard it could be that maybe the mice just worked better than humans and we need a bigger dose but what I not talked about a lot because it in the commercial realm is there a team of seven chemists working on much better molecules than any of these two that I boosters and we have ones that work far better than any men and these are timed release these are what we call pro drugs and those are the ones that aren really excited about for medicines of the future that don someone diabetes and heart disease and cancer and Alzheimer clinical trial right now with a molecule called MIB 626 MIB is just a metro biotech and that trials that have been done at Brigham and Women group for me it and they that when I come back on your show if I come back back on your show I may be able to tell you if we see some actual efficacy some results we the face to study at strength and endurance in the in the muscle of people after some nmn dosing so we verge of knowing if this is real or not for people you	Success
NAD+ boosters: NR, NMN, and how they affect sirtuins | David Sinclair	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4um8OQH8LtM	FoundMyFitness Clips 	you we probably should should definitely get into that but well they because as I mentioned the proteins many of them like the sort terms who are moving around controlling the epigenome you want to stabilize that as best you can animals like whales and naked mole rats have a very stable epigenome so there moving around at proteins and epigenomic noise accumulating if we we slow that process down I believe let boosters are so the precursors for nad should we make nad in our bodies and we yeah we do and so nad is recycled in the body because there can cycle it nad and it all starts with nicotinamide which is a form of niacin vitamin b3 but you can very effective just overdose on vitamin b3 because you need other things to make the big molecule nad so nad is the reason it dinucleotide is that it three main components and the dinucleotide is related to DNA right but that molecule so that if you give a big molecule to cells it doesn up so we don don is the little end part of nad because it these other parts so n MN and n are a two molecule so it stands for nicotinamide mononucleotide which is essentially the precursor the immediate precursor to nad if you give a cell in a man it will be taken up by a transporter which was just discovered by my buddy Sheena my we used to work together at MIT now he wrote about it I wrote about it that there man and the other man is converted within one step to nad in the cell and now it locked inside the cell and that step is carried out by an enzyme it it up under stress and calorie restriction and in yeast it we showed years ago that that step of conversion of to nad or in yeast what is a nicotinic acid to nad is the critical step for boosting an ad when you your circadian rhythms when you exercise when your cells are stressed and without that step you don calorie restriction your organs start to get old so what is n R so n R is fairly popular a lot of people have heard of it it stands for nicotinamide ribose ID and all it is it n a man without a phosphate on there so there take an hour your body has to first put on a phosphorus and then it has to basically link two of them together to make the nad so with all that said and argit then into nad yes yes it has to yeah but in RNA and in a man have both been shown to raise the nad levels in animals and in humans as well and there nuances about the differences but they both seem to be effective not just in humans actually and I should say and in mice but in yeast they work as well which is nice you	Success

Resveratrol and NAD boosters lead to positive impact on Alzheimer's disease & vascular dementia	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n6fmXkLgcA	FoundMyFitness Clips 	as you know that there was a couple there studies on Alzheimer they were given 500 milligrams or a thousand milligrams of resveratrol it was a very tall day and both these studies found that there was a reduction in amyloid beta 42 and cerebral spinal fluid there was an improvement in cognitive function and a couple of other parameters so it was kind of interesting because I recently had dr. Dale bredesen on the podcast and he has this whole protocol where he you know diet and lifestyle factors you know improve cognitive function and also by MRI like help shown to like reverse some of the atrophy in the hippocampus and so whereas very tall was honest he got this long list and I kind of like everything in the kitchen sink or it was like geez like what is old and was very trawl was on there I never really knew why until I read very recently was reading a little bit of the clinical studies I thought that was super interesting as well and then the other thing that was interesting as you know is the etapa G because R is very tall seems to be activating a kapha G yeah and I also interviewed Guido Cromer on the podcast you did and he talks about these three signals that are important for tofu G and one of them is the decrease in protein acetylation yeah yeah because sirtuins are histone deacetylases right so that would lead to right a decrease in protein that exactly right so that pac-man enzymes are working and one of the enzymes that they work on is a notify protein that goes and destroys bad proteins so it reasonable to think that if you take resveratrol it might be clearing the body who has protein there I have seen a study with yeah we should Turner I believe he think you really promising and he did what looked like a very convincing study but he actually is still trying to raise the money to do his larger trial and I trying to help him with that but I would love to see that repeated yeah and more people yeah I know that dr. chroma has published a study looking at biomarkers of etapa G and humans after after they think one of the one of those was looking at like lice the acetylation on lysine or something so seem to be working so that interesting the NAD boosters also yes help the brain so at least in mice a couple of labs have published now in top journals like cell that raising the nad levels in the brain also improves memory and slows down the advancement of Alzheimer mice admittedly I know we Alzheimer nicotinamide right aside and nicotinamide mononucleotide i shown to do that in animal studies right yeah you yes you know so that that love to do a human study actually one of the benefits that we might see is also improved blood flow and that might be helpful for vascular dementia because as I men and others have shown for NR that it also helps with blood flow and and actually mimic exercise and regrow the vascular system and we muscle we it also helped restore blood flow in the brain which is badly needed for a lot of elderly people right yeah I know that a that for cognitive function and so and a man was able to do that in Amash mice yeah you	Success
Why we lose NAD+ in aging [DNA repair & inflammation] | David Sinclair	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzZmTrGVzqA	FoundMyFitness Clips 	let me ask you this this is kind of something that it comes to my mind I don this way at least in the field but you know because nad is required for cells that have a really high energetic demand like activated immune cells for example activated immune cells require a lot of ATP for energy and a lot of nad and if you think about like chronic inflammation how you know your especially as you get older and you unhealthy and with a ticket you know basically it is it is increasing if you cells is there any way to test if like the NAD like there is kind of being sucked away to these activated immune cells and like then your mitochondria are now suffering and you get like mitochondrial decay because because you all this nad like take care of you know what your body thinks is potentially an infection that could kill you right so there evolutionary mechanisms at play that say oh yeah immune cells need this nad more than mitochondria or I don be kind of interested in do you follow what I think you being thinking along the same lines that as you get older you the ability to make nad but you chewing it up and as it gets worse and worse as you get older the immune system is a big drain on nad and actually so is DNA repair with the activation of parts and and once you drain in AD a little bit then your pops and your immune system won they more damage and this is a positive feedback in a bad ways that you once you start going down the nad decline the cells just start to need more and more and more with accumulating DNA damage and that yeast cells going back to those little critters that we found that they became overwhelmed with damaged DNA and the sirtuins were overwhelmed they had to go over and repair that genomic instability the DNA instability and one of the reasons old cells became sterile which is a hallmark of yeast aging is because the sirtuins is keeping the cells fertile back here but they distracted by all this other DNA damage that over here that they lose their identity and that is likely trillion mammals as well that accumulations of DNA damage distract the sirtuins from their normal job of keeping a cell with the proper gene expression and seller identity and we see the loss of cellular identity over time in mice at least and our what we trying to do is to raise nad levels back up so that they can fix the DNA damage but also get back to where they came from and make sure the cell doesn its identity too much edit know so trans played a role direct role and I guess they they DNA damage well they proteins to get to a broken chromosome really yeah we we discovered that that a while ago it was a it was a cell paper in 1999 if anyone would like to look it up mills myself and guarantee published that surtout goes to a broken DNA end and then helps recruit other proteins really so like like like gamma h2ax yeah so the first thing that happens is gamma h2x gets lit up on the break and then within seconds sirt1 brings in h deck one remote all the DNA in the chromatin so that it proteins to come in and without sort one getting there these are repair proteins are very inefficient but they distracted swords should actually be regulating genes elsewhere I think right this is all part of my idea my hypothesis is called the information theory of aging is that we losing the information regulation over time and all of these other things that occur such as telomere loss and mitochondrial loss and loss of produced a scissors and he would call it loss of protein folding mechanisms this could be upstream of all of that that we ourselves lose their identity and don turn on the right genes the way they did when we were young but the trick is how do you get everybody to go back and reset and that on you	Success
Why NR is more commonly used in studies (vs. NMN)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVHnzROvZWY	FoundMyFitness Clips 	is the reason why there are more studies within our because Ana men is so expensive yeah well historically some companies started making in our early on and made it widely available and cheap to research is in fact so cheap they were giving it away to researchers so it became used much more often than Anna men but increasingly and if any scientist lab once so many men let me know I like but yeah and Anna man was late on the scene because it was harder to synthesize because it molecule needs that phosphate and phosphate chemistry is quite difficult what are so you mentioned the the company that you that that four of Anna men or is this like so I don endorse products um I you can only do one it doesn committed my career to making pharmaceuticals that are proven to work and a proven safe and a watered dark you know so let me by the update it it my early in my career I dabbled in in a supplement world with resveratrol and it only lasted about three weeks before I had to get out because of it incompatible with for me at least me to be able to without getting criticized this is what I think this is the data and I want to be able to say that without making any money off it but also I find that the supplement world is it so controversial and litigious that I was scared away it that I am unable to talk about supplements by name because I obviously know a fair bit but I just can you know I lawsuits I that I my mouth and there are a lot of companies out there who have a lot of money who don unfortunately you know I really am unable to do that I do tweet out on and do social media where I can I blogs about it like I the few scientists that tells the world what I do personally and use myself as a role model for people to judge but I never recommend anything because first of all I physician I mostly study mice so I don yet how this is all going to play out in people it be available without a prescription now well it would but it will also be nice if someone like me did a clinical trial so we knew what would happen and want those to take well that would be that the first and foremost I mean knowing the dose to take that effect right it mean don amount just because it makes you feel good I mean let something it definitely is changing to open meaning and an immune system and stuff but I agree yeah you	Success
Nicotinamide mononucleotide cancer study (senescent-cell dependent pancreatic cancer model)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfVEFrXkoQ	FoundMyFitness Clips 	while many animal studies have found that nicotinamide rai beside and nicotinamide mononucleotide can ameliorate age-related disease by increasing nad levels in different tissues there is always one disease context that throws a curveball cancer in a recent study nicotinamide mononucleotide was shown to accelerate cancer growth in mice with a type of pancreatic cancer where pro-inflammatory senescence cells drive tumor growth when mice were injected with 500 milligrams per kilogram body weight of nicotinamide mononucleotide for 13 days they exhibited significant increases in precancerous and cancerous lesions in the pancreas so let little more because nicotinamide mono nucleotides effect on accelerating tumor growth was dependent on senescence cells which can disrupt normal tissue functions and ironically also drive the progression of cancer over time as well this is in spite of the fact that senescence is a program that usually prevents cancer more immediately in the short term the reason this happens is that when cells become senescent they can secrete molecules that tend to have the following qualities they are pro-inflammatory they immune activation and evading the immune system they signaling and also involved in angiogenesis which plays a role in cancer metastasis nad seems to increase this quality of senescence cells likely because it energy metabolism so it senescence cells even more tumorigenic and while this study only looked at nicotinamide mana nucleotides effect on cancer growth it nicotinamide right beside may show similar results in this very very specific context which is a type of cancer where pro-inflammatory senescence cells drive tumor growth that does not mean that nicotinamide mononucleotide or nicotinamide rye besides supplementation will cause cancer or even drive tumor progression and other types of cancer but I will say it would be nice to see long-term animal studies to confirm I sure those are underway you	Success
NAD+ and resveratrol levels affect the aging process | David Sinclair	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE6OBk22uOY	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so nad levels decrease with age and and that you think this is a causal for plays a causal role in the aging process right right so what why is an ID link to sirtuin so sirtuins are enzymes and this is my picture of an enzyme but things like a pac-man that chemical groups off other proteins telling them what to do like a traffic cop and without nad they don they an idea around otherwise you but if the levels go down as they do as you get older and I so my levels probably a half what they were when I was twenty scary thought so my sirtuins are working maybe half as well as they did telling the troops to go out and fix my body so when I go for a run I get less benefit from that I feel tired I don mitochondria are down but by raising up the levels of nad - when I was young what I think is going on based on the animal work we years now is to trick the body into thinking that it been exercising or dieting and that it allows the sirtuins to do their job the way they once did by just having that level of nad higher like it basically like a signal it is so think of it as the fuel in a car if the sirtuins are driving yeah and then the resveratrol that we worked on years ago works on the same enzymes but it accelerator pedal so it actually the NAD is making it work but research oh we come along and make it work even faster so the combination of those two we find is even better than just one alone you	Success
Replenishing falling levels of NAD+ may be a strategy for reducing some symptoms of aging	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bsVUSMxy5g	FoundMyFitness Clips 	something else that really seems to change with fasting is the nad levels yes and that your lab has studied extensively with mr. Timmons is maybe could you talk a little bit about because nad is also extremely exciting to me and it pretty pretty popular these days as well yes so nad is emerged as one of these critical intermediary metabolites think of ketone bodies nad are all I call them currencies I mean so think about your organism as a as a country you need to circulate energy and nad is one way that our body is utilizing within the cell to convert to transfer energy it like the Brinkmann truck carries the money and nad action can actually is a high to so-called hydride acceptor during what we oxidize food you can actually serve as a as an acceptor for electron and it can transfer them for example to your respiratory chain so it circulated within the cell and there growing evidence that it decrease during aging why that happens is still one of the big mysteries and so this has yielded a whole approach that trying to understand first what are the consequences of decrease energy levels and one of the consequence is that enzymes like sirtuins which rely on an ad to exert all of their beneficial activities actually function less well that during aging but also many other enzymes that are involved in our metabolism are relying on nad and so they function as well so you your intermediate metabolizers as well the sirtuins which are global regulators function as well you essentially you know everything becomes a little less yeah a little less efficient so out of this these discoveries came the idea that maybe should replenish the decreasing level of nad and so that this has yielded some discoveries such as nicotinamide ribose ice nicotinamide mono nucleotides which are now being taken by a lot of people and with the hope that it will you know correct some of these problems I one word of caution I think there is we do not know why these levels decrease they could decrease because we have decreased production of nad but it could also decrease because we have accelerated destruction of nad which means if you are if it bringing more into it it pouring more an ad in the leaky sink so I think a lot of our work right now is trying to understand what is the cause of the decrease in an ad during aging and because I think it will yield very different solutions if you find that there filling blood plugging the sink yeah this is keeping pouring water I have a theory yes so I know you know coming from I did a lot of work with DNA damage yes and knowing that one of the main enzymes work exactly I mean if you think about you know so one of the main enzymes that repairs damage as we age DNA damage harp is requires nad and it like if you more damage as you age you have to repair more of that damage and the more and more damage you sucking the nad you know sort of like sort of like almost a triage where it like well you got to keep repairing that damage so then other things like the mitochondria suffer you know so I completely agree and actually that there are two two major theories right now that have been proposed in terms of why doesn activated part and indeed as we age we accumulate DNA damage it it and so the idea is by activating PARP you constantly depletes in your energy levels the second one is we all have in our body a so-called salvage pathway for nad for nad is nad turns over there salvage pathway that allows it to be recycled back to so we can get an ad from the food but also we salvage the one that we utilize them and the salvage pathway has been shown to be to becoming paralyzed while you age there enzyme called an EMP T it has received a lot of attention that enzyme tends to be inhibited by chronic inflammation and and a high-fat diet so one way so it could be a combination of both of these things but it could be other mechanistically we another mechanism which is that they might be accelerated destruction by other enzymes beyond par and getting some exciting results in this direction cool you	Success
Differences in tissue-specific utilization of NAD+ boosters (NAD+ flux study) | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTXWEDBKEYo	FoundMyFitness Clips 	the next point of concern is the bioavailability of either nicotinamide rai beside or nicotinamide mononucleotide the important point to address is whether nicotinamide right beside or nicotinamide mononucleotide can reach other tissues intact and directly form nad without going through that nad recycling pathway that I mentioned earlier called the salvage pathway the salvage pathway would mean that nicotinamide rai beside or nicotinamide mononucleotide were first metabolized into just nicotinamide before forming nad instead of directly forming nad this is an important point because nad produced from the salvage pathway is subject to feedback inhibition and therefore cannot raise nad levels in tissues above a certain level so let an animal study using isotope tracers allowed nad made directly from nicotinamide rai beside or directly from nicotinamide mononucleotide vs nad made from nicotinamide via the salvage pathway to be measured what the study found was that at a low oral dose of around 50 milligrams per kilogram body weight of either nicotinamide ride beside or nicotinamide mononucleotide they produced very low levels of nad made directly from those precursors but only in the liver not in other tissues low levels of nicotinamide drive nad on the other hand were found in the kidneys and very low levels of nicotinamide drive nad were found in the muscles and also in the brain the human equivalent dose of 50 milligrams per kilogram body weight is roughly 4.0 7 milligrams per kilogram body weight so for a hundred and eighty pound person that is approximately three hundred and thirty-two milligrams of either nicotinamide rai beside or nicotinamide mononucleotide which is a pretty doable dose but very little increases in nad were found at least in animals at that dose a higher oral dose was also done but only for nicotine my DRI beside a dose of 200 ml grams per kilogram body weight of nicotinamide rai beside showed no difference compared to a low dose in terms of making nad direct from nicotinamide right beside in any other tissues other than the liver however more of the nad derived from the salvage pathway was found in the kidney muscle and the brain then at the lower dose so 200 milligrams per kilogram body weight translates to around a human equivalent dose of 16 point 3 milligrams per kilogram body weight which for a hundred and eighty pound person is about 1.3 grams which is pretty high when nicotinamide rai beside or nicotinamide mononucleotide were given intravenously at varying doses so 50 milligrams per kilogram body weight or 500 milligrams per kilogram body weight directly produced nad was found in the liver kidney and muscle in a dose-dependent manner however the only nad detected in the brain was that which was salvaged from nicotinamide suggesting that neither nicotinamide right beside nor nicotinamide mono nucleotide crossed the blood-brain barrier it is noteworthy that had to head comparison of identical doses of injected nicotinamide rai beside and nicotinamide mononucleotide produced more nad made directly from nicotinamide right aside in the liver kidney and particularly in the muscle tissue compared to nicotinamide mononucleotide so what does this all mean and should we care what this data from the isotope tracer studies means is that even at very high oral doses neither nicotinamide rai beside or nicotinamide mononucleotide appeared to directly be transported to other tissues other than a liver at least again at those doses that were measured however nicotinamide rai beside and nicotinamide mononucleotide were converted into nicotinamide which was then transported to other tissues and some of that nicotinamide was then converted into nad and at the end of the day isn cellular nad levels what is most important anyway the other animal studies a previously mentioned that showed positive health benefits in tissues like the muscle or the brain were at a very high oral of nicotinamide right aside and nicotinamide mononucleotide in fact in some cases they were double the dose so they were about 400 milligrams per kilogram body weight so it aside and nicotinamide mononucleotide can be transported to other tissues other than the liver at very very high oral doses but that however it very high doses the nad derived from the salvage pathway was high enough to do something beneficial the isotope data also suggests that if nicotinamide Rui beside or nicotinamide meinem nucleotide is administered intravenously both of those compounds are able to be transported to other tissues and directly form nad and not be subject to feedback inhibition this also raises nad levels in multiple tissues to a much higher concentration than otherwise would be of course IV injection of these nad boosters is very challenging to translate to humans you may be wondering why all the messing around with nad boosters like nicotinamide bribe aside and nicotinamide mononucleotide in the first place the reason nicotinamide Rui beside and nicotinamide mononucleotide are popular is because they can be transported into multiple tissue types including the liver kidney muscle and heart the brain is the exception neither nicotinamide right beside nor nicotinamide mononucleotide seem to be able to directly cross the blood-brain barrier but both form nicotinamide which can be transported into all tissue types including the brain where it can then form nad so why not just go to the source and take or inject nad directly well for starters nad has poor bioavailability animal studies have shown that upon ingestion orally administered nad is primarily digested into the precursor nicotinamide but also to nicotine my driver side and nicotinamide mononucleotide before being absorbed while oral bioavailability of nad is low the hope is that intravenous nad infusion may bypass that digestive system the problem is that no mammalian nad transporter has been identified and with the exception of the brain and the heart extracellular nad has not been shown to be taken up into tissues when nad was injected into the abdominal region of mice it was able to raise nad levels in some brain regions similarly mice that were injected with a high dose of nad had increased levels of nad in the heart and also protection from cardiac hypertrophy this suggests that direct injection of nad at a high dose may be doing something beneficial at least in the brain and in the heart I would like to mention that just because no data exists that does not mean that nad delivered intravenously cannot raise nad levels and other tissues other than the brain or the heart it extracellular nad could be metabolized to nicotinamide and that could be transported to other tissues like muscle and also be converted into nad while there is very little preclinical data and zero clinical data on direct IV injection of nad it does seem like this may also be a good idea or a good area to explore as a potential way to boost energy levels and tissues you	Success

Nicotinamide riboside for prevention of hearing loss and the importance of NAD+ for mitochondria	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HBhATHiXQI	FoundMyFitness Clips 	[Rhonda]: In terms of what role it plays,\\nyou know, in the aging process, you know, it seems as though, at least in some of the\\nstudies that I’ve seen, that mitochondrial function really seems to be important and\\nthat you’ve shown that the sirtuin-3 in the mitochondria itself seems to be really\\nimportant for the mitochondrial function, keeping your mitochondria young. Mitochondria play a very important role in\\naging as well. [Dr. Verdin]: A critical role. You know, many of the aging pathways that\\nwe know, be it the unfolded protein response, or mitochondrial biogenesis, all point to\\nefficient mitochondria as one of the key ways to stay young. And one reason is because this is a way so\\nyou can generate energy from glycolysis, which is glucose, carbohydrates, which, as we know,\\nis linked to aging, but also via mitochondria via a process called oxidative phosphorylation,\\nand that process is not necessarily depending on glucose, but is depending on an efficient\\nmitochondrial function. So, we talked about NAD-dependent enzyme. Many of these enzymes reside in the mitochondria. And we found that, for example, the NAD supplementation\\nthat is being tested in a variety of aging model requires sirtuin-3 quite often, this\\nmitochondrial sirtuin, yes. [Rhonda]: Oh, really? Nicotinamide riboside? [Dr. Verdin]: Yes, for example, the paper\\nwe’ve published was focused on the age-associated or noise-induced loss of hearing. So, if you actually subject mice or humans\\nto very acute noise, they have a dose-dependent loss of hearing. You can protect the mice completely from this\\neffect by supplementing with NAD. [Rhonda]: Wow. [Dr. Verdin]: But with nicotinamide riboside,\\nso if you’re going to a rock concert… [Rhonda]: Right, musicians. [Dr. Verdin]: …and you wanna protect yourself,\\nthis is definitely something that… [Rhonda]: Harley-Davidson riders. [Dr. Verdin]: Yes. In mice, it actually had an enormous effect,\\nand we found that this effect was dependent on sirtuin-3, so in sirtuin-3 knockout mice,\\nthe effect was lost. [Rhonda]: Do you know if that was dependent\\non sirtuin-3 in the mitochondria of stem cells, or was it just any cell, or do not know? [Dr. Verdin]: So, in the case of hearing loss,\\nit’s dependent on some really uniquely sensitive cells in the inner ear. But, generally, there’s been sort of an\\nassumption in the field that most of the effect of nicotinamide ribosides, protective effect,\\nare dependent on sirtuin-1. I think in… [Rhonda]: Oh, really? [Dr. Verdin]: Yes. And, in some case, it is. In this particular case, noise-induced hearing\\nloss, it was really clearly sirtuin-3. [Rhonda]: So, even the studies that have looked\\nat, for example, I think there was a mouse, had some sort of mitochondrial disorder, even\\nthat one was dependent on sirtuin-1? [Dr. Verdin]: No, actually it did not. In that case, I think the assumption was that\\nit might be helping global mitochondrial function. And so there’s a growing number of cases\\nand, for example, DNA-damage-associated disease where you see accelerated aging where people\\nhave been testing the effects of supplementation, because those conditions are associated with\\ndecreased PARP activity, just like you mentioned. And, in those cases, I think it hasn’t always\\nbeen clearly mapped what is the real target of NAD that is dependent for the beneficial\\neffect. [Rhonda]: So, NAD levels do decrease with\\nage. Has it been looked at, like, for example,\\nin animals, like in rodents, when they’re fasted, because fasting increases NAD when\\nthey’re fasting and they’re older? Does that help rejuvenate the NAD irrespective\\nof their age? Does it… [Dr. Verdin]: I don’t know. I don’t know the answer to that question. It’s a great question. I think, you know, one thing that I remember\\nalso about fasting and other critical effect of fasting that is really essential in our\\nthinking is autophagy, and so, you know, there’s growing evidence also that autophagy by itself\\nresponds to nutrient availability, so NAD levels, acetyl-CoA levels. This is a new area that people are starting\\nto work in, including my labs, trying to understand what is it about acetyl-CoA, which is another,\\nthink about, currency exchanger in the cells, intermediary metabolite that appears to have\\nnot only a role as a nutrient, but also as a signaling molecule. Acetyl-CoA is in the Krebs cycle. It’s one of the key intermediary product\\nof the Krebs cycle, but it’s also the substrate for a whole family of enzymes called the acetyltransferases,\\nwhich are the opposite of what we were talking about, the HDACs, earlier. So, I think there’s really a lot of crosstalk\\nbetween all of these pathways, and we’re working very actively now on modulation of\\nsignaling the acetyl-CoA and these acetyltransferases. Another approach is to mimic calorie restriction\\nin the fasting stage. [Rhonda]: Yeah. I had Dr. Guido Kroemer on the podcast, and\\nhe has been studying that as well. You know, it brings up a question I remember\\nI wanted to ask you that was sort of, you know, biology is never just black and white,\\nbecause I remember him, with his work, he was talking about how important decreasing\\nprotein acetylation was for activating autophagy, which happens during fasting, but also, during\\nfasting, you have these beta-hydroxybutyrate, which is now…was it class 2 inhibitor? [Dr. Verdin]: Class 1. [Rhonda]: Class 1 inhibitor of the histone\\ndeacetylase, which is kind of the opposite, a little… [Dr. Verdin]: No, because you have to think,\\nso beta-hydroxybutyrate is one step above the sirtuins, and actually the class 1 inhibitors\\nare inhibitors of… [Rhonda]: Oh, they’re inhibitors. That makes sense. [Dr. Verdin]: Exactly. And so it fits perfectly if you go back to\\nthe… [Rhonda]: So class 1 is an inhibitor of histone\\ndeacetylase. That makes sense now. Okay. [Dr. Verdin]: Yes. [Rhonda]: Thank you. There was a disconnect in my brain when I\\nfind to… [Dr. Verdin]: So, the whole idea of… If you think about acetyl-CoA, and we really\\ndraw a graph of acetyl-CoA regulating HATs, histone acetyltransferase, and NAD+ regulating\\nthe sirtuins, and these enzymes quite often stay in opposition, not all of them. But one of the key players in terms of histone\\nacetyltransferase is p300, and that’s the one we’ve worked on and Guido Kroemer as\\nwell has worked on, and it makes sense. You get the same beneficial effects by activating\\nyour sirtuins, which lowers acetylation, as you do by inhibiting an acetyltransferase,\\nwhich also lowers acetylation. So, the message is that nutrient feeding or,\\nyou know, low histone acetyltransferase activity or high sirtuin activity all lead to low protein\\nacetylation, which is beneficial. [Rhonda]: And doing the ketogenic diet? [Dr. Verdin]: Regulates one step above. [Rhonda]: Does also, yeah. [Dr. Verdin]: But, obviously, there’s some\\ncomplexity, because there are some histone marks that are depending on one enzyme. So, this is an oversimplified model, but so\\nfar it holds.	Success
How NAD+ drives the circadian clock and regulates sirtuins | David Sinclair	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCMdpTj0nm4	FoundMyFitness Clips 	something that comes to mind when you sew you important role that calorie restriction or intermittent fasting plays and activating this certain pathway and also deactivating things like the insulin signaling pathway and igf-1 pathway it is the the fact that these sirtuins are regulated by something called nad nicotinamide adenine nicotinamide adenine adenine dinucleotide that but that is something that actually those levels rise during a fasted State they showed it right and in response to exercise as well and so the reason nad is so exciting compared to the 1980s when we thought it was just a housekeeping molecule for reactions is that the levels of nad go up and down depending on not just what you eat but whether you and even what time of day it is so during the day your nad levels will rise and then you eat a big meal and they go down again and it of the reasons you also get jetlag is your nad cycles are out of whack is it on a circadian rhythm is it completely regulated by bite meal no it combination it will be going up and down with cicada rhythms mostly but you can adjust it within what about macro nutrient composition like if you eat more or a high fat versus carbohydrate yeah no one knows that that would be a good experiment that circadian field hasn aware but what I can tell you anecdotally is that if I raise my energy levels when I better if I have a shot of an nad booster in the morning when I get to Australia which I travel to pretty often and so I don working we need more than one person in a clinical trial but it fits with the mouse studies which is that you can use nad to reset your clock what interesting about this is that nad isn being driven by the clock the clock is being driven by nad mmm okay yeah so for people that are viewing or listening the clock meaning the the what state yeah how your organs coordinate what time of day it is and when you jet-lagged your brain might realize that it know see sunlight but your liver still thinks it you feel queasy that and the reason why nad is I mean nad is really important for a variety of metabolic I mean it metabolism for metabolism metabolizing glucose metabolizing fatty acids or mitochondria need it but it important for a variety of other tissues as well activating store to ends and then DNA repair enzyme yeah PARP right you could argue that nad is the most important molecule in the body maybe with the exception of ATP but without either of them you seconds so nad and ATP were probably the first two molecules that life on this planet used to survive and it amino acids as well and so isn interesting that the amino acid levels ATP and NADH is in our bodies that are sensed as to what our environment is like and whether we need to hunker down and survive or go forth and multiply and those are the three main pathways there kinase which is the metformin pathway and then there which i listeners are aware but we into very early aspects of life that found all over the planet and that I think we in the animals often people say it good to be true you know you tweak one pathway and all this good stuff happens well these are pathways that have existed for going back probably more than three billion years and we easy and seemingly safe it is to tweak them you	Success

Nicotinamide mononucleotide cancer study (senescent-cell dependent pancreatic cancer model)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfVEFrXkoQ	FoundMyFitness Clips 	while many animal studies have found that nicotinamide rai beside and nicotinamide mononucleotide can ameliorate age-related disease by increasing nad levels in different tissues there is always one disease context that throws a curveball cancer in a recent study nicotinamide mononucleotide was shown to accelerate cancer growth in mice with a type of pancreatic cancer where pro-inflammatory senescence cells drive tumor growth when mice were injected with 500 milligrams per kilogram body weight of nicotinamide mononucleotide for 13 days they exhibited significant increases in precancerous and cancerous lesions in the pancreas so let little more because nicotinamide mono nucleotides effect on accelerating tumor growth was dependent on senescence cells which can disrupt normal tissue functions and ironically also drive the progression of cancer over time as well this is in spite of the fact that senescence is a program that usually prevents cancer more immediately in the short term the reason this happens is that when cells become senescent they can secrete molecules that tend to have the following qualities they are pro-inflammatory they immune activation and evading the immune system they signaling and also involved in angiogenesis which plays a role in cancer metastasis nad seems to increase this quality of senescence cells likely because it energy metabolism so it senescence cells even more tumorigenic and while this study only looked at nicotinamide mana nucleotides effect on cancer growth it nicotinamide right beside may show similar results in this very very specific context which is a type of cancer where pro-inflammatory senescence cells drive tumor growth that does not mean that nicotinamide mononucleotide or nicotinamide rye besides supplementation will cause cancer or even drive tumor progression and other types of cancer but I will say it would be nice to see long-term animal studies to confirm I sure those are underway you	Success
Metformin and reductions in cancer death | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLoRmQk0SKI	FoundMyFitness Clips 	you know some of the life extension things on the human side I been linked to its ability to prevent certain cancers yeah we yeah and that don get lymphomas and leukemias but the majority of human cancers are or what called epithelial based cancers not blood based cancers they based cancers meaning they tumors you know prostate cancer liver cancer breast cancer ovarian cancer right you know these these are all solid tumors some of the human studies which is what you just brought up I mean that kind of like getting to the human data is what to mention that animal study data because it know depending on gender and dose and time of administration I think that all important stuff to like consider right mm-hmm and we don why I want to say why men why the male mice are so like sensitive to dose in terms of like their their lifespan effects but to the cancer note that you mentioned that interesting there different prospective studies showing that my Foreman reduces cancer incidence and mortality among type 2 people with type 2 diabetes right you know so that important to also consider this isn like these aren you know type 2 diabetes also increases cancer incidence right so the fact that you can find meta-analyses showing that metformin reduces overall cancer incidence by like 30 percent or cancer death by thirty five percent or something like that is not that surprising right you people with type 2 diabetes when they taking so compared to people with type 2 diabetes that are not taking metformin they incidence dysregulated glucose metabolism and all that stuff has been shown to play a role in cancer you	Success
Tim Ferriss discusses vitamin C with Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPF4zySs4TM	FoundMyFitness Clips 	[Tim]: One thing that I C, if you look at protocols being used at,\\nsay, the University of Kansas for antiviral purposes or anti-cancer purposes, the vitamin\\nC is thought of when it as a pro-oxidant. So then I being converted into like hydrogen peroxide,\\nto not mitigate but exaggerate the benefits you want of, say, intermittent fasting. [Rhonda]: That Yeah. [Tim]: If you were doing not even necessarily\\nintermittent. Let Could you do like 50 to 75 grams of vitamin\\nC each day? Would that end up nullifying a lot of the\\neffects or dramatically enhancing the effects? [Rhonda]: So here are my thoughts. I Intravenous vitamin C, you get much higher,\\nup to millimolar concentrations of vitamin C in your blood. So vitamin C is constantly going through the\\ncycle of being reduced and oxidized and reduced and oxidized. When it That but they But all they need is a little push. That little push is like reactive oxygen species\\nor a pro-oxidant like vitamin C. It just pops them, pushes them to death. So intermittent fasting, for example, one\\nof the benefits of intermittent fasting is that your autophagy occurs. Your body is clearing out all these damaged\\ncells. So that would, in theory, if you cells, if they don When they So then they damage nearby cells because the\\ninflammatory cytokines. So it [Tim]: You need to get the cellular Zamboni\\nto clear that stuff. [Rhonda]: That I used to be an ice skater. [Tim]: That Oh, really? [Rhonda]: For many, many years I was a competitive\\nice skater, both freestyle and drills team. So you want to clear them out. I would think that if you have this senescent\\ncell, that would help get rid of it. So very, very interesting observation.	Success
Considerations for glutamine supplementation as it relates to gut health and cancer	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5b3h1F--Sk	FoundMyFitness Clips 	you you sis and I have done a lot yeah research on this and there are questions that I would like to be answered yeah and so since you you have resources I out there um yeah so obviously when you said you know this is this is well-known literature that blue cups and glutamine are both you know sort can mmm it both yeah yeah and I studies on various types of cancer cells and these are in vitro so this is not in an animal model yeah where I can I withdraw glucose and the cancer cells will proliferate slower or some will die but if there what anymore yeah so then I would start withdrawing petaluma yeah yeah let me withdraw this all in vitro though glutamine withdrawal would kill him it yes so glutamine a lethal yeah very little and has been shown by at least some of the studies that were initially done by Ralph de Partie knees when he was was working Thompson yeah later with use establish zoom lab where he radio labeled and showed that actually it was being used predominantly for a Mac you know macromolecular this is not for ya you know which is of course that make sense because a lot of to your cells aren acids actually so I got four new dices on the cell membranes and stuff right so the question for you the question that I have and this is so that end in spectrum okay glutamine seems bad when you perspective and and I did these studies but many people have published on this you there glutamine is really believed that you got two cells it the therapeutic for gut and when you take the mean orally the gut takes it it it the liver take take its share and very little of it actually gets into the bloodstream right so that getting at yeah the question is if you have a mouse model of you know a solid tumor that cancer you know let you tumor brain tumor yeah then you give the mouth glutamine is that really you know so is it really gonna affect the tumor or is it just gonna help the gut I mean of course it could indirectly affect it but the question for me in my mind is what yeah if you had a tumor in the gut man that not take glutamine do not you know but on the other hand if you issues you know can be helpful right do you see what I do in a sense yeah this is something that I stay a night yeah I think except this yeah I like well in vitro it because the way our bodies are working in weight glutamine you know when we take glutamine it yeah it yeah help I take I mean I I yeah that this whole you know this is whole like conflict in my head room I can you know my cancer cells love it yeah but the question is if I I have some you know cancer cells and my you know I don something then I guess he said liver is one thing it does it does use it but so the question is is that harming me or is it helping you should you take it or not yeah I get the question a lot for GI cancers and liver cancer I would say do not supplement glutamine yeah and I would say under most conditions I would say in those those states actually try to look up you know the glutamine content of food and you might want to avoid it or minimize glutamine hai glutamine containing foods otherwise I wouldn some some patients really stress out about it you know but I think if you just keep your protein low to moderate or keep your protein at a level to ensure proper you know you know regeneration and just kind of replenishment of your normal cells and prevent protein deficiency and being in a state of ketosis will help with that to some extent but glutamine is pretty low on this obstacle it think that will lower your blood glutamine levels just being on a kid jiang diet will do that and then you could further lower it by selecting protein food sources that are lower on the end of you know our glutamine or not or avoiding protein types of supplement avoiding glutamine supplementation altogether and you may be able to further suppress glutamine by taking a supplement that chain amino acids high essential amino acids so taking a supplement that is formulated in a way that kind of gives you essential amino acids excluding you know including me of course including me it acid you know it essential but then you you I don you in glutamine in any way but I would avoid I would pay attention to it if you have a GI cancer or liver cancer and then nobody is so if you have say for example like a brain tumor and you taking a drug that can impair systemically you that impairs your GI function then it may be helpful to take a little bit of glutamine because I don think that and the guts gonna be very greedy when it comes to glues Mary so I think just you know maybe even 510 grams of glutamine to help repair your gut we know that if your gut permeability is impaired that can wreak havoc in your body as far as systemic inflammation so so try to try to there repair your gut too but I think glutamine may be a factor you know and helping to ensure proper definitely other ways but my mood Amin has been used in in oncology so yeah glutamine for helping people with chemo combating the issues with chemo yeah and I included me in has almost been like a staple you know so they gave it to a patient yeah help them recover as part of the immune system too you know because you system your gut is like what like 7080 percent of your immune system is right yeah yeah it healthy as possible and there are many drugs out there that really impair gut mobile or the yeah diets yeah you	Success
Does increasing IGF-1 lead to cancer? | Rich Roll	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLtKbVeqCj0	FoundMyFitness Clips 	[Rhonda]: and then there [Rich]: And what is it, the ami-, the hypocyclic\\namines? What do they call it again? [Rhonda]: Well, those are nitrosamines, yeah. [Rich]: Okay. That [Rhonda]: And there the heat... [Rich]: What about the heme, and the sort\\nof implications for promoting IGF-1. Like there are other aspects to that, as well,\\nright? [Rhonda]: So IGF-1 has nothing to do with\\nheme, but... [Rich]: Those are two different things that\\nare going on. [Rhonda]: Yeah, so I So one of the things...So there have been\\nstudies linking protein and meat consumption to cancer incidence. And there was a really well-done study published\\nlast year by Valter Longo And he has been doing a lot of research in\\nthis area. He He does studies on humans that are correlative,\\nso epidemiological studies, but he backs them up with mouse data and then goes into like\\ncultured cells and he teases apart all the mechanisms. So he doesn He first makes the observation. He finds the correlation. And then he goes into the mouse model. And he gives them a certain diet. And he controls everything. And then he goes and dives even further into\\nall the biochemical and molecular pathways in different cultured cells. So which is why he always ends up getting\\nlike a really high impact scientific publication like And he So a study that he published last year, it\\nwas looking at...I but it was people that were eating protein,\\nin meat. And it looked at how much they were eating\\nand correlated it to their all-cause mortality. So they were looking at cancer or they were\\nlooking at different cardiovascular-related diseases. I at those two. And they found that people that eat more meat\\nhad a higher all-cause mortality. They had more cardiovascular disease. They had more cancer. And that was the real main thing. They had more cancer, but it was a certain...You\\nhad...It was people that were older, but not too old. So once you got to a certain age like above...I\\ndon that, the opposite was true. So protein became more important. Protein intake was inversely correlated with\\nmortality. So the higher the protein intake, the lower\\nthe all-cause mortality. And I think that has a lot to do with frailty. You know, as you get older, you fall down\\nand break a bone. You know, muscle mass is also a very important\\nindicator of all-cause mortality. And not everyone that are maintaining the muscle mass and staying\\nphysically fit. So protein does become important as you a hip and then it takes you out, you know. So, but what was interesting about this study\\nis that they went into animal models. And they gave animal models cancer. So they basically injected them with some\\ntumor cells, various types of cancer. And then they gave them either a high-protein\\nor low-protein diet. And they looked at the tumor growth. So it wasn So there And there [Rich]: Promotes the growth. [Rhonda]: Promote it to grow. And so IGF-1 is a growth factor that It It I mean, you want IGF-1. You want it to repair damaged muscle. You want it to make new neurons. And when you However, as you become older and you have\\naccumulated a lifetime of damaged cells...Let say you You You don You want them to die. [Rich]: Right. So the IGF-1 is really like throwing gasoline\\non the fire. [Rhonda]: Exactly. Exactly. So it And so these mice that were given a high protein\\ndiet, the tumors grew faster. Duh. Their IGF-1 was going up. IGF-1 is a major promoter of cancer. And it can allow cancer cells to grow and\\nthrive. And when we have a damaged cell, our body\\nknows it. And our body goes, This is not good. If I don\\ So it kills it, but you know what IGF-1 does? IGF-1 comes over and it\\ Don No, no, we We\\ So it like overrides that whole inherent mech\\npathway that we have in our bodies that are protective against getting cancer. So IGF-1 can be very bad, but it all depends\\non the person. So if you have someone that is very health-conscientious,\\nthat processed foods, refined carbohydrates, not\\neating a bunch of processed meats they eating their healthy meats and they they to minimize their inflammation, they as much of a problem for those people as it\\nis for the person who is eating meat and all of the other bullshit. [Rich]: Right. Right, right, right. Interesting. [Rhonda]: You know, so I think that so when you\\ Well, not exactly, you know. [Rich]: Right. Well, I think it release. I mean, the internet exploded yesterday, right,\\nwith this news. And what that dialogue. So we So there necessarily accurately reflect what the study\\nactually says. I feel like you what these studies mean actually, but most\\npeople aren You know, they And they And they And it camps are sort of solidifying their positions. So you have the like bacon-loving, low carb\\npeople who are basically throwing the predictable barbs out there about how it It doesn studies because that And then I saw a funny headline on like a\\nparody site. It said something about like, 250% more likely to be snarky, You know what I mean? So it And, of course it\\ It say, is ridiculous as well. I mean, I think that this was a consortium\\nof scientists that span not just the WHO, but these other organizations over 10 countries. I think they looked at 800 studies. [Rhonda]: Eight hundred studies. [Rich]: And that dealt with many populations\\nof people. And, of course you can You can It And I think they even did try to control for\\ncertain co-factors. And that actually made the statistics less\\ndramatic in doing so. And they still were able to to come up with\\nthese correlative figures of what was it, 18% for every 50 grams of processed meat,\\nmore likely for, was it, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, 17% per 100 gram of red meat for a\\ncouple other, pancreatic cancer, I think a couple other ones, whatever. So you can parse that out and draw from it\\nwhat you will, but I think at the end of the day, like what I take away from it is saying,\\n is clearly some risks associated with this. And we need to like take a look at that.	Success
Does a low-fat high-carbohydrate diet lead to heart disease? | Ronald Krauss	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UYhPOJ8ES8	FoundMyFitness Clips 	what about carbohydrates process for fine carbohydrates and their effect on small dense LDL particles so you talking about context right that so that takes me back to the nutrition community again so I started as I said I research for a long time and and dietary effects on like proteins as part of our program and I got into the American Heart Association nutrition activity really as a result of that of that interest and in addition to inheriting this confusion between dietary cholesterol blood cholesterol in the in the general public I also inherited from my colleagues and predecessors in the field the mantra that we should be going for low fat diets there was a very strong campaign to keep the message simple and stay away from fat and there were a lot of forces in society as well as in in the academic and industrial worlds that had an interest in and pushing that that message as a way to keep the public focused on what what they felt was the most important thing they should be doing was restricting it found in Saturday in particular but what nobody really thought about seriously was the unintended consequence that that message which the food industry responded to and it well we experts in the field are telling us to use low-fat products and we going to make low-fat foods we make a little fat cookies we make low-fat snack Wells the brownies and and and and so there was this tremendous response which led to a reduction in fat intake and saturated fat levels did go down the diet but the trade-off was an increase in carbohydrate so getting back to your your question we became very interested in studying the effects of a low fat diet on lipoprotein metabolism and so the very first uh D I did when I came here to Berkeley it dietary work was to test the effects of a low-fat diet the traditional low-fat diet this is again when I was talking about with the Heart Association I was thrown in that mode I think a little fad diets are good this is what my predecessors had said and so maybe that be studying and the hypothesis was that people with small LDL would have a good response let me put my low fat diet their heart disease mystery to go down well it turned out that it was actually the opposite we had a completely contrary herself he found the people who started off with large LDL when they put on the low-fat diet actually made their LDL smaller so it went exactly the opposite direction and that was like an eye-opener to me and I think it sort of somewhere percolating through the nutritional world had not not everybody has really understood the implications of this but what we found shortly thereafter is it wasn to the low-fat aspect of the diet that was causing this to happen it was the fact that we were substituting carbohydrates high carbohydrate diets can promote the production of these v LDL particles from the liver that make small LDL so high carbohydrates clearly push a high protein metabolism in the direction of athletes and into Slovenia all the features hype regularized small LDL and still make sense lower HDL and so we dietary response into a more specific role of particular carbohydrates because you know carbohydrates prepara a wide range of food substances ranging from simple sugars like fructose and glucose to complex starches and fiber that are less easily metabolized and do not raise blood sugar levels the way the process starches do so we have been very interested in narrowing that down and we and others have pretty much come to the conclusion that probably the chief culprits in the production of this atherogenic to slip anemic trait on low-fat high-carbohydrate diets are probably the simple sugars and fructose in particular which is of course a component of native of sugar and added sugars half of that is fructose the other half is glucose so we think all carbohydrates have this potential for pushing lipid metabolism in that direction but sugar isn particularly fruit to us we think are the most potent and this has flown in with a huge popular attention now people really do understand I think for the most part that the dietary added sugars have adverse effects not just on lipids or heart disease risk but on many aspects of health and obesity for example being perhaps the biggest public health issue that has been associated with added sugars to Cle from liquids you	Success
What are sulforaphane's effects on cancer? | Jed Fahey	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aN2zAOy9i2U	FoundMyFitness Clips 	let was related to cancer the question was are there any studies that that you know of that would suggest broccoli sprouts would be beneficial for a person who has already been diagnosed with cancer if so which cancers yeah um so i caution here i physician and i don advice um i i would in that instance i would certainly eat a vegetable based diet a whole food vegetable based diet um there are certainly clinical studies suggesting that there may be cancer therapeutic effects um but those studies are all in progress and i i don there is not scientific consensus that um sulforaphane is a cancer therapy or therapeutic certainly um so it will be irresponsible to suggest that my bias is that i certainly think that it is valuable in a cancer preventive lifestyle trying to prevent cancers from starting so if you especially if it it may actually not be wise to take sulforaphane or to supplement or to to go heavy on on broccoli um we just honestly we just don enough we do know that upregulating nrf2 protects protects cells and when you think about it metastasized cancers what growing faster than the rest of the cells around them the rest of the rest of the body for that matter if you adult they the products of respiration and oxidation their mitochondria are cranking away so if you support their mitochondria and enhance their ability that enhance their ability to detoxify things including including perhaps cancer drugs um this may be a slippery slope we just don are some animal model studies in which nrf2 is is genetically upregulated or knocked out and i think those studies the results of those studies suggest that caution is is advised um in cases where people have been diagnosed with cancer um hopefully a lot more to come on that from studies that are underway and in progress in various parts of the world and just to add on as a comment you know speaking to prevention i know there preclinical evidence that really excited me was um there was a rat study and i forget the group that um published a study but the rats were given sulforaphane they were given it before they were given a chemical that causes bladder cancer and the other group of rats were just given the chemical that causes bladder cancer and the rats that were given the dose of the sulforaphane um did not develop bladder cancer and one and if they did the tumors were much much smaller in size so again a preventative you know just more evidence that the preventative approach um seems to be stronger there um it seems as though and you this uh jed about you know the the the tissues that sulforaphane may accumulate in more you know the the bladder prostate breast uh versus other tissues or lungs you know i don all the differences um but the prostate seems to be one that at least clinically there a few studies showing that sulforaphane ranging in dose and the higher the dose the more robust the effect so 60 milligrams of sulforaphane a day was shown to slow the the biomarker prostate specific antigen or psa which people with you know early prostate cancer you know or risk of it or whatever have um and so slowing that by 86 is certainly you know a good thing um yeah so so as a follow-up um shame on you i think that first bladder cancer study you were talking about is also one that i was involved in whereas the beginning of the call i said i because you much every study that i cite almost jed fahey dr jennifer he is an author on so i it keep track of all your publications ted mostly a a minor player so in this case a minor player uh uh a group in new zealand rex monday and uh old old colleague actually the the guy uh who with paul tell they put sulforaphane on the map and i um did this did one of the one of the rat studies i think maybe the one you um with bladder cancer and absolutely this was uh this was benzoyl isothiocyanate as i recall that we used her or or sinogram um allyl isothiocyanate um which come from radish or daikon um or mustard seed so it think about what happens with sulforaphane which most of you i don probably too much to my detriment but what happened you ingest it you take it in the body sees it your cells of your body see it um they actually take it in very rapidly they conjugate it with glutathione they spit it back out then where does it go it goes from the blood to the urine then where does the urine go unless you most of us that are reasonably healthy aren uh although i before so your bladder stores urine up what in that urine sulforaphane and its conjugates well what is bladder cancer bladder cancer is the epithelial cells of the bladder that most most of them the tissue lining that bladder um muta you know a mutation forming and ultimately a tumor developing so bladder cancer we i still think is the ultimate target for isothiocyanates because you protective compounds um essentially all the time you know you empty your bladder and immediately it starts filling back up again certainly the prostate cancer is is another example where mechanistically uh or i should say

How epigenetic predictions align with onset of cancer, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's | Steve Horvath	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M6G7O2o9RI	FoundMyFitness Clips 	what about so disease states you mentioned cancer people with with cancer or alzheimer disease what does like have you you know measured the epigenetic age of these individuals and does it look like it yes so we looked at blood samples from parkinson cases and controls and there question there effect in blood it years you know but it is there alzheimer looked at pre-frontal cortex samples from the religious order study you know and again we found h acceleration in the prefrontal cortex when it comes to blood samples from alzheimer there might be a signal but if there is a signal it um what other disease did you mention cancer i a beast i mean it there yeah cancer is complicated so the exciting insight is that yes blood methylation data indicate that blood samples collected before the person developed cancer show a slight epigenetic age acceleration so that supports the view that faster epigenetic aging is predictive of future onset of cancer and that finding has been validated by many groups problem is this association is weak you know you you need really a couple of thousand people to observe it but but the question is what about if we for example measured um well tumor tissue the signal is huge so if i for example um when i analyzed breast malignant breast tissue samples from women with so-called luminal breast cancer the epigenetic age acceleration is off the chart so their breast tissue is much older than expected um but it complicated have you compared it to their blood like is it yeah is tumor tissue the same no no it would be different i mean i would say that i mean yeah let 10 15 years age acceleration in malignant tissue but in blood i mean that that effect would be much smaller if at all that interesting because you mentioned the alzheimer weak very weakening signal but in the if you mentioned that if you measured actual brain tissue which is where this you know that you find a signal yeah the interesting thing is you said parkinson you do measure the signal in the blood and yeah it if the immune system is playing a role in parkinson yeah i can tell you i can tell you the following so we did this study of parkinson why because i was interested in epigenetic aging however as my software also produces estimates of blood cell counts and so it turned out that the blood cell counts in particular neutrophils were really highly elevated in parkinson huge effect you know and so so in certain ways um um this was completely surprising to me but this finding has now been validated over and over so yes pd cases have highly elevated neutrophil counts that immune system plays a role we don know um is it first an immune dysregulation that gives rise to pd or is it the other way around yeah there interesting links to gut the original gut and the parkinson the immune system is involved in the gut and all that so you	Success
Caloric restriction vs. periodic fasting and the importance of re-feeding after a fast	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv3OUdLl31Q	FoundMyFitness Clips 	calorie restriction is say 20 to 30% restriction in calories so you basically eating all the time and and you just happen to eat less calories fasting and periodic fasting are much more extreme and we really use them to trick or manipulate the system orchestrate a lot of genes to get it to do things like increased protection a lot or turn on stem cells and so you can get by calorie restriction but you can get them by by these more extreme interventions and yeah so calorie restriction also is missing the biggest component of the periodic fasting which is not fast in itself but it right so most people think of the restriction as what turns out as we papers that is the reef eating that is doing most of the work right so that during that for example when we when we publish on regeneration the stem cells are turned on during fasting but it is the reef eating that causes the rebuilding of the system and so the most important part is the reef eating and in calorie restriction of course you never have that so so it how how this works and it coordinated effect based on cycles of fasting refeeding you	Success

Drs. Bill Harris and Rhonda Patrick comment on omega-3 prostate cancer study SELECT trial	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LncobFcnYlg	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so there would i would kind of love to get your thoughts on sure one is a question i a lot of people um will ask me or email me about and it is about this 2013 paper that was published by yeah bradsky pulaski yeah um yes and he he looked at blood omega-3 levels i don was platinum plasma phospholipids yeah omega-3 and the incidence of prostate cancer in a trial of people was called the select trial where people were given high dose alpha tocopherol and or selenium selenium right um and he found a correlation between the plasma phospholipid phospholipid omega-3 and right prostate cancer and it was statistically significant yes it was the the range of high to low omega-3 was like this like 4.6 versus 4.2 something like that it very small which makes you go that doesn plus i mean my biggest i i don criticize the results so much as the discussion in that paper because they said therefore ergo taking fish oil or eating high omega few fish is going to cause prostate cancer they turned a an association into a cause and effect in that study you weren supplement nobody in that study was on omega-3s and so they these guys already had a bent that they didn about them supplements in general omega-3 happened to be the supplement du jour and so their discussion and what they said on tv and what they said on other interviews was what went way beyond the data the data itself have not been confirmed they by other studies those studies don of course and you weird thing hanging out from now eight years ago that still pops up that uh hopefully this podcast will not cause somebody to go look at because if you do look at it realize that the the levels of omega 3 are very tiny plus i mean we we submitted a letter to the editor about that me and michael davidson and one of the things we pointed out was there some cancer cells they can actually up regulate fads activity and you might actually be making some more omega-3 because you got cancer if i mean that again it difference in levels between those who did and those who didn but there are other mechanisms one if it was even true then that you can explain it by and once you have expected it to be repeated with yet there were other studies as you mentioned that refuted that weren yeah that showed that actually omega-3s were more protective even prostate cancer um but i don my thoughts too on this with the selection yeah sure am i allowed to ask her i mean so i you know the the fact the trial design the fact that these men were actually they were given like it was a 400 i used of alpha tocopherol or selenium i mean the the 400 i used of alpha tocopherol uh my mentor bruce ames and his um one of his postdocs had shown that when you give like a high dose of alpha cophoral much like the rda of it is like 25 15 15. something like that yeah um that you basically deplete another um tocopherol gamma tocopherol which is anti-inflammatory and so there actually not good to take megadoses of the vitamins the alpha tocopherol form of vitamin e and so it looking at blood samples from a very confounded you know cohort yeah you assuming that selenium and elephant golfer had no effect on right and we have no idea what could have happened right so i didn interesting yeah and then plus the the the the lack of confirmation of that study it you know get this out there i mean this the study it was not believe this stuff yeah no it as anything that is thought to be good for you but then is not good for you and not only not could be bad for you totally they love you you know yeah it makes it makes the headlines um so glad we got that taken care you	Success
The ketogenic diet and cancer research | Dominic D'Agostino	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoKibvj8VBs	FoundMyFitness Clips 	i can say that we know that dietary interventions nutritional interventions can be powerful modulators of the immune system and in some cases a hypersensitive immune system will contribute to increased intestinal permeability so intestinal hyper reactivity is an immune response and that intestinal hyperreactivity will always lead to intestinal permeability which can lead to uh impairing you know exacerbating an autoimmune condition so i think dietary interventions are working through that way too and maybe suppressing some of the inflammatory mediators il-6 ilm beta tnf alpha things like that so the ketogenic diet interesting can also augment the immune system in ways that makes it hyper vigilant in being able to detect things uh like cancer cells right so the the ketogenic diet enhances the anti-cancer immunity uh of people that are following it yeah so a colleague of mine dr adrian scheck did research with a glioblastoma cell line showing enhanced cancer-specific immune regulation you know with a dietary intervention she was also using radiation and and also i think it needs to be appreciated that there are against the standard of care uh but i think the standard of care in the context of the ketogenic diet is a much more synergistic approach so when you give radiation when you give chemotherapy it and is stimulating tumor lysis syndrome so you you have bits of tumor that are entering circulation and i actually and it about i always think about it in this way when you give someone chemo it killing cancer cells and then you stimulating autophagy and tumor lysis syndrome and then that immune system so you know i think chemotherapy in general is carcinogenic it immune system to then attack the cancer cell in the context of a ketogenic diet that a ketogenic diet especially if it calorie restricting is stimulating cancer is putting metabolic stress on cancer cells and actually stimulating autophagy sort of in cancer cells is stimulating cancer cell death and it makes the tumor more sensitive to a chemotherapy and radiation so you have more tumor die off and you protecting the normal uh healthy cells and it a way that stimulating it more to attack the cancer so i think uh so what i saying here is probably you can any publication but we just know from tumor biology that you know when you stimulate when you kill cancer cells you know through any means you can have this process called tumor lysis syndrome which could kill the patient if you do it too abruptly right but uh that we very you know adamant in advocating a more gradual approach which would be like ketogenic diets maybe metabolic drugs and also hyperbaric oxygen therapy or something that we studied but it needs to be acknowledged and recognized that chemotherapy and radiation also work by stimulating the immune system and it works better in the context of the ketogenic diet which makes the immune system more hyper vigilant to be able to recognize and attack the cancer cells so there of research being done on that now and you know i know the moffitt cancer center which is by usf is very interested in immune-based therapies and using ketogenic diets to enhance like pdl-1 inhibitors like checkpoint inhibitors there pretty high impact journal i forget the name of the journal but it showed that pdl1 inhibitors were greatly augmented in the context of the ketogenic diet and even drugs like metabolic drugs like the pi3 kinase inhibitors are remarkably effective and promising but they have a counter regulatory effect at increasing insulin so when we take these things they can target tumor metabolism but there and in the context of insulin suppression with a ketogenic diet that can unmask and augment and enhance greatly enhance pi3 kinase inhibitors so uh so dr lou cantley is really spearheading some of that work and i think it with a few of the patients in that that are doing like really well uh and they enhance the you know the efficacy of that i know glioma gliomas are one type of cancer that seems to be responsible at least preliminary evidence suggests right yeah that was my my first interest in because i started doing hyperbaric oxygen and i saw some i saw like cancer cells exploding under hyperbaric oxygen so this got me very interested in cancer it was that and i didn were exploding and we had a different a dye that was looking at superoxide production in the cytosol and also in the mitochondria so what i would see is that the mitochondria would light up really quick we were doing optical sections with a landing a laser scanning confocal microscope and i could see that superoxide production was ramping up like super high and super fast when we hit it with oxygen and then i would see the mitochondria disappear and then like the cells would rupture there so they exploding so we oxygen and the tumor cells are taking that oxygen and because the the cancer cells have defective mitochondria they they put out proportionally more superoxide anion which then can be converted to uh you know hydrogen peroxide and more reactive intermediates like hydroxyl radical and then that damages membrane lipids and then you get rupturing of the cells so i was like seeing this and i was like this is very interesting and what it was telling me is that i didn later found out of the warburg effect where you have a dir an altered metabolism like some people say the warburg effect is the cancer cell sort of changing metabolism for its own benefit to redirect nutrients and biomolecules to the biosynthetic anabolic production of of you know to for the expanding biomass of the tumor so that warburg said it was damage respiration leads to compensatory fermentation so the sugar cell consumes more glucose but uh but it was sort of looking at this effect which got me very interested in cancer and ways to target sort of cancer cells and then manipulate the the substrates so that actually was the precursor to our cancer work with ketones because i was using hyperbaric oxygen and then under different conditions i started growing cancer cells and feeding them glucose and ketones and then i would take away the glucose and keep the ketones and the cancer cells would die and then i would have glucose and when i added ketones it would decrease proliferation so this is before i ever published anything but it was like it got the wheels turning i was like there something that needs to be studied here so i had a few different med students replicate each other so they could replicate it so that gave me some confidence and then a phd student came along dr angela poff who hosting metabolic health summit so she does research and among other things but uh and then she actually moved this to the animal model which was ketogenic diet and hyperbaric oxygen and then later ketone supplementation and that was a synergistic combination so the modified ketogenic diet we used was we took out the lard and we put like a large percentage of the fat 40 maybe 40 was mcts and then we also used uh uh omega three fats with flaxseed oil so we at the time i was very interested in mufas and pufa so we took we looked at what ketogenic diet researchers were using i was like well let so we did like 20 instead of like 10 10 you know protein we did like 20 or more protein 20 to 25 and then we replaced the fats with essentially mct flaxseed oil and then we put some fiber in there too and then that became the diet we actually use for the alzheimer research and then we use this diet for our cancer research and our effects were pretty robust and i often think you know was it because we were using you know a diet high in like you know omega-3 oils and we just we also had higher protein which i think was a little bit beneficial but we had high ketones so we did different diets and this diet especially with the mcts gave us higher ketones and seemed to work really well wow super interesting what about the you know the different there cancer and i know we were discussing this a little bit earlier you know the potential for some types of cancer at least in rodent studies uh to you know maybe metabolize some ketones and use them in a positive way to benefit the cancer cell is that something there little bit of i think cancer cell is cancers are more heterogeneous than we field at whole belief at large believes that and that different cancer therapies there are some cancers that are very responsive to the ketogenic diet but when i think of the ketogenic diet as a cancer therapy i don the hyperketonemia treating the cancer cells i think of the therapeutic efficacy of the ketogenic diet is through insulin suppression and and suppressing the insulin pathway limiting glucose availability and also to some extent elevating ketones we know this because if we put exogenous ketones into a standard diet we can extend the life of animals that have metastatic cancer so we international journal of cancer but what was happening was when you put the ketones in the standard diet food they probably eat a little bit less and it changing metabolic physiology but so it may not be uh and then the reviewers rightly asked they said well go do a calorie restriction group so we took a standard diet and calorie restricted like 25 and we saw an increase in uh survival but it was nowhere near the increase in survival from adding the ketones to the standard diet so we did that control uh so to get back to your question yeah i think you know brain tumors aggressive you know solid tumors endometrial cancers maybe certain gi cancers maybe lung cancer you know are responsive the cancers that are associated with metabolic derangement are probably responsive also cancers that are more aggressive or more glycolytic so they more likely to respond and brain cancers are a good a good uh cancer to study because you get seizures with brain cancers and because the the tools the treatments are so limited like leoblastoma we just know that standard of care does not work so you want to use something a dietary approach can then potentially make the existing drugs work or augment the many different factors that could make the brain cancer more responsive to the tumor but there are different mutations there mutation i believe which changes the tumor metabolism in a way that can actually maybe cause acetoacetate to be used as fuel some cancers may respond to ketones in ways that are different than other cancer cells like the brain tumor cells that we in the lab so in particular there melanoma cell line at least that has a b raf 600 b raf v 600 e mutation i believe and and those cancer cells have been shown to use acetoacetate as potentially an energy source but also for biosynthetic reactions and i suspect there different cancer cells that can use ketones not only as a biosynthetic molecule but maybe even for energy too but i think largely cancer cells that are more aggressive have reverted back to a glycolytic phenotype where they primarily relying on fermentable fuels and that includes glucose and glutamine are the two fuels and cancer cells that are more glycolytic and very uh sort of damaged in their respiration due to the hypoxia of expanding tumor mass so as a tumor grows it outstrips its ability to supply blood flow and oxygen to the tumor so it becomes hypoxic and that further damages the mitochondria so it causes the tumor to be more glycolytic and less of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway so literally this would mean that tumor cells especially the the core of expanding tumor biomass would not be able to use ketones as an energy source because it energy you know event uh so in that way we think that ketones are not you know an ideal fuel for for tumors and in our model systems you know it the absence of glucose tumor cells die whereas uh even in the presence of consistent glucose when we add ketones there seems to be a decrease in proliferation and we think that could be due to a ketone induced decrease in hexakinase which is a glycolytic enzyme so there for using ketogenic diets as you know an adjuvant therapy and then maybe some potential as using exogenous ketones as a means to influence the tumor micro environment and also to influence essentially this the metabolism of the tumor as a whole and also as you mentioned earlier with uh with dr eric burden and john ramsey there was a reduction and there possible preventative you know yeah mechanism as well with at least according to animal research there being a reduction in spontaneous spontaneous tumors and these in these rodents um seems promising to study you know as well yeah if there can reduce cancer incidents you know it than to try to treat it exactly so you know that interesting and promising field that and i think i mean those results were impressive so suppressing tumor growth through probably igf-1 and mtor and just suppressing keeping inflammation low and many other you know biomarkers i think it we take these ketogenic diets and optimize it with specific phytonutrients and we add some fiber in and we add i mean then i think then it becomes difficult to figure out what feel that there uh in optimizing a ketogenic diet with plant you know fiber and phytonutrients that we know have anti-carcinogenic effects like curcumin and turmeric and egcg and you know there institute that spend their whole life studying just a handful of these phytonutrients and they show that it has remarkable chemo prevention effects so we should be incorporating these into the ketogenic diet you	Success
Age and gender-specific effects of metformin (animal research) | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPHnF0yE-MY	FoundMyFitness Clips 	you know if you look at male and female mice that were given metformin about a hundred milligrams per kilogram body weight which that dose of like eight milligrams per kilogram body weight so that translates to something like six hundred and sixty milligrams for like one hundred and eighty pound person so that given to mice it decreased the average lifespan of male mice by thirteen percent and increase the average lifespan of female mice by about four percent now the negative effect on male male lifespan could actually be dose dependent so there was another study looking at different doses in male mice so male mice were given either a 0.1 percent or a 1% dose of metformin in their diet starting at the age of like 50 weeks or something 54 weeks their lifespan their average lifespan increased at the lower dose so their their average lifespan increased by close to 6 percent but the high dose it was toxic it reduced their average lifespan by like what I mentioned earlier something between 13 to 14 percent so that consider the dose and then also the age that you know these animals are given their first treatment there was another study and this is in female a lot of studies have been done in female mice because that was female mice have been shown to be the most responsive in terms of lifespan extending effects and female mice that were given again a hundred milligrams per kilogram body weight of metformin starting at the age of three three months nine months or 15 months the most robust effects were happen earlier so at three months the lifespan was increased by 14% if they were given at the age of nine months it increased by only six percent and if they were given it at the age of fifteen months they were the lifespan there was no effect no difference at all now mice live on average around two to two-and-a-half years so it average lifespan so 15 months typically died of just old age it depends you know some of them they get like lymphomas and yeah but they do they die of old age the reason why I ask is that you know some of the life extension things on the human side I to its ability to prevent certain cancers yeah we that human types of I mean humans get lymphomas and but the majority of human cancers are are what cancers not blood based cancers they epithelial based cancers meaning they like solid tumors you know prostate cancer liver cancer breast cancer ovarian cancer right you know these these are all solid tumors some of the human studies which is what you just brought up I mean that kind of like getting to the human data is what to mention that animal study data because it know depending on gender and dose and time of administration I think that all important stuff till I consider right hmm and we don want to say why men why the male mice are so like sensitive to dose in terms of like their their lifespan effects you	Success

Timing metformin to avoid negative effects on exercise adaptation: plausibility | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfMobif8dSM	FoundMyFitness Clips 	these are India people do you think this is something we we because we do want this activation of AMPK right that thing so activation of a pulse which so the activation so here the question right well what if you time your metformin right there consider other than the half-life of metformin or their you know how you the important thing is so for example exercise activates a ampie kinase the activation is relatively transient but the effects of exercise lasts about 48 hours metformin activates an P kinase and the effects of metformin lasts about 36 hours after the last dose so is it the ANP kinase activation that responsible for these effects we don even know like that even known or how long is the complex want to have issuing after you take your last dose is that also 36 hours after we don not to mention that there was just I don another randomized double-blind controlled trial showing metformin this was also in healthy adults that were doing resistance training and they were older adults both of these studies were older adult to 65 80 you know aged 65 years and older but this study also showed that after 14 weeks of taking about 1,700 milligrams of metformin which is quite high that it and this gets back to your friends anecdote the participants that took the placebo gained more lean muscle lean body mass and also thigh muscle mass compared to those took metformin so metformin blunted some of the gains in muscle mass right it also diminished the strength but those results were not significant statistically significance was trending towards your friends anecdote what he what he found with his power and output and stuff you	Success

How sauna mimics cardiovascular exercise: a comparison to stationary bike | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDx1bwymA00	FoundMyFitness Clips 	I would say that some of the most exciting things that have come out in the last year or so have been that a lot of these positive effects on the sauna on heart health also even on brain health you know are very similar to what right basic physical exercise which is not that surprising because what happens when you your core body temperature right you getting hot yes so your skin heart rate goes exactly so these are the things that happen your skin and core body temperature rise there 70% redistribution of your blood flow away from the core all the way to your skin and the reason for that is to facilitate sweating you start to sweat your heart rate increases up to 150 beats per minute you know so all this stuff is very similar well there was a study that came out that showed in fact that what happens the sauna has been shown to mimic some of the effects of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise so a 25 minute sauna was comparable to 25 minutes doing like a hundred watts on a stationary bike and it improved both blood pressure and also lowered heart rate after the so during the obviously during the activity heart rate increase and blood pressure increased in both instances but then immediately after heart rate dropped below baseline levels and also blood pressure drop below baseline levels hmm it really mimic that effect that cardiovascular exercise has say you mentioned 150 beats a minute in the sauna like who gets that high I can sit there for 20 minutes at 175 and I even cross 105 oh really yeah how high do you get about a 120 so I so I usually sit in and the sauna I going in is is probably around 168 because it that about 30 minutes and at the end of 30 minutes here at how many beats I probably get close to around 120 close to it I those my body gets more and more used to it you adapt yeah you	Success

Does contrast therapy reduce the benefits of sauna? | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAhVtr71k24	FoundMyFitness Clips 	on the sauna side of things is there anything new to report on research-wise and then also when you do the sauna are you doing it with a hat or without a hat again have you thought about does the exposure of the heat to the head cause any benefits and then also what are your thoughts on cold showers in between like doing say 15 20 minutes on do a cold shower and hop back in does that is that a good thing or bad thing okay so the sauna the newest stuff that I about is you know there studies showing that frequent sauna bathing has a positive effect on a variety of different heart related diseases you know where it doing it four to seven times a week and lower fatal cardiac heart disease by like 50 percent you know stroke by 51 percent 60 percent lower sudden cardiac death just on and on right multiple studies have shown that there some intervention studies showing that like a single thirty minutes on a session can improve your arterial compliance which is like the ability of your arteries arteries and stuff to respond to stress we hundred and seventy-five or so degrees Fahrenheit for this right exactly for about twenty minutes and and so this and there know the effect on cardiovascular disease also there mortality also lower like 60% lower Alzheimer more - sometimes right and of course cardiovascular health is very related to Alzheimer there shock proteins that also could play a role basically saying in the sauna for longer than 19 minutes there was there a much more robust effect on these lowering of the cardiovascular and all cause mortality than staying in the sauna for like 11 to 18 minutes here the question let minutes when I leave the sauna am I just doing a normal cooldown slowly or can I do the cold shower right afterwards I get to that let me get to that okay okay so let then because all that to answer that question I say there have been some studies that have done a cold so they protocol well they 15 minutes and then they water or something like cold shower I think it was and then back into the sauna again and they were still like some of the same benefits on different parameters of like mitochondrial function and things like that that to do yes yes it that kind of like and again a lot of these studies that I just cited come out of Finland where a good 10 to 20 percent of the population there they the sonnet occult sonnet occult sound of coal right so they not everyone does it but a lot of them do you	Success

Magnesium deficiency and inadequacy is hard to measure accurately | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNJN8wFvPAw	FoundMyFitness Clips 	I would say that I absolutely think magnesium is really really important and as you said you know like they know half at least back back in 2014 you know 45 percent of the u.s. population was not getting adequate amounts of it what does that mean for people like if they feel like I do okay I or something like what is what does that mean in terms of symptoms like why do we need this much magnesium well for one it magnesium is stored in muscle tissue and in bones your your body anytime it it pulls it out of those so your plasma levels unless you deficient your plasma levels aren going to really indicate much of a deficiency so the way that inadequacy or deficiency like I measured is from dietary intake so people aren supposed to be getting you know depending on if they it a day of magnesium and most people aren eating the right foods you know these foods magnesium is high in dark leafy greens it center of a chlorophyll molecule chlorophyll giving plants or green color so things that are dark and green plants how we course it it know affect the bioavailability nuts also a great source but the thing is is you clinical symptom like you to wake up and and go oh my you know like I can see DNA damage happening because magnesium is critical to repair damage of your DNA but that something you can see it something that measured right I mean it you had scurvy right your but you were so vitamin C deficient you had scurvy that your gums started bleeding wake up in the morning you oh my plums are bleeding maybe I like you know should should get some vitamin C but magnesium I mean this is this is one of those things where it types of damage that over the course of decades builds up and starts to lead to diseases of age right you know defects and DNA repair absolute play a role in cancer big-time mold answer and also just in like cellular dysfunction when you start to accumulate damage instead of cells don well including in the brain so magnesium is also critical for the production of ATP and the utilization of it so you can have low energy that is one of you know potentially maybe but see you know the thing is is that it because you need to make energy to survive that that your your all your magnesium then will be used for things that are critical to prevent death in the short term right so this is um part of my mentors theory triage theory on Aging but that he about and published on where you know some of these some of these little insufficiencies in in micronutrients like magnesium they are they are resulting in insidious damage that builds up over decades things that you aren life and actually as diseases of Aging and so you know regulate the aging process itself so I don you a real clinical symptom unless you severely magnesium deficient you	Success
Effects of magnesium L-threonate on the brain: animal vs. human evidence | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL2rQCB46bc	FoundMyFitness Clips 	I know back in the day you are big you were one of the early people to come and realize that there deficiency in the United States and you were one of the very first to start talking about that online which is awesome not too long ago maybe years or so ago I learned about a new form that was developed at MIT called Elfi innate I think I say that right via tieran eight three nine four brain three nap yeah for brain health I you are you familiar with this form and given that you health what are your thoughts on it I am familiar with this form my interest was also peaked when I read some of the earlier animal studies that had shown so that meant that this specific form this magnesium L 3 & 8 was a specific form of magnesium that could cross the blood-brain barrier better than magnesium not in that form and that it like improved cognitive function and prevents the loss of synapses and reverses memory deficits and all sorts of like amazing stuff of course it was very high concentrations in animal studies but my excitement for that is still kind of on hold because there was a clinical study pop one clinical study published actually showing a high dose of magnesium three and eight something like 1500 to 2,000 milligrams a day depending on a person 12 weeks the study claimed that it improved cognitive ability and it relative to placebo but when you look closer at the data the first thing that kind of jumps out is that they looked at whether or not this you know then this is pretty high dose they were giving people you know 1.5 grams or 1500 milligrams a day is a lot there was a very meager increase in plasma magnesium levels hmm very small no difference in red blood cell magnesium so like getting inside tissues would be some and red blood cells are at by the way usually a marker for brain things that get into red blood cells are sometimes used as biomarkers for things that get into the brain for example like DHA and so there was no change in red blood cell magnesium and there was tons of magnesium being excreted in the urine so people that were taking this versus placebo so people are taking this magnesium 3 and 8 were essentially peeing out most of it there was four cognitive tests that were done and if you look individually at each of those cognitive tests there was no like the confidence interval like there was no real significance but when you pulled all four together then you could say that it was an improving cognitive performance with all four of them pulled together a little kind of a little you know I would say yeah a little manipulation there just to get the p-value you want the significance you want so I would say that I absolutely think magnesium is really really important you	Success
Sulforaphane supplements vs. broccoli sprouting | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgYzgQVqyA	FoundMyFitness Clips 	I sulforaphane I know that you know here gosh wet it when you first started doing videos and posts about the benefits of sprouting broccoli seeds and this miracle compound call sulforaphane and where are you now with all that I about it sulfur fame is it formed from a precursor called glucoraphanin and glucoraphanin is found in a variety of what are called cruciferous vegetables things like broccoli brussel sprouts cabbage daikon you know watercress all these things cauliflower these things are all from a cruciferous family of vegetables so gluco rafen is the precursor to it when the plant tissue is you know crushed to torn apart it activates an enzyme called myrosinase which turns glucoraphanin into sulfur fame so fer fame has about 70% bioavailability if you orally ingest it the precursor glucoraphanin only has about 10% bioavailability to be converted into sulfur f---ing so there been tons and tons of intervention trials where people are given either a broccoli sprout broccoli sprouts by the way have about up to hundred hundred times more of the precursor to sulforaphane called glucagon then the mature broccoli plant which is kind of why I sprouts because that can eating so many of them I was eating like tops of those a day and they don good and I them I just I had to go to the supplements yeah well so here thing the supplements so there there have been you know scientifically validated to really have what they say they have so for free and not is not a very stable molecule it and it know in a supplement form there two supplements that are really I would say have been clinically validated and but have been used in randomized controlled trials that have been pure you know peer-reviewed and published one is I way I have no affiliation with any of these supplements or sample but companies at all you don have any yeah it have any affiliation with any something I don that because people don no I don neither do I yeah good to mention I been taking you know there supplements one I think AB McCall has around three point five milligrams of sulfur refrain in each tablet and the recommended dose on their bottle is two tablet so that would be about seven milligrams of silver Fang the other supplement is called prostate Pross the fame is unfortunately not available in the US I shouldn say that yeah it because sulfur vein is so unstable like the company just didn with like the whole shipping it to another country and all that and dealing with all that right but you can buy like I buy pasta fain there pharmacies you can have it shipped shipped to you oh really yeah like I arriving arriving tomorrow also even you stopped with the broccoli so each processor vein tablet has around 10 milligrams of silver in it there are trade offs you know verse you know for doing broccoli sprouts or vs. supplements I would say first and foremost the supplements are expensive prostitution is really expensive they like fifty fifty dollars a Packer something like ninety something dollars for a pack of sixty for reprocessing it has how are you taking a day one 60 day supply we each one has ten milligrams in Episode four a fan and I get to that dose babe maybe I should talk about some of the clinical I mean there have been really exciting in the past couple years cool yeah please do let me just finish with the sprouts they cheaper and you get a ton of sulfur so like 400 grams of fresh sprouts use something around like 40 milligrams of sulfur refrain you know can be bio you know basically you can get something around 40 milligrams of sulfur that lot right for a lot cheaper now the trade-off is its pain you have to like work right have to make them I mean they there very they can easily be contaminated and I and it kind of gives you some you know it there you should bleach the seeds first and then and I don comfortable bleaching the season do it I just don that been doing the processing for one simple reason I running found my fitness and trying to do all this research and stuff and and also trying to like exercise and there just I just this too much you know this is too much for me so I found it easier for me to take the prostitutes implement I would like to get back to the sprouts and I will probably mix that up again but for now I way that seriously am i keeping my fridge looked like a little mini farm like it was like Farmville up my fridge it was like there was sprouts everywhere and yeah some of them are going bad like me and I was freezing some of them and yeah you	Success

Omega-3 phospholipid DHA and supplementation | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV_5B38s2Ak	FoundMyFitness Clips 	one of the things I want to cover that has changed since we last talked is you had really gone deep and and published a paper around the phospholipid form of omega threes and its benefits I was wondering if you could bring us up to speed on that and what your current thinking is on omega-3 supplementation so when it comes to if we about phospholipid DHA when it comes to DHA in general DHA is one of the Omega threes it marine sources really what I care about is you know getting it to the brain that the only type of DHA that crosses the blood-brain barrier is DHA that is bound to albumin which is a protein found in your bloodstream transports a variety of you know goodies in addition to DHA to other tissues including the brain but there are two forms of DHA that are bound to albumin and these two different forms are transported by different mechanisms so the first is DHA that is not as terrified it anything other than albumin so it free fatty acid form and I often refer to that as DHA free it not bound to anything mm-hmm aside from albumin it gets transported across the blood-brain barrier via this mechanism that just means it crossing the blood-brain barrier and the blood-brain barrier there things that you know make it up but one of the things that discussion is that endothelial cells align the blood-brain barrier and there the endothelial cells are attached to each other by tight junctions so this passive diffusion mechanism where free DHA gets across the brain depends on the integrity of the blood-brain barrier so unfortunately as we age the blood-brain barrier becomes compromised and this is even more of an issue in people that have an AoE four allele apoe4 is just a gene and allele just means you know one copy of the gene you have two copies of every gene one from your mom one from your dad so we have two alleles of every gene and just to bring people up to speed if you have one copy of this gene you are how much more likely to get Alzheimer disease people that have one copy of the apoe4 allele are about to two fold more likely to get Alzheimer that have no copies of it people that have two copies of it it common so about 25% of the population has at least one copy of it to copy is much much less common I don percentage off the top of my head but you can figure the math out if you know 25% hasn copies would be but that increases the risk for Alzheimer anywhere between ten to fifteen fold and what percentage of the population that is diagnosed with Alzheimer has at least one copy anywhere between 65 to 85 percent Wow yeah so this is a pretty big indicator then it is and we could spend like hours talking about the reasons why that is and I do talk a lot about that in my paper that he published last October in Fast of journal but basically to get back to the whole DHA part of the story I mentioned that there the brain this one form that know not bound to anything other than albumin it goes through passive diffusion however apoe4 actually disrupts that because it does compromise the blood-brain barrier and that even gets worse with age things like traumatic brain injury also compromised the blood-brain barrier the good news is there is another form of DHA that is bound to albumin it specific type of phospholipid form called lyso phosphatidylcholine DHA or DHA lie so PC as I like to call it for short and that the blood-brain barrier through an entirely different mechanism it uses a transporter called M FSD to a and basically when this phospholipid form of DHA binds to the transporter the transporter flips it across the outer membrane into the inner membrane of the blood-brain barrier and it potentially bypasses any defects for example in tight junctions and affiliate cells that I was just mentioning which by the way April before does disrupt tight junctions in lining the blood-brain barrier so I sort of argue in my latest publication that the specific DHA lie so PC form of DHA may be a nice way to bypass that you know defect that April before causes or even just normal brain aging causes where you can get DHA into the brain is your hypothesis here that lack of this DHA is a cause potential cause of dementia yes specifically making a people with apoe4 more susceptible to it so DHA plays a lot of important roles in the brain it plays a role in preventing and ameliorating a couple of the hallmarks associated with Alzheimer tau tangles and amyloid beta plaques and that it can lower the amyloid burden and also tell tangle pathology in people that have them so specifically people with Alzheimer improve cognitive function the other thing that DHA does it important for transporting glucose across the blood-brain barrier and this is a really major hallmark of Alzheimer into the brain basically hmm that is actually something that can be observed before any other clinical features of Alzheimer specifically found early in people with apoe4 so DHA is important for increasing levels of the transporters that transport glucose across the blood-brain barrier the glucose transporters so I always thought that you know people for a while we Alzheimer type 3 diabetes I called that before I always thought an increase or too much glucose in the body would be a bad thing but here you saying the brain getting a lack of glucose is a bad thing what I here yeah is that getting not having glucose in the brain can be a bad thing but that obviously from like dysregulated blood blood glucose levels and insulin insensitivity like those things are all hallmarks of aging and cause multiple multiple problems for sure it a different thing that I here so like bran glucose levels are important for preventing a lot of the the hallmarks associated with with Alzheimer and this has to do with a lot of like very specific molecular mechanisms having to do with like forming tau tangles and stuff like that so not being able to get glucose into the brain can play a causal role in Alzheimer disease and perhaps that is also linked to this type 3 you know diabetes that you know completely separate but sort of parallel mechanism has DHA I think it could play a role in in addition right so DHA is important for getting blue close in the brain but also some newer research does indicate that you know insulin insensitivity can reduce you know glucose getting into the brain as well so those two things could even possibly synergize who knows I mean it would be nice to see data on that yeah but in terms of getting the DHA in the brain and like the question you kind of asked at the beginning and I people are wondering is well like what are the dietary sources of these you know different types of DHA the free DHA versus this lie so PC DHA the one that a phospholipid form that across the blood-brain barrier and the simple answer actually is that all dietary forms can form either of those forms of DHA that there complicated answer that you know involves even getting down to the chemical level so DHA looking at dietary sources like fish fish roe krill oil those are all sources that have DHA in phospholipid form predominantly you find phospholipid form being phosphatidylcholine as the phospholipid triglyceride form is found in fish also in fish roe and also in higher quality fish oil supplements or DHA supplements there find in supplements a majority of supplements that are molecularly distilled which is the process used to purify fish oil to purify away contaminants like mercury PCBs etc a lot of fish oil supplements are found in ethyl ester form some are even in free fatty acid form those forms are a little less bioavailable than triglyceride form oil supplements mm-hmm but the main thing here is actually the difference between ingesting it in phospholipid form versus any of those other forms because those other forms to some degree are metabolized in a very similar manner compared to phospholipid form and the reason for that is because phospholipid form again found in fish fish roe a variety of different you know eggs fish eggs caviar as people call it and also krill oil have DHA in this phospholipid form predominately fostered all choline and the phospholipid form has this backbone it the thing that differentiates it from the other forms is that there two DHA s attached there could be a DHA attached at two positions on it positions meaning different carbon atoms one on the sn1 position as its called the one on the sn2 position and so the triglyceride ethyl ester all those those those forms have DHA on the sn2 position and there DHA is metabolized on the sn2 versus sn1 position on the sn1 position where it found in this you know in phospholipid form you can actually metabolize it and it retains its phospholipid form throughout metabolism it gets cleaved by an enzyme and it forms DHA lye so PC that form that you know bound to albumin across as a blood-brain barrier through a transporter the DHA on the sn2 position which is found in all forms is cleaved by an enzyme it forms a free DHA molecule which then is bound up in LDL instead of HDL and enzyme Cleaves it out of the LDL and it can form either free DHA bound to albumin or it can form the DHA lie so PIPC so it can form either but the bottom line here is that for the the the phospholipid form the dietary phospholipid form you consuming you your buck in terms of forming that DHA lie so PC form that you want to cross the blood-brain barrier mm-hmm that the bottom line so the majority of supplements that you see out there mostly as a triglyceride form is that right the high quality ones are triglyceride most of Uncle are actually ethyl ester oh really yeah yeah because there come more costly you know when you molecularly distilling these fish oil supplements they triglyceride form which is what they originate in and and they ethyl ester backbone and and that they like run it through this column where they this chemical stuff and then at the end of the day a lot of people just leave it in that form because the enzymes your pancreas and small intestine things like that they can recognize that ethanol backbone and cleave the DHA off of that hmm the higher quality fish oil supplements after that whole molecular distillation process then rias terrifi it to a triglyceride form so it extra step so extra step means more money right right and so that say higher quality higher quality usually also means you have to pay more for them you know as well what are your thoughts on say eating salmon roe versus getting a krill supplement versus finding a form of omega-3 that is phospholipid I know Nordic Naturals came out with one not too long ago what do you recommend there so I should probably start with this fish contain around 1 to 1.5 percent of their DHA in phospholipid form the remaining is triglyceride form fish roe and this includes salmon roe herring roe Roe flying fish roe they contain between 38 to 75 percent of their DHA in phospholipid form I didn know this is a flying fish roe as well that yes it is down because it doesn know yeah there yeah right yeah I know I know you have a harder time than I do eating salmon roe for example you like my husband he it take yeah I take it like pills I like it scooped in my mouth and then just like drink water real quick or pop them real quick to make sure they get all out and then it mine I put mine on a little bit of seaweed with a slice of avocado and some lemon sometimes a little ginger and really - I really like how that tastes I gave it to my son now he he likes it with this type of cheese called borscht borscht conversion Bo you are si an it like this like cream cheesy garlic or you know stuff this is great and it masks the salmon roe taste and so he gets that almost every morning and Dan is getting that he he get he like sit on this like paleo waffle with some sour cream and that cheese and the salmon roe and that totally masked it like you know so for me like I can just you know I can just eat that stuff but I probably should mention that this form this DHA lie so PC form in addition to B what I argue and my most recent publication to be really important for brain aging and preventing Alzheimer particularly for people with apoe4 alleles also it animal studies to be a preferred source of DHA to be taken up into the developing brain in fact it in some cases ten times better than DHA and free fatty acid form hmm so that kind of why I mentioned my son you know he mental stage and so that trying to get him the salmon room but back to the whole important question that you asked because it really is it is an important question I mentioned you know 38 mm 5% of DHA in these you know in these different rows from fish are found in in phospholipid form krill oil is another phospholipid form you mentioned and about 35% of the DHA in krill oil is phospholipids krill oil supplements are not very high in terms of their concentration so if you look at a majority of krill oil supplements out there consumer available supplements you milligrams you know / - soft gels or something like that is what you compared to like what I take in my fish oil supplement which is each pill has 500 milligrams of highly purified DHA so two pills have a gram so one gram compared to 60 to 80 milligrams I mean even regardless of the fact that they you know more of that DHA is bioavailable to be to form the phospholipid DHA form the DHA lie so PC you gram of fish oil yeah what I choose to do is I actually take fish oil and I take I eat salmon roe and I eat fish so I do all of those things do you have any preferred sources of where you get your supplementation oil so I take a fish oil it so it it it in Norway and he is basically convinced me that it purest forms of fish oil he doesn any lemon or strawberry anything to mask the fish one little trick in the industry is unfortunately it can mask the smell of rinse you know when something you can smell it if you pop open a fish oil pill you can definitely you don even have to pop it open sometimes you can smell it you definitely taste it that strawberry flavors and stuff like right he doesn there and it first when I first met him I I popped open one of his pills and tried it and it was like the best tasting I couldn believe I could just eat it like it was oh you actually chewed it up I just yeah I did yeah that does that that wondered because I handled I give him mega threes to toast her time watch him chew him up I like my little tester yeah totally I actually pop open those pills and I put it in my son with lots of butter so so he the DHA pills in his oatmeal as well where and again at is that it tastes good so it I should mention that I don ties to this fish oil company I don get any kickbacks I with him but he is a friend of mine and you do a gram of that a day I actually take three grams a day Wow yeah so that upper limit of this like have you read about any downsides any potential downsides of doing high dose the only potential thing I high dose EPA and it is and it is really possibly because it can inhibit with like leukotrienes and stuff things that are involved in like blood clotting that maybe it can send the blood a little bit so it could you know contraindicate people that are taking blood thinning medications but there large randomized control trials coming out now showing that highly purified epa in high doses up to three grams a day are like dramatically reducing triglycerides and lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease and so it that right yeah he P is more linked to heart health right well it potent anti-inflammatory which is linked to brain health inflammation in the brain so there showing that it may help with depression specifically EPA as well hmm so how do you balance that if you doing three grams of DHA do you do a gram of EPA or so the high DHA that I get so he so he makes two different versions a high DHA a high EPA and the high DHA does still have EPA in it just to a much you know smaller degree and I don recently you know I was really you know while I was breastfeeding you know it was like super hardcore about getting tons and tons of DHA I you know through the salmon roe and also you know like taking the 3 grams which is turns out to be six pills of these high DHA and and there because there that like women that take in in a dose-dependent manner DHA and breast milk increases and like and there it really like it reaches a limit but it a super high doses like 10 grams or something like that Wow now I to do high DHA and high EPA but I take I take one in the morning like one I sort of like taking my different times the day but DHA is is basically been my you know my number one thing for a while just because of pregnancy and breastfeeding and all that but but I trying to take notes actually you	Success
What's the Optimal Level of Vitamin D?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQwK1-JNcIM	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so I want to ask you a question about this so what do we know about the relationship between call it naturally acquired vitamin D through sunlight versus supplementation of vitamin D uh exogenously through you know a supplement do we do we have any reason to believe that those are different at the same level of vitamin D in the same like like in terms of like how Vitamin D is acting so the thing is is that when you things going on right that like if you you oxide like there that you there like with respect to let every like let you convert the vitamin D3 into the 25 hydroxy vitamin D into the 125 you know at that level it you know to some degree I mean that not when it vitamin D receptor like the the the actual 125 hydroxy vitamin D which is the active steroid hormone it it same y um now with respect to like you know your body regulates how much vitamin D3 is converted or is released into the bloodstream and converted into 25 hydroxy vitamin D at the level of sun exposure so at a certain level you not making the vitamin D3 when you gotten so much of it that avoid toxicity right like you you highest level of vitamin D A person can ever get to naturally meaning if if you just like took a an individual and put them in the sun put you know shorts only no shirt go out there and work in the Sun for all summer like how high like how high were were my vitamin D levels when I was in high school working construction I know I I I know there like data out there where where people have looked at like you know um you know people that are that are like out in the they but they looking at uh people like in the tropics and stuff that have uh melanin yeah which again so it might depend also on on that but that would be an interesting at least way to say like the if the body has a built-in mechanism to say I going to let you make more vitamin D than this do supplementing above that would be a bad idea it yeah like and so that think that threshold is um I I think going above 60 nanograms per milliliter is probably still okay like going to 80 you know like there looking at 80 and it with lower all cause mortality um and in fact I mean honestly if you start to look at some of the literature you have to take a really high dose daily for like a decade to start getting like the the high calcium but like the problem is that when you absorb um when your V when you have a lot of vitamin D you absorb more dietary calcium and you also absorb more phosphorus and calcium plus phosphorus can precipitate right and so like there but I think most people are not menting like there crazily supplementing and it just think more of everything is good but I don that like I don 7,000 I for most people some people have to take more than that because they have Snips right and you in your patients where it had to take a high level just to get up to 30 or 40 um this by the way is why I think all these vitamin D trials the mega trials are so flawed is they always doing it on the basis of a they and they like to me the dispositive study on this would be take a whole bunch of people whose vitamin D is 30 give half of them a placebo give half of them whatever vitamin D is necessary to get them to 60 or 80 80 yeah get something higher yeah get create separation go 30 to 40 but be like do it the way we do blood pressure trials when we do a blood pressure trial we don fixed dose of a med we give you whatever dose of the med is necessary to change the blood pressure so we two blood pressure level s not Placebo versus 10 Mig of a drug that for one guy is too much and for one guy is too little and yet this isn vitamin D and I find it infuriating that we have no really good reliable RCT data on what seems like a jugular question are you better off with a vitamin D level of 80 than you are of 30 I mean again we think the answer is yes but the you know evidence-based medicine you know crowd will tell you no because this trial that gave people 2,000 IU for 10 minutes found no difference right or they they measured maybe if they if they measured anyone like 10% of the population yes exactly like the most recent study we only got a level on 10% of people with with like you know the fact of the matter is so many people do have these Snips too yeah and I remember having an email dialogue with Joanne Manson this was years when I was postto and I was and she was I think at the time she was doing the vital study it hadn it was like please please can you get the snip data in there can you get measure the levels like do everything you know like it but I what is clear is avoiding deficiency and I do say that a lot because and where are you drawing the line is is 30 or 40 where you I say 30 I mean it it does depend on are you looking are you looking at what the endocrine society says uh is more of an adequate level or inadequate are you looking at deficiency where you know like your bones are like your bone health isn I I I want to know the same thing like I 50 60 but I yeah you know and I don it side of caution you know air on the side of caution certainly avoiding deficiency yeah um but even with respect to like all these genes I know like what if there talk with that there is cross talk but what if there a level of vitamin D you know 50 50 or 60 NRS per milliliter does help alleviate some of the effects of having no estrogen you know like we don really know interesting it is especially when you look at the mechanism and I like I said I spent a lot of time looking at these response elements and and I you know looking at the fact that estrogen can actually compensate for um vitamin D deficiency in some cases with certain genes too and it goes both ways so I be an important uh component in the equation right um but I the tent like like this even this I was talking about where there was protective effects against you know in the cardiovascular health in uh cancer prevention with uh hormone replacement therapy when initiated like you know within a a close range like not greater than six years so was six years or less so if you you that only did it for like 10 or 11 years and they stopped Y and it happens then when you started at 55 you know like so we don we don mean the answer to that either um but I	Success
Peter Attia on What It's Like Getting a VO2 Max Test (key markers to look for)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep-q3POpB3c	FoundMyFitness Clips 	have you done a VO2 max test yet I haven any doctor or do typically doctors don do it no you typically go to um well when I did when I lived in San Diego I used to do them with my coach so he would do them um in in Austin we send people to UT like we just send people to the university and get them done so very inexpensive test like like a hundred bucks or something like that right so they of two ways which is a bike or a treadmill and I always tell paatti do it in the way you train cuz there know there cyclist and make them do the running test or vice versa so it sounds like you so you would do it on a bike because you they it be incredibly tight it can interference from the outside world in terms of air that you escape and no air from the outside can get to you there are two gas sensors on the outside of the mask one for O2 one for CO2 this is the bread and butter of this whole device if those sensor aren calibrated correctly or they don the test is meaningless and like one out of 10 times they fail so you got to make sure whenever you per the tech who does it has calibrated this thing and knows what to look for if the calibration fails during the test uh we just had a patient do one recently the test failed so um you put on a bike and it urg which means unlike the pelaton where you set the resistance and how like let well that doesn by itself how fast you pedal also determines the wattage that here here the computer is telling the bike how many watts to put out so the hard the faster you pedal the less the resistance will be okay okay but it fixed wattage so they might say look Ronda we Watts nice little warmup we have you spend you know five minutes here and then like three every three minutes we watts or something like that and there you know within about 15 minutes you going to be in crunch time and at that point they the wattage every minute and you going to you has left the station like this is unpleasant and you have to keep your RPMs High the test is usually aborted if you can or 60 so as you mind these are all the things you don want to fail the test because you didn know the test right you know what I mean um let the physiology be the place you fail um so make sure when you that pelaton you really comfortable in that 80 to 100 Zone um of RPM and um and so what is the tech tech looking for so the tech is looking at a bunch of data so what they are the things that are being measured so they every moment in time they know how many watts you because they generating by definition everything they measuring V2 so ventilation rate of oxygen and vco2 ventilation rate of CO2 they also at every moment in time see the ratio of vco2 to V2 that respiratory quotient or RQ it known as rer that ratio in any moment in time tells you how much fat you oxidizing versus how much glucose when that ratio is7 you are 100% fat oxidizing when that ratio is085 it and above you carbohydrate so what you when you do the test is you won the report the summary you will also want the raw data which is pages and pages of a spreadsheet and you of go through and you can see how these things change so when I used to do my tests I used to plot my own data I would just get the spreadsheet and I would make the fuel partitioning curve so what I would draw would be Aur what I would have Excel plot for me is on the x-axis I would have wattage because I cared more by wattage than by heart rate so you have either wattage or heart rate on the x-axis and on the y axis I double y axis and the y axis would be either calories or preferably grams per minute and I would have carbohydrate oxidation and fat oxidation so fat oxidation goes down from as the test starts so it usually has an early Peak and then comes down as intensity goes up and carbohydrate oxidation just Rises monotonically and there two cross some people call that your Anor robic threshold um but that respiratory quotient is equal and if you if you do it in grams per minute it won because obviously there calories in fat than oxygen so one of the other metrics we care very deeply about in our patients is what is your Peak fat oxidation and where does it occur and we plot that so we we we plot their V2 Max we plot their Zone 2 and we plot fat oxidation and not surprisingly there there there family of curves that we put the patients on so we say this is what someone with type 2 diabetes looks like this is their fat oxidation curve this is what a worldclass tourto France cyclist looks like they couldn further apart and this is everything in between and where do you stack up so what you want is is the highest amount of fat oxidation and you want to be able to sustain that for as long as possible now if you do this on somebody who is heavily carbohydrate restricted you will get an artifact of the test because their resting our Q is very very low okay and so it of that are other than we typically will will feed people carbohydrates before they do the test um like in the days their V2 Max won their V2 Max no because the V2 Max is literally taking the peak V2 that they achieve and dividing it by their weight in kilos what V2 Max do you aim for and if you can recall I know that jam 2018 paper which was probably one of the most convincing studies that V Max is like one of the best metrics of Health and Longevity and there was an even bigger paper that came out that that Jama paper had 120,000 subjects in it there was a jaac paper that came out a year ago that had almost a million subjects in it and it showed the exact same findings do you so the findings if if I recall was like both of them are in the book I think I have I have figures from both of them in the in the you had the numbers in there okay um and that so that was like the top I just remember was like top percentile I mean they had like 80% lower the yeah if you compared the top the difference in Risk between someone in the bottom 25 percentile of V2 Max to the top 2 and a half% has a hazard ratio of five meaning it greater all cause mortality if you the bottom 25% versus the top 2% okay so if I want that number do you know it or I mean what what like the top yeah are you are you 30 to 40 I you 50 um I would guess but the table is in my book so I can that right now I would guess that it 40s okay yeah so roughly probably like 46 47 48 milligrams uh um sorry milliliters per minute Kil to do but	Success
How to Increase Insulin Sensitivity (and the optimal blood glucose for longevity) | Peter Attia	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WoAry7SquM	FoundMyFitness Clips 	and so the major obviously it seems like lifestyle factor that is regulating you know glucose disposal insulin sensitivity I mean it seems like both of these things are affected by the contractions of muscle and increasing those glucose Transporters right so that exercise is probably the single most important thing we have at our disposal to increase insulin sensitivity and and then there are other things that are very important right so energy balance really matters sleep really matters so uh both acute and chronic disruptions of sleep will impair that system it entirely clear Why by the way the experimental evidence is undeniable and these are experiments that are so easy to do well that they Right Where You disrupt people you know you take if you just took a normal group of people and you did like what clamp which is a an experiment um where you you run IV glucose and IV insulin into people and you basically run a fixed amount of insulin into somebody and then determine how much glucose you need to put in to keep their glucose level fixed that keep glucose fixed um that the gold standard for measuring insulin sensitivity so you do that test on somebody and then for a week sleep deprive them for you know down to five or six four hours a night call it four four would be very dramatic uh within days you their ability to dispose of glucose with no other difference no dietary difference no exercise difference so we don but it so sleep disruptions impair this um energy imbalance uh impaires this hormonal changes impair this right so as we age uh both the reduction in estrogen and testosterone impair this hypercortisolemia impairs this uh and then of course inactivity is the is the is the greatest thing that drives this I definitely uh didn experiment you mentioned it to you before I had my my CGM and when I was a new mother it was you know clearly my sleep was being disrupted I was getting up and breastfeeding and you know I mean it was it was like night and day difference in My My My fasting blood glucose my glucose disposal my postprandial levels I mean it was like clear we would have asked you to take that CGM off not that would be an awful time to wear a CGM but I did find that my going to my hit class even though I was like just dogged tired like the last thing I wanted to do yeah really did normalize it so um is there a postprandial level that like you know let low carb diet like they like because that right but like they just you know they omnivore diet more paleo-ish or Mediterranean is right is there a level that you think postp prandial you know glucose levels like a threshold they that would signal like oh you shouldn really be going or it mean um um here think we know more clearly um we we we certainly know with more conviction that the average blood glucose the lower it is the better you are and I say that even outside of diabetic range now I don that because the study but I can tell you that by proxy based on hemoglobin A1c data so the hemoglobin A1c data make it very clear that lower is better even outside of the range of diabetes so Di IES is defined as a hemoglobin A1c above 6.5% that translates 6.5% is an estimate of an average blood glucose of 140 milligram per deciliter so assume for a moment that if you have a CGM that says 6.5% meaning you just trigger the threshold for type 2 diabetes your hemoglobin your your CGM would say your average blood glucose is 140 Mig per deciliter nobody disputes that that harmful the question is is it better to be at 130 120 110 100 like at what point does is is it too low and what the hemoglobin A1c data would suggest is being at 5% which is about an average of 100 is better than being at 5.5% which is an average in the 11 both of those are normal by our current definitions neither of those would be pre-diabetic even so 5 and 5.5 are both considered completely normal levels but the all cause mortality data or the data on all cause mortality suggest a better outcome if you five rather than 5.5 okay that suggests to me by proxy at least that an average blood glucose of 100 on a CGM would be better than that of an average blood glucose of 115 so that metric we care about we use other metrics to think about that so that since we can time looking at postprandial spikes and variability so looking at the standard deviation which you can get off the CGM and just the number of times you exceed a threshold and that threshold you could say maybe make it 1 15 or 140 milligrams per deciliter and you can just say how many times in a week do you exceed that threshold that might give you some indirect proxy of how much insulin are you secreting in response to that because for example if you took two people who had an average blood glucose of 110 milligrams per deciliter by CGM but one arrived at it with you know levels like that and one arrived at it with levels like that the former would be a better way to achieve that than the latter but you know there are lots of things that raise glucose that are not harmful for example that hit class that you were doing probably in the short term really spikes your glucose because your liver is really trying to meet the demands of all that exercise so it putting a ton of glucose into your circulation and it right thing which is always air on the side of too much because in the short term it too little so if I a really hard workout I mean I that glucose get to 160 Which is higher than it will get with a meal that goes right back down though because yeah	Success

Peter Attia Goes in Depth on CANCER (and why aggressive screening is ESSENTIAL)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m1VNppOqyo	FoundMyFitness Clips 	but you know we metabolic Health obviously you endlessly about the importance of metabolic health for cancer um certainly you know cancer prevention but um looking at like so the biggest risk factor for cancer is age right uh yes if you yeah unless you include yeah if you don generally talk about modifiable risk yes age age is the greatest risk for all disease including cardiovascular disease the biggest mod if iable risk factors so let like obesity being smoking is number one smoking okay number one of of course smoking I always it you should not be smoking but it is easy to forget it still smoke it Fathom that but addiction is addiction so smoking is the number one smoking is still the number one um modifiable risk fact after that obesity obes obesity so why do you think obesity what if you were to speculate why do you think it I I and I feel pretty strongly about this I mean I I things and I I have no idea here I think we have a pretty good idea first of all I don think it I don pounds I have on my waist that I wish I didn the environment of growth factors that comes with obesity namely the hyperinsulinemia but also the chronically elevated igf and things of that nature and it is the inflammatory environment that comes rif with obesity and again that energy that of the subcutaneous storage Depot it due to the um excess fat that spills over from that into these other areas where fat accumulation is very harmful so fat accumulation is not problematic Believe It or Not despite our aesthetic preferences when it occurs in areas that we are designed to store excess energy it becomes problematic when it escapes those areas and gets around the viscera gets around our organs enters the muscle Itself by the way that contributes to insulin resistance uh when it accumulates in the liver accumulates around the heart within the pancreas itself where it serves the double role of not just creating an inflammatory environment but also reducing the amount of insulin that the beta cell can release um and also around the the kidneys so those are the main places where even a small amount of fat I.E if just 10% of your total body fat were in those places you would be at enormous risk for cardiometabolic disease yeah I remember I studies where it you know covering surrounding your organs you know that was highly correlated with an increased cancer risk y and there was like there was also another correlation with like there was some specific inflammatory cyto kindes that were being generated or you know associated with I guess I would say with the visceral fat and the cancer incidence which again it environment like you so the metabolic Health being important we talked about you know the best like exercise being at the top right I mean that energy balance sleep and then of course you know management of of of of distress right hypercortisolemia will also contribute to this significantly right which of course even doing things like exercise and getting enough sleep help help balance right exactly um when it comes to cancer prevention you know you you talk a lot and outlive about cancer screening aggressive cancer screening yeah so can you talk a little bit about weighing the benefits versus the risk of that type you know doing more of an aggressive type of cancer screening yeah I mean the reason I think we have to pay attention to cancer screening in such an aggressive way is that unlike cardiovascular disease and even though we didn pathogenesis of it today I mean I covered this on other podcasts I you have as well it understood doesn everything I I minutes telling you all the things I don understand as as a community but we have a pretty good sense of what that still a really really big black box to try to understand all the different ways in which people get cancer and if you just want proof positive on this I bet you there listening to this not one who can you of at least one person they know who otherwise did everything right they didn didn carcinogen exposures they lived a perfectly healthy life and they still got breast cancer or they still got leukemia or they still got some god- awful cancer so the truth of it is in cardiovascular disease when we sit here and talk about modifiable risk factors like lipids smoking blood pressure all these things that virtually accounts for the entirety of the disease in cancer when we talk about the modal modifiable risk factors it doesn account for half of it so it money don make unforced errors don metabolically healthy but you don to leave it at that there too great a chance that you end up getting cancer um relative to you know if you just take the approach of well I therefore I the missing link how we bridge that Gap has to be through aggressive screening because about the only thing you can say about cancer that is capital T true is when you treat a cancer in an early stage you will have a better outcome than if you treat that cancer at a later stage and in the book I talk about a couple of very specific examples of this where we have just overwhelming data I use breast and colon cancer as an example so when a person has a stage three colon cancer that and it stage three it has spread to the lymph nodes but it has not spread visibly beyond the lymph nodes so when you do a CT or an MRI on that patient you that there is no other evidence of cancer uh outside of the region of the reection which is the colon and lymph nodes now you know that there microscopically cancer elsewhere so there are still Millions to billions of cancer cells throughout that patient body almost assuredly in their liver um but they see them if you give that patient the fulf fox regimen which is the standard chemotherapy regimen that um 65% of those patients will be alive in 5 years so a third of them will still die but two-thirds of them will live if that exact same patient when you go in and you take their colon out and you take their lymph nodes out also has visible metabolic disease in the liver they they will go on to get the same chemotherapy none of those people will be alive in 5 years there is a fundamental why why that difference same is true with breast cancer same is true with every Cancer the reason is the more cancer cells you have the more heterogeneity you have around the burden of mutations in that cancer the more capable that cancer is to mutate its way out of treatment evade the immune system a whole bunch of other things so if step number one is don which it should be and we want to do everything we can to not get cancer step number two is if you do get cancer you want to be able to catch it as soon as possible so that you have the smallest possible burden of this disease to treat and by the way you know there entire argument that says well screening is too expensive it treating late stage cancer with very expensive drugs that do very little so you brought up a lot of good points Peter I mean um I I really like the way like you can do everything you can and you know like my one of my favorite pelaton instructors lean Hanby you know she physical activity every day I mean she looks amazing I not eating a terrible diet and she came down with breast cancer was being treated and was still doing pelaton classes while she was being treated I mean amazing um but the reality is is that there like over a lifetime you know you do like there things that can happen let metabolically healthy and everything like your cells are dividing you can get a mutation your immune cells will take care of it most of the time as you know we start to get you know into our what fifth sixth seventh decade maybe the immune system mean there control like there mentioned so um with cancer screening what let gen risk factors and there family history right what age would you say or what decade of life around where would you think that or how do you treat it in your clinical practice with respect to cancer screenings um what are the major ones you know to do you said colon and breast um are there any others yeah so you know a discussion like this always begins with our patients by saying um you know you have to understand your risk appetite as an individual and you have to understand the price you going to pay for screening um because there prices you pay the first is economic everything we about is going to be outside of the standard of care not everything I mean if you you know your mamography and your colonoscopy will be covered but your colonoscopy won frequency that we you do it and even if your mamography is covered they probably won MRI or the ultrasound that we to recommend because we never recommend mamography and isolation ever um if we any of our metrics show more care is warranted they follow-up study like a 4K test or a you know multiparametric MRI unless your PSA is very high so so understand there cost that has to go into this but I think there you have to be willing to tolerate if you go down this rabbit hole which is the cost of the false positive the emotional cost of the false positive so we always kind of start by explaining how sensitivity and specificity work and I know a lot of people glaze over and they like I don this but if you don sensitivity means and you don understand what specificity means you can never understand the things that really do matter to anybody who gets a test which is positive and negative predictive value positive predicted value means if this test comes out positive How likely is it that I actually have the thing it says conversely if this test comes out negative How likely is it that I negative you want very high positive predictive value and very high negative predictive value and that things the specificity of a test which is the ability of a test to detect a condition being present if it is indeed present the spe specificity of a test the ability of a test to conclude that something is absent if it is indeed absent and the prevalence of the condition being tested meaning How likely is it that you have this before I test you so you can call that prevalence if you pre-test probability but the point is this is all a basian process so I really spend a lot of time going through this with people and let just you know start with something as simple as mamography right so you know so Peter why why are you saying you not satisfied just doing mamography well here of about 90% And A specificity of about 85% which is fine except if I do a mamography on you at this moment in time your pre-test probability for having breast cancer is pretty low like a couple percent that means the positive and negative predictive value of this test in isolation are very poor like less than 20% um furthermore there are features about you personally that might make you a bad candidate for MRI in isolation one is you you tissue is very glandular now in 40 years on a mamogram your breasts are going to look totally different the mammogram will actually have an easier time seeing what on in your breast because there to be less dense glandular tissue the mammogram because it x-ray is really good at seeing calcified lesions it non-calcified lesions conversely an MRI is really has no issue with gland ular tissue but can very well so you go through this analysis and you realize there actually no perfect test for screening you have to stack tests on top of each other if you want to increase positive and negative predictive value and if you rely on any one test by itself you always going to have a blind spot the the one exception to that by the way is a colonoscopy a colonoscopy is a test that has 100% sensitivity and very high specificity um but with colonoscopy you have a whole different risk which is a physical risk there harm from a colonoscopy basically three big risks there dehydration electrolyte imbalance hypotension that comes from the bow prep there sedation and then there perforation or bleeding actual procedural risks now if you look at the largest study that came out on this which was last summer in the New England Journal of Medicine this was actually a study that was meant to show that colonoscopy wasn showed something totally different in my mind which showed how safe it was so it was a study of I think over 20,000 people uh and had not a singular not a single incident so it showed that in good hands a colonoscopy is a very safe procedure um but I always want to make sure people understand like we don take this stuff lightly um and there reason you don times a year which if you did colonoscopy three times a year you never get colon cancer CU you you you know colon cancer always has to come from a pup so if you were checking somebody three times a year like you you develop a pup that you wouldn but at that point the risk would be just too high that something else would go wrong um so you know standard recommendations used to be every 10 years starting at 50 current recommendations are starting at 45 and there you would do it every 5 to 10 years we typically say with no family history or risk factors meaning you don inflammatory bowel disease or Crohn disease or things like that um we would typically say 40 and then about every 3 years depending on the findings so sometimes the findings on a given colonoscopy will make you want to actually do a more frequent surveillance if you find a CLE pup for example or if a patient has an incomplete bow prep you might decide you know actually we need to do this a little more urgently and and do it in a year again as opposed to we three great information and with respect to the um combined you know especially for younger individuals like younger like myself um the mamogram uh starting so so I might say like you know at 40 I would start doing a mammo and an ultrasound every other year uh sorry every six months so you would do a MMO every year you would an ultrasound every six months uh every year but stagger them by six months so if there was if there was a high enough risk that take now is that because there lifetime risk of one and eight just for on average forget about all that okay um and again breast cancer is one of those cancers where if you treat it early like it that can be treated early if you catch this in a stage one it disease um a stage four disease is a uniformly fatal disease what positive predictive value of catching it in stage one with the combination well so okay so so the way to think about it is you think about it as what positive predictive value of the combined modalities and and and here it little more complicated because it depends on the hormone status so I give you an example um another uh thing that we use that we haven are liquid biopsies yeah so we incorporate liquid biopsies into our testing let talk about them yeah yeah yeah so so so have you talked about them on the podcast do you listen there was a question I was going to ask you about with um you know the the Grail by their Gallery by Grail yeah yeah okay so what does this test do so the there are basically three things that you can figure out by looking at strands of DNA in the blood that can give you a clue as to whether or not a patient has cancer so let of you connect you know the Grail test uses 10 CC of blood relatively poultry sum of blood and they look at all of the cell-free DNA so again they separate the DNA that right from the cellfree DNA and determined so so basically there could be known mutations that we know are cancer genes like a Kass mutation or p-53 mutation where you might say oh if you see that K mutation like there cancer somewhere in the body the second thing that gives you a clue that there could be cancer in the body is the length of the DNA fragments that you see so there Grail does by the way but there are other technologies that are looking at fragment length and using fragment length to impute probability of cancer what gra does is they look at a third thing which is methylation so they say okay well all of this DNA is yours we worry about what the mutations are what the fragment lengths are but what we do know is certain methylation patterns are indicative of cancer and tissue of origin that are doing a screen for not just does this patient likely have cancer or not but if they do can you tell me where that look more closely there now there something really interesting about how this works because it any other type of screening test see that MRI that we talked about or the ultrasound or the mamogram um or the colonoscopy for that matter are basically morphology tests you looking visually either directly in the case of colonoscopy or indirectly in the form of a mamogram where you have to look through the tissue you at the morphology of a cancer The Grail test says nothing about that it telling you is this a cancer that is leaving its sight of origin or shedding its DNA in sufficient enough quantities as side it s side of origin so something very interesting emerges when you take a closer look at the Grail data and this is why we use the test again I have no affiliation with Grail so this is you know just my clinical um uh experience and observation at first glance the sensitivity of the Grail test for breast cancer is quite low the specificity is very high for Grail by the way meaning if you don likely to tell you you don cancer the sensitivity is quite low meaning if you have cancer it could miss it and it algorithm has been tuned for a very high specificity a low sensitivity but if you look at breast cancer overall sensitivity it 20% for stage one stage two which seems kind of abysmal meaning if you have a breast cancer that one stage too there chance it and many people myself included at one point thought that doesn the test I don tell me I cancer like I falling off a log right uh so I need something to tell me when there stage one breast cancer but a closer look at the data showed that if you looked at erpr negative breast cancers stage one stage two sensitivity was 75 to 80% it was only in the triple positive erpr positive her two new positive that the sensitivity specificity are so low and since that cancers it brings it down what does this mean it means that the more indolent a breast cancer is the less likely the Grail test picks it up at an early stage but the more aggressive it is the more likely it is to pick it up at an early stage the implication might be here that it matter and I think that interesting way to combine liquid biopsies with morphologic studies do you ever uh not combine like do you think doing just a liquid biopsy by itself would be a useful thing or do you think really it combination with other morphology types of screening yeah that question I mean we don because I still think we early days and I I just think a little bit of a belt and suspenders approach makes sense um but I it if the day comes when all you need to do is the liquid biopsy and only if it comes up positive do you need to go and do a morphologic survey a couple of questions um so you know talking about some of the major screenings the colonoscopy the mamogram uh you mentioned PSA uh are so so with like some of these you know types of morphology screenings like the mamogram for example people are concern like there very concerned about the potential the mutagenic potential of you know these types of screening methods um you know potentially causing cancer right so CT scans the x-rays well CT scans would be a very lousy way to screen for that reason right the CT scan has a lot of radiation with the exception the only time we justify the use of a CT scan is in a former smoker or a current smoker we don practice but we do have former smokers we do still use a lowd do CT for lung screening um remember lung cancer risk is lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death uh globally and in the US for both men and women um and 85% of lung cancers occur in former smokers or current smokers so in those people you have to ask the question what kind of cancers do they get and you basically have small cell large cell um and squamous cell are the dominant cancers that occur in smokers and those are best detected on a lowdose CT scan adenocarcinoma of the lung is the dominant cause of lung cancer in a non-smoker and we can detect that equally well with an MRI so we don expose a never smoker to that risk whereas to a smoker we or you know a past smoker or current smoker the risk reward trade-off is worth it and that been documented really clearly in clinical trials mamography has incredibly low radiation um not as low as like a dexa scan or something like that but it still really really low um so there lot of women that avoid them I I I there the radiation has lessened over the years and it always has I me radiation is constantly going down I mean just going back to something we spoke about earlier 20 years ago a SE so just let so radiation is measured in units called mly cevers and um it established that exposure to more than 50 mly cevers a year will increase your risk of mutagenesis um so now let the context of certain things so living at sea level here in San Diego the just the exposure you get to the environment is about 1 to 2 Mill SE verts a year so that allotment if you live in Denver you doubling that so being one mile in the sky doubles your exposure but you still you know you 8% of your annual allotment um a CT and geogr 20 years ago was 20 M CTS 40% of your annual radiation allotment on one test the last patient I sent for a CTA last week because when we get the report it also shows the radiation less than one mver so mammograms are even Point L than that yeah yeah yeah yeah they fraction so it really is makes zero sense for a woman who has a lifetime risk of 1 and8 and perhaps even higher if she um to avoid to to avoid doing mammograms correct okay um but again I I would never rely on a mamogram exclusively I would combine it with an ultrasound or the MRI but they people aren ultrasounds they yeah and and MRI of course has no radiation so um but but again everyone has you know you just have to unfortunately there mongering that goes on um but you just have to look at the numbers I mean it Crystal Clear that a mamogram has a very very they might be confusing it with there there was another test I blanking on what it it think it was called molecular breast Imaging it was another high high intensity mamogram it seen one done I don done in years but prri like pre utility for other tests it was done it was also about a 20 to 30 Mill maybe this where this is all I complete misinformation and misunderstanding where people are confusing mamogram from from what called an MBI is what the test was called well this is good to clear up um I I because I mean I not kidding like I know people I know women that have this fear so um you know I think stepping sort of stepping back just one more thing I want to ask you about is like blood cancers is there any like what is the liquid biopsies are very good on blood cancers actually because you have the proportion of those cells like you higher concentration of cell-free DNA so yeah we actually that where I biopsies is on leukemias and um you know other other sort of hematologic issues uh such as Myoma and things like that and for people listening wondering about the cost of it typic it CL directionally 1,000 and I don meaning I think you have to go through your doctor to do it I don can just do the test willy-nilly I don think you can yeah uh but I don for sure yeah I I could	Success

Peter Attia Dives Deep on STATINS (side effects & the best alternatives)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-gUBEOH1Ls	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so it really wasn late 80s probably I think 1987 if my memory serves me correctly that the first Statin came to be developed and that was the real turning point in um basically the uh you know pharmacologic tool that became valuable against ascvd now the first second and third generation Statin of that era are no longer in use today because their side effect profile was very harsh relative to what we can do today so there are currently seven Statin in in existence uh and each of them you know offers some strengths and advantages over others and they class of drug so to be clear they effective class of drug they effective at lowering uh LDL cholesterol they work by inhibiting the first committed step of cholesterol synthesis they do that everywhere but primarily in the liver and the response of the liver when cholesterol synthesis is being shut down the liver says I got to get more cholesterol in here and what does it do it puts a whole bunch more LDL receptors all over the liver and that primarily driving down LDL in the presence of a Statin but the side effects are what well about 7% of people develop muscle aches on Statin so that if you think about how many people are on those drugs or how many people are prescribed those drugs that number of people the good news is that a completely reversible side effect so you put a person on a Statin they experience muscle soreness you take them off it the other big side effect the one that I probably think about the most is insulin resistance so um a very small set of subset of people about 4% of people put on a Statin might go on to develop type 2 diabetes as a result of it now I I think any doctor who lets a patient get to the point where they get type two diabetes because of their Staten hasn been paying attention we want to know the minute you resistant in response to the Statin and those data are less clear you don exactly how many people are getting insulin resistant but this is a reason to be paying attention to bigger markers and more important markers than just hemoglobin A1c trips over the threshold of 6.5% you have type 2 diabetes here you want to be able to say is the hemoglobin A1c moving what to the fasting insulin and glucose in these other markers does a patient wear a CGM one of the reasons we like cgms on patients when we put them on statins is we we have a historical level of what their glucose control looks like and if all of a sudden their Baseline average glucose goes up by 10 milligrams per deciliter which I a Statin I know it just a quick dietary trigger especially when you take them off the stattin and it comes right back down to normal so even though they haven they haven diabetic they insulin resistant and the third thing we see with statins is a change in or an increase in the transaminases or the liver function tests liver function test is a bit of a misnomer because the transaminases really tell us more about inflammation than function so all that said statens are still kind of you know they of the work in this area but by no means should we say that that that we have at our disposal about 20 years ago another drug called aami can I interrupt for a second and ask you about statens yeah of course um because I have a lot I have some questions about them so um I and and I I conversation that again I had with our mutual friend Ron Krauss because he worked down the hall I worked down the hall from him and I collaborated with some of his post dos and um you know they would come over and show me data and we would talk uh because you know I had a lot of experience in aing mitochondrial function and mitochondrial biology uh during graduate school and um I remember saying this to Ron I Statin are affecting the HMG co co pathway that you mentioned the cholesterol synthesis with which also is important for the synthesis of uh ubiquinol y right this is is an important or cutan as I should probably call it um this is important for mitochondrial function I mean it necessary for mitochondrial function for transferring electron electrons across the electron transport chain which is essentially coupling the oxygen we breathe with the food that we eat to make energy um and I remember saying oh so statens have a side effect of targeting mitochondria and he said to me no it so what are your thoughts on how Statin are affecting mitochondria and through this pathway and obviously you might mention supplementation with a you know uh red all right um measuring mitochondrial function in terms of B2 Max something so so it something I have thought a lot about um so the the literature has nothing to offer here unfortunately so so I wish I could say you know Rhonda the answer is this because here says here this is not going to be a satisfying answer if there is an impact on mitochondrial function with stattin use it to be the single best measurement we have to measure mitochondrial function which is Zone 2 testing with lactate production so I know you know what this is cuz we talk about this stuff all day long but just for folks listening uh this requires a little bit of explanation but it I I think it up so everybody understands what the mitochondria do if they you know listeners of your podcast we don but it functional test is a very important test in medicine we don functional tests right most of the things we talk about are biomarkers um and by themselves they don huge amount of information they tend to be quite static and not Dynamic but we understand that the healthier an individual is the more they can rely on their mitochondria for ATP generation under increasing demands of the cell this is one of the Hallmarks of health and by extension one of the Hallmarks of aging and one of the Hallmarks of disease is an inability to do that meaning as the ATP Demand on a cell goes up there is an earlier and earlier shift to gly is as opposed to oxidative phosphorilation so how do we how could we measure that clinically well we can put a person in because we can know rather than test a cell Let the whole organism right so we put a person in sort of an ergometer right so on a treadmill or on a bike or under some sort of demand where we can control the work that they have to do and we can drive up the amount of work they do while sampling lactate and why does that what does that tell us well just to remind everybody you know glucose enters a cell and it basically has two Fates right so glucose will be converted into pyruvate regardless it has the Fate at which oxygen is plentiful and the body has the time to make a lot of ATP where it goes into the mitochondria and it has the less efficient uh but quicker way to get ATP which is converting lactate pardon me Pate into lactate so this is the uh glycolytic pathway versus the oxidative phosphorolytic pathway the longer a cell can stay in that mitochondrial space the better it is it makes way more uh ATP and it accumulates less lactate and hydrogen ion and the more lactate and hydrogen ion you accumulate eventually the cell becomes effectively poisoned by that hydrogen ion and it becomes very difficult for a muscular cell to contract so we use this test with patients this is one of the most important metrics we care about literally it would be in the top 10 things we care about for our patients which is how many watts can you produce on a bike or how many Mets can you exercise at on a treadmill or whatever vehicle you lactate below about 2 m 2 Millo is about the threshold Beyond which you are now shifting away from the maximum capacity of the mitochondria to to um undergo this process okay all of this is to say I have clearly seen the effect of a drug like metformin at impacting that metformin which is a mitochondrial toxin right metformin impairs complex one of the mitochondria we immediately see a change in the lactate performance curve of an individual on Metformin we see a complete reduction in their Zone 2 output they hit that lact of 2 much sooner we also see an increase not big but significant meaning clinically significant in their fasting resting lactate level so all things equal their lactate is just getting higher to me by the way I don that it believe in metformin as a geroprotective agent I think metformin is a good drug for someone who exercise enough and they can energy balance um but I don foran is a great drug for someone like you or someone like me we don Statin so if it dependent or no just don just don be happening but we don resolution to measure it so that that why I has to have the humility which I hope I have to say look I don do know is if there it ubiquinol or CoQ10 um and there are two states of it ubiquinol and ubiquinone but ubiquinol would be the state we would want to consider here there have been a number of clinical trials looked looking at using or supplementing ubiquinol with patients taking statins they have mostly done this to assess uh the muscle soreness issue so they mostly done this as a way to ask the question can you reduce the insulin the the incidence rather of muscle soreness with Statin I haven literature in a couple of years the last I looked at them there was still no difference um that said we have patients that really feel strongly about taking ubiquinol when they don don it I really don if there would say let unless something has happened in the last couple of years that I I don ubiquinol offsets that and more importantly to your point it to me that that effect translates to a functional deficit in the mitochondria so I kind of want to the the other going back circling back to the statens and um here okay what questions do you think I should be asking and looking in the literature to convince myself that let say a lipophilic Statin that could uh you know cross the blood brain barrier get into the brain inhibit you know hm COA in the brain um particularly at higher doses uh but generally speaking what can what question should I be asking myself to convince myself that it risk for both of the neurod degenerative disease that I Alzheimer it and Parkinson um both of those diseases have been associated with Staten use they been it the the literature as you know is you know you can find what you want right so do you have any you know advice I I did a recent AMA on this um although it might not be out yet I lose track of when I record them and when they come out so I apologize if it hasn yet um but I did an entire AMA on this topic because it is so uh important and I think it confusing um so I was actually surprised to learn this um I was surprised to learn that there has never I shouldn have been surprised but forless here what it is there has never been a study done that has looked at the use of statins and the incidence of Alzheimer disease or dementia as a primary outcome why is that important it because in clinical research the primary outcome is the only thing you can really take to the bank cuz that study is powered to detect there are more than a dozen probably less than 25 so a big number of studies call it 15 16 that have used Statin have had a primary outcome of ascvd but a secondary outcome of Dementia or Alzheimer looked at every single one of those and I can tell you that every single one of those found neutral to benefit of Statin use on the incidence of dementia and and the incidence of um Alzheimer vascular dementia I mean I that sort of makes more sense Parkinson seen have you looked at the literature on that so Parkinson more confusing because the literature is way more sparse um but I do want to go back and talk about Alzheimer there everything I just said what I basically oh the other point I want to make Rhonda this actually surprised me there was no difference between uh hydrophobic and hydrophilic statins with respect to the to these outcomes no difference whatsoever so counterintuitive um but no difference whatsoever um so even though again you might think well gosh you know a Statin that gets in the brain should have more of an impa but it didn to have is there a difference in those two types of statins with respect to the diabetes uh increased uh diabetes risk that you really good question I I didn that in and that wasn this yeah I here the highest incidence of diabetes is probably with atorvastatin um but that might also be because atorvastatin is the most widely used like I don of all there think are even worth prescribing these days maybe only three and I treat them all equally in terms of risk in other words I would assume anytime you put somebody on a stat and you should be looking for any of the side effects and I don particularly because again at the you might say at the population level it different but at the individual level who cares you it zero you not what what statins are those what three the ones that we would prescribe would be ruva Statin or crester crer atorvastatin or lipor uh pitavastatin lielo and sometimes we use prostatin or prol but pretty rarely uh but so so usually those those would be the big four now here what um I would say and um this is something that we spend a an awful lot of time looking at in our practice and and actually just last week Tom dpring um did gave us an internal presentation that was so incredible um it was months in the making uh looking at the relationship between Statin use and desol levels and dementia risk so you may recall a moment ago I mentioned desol so desol is well let I said there were two cholesterol synthesis Pathways well in the CNS really only you have one pathway and it to cholesterol so desol levels are actually a decent proxy for brain cholesterol synthesis lathosterol which is the penultimate molecule in the other pathway is more of a proxy for peripheral cholesterol synthesis are these measure you can measure these on a like they in most Labs we use a lab that measures them so we measure desol and and lathosterol in every patient with every blood drop unfortunately this is not standard of care most Labs can this Boston Hart does that Boston there are enough data suggesting that if desol levels are very low the risk of AD does indeed go up and the risk of dementia Beyond ad goes up so this is you know kind of what I would describe as personalized medicine medicine 3.0 at its finest which is you have to treat every patient IND indvidually and we are doubly careful in patients with an apoe4 Gene Andor a family history and in those patients based on the literature and I to send you Tom not have a hard time with me sharing that even though it was kind of an internal presentation in fact I could share with you the recording Tom made because we recorded the internal uh meeting uh because it was so valuable um but basically the cuto off we use is point8 so if desol falls below .8 mg per deciliter uh we think the risk of dementia is sufficiently high enough that we would abort the use of the Statin very good information and and you think uh there is a correlation with apoe status on that no one has done that study yet in your in your clinical but in our clinical practice we just decided like why would we take the risk but but yes no one has done the study to show our desol levels lower in apoe4 individuals that testable hypothesis and it makes a lot of sense cuz we know apoe is heavily involved in cholesterol activity in the brain and so it wouldn to me if you know if you put people into three buckets zero alals one Al or two Al E4 alals and then just looked at desol levels like that would be a very easy mindless study to do just a survey like just a quick is there a correlation yes or no um so that love to know the answer to um but even absent that knowledge our view is um there the risk you know earlier I said it makes no sense to to go on some crazy obscure diet that has a whole bunch of unintended consequences just to control your lipids well I would make the exact same statement here it makes no sense to get all to take unnecessary risks with Statin in a in a higher risk individual when we have these other tools we have as I we talked about or we will talk about aetam pcsk9 Inhibitors bidic acid these are unbelievable tools that have no bearing on brain cholesterol synthesis but Peter aren have an apoe4 Lil more likely to be prescribed statins based on their their LDL particle number by their physician because a physician doesn their sure none of this this isn personalized it so Y no it um and it those three drugs that all the that are an alternative to Statin two of them are still very expensive okay so the three drugs I know the pcsk K9 inhibitor y um and highly effective in insanely safe zero side effects um cheaper than when they came out uh so they were approved in 2015 um and we have long-term data with the natur people walking around with a natural mutation right just amazing yeah exactly we have the natural experiment we have all of the data from these drugs um and these these drugs have been tested in really good trials and they gone head-to-head with every drug and they always win and there effects um but they they in the United States it outside of this country so everything better out of the US when it comes to drug pricing but in the US you talking about 500 bucks a month for that drug if it by your insurance company right um and if you can get a doctor to say I to prescribe gravity I mean like I mean at this point a doctor who doesn not willing to prescribe a pcsk9 inhibitor just is a fool um so it a question of the the cost because unfortunately most insurance companies will not cover it unless you meet certain criteria such as having familial hyper cholesterolemia or having already had a cardiac event like a heart attack and not being able to tolerate a Statin or what about myopathy like if you have muscle yes significant myopathy on multiple Statin but you be at high enough risk to justify it so insurance companies are going to go out of their way to not pay for this okay then you have aetam now Zam is relatively inexpensive um it as potent so aetam also effectively serves to increase the LDL receptors on the liver but it does so by impairing cholesterol reabsorption so it blocks one of those two Transporters I was talking about in the gut the first one and by blocking that the body is absorbing way less of its own cholesterol and the liver senses that and the liver says hey I got to get more cholesterol puts more LDL receptors on pulls it out of circulation um it as potent and as a monotherapy the only times we see really Head Over Heels responses are in patients who have defective ATP binding cassettes in their gut and we measure that by looking at phytosterol levels so we measure two things one is called cytol one is called called compol those are phytosterol so these are cholesterol we don zerol uh pardon me it phytosterol not zerol and so when we measure those levels we know that it speaks to how much plant sterile is being absorbed and not being excreted and so when patients have really really high levels of phytosterols you know they have a defective ATP binding cassette and those patients respond really well to aetam it it Blockbuster in those people wow is that a common um you know single nucleotide polymorphism that have or you know it it depends how how extreme it is so um it above the 90th percentile but I probably three people that have a level that is so high you actually be concerned with it just in and of itself meaning like the actual level cuz phytosterols are actually more arenic than cholesterol and that like Boston Hart would measure all these ferol okay um they than cholesterol yeah they to oxidation more inflammatory are they being carried in lipoproteins they so so oid are they oxidized they oxidized they this is by the way is a reason that we don phytosterols to lower cholesterol so there are a lot of sort of over-the-counter treatments where people use phytosterols to lower their cholesterol and they it does so if you ingest a ton of phytosterols you will outcompete cholesterol at that ocy and your body will regulate and you up N Net reabsorbing less total cholesterol um the problem with that is if you have a defective ATP binding cassette which again it uncommon that you do you will end up really absorbing ing a lot of those phytosterols and again they can so this is an it dmol point earlier where you can lower cholesterol but if you dmol too much it can be more atherogenic than cholesterol in the first place so dmol has shown up twice today it showed up in a good sense and in a bad sense so too much of it if you that blocks the enzyme that comes after it that was the thing that was producing too much atherosclerosis in the little of it could be a marker of of two uh too little cholesterol synthesis in the brain and that can be a whole problem end of itself the final drugs we can just wrap this up because I the listeners are tired of hearing about this stuff uh is a is a drug called bidic acid that is a pro drug so it very elegant drug uh it pill uh but it metabolized by the liver and in the liver it then inhibits um cholesterol synthesis what makes this drug special is unlike statins this drug only works in the liver so statins work throughout the body they do most of their work in the liver but technically every cell is impacted by a Statin only hepatocytes are impacted by bondic acid and it lowers apob same way lowers cholesterol synthesis liver says I need more cholesterol puts more LDL receptors up pulls more LDL in LDL and cholesterol go down but no side effects no type two diabetes risk nothing nothing it it sounds uh same problem as pcs9 inhibitor it we this point like if money were were no issue you Inhibitors aetam and um and bempedoic acid I mean eventually we right yeah yeah they just have to come down in price	Success

How to Lower Your Blood Pressure (exercise, cocoa flavanols, & heat stress) | Peter Attia	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5BEB0g6rBc	FoundMyFitness Clips 	what what sort of blood pressure do you like levels do you like to see we very aggressive right I mean if you look at the Sprint trial I think it clear that 120 over 80 or better is the place to be and that over 85 which used to be the standard for hypertension right that so we news with blood pressure unlike the lip you know we spent a lot of time talking about lipids and a listener may come away from that thinking okay there some dietary stuff but you guys didn talk about exercise and you exercise doesn like you down the path of pharmacology much sooner on the lipid front but blood pressure is just as big a risk factor for cardiovascular disease as lipids and it word but lifestyle intervention you know losing weight and exercising will fix a lot of people everybody we have some very lean fit healthy people in our practice who still have essential hypertension and it has to be lowered pharmacologically but for many people um you know you know losing 20 lbs and exercising especially cardio is going to do amazing things on their blood pressure have you looked at um so I have a relative who exercises uh good diet like uh the only thing that lowers her blood pressure is hot tubs interesting in addition to the exercise interesting and it she she it of you know whether it be sauna or or or hot tub on on hypercortisolemia that might be having the indirect effect on blood pressure because she is absolutely prone to high cortisol she very high stress and the other thing is um you know uh so Dan he also I mean he the same diet um my blood pressure I mean like I pressure like always always I mean like really low like I side of like I need to be make sure I not like too low y um but he at times like when measuring it at home by the way people at home should just get an automated cuff right I mean like absolutely yeah and then when you finish the story I I sure everybody because it do um he has uh hemat hemocromatosis okay and um there that had it and notice that their blood pressure was high like we people that are like very phys like doing lots of these are like you running Mar they super healthy and donating blood seem to help normalize the blood pressure for whatever reason I don important for obviously getting rid of the iron and hemocromatosis right um but the other thing that Dan is doing that now but the other thing that seems to really help him I mean he does Sauna hot tubs exercise you know and there his office working and he systolic and it that him so like tons of like nitrates so a bunch of like green vegetables and these are like nasty tasting shakes these aren AG no um and and that will that will help him as well so um yeah exercise is very important but like there like has he tried like coca flavonoids things like that you know we I was I give that to so another story no I wasn that because we take a lot of our vitamins at night we do take some fish oil in the morning I did mention that to him because another story my mother um who is sedentary she weight but she you know she she she was great I mean she like she look at the pictures it her life have been extended just by that alone um but I can in the sauna sometimes um but it it of an effort um but one thing about her is she will take the vitamins I give her and um she MTHFR if she b supplement along with like methyl fola like her homocysteine will go high and her blood pressure goes up and she had stopped taking all those because she wasn was giving it to her every day and so I I got her you know this like sort of like battery of supplements that I was giving her um including all the the methyl folate and um lowering her things that were lowering her homocystine along with magnesium and Coco flavonol so I was giving her cocoa uh she was getting four of those pills she gets four she still takes them her blood pressure went from like 155 to like 125 okay her doctors are like they wanted to get her on anti-hypertensive treatment before she came to me and it has been like months now it it at home she takes she does logs I mean so I the fact that she um but again it just it shows that there are they definitely are the lifestyle factors I know you hate that word but you know exercise being one of the main ones but there are people also that in addition to being very Physically Active like they still get high blood pressure you know yeah yeah and there and and you know I don data to look at the direct impact of um Co flavonoids or all the suite of B vitamins that are necessary to lower homosysteine and their impact on blood pressure but here again this is mechanistic and it strong mechanistic but that doesn necessarily equate to outcomes but we know that as homosysteine is elevated it impairs the clearance of something called asymmetric and symmetric dimethyl Arginine I don about adma and sdma and adma and sdma directly and indirectly in inhibit nitric oxide synthes so the we know that homocysteine is associated with poor outcomes in cardiovascular disease um and I think that this mechanism of homocysteine impairing the clearance of adma and sdma is the is the mechanistic link because when you directly inhibit nitric oxide synthes in the endothelium you are preventing the creation of nitric oxide and of course that oils actually do the opposite of that so I think the one two punch of lowering homocysteine and raising uh nitri oxide synthes activity via coca flavanol uh could could certainly explain a reduction in blood pressure that really interesting I I was giving her the Coca flonal just because I had seen the studies on increased blood flow and I you know like we need that um measuring blood pressure yeah so um this was established really clearly through the Sprint trial and and this has basically been now kind of the gold standard for how we use an automated cuff so that trial was done done by um having individuals sit for 5 minutes check a blood pressure no stimulation during that time so not talking not looking at a phone not doing anything and then repeat that two more times so it I or what anybody does but just so you understand at the level of how the trials are done you minutes having a check at 5 10 and 15 minutes you cuff is 2 in above uh the elbow and um the cuff is right at the level of the right atrium so you know you anybody wants to do this experiment at home it put an automated cuff on your arm and put your arm here put your arm above your head and put your arm in the right spot and look at how big a difference you get so measurement errors are a huge problem being over stimulated is a huge problem so you really want to make sure you that blood pressure and we have our patients do that twice a day uh you know an early in the day and a late in the day check and then you know we just have everybody do that for two weeks to start and that blood pressure so you know the idea that you office and get a blood pressure is not valuable for most people so when when someone says what it should be what two weeks of twice daily checks done where you take the 5-minute protocol and test perfectly and I think everybody listening to this should should know that number	Success
This Is How You Know If You're in Zone 2 When Doing Cardio | Peter Attia, M.D.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UThuWiIKEBc	FoundMyFitness Clips 	when you using the zone to you know lactate threshold training to kind of measure mitochondrial function um how so buying the lactate meter Nova diagn NOA by a medical or something like that it a yellow purple one I got it per your like recommendation but U for people listening uh if they want to to get one but also knowing like how you know because there like any sort of if you were to go talk to an exercise physiologist and you say lactate threshold like they kind of know and they lactate threshold is a different number right so this is like lower level this is below your lactate yeah this is lower so um how do people know let let okay and they get on their pelaton and they want to do a Zone 2 test okay do can you somehow use a you know percent max rate heart rate sorry max heart rate uh like prox to kind of know like yeah there are lots of different ways to estimate this and to be clear like I people that is checking his lactate every you know every day that he his bike which is four days a week for me and by the way I while using all the other metrics that I moment mostly just in an Ever NeverEnding quest to just have as much data as possible to understand when is lactate the best predictor when was rpe the best predictor when was heart rate the best predictor when was absolute wattage the best predictor like there there first thing I always say to people namely my patients when they say I don want to get that lactate meter I don want to be poking myself in the finger I there are like other ways that you can pretty much approximate your Zone 2 output and the only reason I brought up the whole lactate testing is it is the gold standard and it is the most objective way to do this and therefore if I impact of say metformin or EST Statin that that aside for a moment and answer the the relevant question which is hey how does someone exercise in this Zone I think the most important you know tool for for virtually anybody is is rate of perceived exertion I think that will almost never let you down um in fact I would argue that for a really really outof shape individual rate of perceived exertion is even better than lactate and the reason for that is you take somebody who 2 diabetes their resting lactate may already be at two so in those patients we actually never use lactate until you get somebody to a certain level of Fitness we only use rate of perceived exertion and we will provide heart rate guidance so here rate of perceived exertion we give people the test which is the talk test so when you are in zone 2 you should be able to speak to somebody but it should be uncomfortable and not something you want to do if you can it sentence you you if you can speak the way you and I are speaking now you hard enough you there is that sweet spot where if you on that pelaton and the phone rings and you answer it the person knows you exercising and you do most of the talking but if they ask you a question and you have to answer it you speak in a full sentence but you that comfortable that important thing people need to understand about it as far as what heart rate guidance comes with it Phil maone uses a test that I think is a pretty good starting place which is 180 minus your age now the fitter you are the less relevant that becomes so I that would put me at 130 but I can tell you my zone 2 is above 130 so if you to that I uh my my I use another app that checks my HRV every single morning and it predicts my zone 2 as a result of my HRV and so every day what I is I predicted by the app which can vary by as much as 10 beats per minute based on how much I slept the quality of my sleep how sore I am a subjective measurement of how much I want want to train that day and my HRV so it it called Morpheus Morpheus yeah um so and I have no affiliation with or anything like that so so basically so this morning I got up my HRV was I don remember 78 milliseconds slept 7 hours 15 minutes good quality sleep not sore felt good so I actually had a pretty high Target today my Target today was 141 was the heart rate on day that about as high as it will predict me to be on a on a day when everything sucks it might tell me as low as 129 usually it where it generally aligning with where my lactate is where what that at a lactate about 1.9 um and then on top of that I paying attention to the wattage so I kind of know where to be but again for somebody just starting out RP is all you need to know 180 minus your age is good and then the if a person is fit enough that they truly know their maximum heart rate we tell them to start at somewhere between 75 and 80% of that number great uh recommendations if so if a person is specifically trying to do this functional mitochondrial uh test how long should they be in that zone two before they can measure their lactate we we 45 minutes before we do it yeah so a true true steady state awesome	Success
How does Peter Attia recommend splitting up cardio & strength training?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSeT_S85VLc	FoundMyFitness Clips 	what what we basically do with our patients is we we start from a standpoint of time how much time are you willing to exercise a week I to tell you what you need to do let start with you telling me what you willing to do and then the simplest approach is we strength and stability half of that into cardio of the cardio it that will be Zone 2 20% of that will be V2 Max	Success
Peter Attia on the INSANE Longevity Benefits of Low ApoB (how to lower ApoB with diet)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OxvLbjMP_o	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so let the LDL I sorry the apob number because like if most people go to a standard lab and they measure their apob there reference range and it says you know okay if you per deciliter you you number come from and you know what like is has anyone measured apob levels across the lifespan do we know like is there a correlation with apob levels and the beginnings of atherosclerosis has someone done those studies you know that sort of thing yeah so the reference ranges are purely uh populationbased um distribution questions so every lab will have a different way of doing this but a general uh you know sort of philosophy for labs is you know let you know so for the lab we use and by the way we completely ignore these reference ranges they them there and we explained to our patients that we editorialize on top of them but you know the Reference Lab we use we below 80 is wonderful well 80 just happens to be the 20th percentile of the population it will say 80 to 100 is intered or 80 to 120 it says is intermediate risk and above 120 is very high risk so in for the lab we use we know that 80 is the 20th percentile uh 120 is the 80th percentile or the 60th percentile I can it against to population distribution and that apob is completely different and um as you may recall I write I devote actually quite a bit of real estate to this in the book because I think it is such an important concept and it is in my opinion certainly top three failures of medicine 2.0 is in failing to appreciate the point I that once you understand the cause Al it of apob meaning once you understand that apob is not just associated with cardiovascular disease but it linked to it meaning it causes ascvd to get into this discussion about managing 10year risk thinking about being in this percent versus this percent makes no sense when you have causal things that cause disease you eliminate them and the analogy I use is cigarettes with lung cancer so no nobody disputes that cigarettes are causally linked to lung cancer they are it clear as you know Tuesday follows Monday but people forget that you know causality doesn smokes will get lung cancer and it doesn cancer um smoked so you you don to be necessary and sufficient necessary or sufficient to still be causal but our approach to patients who smoke is very clear which is Never Smoke and if you do smoke stop immediately do we look at people who smoke and say well once your 10-year risk of lung cancer reaches this threshold we stop smoking or once your pack year smoking is above the 50th percentile or the 80th percentile we you to stop absolutely not you immediately eliminate smoking and so similarly it makes no sense that we would look at a causal driver of asbd in the case of apob and kind of take an approach of well being at the 20th percentile or the 30th percentile the 40th percentile is acceptable none of those things really make sense you have something that is causing the disease you should eliminate it as soon as possible because it is an area under the curve problem so atherosclerosis begins at Birth um when you do autopsies on people who are very young in fact I in the book include a photo of a a guy who you know a man I forget I think maybe 26 years old who was a victim of a homicide or something so an completely unrelated death um but you look at the autopsy sections of his coronary arteries I mean he already had very Advanced atherosclerosis now it wasn relevant it wasn anytime soon but the point is this is a disease that takes decades to progress and one of the biggest drivers of it in addition to things like high blood pressure and smoking and insulin resistance is apop so to be able to take that off the table sooner rather than later is going to has has certainly has the potential to take um atherosclerosis off its pedestal at the top of the uh list of killing and so what do you um I mean take you obviously can off the table completely right we need a be but what well so so you do so so let let with age right um we don are probably a lot of little reasons um so there are you know endocrine changes insulin resistance um sence that you know might involve the uh decreased uh life of LDL receptors there there about so you versus synthesis and I remember our mutual friend Ron Krauss like I you know many conversations with him I did my postc down the hall from his lab right um and I remember him telling me that you know apob you is constantly producing it you vldl just just churning it out right no just going going and we also make LDL denovo by the way right yeah there denovo pathway plus the vldl to LDL pathway but that you know the the the thing is is that you know he was saying well from an evolutionary perspective um you as you mentioned you know it transporting things throughout the body to other organs right cholesterol Tri triglycerides fatty acids it transporting and this is where I was so intrigued inflammatory protein so cyto ctive protein also are being transported through vldl now that was important pre antibiotics pre everything that we do now to combat you know infectious disease and viruses and bacteria parasites whatever um but before that time that vldl did serve that purpose too and that it reason why we because it size it the the unit versus like 50,000 or something it time to make it um and so I was the you know I was thinking well like inflam also does make it go up even further at the level of synthesis I don exactly the the clearance you know how it it think the aging process is mostly affecting the clearance of it or my intuition is yes my intuition is that it clearance level which is going to be again some facet of ldlr ldlr beating LDL receptor so is it we are making less of them they are surviving less uh the proteins that you know and and that can basically done there there are many ways to regulate that process but that that my intuition is it confirmational change in the ldlr and more a number of them and or uh A reduced amount of time that they stay present one thing I evolutionary front you know I had a guy named John kelin on my podcast uh a few months ago and he he proposed a really interesting idea which completely makes sense evolutionarily which you you could argue sort of like we don apob like this is the other thing like most species don apob they don LDL but how I mean they have cholesterol but they don require transporting all these you know you can do it with HDL you can transport everything with HDL yeah okay yeah they don always going in reverse like it was bringing everything back to no it actually much more complicated I mean in US LDL is doing the majority of what called reverse cholesterol transport so RCT which is kind of like the good movement of cholesterol you sort of think of the bad movement as taking cholesterol into the arteries the good movement is taking it back to the liver in US LDL is doing the majority of that so hdls are typically transferring their cholesterol to ldls and ldls are bringing them back to the liver um but John made an interesting point right which is that you know in in sort of following up on what you said The evolutionary cost of making cholesterol is enormous uh I mean it intensive step right I I can the number of atps that are required to make a molecule of cholesterol but it in the tens right like it could could be 40 or something to that effect and so we evolved to have a system that prioritized having a lot of cholesterol being able to keep a lot of it around um because again this was an energy conserving system now this serves us no benefit today because to we can make plenty of it and we are we are in an energy abundant environment which we were not in you know hundreds of thousands of years ago and so this is a bit of an unfortunate vestage of our past much in the way that a lot of the things that lead to insulin resistance are a vestage to things that were once very valuable uh I mean the things that allowed us to LEAP up out of the swand with our swamp with big brains was our primarily our capacity to store excess energy in a way that even primates can um again served us really well until 150 years ago and I think the same is probably true of of cholesterol and apob so going back to your question how much apob is enough well it turns out you don perfectly fine so if you look at a child they apob level typically below 20 milligrams per deciliter so a kid if you think about it has the greatest need for growth right like so you think about the cholesterol demand of myelinating the entire central nervous system all of the enormous uh explosion of steroidal tissue all of these things are done with lipoprotein levels that are incredibly low again what we call physiologic levels of LDL cholesterol and apob are on the order of 10 to 30 milligrams per deciliter and yet there are no negative consequences to such low levels of that lipoprotein burden and it get you know we become teenagers and in our 20s that we start to see those numbers go up and again that just reflected by a reduction in clearance than some need for additional LDL we don what we need is actually you know before the age of 20 do you think uh so like if you were to then estimate or speculate a level of apob that you could say safely well I guess there one you atherosclerosis if you have you if you maintain a level below yeah so Peter Libby um from the Brigham who the authorities on this topic has has argued uh and I referen him in my book that if you had an apob level below about 30 milligrams per deciliter 20 to 30 milligrams per deciliter it wouldn be possible to develop atherosclerosis what about not dying from AOS like what about like if it the if it globally yep and let takes to get down to 30 probably is pretty aggressive yeah most people cannot get down to 30 without without a pharmacologic intervention yeah y do you think that you would would die of atheroslerosis if you had you know if you couple of other things so the first thing is how long are you at 60 so if you say I very different from saying hey I showed up and I was at 120 and you now lowered me to 60 so again I think of you know I imagine like everybody walks around and you graph that on the x- axis is time and on the Y AIS is AP B and you have a curve and you want to figure out what the area under that curve is and that we want to minimize the area under that curve so if if if you took exactly so if you took so again very similar to smoking right we talk about risk in pack years of smoking so if a person smokes a pack a day for 20 years or two packs a day for you know 10 years you know you have a way of kind of comparing Apples to Apples on those things so to have a lifetime ceiling of 60 would also be a very very low-risk individual 60 milligrams per deciliter is about the fifth percentile at the adult population level so then that comes back to my question Sor one across the lifespan when like wait when do you start measuring this like people aren measuring their apob in their you know teenage or 20 yeah I mean I would argue we should be but I want to go back and say one other thing about your question um which I should have mentioned earlier which is it also depends on other risk factors so there are really four big things that are driving risk causally apob is one insulin resistance is one hypertension is one and smoking is one those are the Big Four so you have to take everything we the apob front and acknowledge that those other things are also causally linked to asbd so again it difficult situation to imagine but it certainly at least theoretically plausible you have somebody whose apob is at 60 but they have uncontrolled hypertension type 2 diabetes and they smoke I mean you could certainly arrive at that situation pharmacologically you that situation naturally um would I say that that person is free clear no I wouldn mentioned how the you know the downside of talking about asbd is the number one killer I mean it you talk about it globally the gap between asbd and cancer is even bigger it 12 or 13 million for cancer I mean it an enormous difference um but the good news is our understanding mechanistically of what drives this is so clear and our tools for prevention are some of the best and most benign okay so let person is relatively healthy you know they insulin resist I do want to talk about hypertension and insulin resistance but okay healthy generalized quote unquote healthy person right um wants to lower their apob they want to try everything through diet through lifestyle and you mentioned there are some major lifesty dietary factors that can increase AP so let talk about those what are the major so the big two are anything that contributes to insulin resistance so we um mostly through the vldl triglyceride pathway so we talked earlier about it how there are really two ways we make LDL we make LDL directly we but most of the LDL is made through vldl so if you you that lipoprotein but you also have a lot of triglyceride in it now something I didn restating or stating in the first place the LDL is C carrying around both cholesterol and triglyceride and the more cholesterol there is all things equal the more LDL you need but the same is true with triglyceride so the first mechanism in which we see a very clear relationship between diet and apob is the higher the burden of triglycerides the higher the burden of apob to State this another way if you take two people who have the exact same level of LDL cholesterol in the same total cholesterol but one has very high triglycerides and one has very low triglycerides the former is going to have a much higher apob and therefore be at a much higher risk of atherosclerosis because they have more cargo and therefore require more ships in the analogy of cargo being cholesterol and triglycerides and the ships being the lipoproteins so step number one is lower the triglyceride as much as possible and the triglyceride being low is an enormous proxy for insulin sensitivity so this is one of the important ways in which managing insulin resistance uh is is a key to keeping apob in check and of course there are other issues as well so insulin and glucose by themselves when elevated also create problems at the endothelial level which becomes another mechanism by which this is problematic um it dietary pattern perspective that carbohydrate restriction is the most effective tool of triglyceride reduction all carbohydrates I mean like vegetables fruits F yeah refined and starchy carbohydrates yeah so but that actually feeds really nicely into the next observation which is what impacts apob and that saturated fat consumption and the reasons for that are twofold so the first is that saturated fat directly impacts cholesterol synthesis now this is not true equally of all saturated fats but we don on if certain saturated fats have a greater impact on cholesterol synthesis uh relative to others for example a c16 might be potentially more so than a c18 or a c19 but again what foods would you find a c16 version oh like a c16 would be more in I believe like a coconut oil or a palm oil or something like that also by the way that you would also see that more a c16 like a palmitate would be more of a synthes would be more of a saturated fat you see in response to insulin resistance so it actually be a denovo saturated fat synthesis so um perhaps so so I think that part of it I think cholesterol synthesis big part of it I think a bigger part of it might be that excess saturated fat inhibits this sterile binding the sterile regulatory binding protein in the liver that results in fewer LDL uh receptors being made so saturated fat therefore has two things that it that are driving up apob and the susceptibility of this varies from different individuals so um I was on a ketogenic diet for 3 years I was not one of the people who seemed to suffer from this so even on a ketogenic diet where I was getting 80% of my calories from fat and probably half of that was saturated fat I did not have any sort of obnoxious increase in my apob or ldlc or any of these metrics similarly we have some patients who are on you know very low carb very high fat diets some of them have completely normal levels of lipids and some of them have lipids that go absolutely Haywire so it clear what the difference is but clearly there are different genes that will allow certain people to metabolize that saturated fat safely While others do not so I that um and there is an entire Camp of people who believe this that if you on a low carb high fat diet and your apob and ldlc go through the roof it it that at all I think that that bold claim and I would not be willing to play that game I think if your apob goes Haywire even if you sensitive and even if you balance and all the other wonderful things that might come with your uh with your you know your enic diet I I think you have to pay very close attention to if your if your lipids get out of whack so those are basically your big manipulations dietary Wise It composition of fat the

This is how long you should stop eating before bed	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZTSpjEtuXs	FoundMyFitness Clips 	I do make sure I stop eating at least 3 hours before bed it really makes a difference going back to sleep that I go to bed a little hungry um if I ever go to bed with my belly too to full it feels nice but I don I really try to air on the side of going to bed a little hungry and that know I young kids so we eat early so we eating at 6 so I typically with four hours between when I last ate and and when I um um when I go to sleep	Success
How much protein does Peter Attia eat in a day?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYbb2qiBfBY	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so I just generally pay attention to not eating junk that important Credo of my diet I would say and I say this as someone who everything right like I I you know um you know hardcore fasting intermittent fasting time restricted eating like I don periods of time and I have found benefit in one form or another from various different aspects of these things but um you know right now I around energy balance which you know stay in energy balance um and protein intake and so most of my conscious effort around my diet goes into making sure I protein four times a day um and a lot of times at least two of those are in meals that are just like just just venison or just you know eggs or something where it not a lot of other stuff in it	Success
The SHOCKING most common first sign of coronary artery disease	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jis17yRa774	FoundMyFitness Clips 	a little less than 50% of people brush with a symptom of coronary artery disease is sudden death that that worth repeating because it we couldn remember I still remember being asked this question in medical school you know you medical student in cardiovascular pathology class and the pathologist said what feature for someone having uh cardiovascular disease the first time and everyone was like chest pain shortness of breath you know rattling off all the usual stuff he goes no sudden death um again today it quite 50% but that statistic	Success
Peter Attia's INSANE exercise routine	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWWIAeVYqiA	FoundMyFitness Clips 	but I hours of Zone 2 a week with one sort of higher intensity workout that towards V2 Max a week and then four strength training sessions a week um so that of everything I do and then there other things that get layered on top of that like rucking and recreational activities that are also physical as well	Success
Peter Attia on Treating Low Testosterone (and why TRT isn't always the right answer)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htfbGGeliZU	FoundMyFitness Clips 	you hear a lot about uh low tea low tea and there it like what defines low tea is it a levels is it a combination of levels and symptoms um so how are like we looking at menopausa and women we talking about an average age about 51 or something like that right men let the same period of of life for men okay 50s do they start to experience like a decrease in testosterone around gradual and it starts frankly in your 20s and 30s um so so male testosterone probably peaks in the 20s and it steady decline it in the case of women where they you know they go through puberty they have these hormones that are cyclical and then fall off a cliff with men it sort of you go through puberty you kind of peak and then you um you combination of levels and symptoms and it symptoms matter because levels are really well how can I put it delicately I mean just not as helpful as we to believe they are um and it comes back to something you talked about a minute ago right which is how do these hormones work these hormones work by binding to Androgen receptors and the testosterone Androgen receptor complex has to make its way into the nucle nucleus where it impacts transcription factors now we know that not all men have the same density of anderen receptors and we know that not all Androgen receptors function in the exact same way so have this problem which is we sit here and we measure testosterone levels in men and maybe we measure bioavailable or free testosterone but those are just estimates they aren actually telling you free testosterone level um you testosterone you hormone binding globulin you measuring albumin you use those to estimate the free amount of testosterone but that like ldlc calculated by the fredwell formula is an estimate and then you sort of have to guess well maybe their Androgen receptors are saturated maybe they testosterone in the presence of mild to low te you receptors are not saturated and therefore giving him more testosterone will lead to an increased saturation of the AR and will lead to more nuclear transcription but we have no way of measuring that and so what I always say to patients is I got to see a certain set of symptoms in combination with a biochemical set of labs that makes sense and then we have to test it out but it not going to be a placebo test so we going to have a placebo effect and then if the if if the response we see isn hell yes I think we should pull pull it all off and see if we notice a response in the deficit and I symptoms as follows right so I for some signs and some symptoms uh most of it is symptoms so it reduction in libido reduction in energy mood um and then on the signs we of looking for um insulin resistance uh difficulty putting on muscle mass and difficulty recovering from exercise those are kind of your big ones and some combination of those signs and symptoms coupled with a biochemical story that plausible so you know your total testosterone might be below the 30th percentile or even 40th percentile um and your free is commensurate with that even though again that probably reason in in my book to initiate and uh is there a level that you decide to go to like so I mean is there like a threshold where it this is too much to stop yeah it actually kind of like what we were talking about on the vitamin D front like don going to get the answer so if if if and again each lab scales but in you know in the lab we use um the fifth percentile of total testosterone well let testosterone because we actually even though free is an estimate we kind of look more closely at free so approximately the fifth percentile is 5 nanograms per deciliter and the 95th percentiles about 24 nanog per dcil so call it 5 to 25 basically so if a guy is at 8 and we have the the case to make that he going to take him to 12 it like I and see if something and if he says to me at 20 I don we take it away and he says I don any different unless we were only treating this for insulin resistance and muscle mass those were the only things in which case I would say we still say the course and see if those things get better but if he you know if if we were doing this because there was you know some of the other actual symptoms um then I would say that look this guy might have been already saturated at at 8 nanograms per decler where he started and all that additional testosterone may have done him no good whereas somebody else might have been woefully undersaturated and when you you know increased him by 150% you actually got benefit from it does the like it injection versus like a gel does that matter like we towards injections um I think they far more consistent um I think you know you have variable absorption and it doesn vary by individual it varies by time a day so you know for example like if you and you and have a shower you in a less absorptive State than maybe if you your body do you put it on do you have to exfoliate the skin for first you have hair on the skin you know you want to put it on an area that doesn there so we recommend um an injection we also recommend instead of doing it every two weeks which is standard doing it twice a week at obviously a much lower dose so typical dose would be somewhere between 80 and 100 milligrams of testosterone a week so it would be 50 40 to 50 milligrams twice a week and that produces just a much more steady uh level because you trying to get the steadiest level possible and the problem with doing it every 2 weeks which was usually done in the days when people would go to their doctor to get the injection and you wanted to minimize the inconvenience of that um you for you know four or five days then you you very subphysiologic before the dose so we like what testosterone replacement therapy and like the prostate yeah very well studied um so couple things we know as clear as day right so we know know that the lower the testosterone the higher the risk of high-grade prostate cancer um so again contrary to popular belief testosterone replacement therapy does not increase the risk of prostate cancer um but what it does do is potentially increase uh BPH benign prostatic hypertrophy so it does increase the size of the prostate potentially um so so one you know needs to be mindful of that it also there are there are side effects of testosterone right it will drive hair loss in an individual who loss through um uh the the sort of Androgen Pathways there um it can increase acne in a susceptible individual again these things are typically more the type of side effects that people talk about when testosterone is being used in super physiologic levels so I last time we saw a patient who had acne um I so so these are really infrequent side effects um but we do have a lot of patients who you know are concerned about hair loss and um and and so we say look I mean there are strategies around that of course you can take a 5 Alpha reductase inhibitor uh so those are drugs that block the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone which is a more potent Androgen and that driving Androgen specific hair loss um or they might say you like I patients say oh you know what like my My Hair Matters more to me than my testosterone I don testosterone so so so those are the things that we just kind of want to point out um the only other thing that worth noting is I do believe that in a susceptible individual in the short run there increase in the risk of cardiovascular events with testosterone and it probably born through an increase in blood pressure so there was um a very large study that looked at kind of high-risk men and they were given testosterone and at one year post initiation of trt there was a slight increase in the risk of major adverse cardiac events in the testosterone group compared to the placebo group that vanished at two and three years uh almost suggesting that the highest risk men probably those that were closest to having an event were actually pushed over the edge a little bit again I I would probably attribute that to an increase in blood pressure as the thing that was potentially driving it so you know we testosterone until we have the house in order with respect to everything else	Success
Why Peter Attia has two phones (and how it helps him sleep)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o58JT6kbCPo	FoundMyFitness Clips 	I try not to look at email for a couple hours before bed in fact I have two separate phones I have like my regular phone that has email and social media and junk on it and then I have what I call my bat phone that literally has nothing it remote to the TV you know and it has like a phone and email but like oh sorry a phone and text but only like two people know the number my wife and my daughter and um that camera so it have a camera and a phone if I someplace and I don me um so that with me if I something like that but I can tempted to look at social media or look at email so it of like turning the system down before bed	Success
Peter Attia's 80% Zone 2, 20% VO2 Max Training Protocol (and the optimal VO2 max interval length)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klz9VouT0h8	FoundMyFitness Clips 	what do you think about so metabolic flexibility being being the capability to shift between using glucose as a substrate and using fatty acids I mean this is something this is the zone two thing right this is exactly why we train that zone 2 system and that know we have our patients spend 80% of their cardio training time in zone 2 that flexibility you this is a this is the training system for making sure you expand the capacity of your mitochondria to under ever increasing demands have the ability to utilize fatty acids for oxidative phosphorilation and glucose for that matter but if you were to do let high-intensity interval training which I do a lot of um that increases the capacity because it stimulator mitochondrial biogenesis so maybe and I and I hesitate to say like I think a lot of times when I hit I am I mitochondria like you know I doing an allout Sprint but like you know I do shift into to using glucose of course and we just think that only 20% of the cardio training volume should be there and the reason for that is actually kind of an empirical observation if you ask the question who are the most metabolically flexible healthiest specimens we have on this planet they are highlevel endurance athletes namely CrossCountry skiers distance Runners and cyclists so what do we know about this group we know that they have the highest V2 Maxes of any humans on the planet and we know that they are the most metabolically flexible of any humans on this planet now my experience is far more with cyclists and so I usually just talk about this through the lens of a cyclist um and the other thing I like about cycling compared to SK skiing or running is we can use wattage because we can put people on power meters and we can get the numbers a worldclass cyclist is able to put out 4 watts per kilogram of power while keeping lactate below 2 Millo in fact the best cyclists in the world are probably at about 4.2 4.3 watts per kilo so let on that if someone and they so if you means you watts which by the way most people who weigh 80 kilos can minute literally they can one minute these people can do it for hours and keep their lactate below 2 Millo it demonstration of metabolic flexibility that you will ever see how do these people train as this is you know this is one of the questions my patients ask me is Peter where is this 8020 coming from where demonstrated this and I said well the studies are all based on what do you have to do to achieve that level of performance so these athletes and their coaches have all figured out that to produce the highest V2 Max and to produce the greatest degree of metabolic flexibility you think of it as a pyramid where the base of the pyramid is your Zone 2 efficiency and the peak of the pyramid is your V2 Max and the area total area of the pyramid is your cardiorespiratory engine so you want not a narrow base with a high peak not a wide base with a short Peak you want a big base big peak and the way to get that is about 8020 if you try to do too much high intensity you simply don have the aerobic base on which to build it so yeah you might have more mitochondria but they efficient if you only do the low intensity stuff they you might not have enough this is a bit of an oversimplification but you want the Best of Both Worlds right you want you want both the the breadth and the the peak effectively so um what what we basically do with our patients is we we start from a standpoint of time how much time are you willing to exercise a week I to tell you what you need to do let start with you telling me what your willing to do and then the simplest approach is we strength and stability half of that into cardio of the cardio it that will be Zone 2 20% of that will be V2 Max and V2 Max by the way training is pretty hard because it intervals than what people think of as traditional hit so traditional hit works I the best way to get there um it a good way to get there and and we know like even just looking at the Tata studies right Tabata is neither one or the other right like a 20 on 10 off times eight rounds is neither a pure Zone 2 nor it it actually because V2 Max sweet spot is 3 to eight minutes with one to one rest to recovery so three on three off three on three off um that than most people are doing in a hit class most people in a hit class doing shorter intervals and pushing much harder I I just had a a a talk with um with Marty gabala and I asked him that question you know and he was like Ronda you got to do more three because I wanted I was like I want to do V2 Max training like this is what I do I do a lot of the you know do I do 16 rounds and I right but my 10 seconds off are I mean my my heart rate like I don to do like 3 minutes at least one you know and so I now to doing and it am not going as hard you can you just can it out because you realize and you you dead at a minute and a half and I was like loafing the last minute and a half or I held back too much and by the end of the 3 minutes it was like oh I actually could have gone harder and that of figure out what that sweet spot is um but that that 3 to eight minutes is the is the optimal zone for for generating V2 max power	Success
Peter Attia's sleep supplement stack	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdCi6USm3K0	FoundMyFitness Clips 	uh there use to sleep as well so I glycine um ashwagandha um magnesium L3 and8 and um and just straight mag oxide as well I don unless I hopping I well	Success
Peter Attia's Longevity Routine (sleep supplements, diet, exercise, and thoughts on alcohol)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ry_hPXwitMc	FoundMyFitness Clips 	there are a couple of personal questions that I very end of this um that I know people are also very interested in one being your ideal your ideal diet and exercise routine and other factors that you doing um for longevity or maybe for the day or for the week whatever whichever way you kind of bunch them in like what know improve your longevity I know that to nutrition and exercise um nutrition exercise and anything else sleep like you know son whatever whatever is your ideal like program the whole sweet yeah um well I will say this I I I that everything I going to make me sound really rigid and people are going to be like that guy psycho so I when in talking about what I do um well they want to people want to know what you do okay so um look probably compared to most people I am considered quite regimented um I than I used to be um but nevertheless here here things so let really take my sleep seriously and I functions best with a consistent bedtime and wake up time so I am in bed usually for eight hours a night and that typically 10 to 6 um and that usually results in probably 7 and a half hours of sleep um I the names of things I use because I don things so I use eight sleep as my mattress cover I love what these guys have done um it product and it difference for me I the last three years most of our patients are using it uh there are other products out there and I and they to Fancy the most agreed um I I doing before bed so I really and I perfect with this I any of these things Rhonda but I really go out of my way to not look at anything that not to look at email for a couple hours before bed in fact I have two separate phones I have like my regular phone that has email and social media and junk on it and then I have what I call my bat phone that literally has nothing it just of it has like the remote to the TV you know and it has like a phone and email but like oh sorry a phone and text but only like two people know the number my wife and my daughter and um that about it and a camera so it an excuse to have a camera and a phone if I my phone with me um so that the phone that TV downstairs or something like that but it I can social media or look at email so it it the system down before bed um even even little things like I my teeth before I go in the sauna because I sauna before bed as well so that once I shower like I bed um so for me that productive uh sleep trick uh there certain supplements that I use to sleep as well so I ashwagandha um magnesium lonate and um and just straight mag oxide as well I don phosphaline unless I I well uh so that nutrition side I don particular diet I I guess you could say I eat what a balanced diet so I um will probably always struggle with food in the sense that like if left to my own devices I would eat everything uh and too much of it so I do need to be mindful about what I eat so what do I pay attention to so I just generally pay attention to not eating junk that that my diet I would say and I say this as someone who I like the most you know um you know hardcore fasting intermittent fasting Tim restricted eating like I there done for long periods of time and I have found benefit in one form or another from various different aspects of these things but um you know right now I mostly optimize around energy balance which you know stay in energy balance um and protein intake and so most of my conscious effort around my diet goes into making sure I grams of protein four times a day um and a lot of times at least two of those are in meals that are just like just just venison or just you know eggs or something where it you know there stuff in it um I do make sure I stop eating at least 3 hours before bed it really makes a difference going back to sleep that I go to bed a little hungry um if I ever go to bed with my belly too too full it feels nice but I don I really try to air on the side of going to bed a little hungry and that know I young kids so we eat early so we eating at 6 so I typically with 4 hours between when I last ate and and when I um um when I go to sleep we can talk about alcohol I um I absolutely no benefit to alcohol at any dose from a purely you know biochemical standpoint um however I acknowledge that there are probably some pro-social benefits to it and I happen to really really like alcohol so I probably have well I don anywhere from zero to seven or eight drinks in a week um probably NE I don that I can recall in the last 5 six years where I drinks in a day and I also try to do my drinking early now by that I don two in the afternoon but I mean with dinner so that again um alcohol is completely it functionally the alcohol doesn this because I track all these things and I know exactly how alcohol negatively impacts sleep in me and I know that as long as I have that drinking done by six or seven uh it doesn that I okay exercise most important uh thing from a physiologic standpoint for me um I exercise every day and it know it around it so even here being in San Diego this week I mean it a membership at a great gym when every time I going to get up first thing in the morning and I going to do my workouts and they going to be completely you know they not going to be the exact same workouts I generally doing you know 4 hours of Zone 2 a week with one sort of higher intensity workout that V2 Max a week and then four strength training sessions a week um so that kind of the foundational pillar of everything I do and then there things that get layered on top of that like rucking and recreational activities that are also physical as well um so and then the the the last thing I guess I would say on that which didn about but it of this is you know mental health so everything that we factors into so so the right sleep the right nutrition exercise all of that factors into creating you know what I kind of describe as a wider buffer zone around distress tolerance and then you know therapy which I do at least one session a week sometimes two plus journaling um and and and you know doing something called dialectical behavioral therapy these things have been you know enormously important increasing kind of the quality of my life in the past 5 years	Success
Lactate and beta-hydroxybutyrate in the treatment of traumatic brain injury | Peter Attia	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p31duDKkj0A	FoundMyFitness Clips 	back to the lactate thing very interesting yeah so read up on this you know it George Brooks a friend of mine he physicians at UCLA looking at the effects of actually exogenous lactate on helping treat TBI because TBI why not just exhaustion is BHB or yeah or that have you seen what dumb D done I have I of his studies on cancer you should see Dom got started he okay the only reason he is because he saw he started out working in neurobiology and and using TBI models beta-hydroxybutyrate it doesn they both similar things are both thermodynamically favorable they allow glucose per and they allow glucose to then be you know used to make with phione which is important in the brain when you have damage but what interesting is that TBI also disrupts astrocytes ability to make lactate and what I might just synergize that that night because because I also think I think the trauma causes an oxidative stress I think what dehydrogenase is getting interrupted and all of a sudden you were having a a transient but violent interruption of energy to the brain and so from that this is obviously of high interest in the military because of blast injuries and Dom would know this so it absolutely worth talking about this with him I hope the DoD is all over this because the interesting question is do you have to have the bhp or the lactate in your system at the time of injury to prevent it or can administration be done immediately following the trauma or is there a kinetics is there a certain time I think because of the fact that it allows glucose sparing which if you have a trauma is and this has been shown in animal models for TBI that if you can prevent the and this but this was done by putting glutathione transcranial II which obviously is not going to do anyways they could prevent like over 50% of the damage because they were able to sequester the reactive oxygen species so that start to damage caused all the damage and the inflammatory pathways that start to get and out of control so I think that if you allow that glucose to be used for the pentose phosphate pathway within a certain time frame I don is it something within a couple of hours then independent of the you know allowing your neurons to get you know this easier source if your neurons are using glucose because they need energy you know but the glucose snack kit you know can used to repair that damage through the pentose phosphate pathway I think that one component of it in terms of the tempura it looks like how soon a few damage you	Success

Lactate and ketone metabolism in context of brain energetics and lactate shuttle | Peter Attia	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urkcn-Q4vFQ	FoundMyFitness Clips 	we brain being Alzheimer interesting to me is the fact that neurons are actually mostly using lactate from astrocytes astrocytes our glycolytic so the astrocytes are scoring cells in your brain which are using glucose mostly or what using clue the glucose to generate lactate lactate then get shuttled into neurons and then the neurons and the reason why neurons like that is because it like beta-hydroxybutyrate which you mentioned VHB because it can shunt right into it it how does the brain out-compete the liver for lactate so if you go out and if you if I made you go out there and do a bunch of burpees right yeah so you the blanket on the name of the transporter MCT one or two which one is the transporter out of the muscle oh I don lactates gonna be generating the muscle so then that MCT is gonna transport that out and somehow remember it through a portal system yes it actually does go to the portal it passes through the ID cave it but it through the liver how does the brain manage to get any out of without the liver taking it all into the Cori cycle which seems to me the preferential place to undergo gluconeogenesis yes so what weird is that I don question I know that many tissues and this has been shown through the work of George Brooks at UC Berkeley who actually pioneered the lactate shuttle hypothesis in the theory but it shown that it and by the liver it gets taken up by the muscle gets taken up by the brain in fact exercise itself has been shown to preferentially cause the brain to pick up can we measure you know I don if you read this literature but there a lot of really interesting work back in the sixties done at Harvard with real fasting experiments mm-hmm I mean 40 day fast s-- you have impatient subjects given nothing but water and minerals forty days and it was done to basically demonstrate what the steady-state fasting levels of glucose insulin bhp and acetoacetate would be and it actually quite interesting right so you take a normal person let and let know 10 your glucose level is 95 your bhp levels unmeasurable because you on a normal diet and your acetoacetate levels unmeasurable and then we just fast you and it turns out that within about seven days you level of five to seven millimolar glucose will be down to three to four millimolar which is call it 60 to 70 milligrams per deciliter and you will stay at those levels in you know sort of forever you know until at the end of the forty days they so the glucose so glucose never really goes away what consumption by the neuron which goes from at the initial state being about a hundred percent glucose of course I don then so we don looking at neuron adjust brain was it astrocytes they were probably just looking at brain yeah but it would fall to maybe 40 or 50 percent the rest of it being made up by the combination of the ketones and it never went to zero right so even to your last day of life if you to death you still have glucose in your blood yeah and so it that like what percentage of overall brain metabolism do you think is driven by lactate it must be very very small and reserved for you know a very very specific subset of neurons or astrocytes or well the astrocytes are using the glucose and they so so that issue so that doesn during exercise I mean but but it has been shown that lactate will cross over the blood-brain barrier during exercise as well but that is not the dominant source new sites yeah the exercise are making it in the brain and what so astrocytes don they do so why do they make all the like you I think they make the lactate because the neurons that getting their energy I think that the way work so it effect the Warburg effect of course to me is interesting because I don the argument that the Warburg effect is due to my defective mitochondria my Warburg showed that I mean he know there is there is still a lot of people who think that it the mitochondria and that but I think it cells smart enough and it for cellular building blocks and it sounds like the astrocytes doing the same thing you	Success
IGF-1 and its role in diabetes and Alzheimer's | Peter Attia	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OROpXGovSJw	FoundMyFitness Clips 	there are other things there things going on of course IGF of course just to bring it back to where we were I just really interesting because centrally and peripherally you may actually want them to be in opposite directions you probably know this but Amgen had a drug that was an IG F receptor antibody it went into clinical trials phase two trials in pancreatic cancer advanced pancreatic cancer and it failed now it failed despite reducing IGF levels at the receptor by 50% you could argue that that failure implies that reducing IGF is irrelevant reducing IGF is irrelevant once the tumor burden is established reducing IGF to only 55 percent is a realm you could argue a hundred different things so what does not cross the blood-brain barrier and so today there is there is ongoing research it this point in time that giving a diet that actually increases IGF but giving it in the presence of this IGF receptor antibody the point being is can we raise i GF levels totally primarily centrally and then block the receptor peripherally so we ward off cancer and diabetes but we ward off dementia and actually there evidence though I think this evidence isn central idea also are protective against diabetes oh really yeah but again the problem is these are animal data so you got to sort of take everything with like a lot of population you	Success

Peter Attia discusses biomarkers associated with the risk of the leading diseases	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxDOhKHnwzQ	FoundMyFitness Clips 	but yes Alzheimer the Nerds general diseases that are up in the top four or five like you mentioned well it only neurodegenerative disease that the top ten list of death top ten yeah so cardiovascular disease the cardiovascular annoy number one it it aggregate is number two but as as an oncologist I sort of taken issue with that because cancer is a completely hetero you know genetic form of diseases so you know to put this in perspective right so breast cancer who of breast cancer if you breast cancer accounts for three percent of deaths in women I was shocked to learn that very low I would have thought much much higher now cancer and women all cancers twenty and twenty-one percent cardiac disease twenty to twenty three percent so if you anyone on the street are you more afraid of heart disease or breast cancer I think most women would understandably say breast cancer and yet it dwarfs it dwarfed by the cardiac disease by a factor of seven and a half to one and we definitely know that diet and lifestyle play a major role and your you know risk for cardiovascular disease yeah I mean I think there obvious than actually in Alzheimer disease for other reasons which is really uh yeah I think then cardiovascular well III mean I say that just based on what I call the existence principle right so cardiac disease I mean I think that I think cardiac disease is inevitable mm-hmm right and well we deterioration in our lifestyle over the past 40 years pretty precipitated and accelerated sort of move in the wrong direction on that it amazing medical advances so there three things that have I think allowed cardiac disease to remain in fact it actually come down if you look at the death rate from cardiac disease it come down so it killer but it slope I mean it when you look at what sort of the three biggest drivers are of cardiac disease the first one is not disputed it data are really clear that if you could only make one behavioral change to reduce your risk of heart disease it done smoke yeah the next two are actually because they are so cross correlated you can distinguish which one are hypertension and elevated a poby or LDL particle number and again a PO B is the single best biomarker or LDL P to distinguish your risk of cardiac disease it Trump non HDL cholesterol it Trump triglycerides HDL cholesterol those things don particle number a bobeat well think about it think about the advances we made in the last 40 years on all of those right so smoking has gone from you know 45% of the population to 18% of populations we reduce smoking in the u.s. in the u.s. that we haven the developing world think of the litany of drugs we have for controlling hypertension and think about the litany of drugs we have to bring down a poby so despite enormous improvements in the three big picture drivers it number one killer so it lifestyle driven but we effect of that whereas an Alzheimer disease we don pharmacotherapy plays like we arguing about what the what the environmental trigger is is it all diet driven is it sleep driven is it stressed divin what is it a virus or is it prions I mean I but here in the last 50 years the prevalence of Alzheimer two and a half percent whereas the increase in our lot per year by the way I know that our longevity has increased at about 0.6 percent per year over that same period of time now over a 50 year period a two percent spread per year of prevalence actually they might be incidents now that I think about I think it that Alzheimer natural response of getting there you accept that part of that increase in incidents is a greater appreciation for the diagnosis it makes up the full 2% spread yeah and so that that there is something in our environment that and it is not just the natural consequence of Aging you	Success
Lifestyle factors that affect AlzheimerÂs risk for APOE4 carriers | Peter Attia	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIG3KXUXfzs	FoundMyFitness Clips 	there lifestyle in risk for Alzheimer disease particularly with having an April before allele and that I know looking I mechanism but also looking at you know the EPI studies up looking at epidemiology you see certain lifestyle factors you know for example drinking if you you repair as well you you know so anything that damage your body worse anything that gonna create inflammation refined carbohydrate eating a bunch of you know refined carbohydrates a bunch of sodas with you know added sugars like all this stuff that you know whole food food that something that to cause inflammation inflammation inflammatory molecules get across the blood-brain barrier you know so blah blah blah all this damage can continue to occur so obviously diet lifestyle play a very important role in your Alzheimer understanding the biology of what April before is doing because not only now there coming out of UCSF Gladstone Institute showing that in addition to a loss of function with April we for a lil there also a dominant negative effect so apparently the apoe4 there amino acid in a substitution and structurally if you look at the the structure of the protein it starts to get cleaved and so it itself starts to accumulate these like aggregates that it then you know keep you get more activated microglia and it keeps like spiraling out this whole inflammatory process in the brain so there this dominant negative effect that going on that to understand that as well you	Success
APOE 3/4 and APOB and their influence on AlzheimerÂs and cardiovascular disease | Peter Attia	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itiUatBsNH0	FoundMyFitness Clips 	yeah it but we I apoe4 allele so I poem actually writing a paper on it before and it right now well I that which I literature on it but I actually think it than the genotype so in other words I think it that apoE that not the genotype in other words just as we measure a poke B as a surrogate for LDL particle number and VLDL and renminbi LDL particle we can measure it but we know there clinically used or CLIA approved assay for that yet but there are labs that are doing it for experimental purposes and there nine months ago that actually showed that the if you take the eight but we three fours and four for says you know I a three for genotype just on a hazard ratio is about a 2x increase over the three three in terms of Alzheimer disease a four four of course is anywhere from ten to twenty X depending on the series okay so if you there and you especially if you you my patients who are for fours I have for patients who are for fours but when I saw this paper what it showed was actually and just so the listener would know the majority of people with Alzheimer four four they the difference is this because remember the three three is the majority of population I mean the four three four three four actually pretty big it about twenty percent but the three three is the largest one so having a three three doesn Alzheimer doesn the and by the way even a four four doesn so the key is is there something else that the phenotype so when they measure the serum level of apoE it turned out to be more predictive of Alzheimer my hope is that we can get a clinically approved assay in a relatively short period of time that will allow us to actually do that especially for the patients who are 3/4 and 4/4 which says are you able to reduce your risk so let and your apoE level was here and then we could say well look there intervention we believe that reducing you know increasing insulin sensitivity of your brain you know reducing the probability that pyruvate dehydrogenase is going to cause an energy shortage in your neuron it odds for delaying or eliminating an ad from the list and then we could measure your apoE at a point in time and it we confidence that we right direction because lower so you saying that the higher the expression the higher the risk the plasma in the plasma the higher the risk okay so a couple things one is happy to show you the paper yeah that because most from my understand you make a Bowie and liver you make it in astrocytes but one of the important things is that it important role in bringing cholesterol neurons but also in repairing damage that outgrowth to repair any sort of damage it or traumatic brain injury which is like damage in real time but I was into the impression that there there we for and so that there ends up being a problem because the LDL receptor is very important for bringing the cholesterol to the neurons getting it there and so I don I think the end by the way I could be wrong like it so I could have it backwards but I think the more important thing is there think there on right so the the apoe4 gene also plays a role in because because my real interest clinically is of course lipid ology that that becoming pretty clear now that the apoe4 four or the three four is not a death sentence in cardiac disease especially the four for the four four was really viewed as boy you an mi before sixty and I think the evidence today suggests that once you normalize and correct for LDL particle number or a poby yeah it stops mattering yeah those are definitely probably wrong yeah and and so so with the so loosely speaking this is an oversimplification if you 4 in theory you should have a harder time clearing LDL particles from circulation and and but I think that that you two issues you that one is the clearance issue and then one is the cholesterol transport the central park yes there there that well the in the brain versus the liver so I mean we astrocytes are almost like little livers in a way but not really I mean so there think looking at the effects on the brain and looking at the effects on you know recycling LDL and all the other things going on in the periphery are different but by the way I did just want to mention that between 65 and 80 percent of all all cases of Alzheimer disease at least you know at least one for at least one has a for between 65 and 85 and eighty percent of all the Alzheimers cases so so the majority are three for is then the majority of them have at least one allele yeah yeah but again that ratio we know that that game because 20 20 to 25% of the population is 34 right it exactly so but the point is is that the 3 3 doesn with someone walking around the 3 3 shouldn gonna get does not protect you but there is definitely some as the - to protect you - to the - does actually protect ya yes I yes I histogram of 2 2 to 3 its protective yes it is and so it it does and in cardiac disease the 2/4 is about the same as the 3 3 the 2 and the 4 cancel wait say it again so the 2/4 is before it 3 3 oh good again just in hazard yeah I found I found out my mom was 2 4 and it was further cardiac problem that was kind of worried anyway ok that interesting so we on this April we attend Junt but it one you	Success
Gut healthÂs important role in regulating inflammation | Peter Attia	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNy3PYc7lME	FoundMyFitness Clips 	your approach seems to really look at you know insulin response it at you know obviously the igf-1 m2 are things that are dietary nutritional factors that are you know influencing those pathways and then of course the rest being fat for me I like to think about food as a what you your body not only to activate these pathways or try to keep the pathways from you know being too active but also I like to think about at the level of the gut because they regulates the immune system big time I mean that insoles in your in your gut than you do in any other organ in your body and your your gut bacteria the interaction between you kept picturing your gut are also you know regulating the types of immune cells that you regulatory t-cells being you know put in that and also because it source of inflammation and inflammation even very recently has been identified to be a driver of the aging process so you know eating things that are good for your gut like fiber and avoiding things that are going to cause a lot of damage so I think about those things as well do you do you or and then micronutrients which is also very important micronutrients are cofactors for a variety of enzymes and proteins in the body make sure they functioning proteins that are involved in you know these processes we talking about keeping cancer cells in check you know like you know p53 is Inc dependent proteins magnesium which is important for repairing damaged things like that are those things that you consider at all when you about the influence of diet on the aging process I don as a lot of people do and I would hate to use the term a gut skeptic because I don bunch of negative images but so I gonna be a late adopter on this one right so there are a whole bunch of facts that everybody can rattle off about the gut a lot of them by the way are kind of BS so the the cells in the gut outnumber the cells in our body ten to one that actually turns out to be false I mean it bacterial cells versus yes right the bacterial cells within our gut so putting all that stuff aside there are a whole bunch of really interesting facts but it reminds me of you know what a good friend of mine once told me when I was trying to rationalize something I needed to do or so thought I needed to do to him I he said why are you doing this and I said and he said that fact but is it a reason and so that kind of how I feel a little bit about the gut look there really interesting stuff but I don know that it actually matters that much right it really idiotic example the number of ants on this earth outnumber us 10 to one I ergo we should be doing more to protect the ants by avoiding climate change yet I might be true there might be more ants than us and yes but but we species of interest so the point is so that interest the second is I don know what to do with it right so I been through it all I all the sequencing I patients and I have found that it there can use in really obvious cases so I had a patient that came to me two years ago who you know had a history of sinusitis horrible history of sinusitis so this is she was you know she probably had to do an augmentin course six times a year because of recurrent sinusitis she had three surgical procedures just couldn get better so started working with her became pretty clear to me that there was something in her diet that was creating an inflammatory environment that wasn a structural problem so we made a lot of dietary changes things got better but in parallel to that I sort of suspected that ten years of six cycles of augmentin probably altered her gut and so yeah she where I would do you know a sequence and look and be like lo and behold you all yeast right not surprisingly and and disproportional bacterial overgrowth okay so she whom the signal was so big that I felt like there was an intervention I could make which was both fixing her diet but also utilizing agents that could alter that but for the most part I don a clue what to do and all the people I see who claim to know what they do like they can knowing what they doesn I mean I of really amazing examples so we familiar with how c-diff colitis works and the reversal of c-diff was dual transplant so those are remarkable examples but but some of the other stuff I what I convinced but I this is like the that this is a reason and not just a fact so um I think that focusing on the gut microbiome and the number of you know bacterial cells that supposedly outnumber or human cells and all that I don important point my you know so I become very interested in the gut mostly because of a colleague of mine Marc Shaiman andhe who got research at Children Oakland and is brilliant he know showing me data and I convinced more and more that got health making sure that you mucin which your gut goblet cells are producing you know that disgustingly slimy mucous like material that keeping and separating the immune cells in your gut from all the microorganisms in your gut and that because when that starts to break down the immune cells recognize bacteria and there and I rhetorically I just don an effective way to to diagnose that in patients so the problem is is that endotoxin release into the blood system would be the way to measure it and you can measure it through the luck the lack of barrier basic you can measure the endotoxin levels in someone which is a marker of the three-book yeah but the problem is is that getting that there right so that that test that diagnostic test can be because it seems to me a stool test would be a more effective way to measure that under mucin mucin yeah there might be there might be a way to do that to measure it in a in a school that would be that would be an interesting thing to explore because that the so you know what I bit I or a scientist and like to be you know understand mechanism and see solid data before you you know think something is true and I have become more convinced that literally like the endotoxin released from the gut which is a constant I mean really the major source of inflammation in the body is yes and to be clear Ronda I so to be clear I I bought that thesis back actually when I was a surgical resident because we would see endo toxemia yeah right surgical procedure gone bad endotoxemia ICU death I know what that looks like an extreme state what I think I skeptic of and again a skeptic waiting to be convinced is that I can intervene through that I can make that diagnosis in a non catastrophic case which is basically the chronic case and make an intervention either through you know some alteration and in the microbiome itself or meaning directly or indirectly through diet or other variables so and I think that will be very interesting sort of sort of path to go down but but again I I just I know at the moment I focus on the ones I do know yeah yeah there is there is some interesting work coming out of like Justin and Erica Sonnenberg lab where at Stanford I recently had a discussion with them I looking at the role of fiber and certain types of fiber in fueling different species of bacteria that gut and how those are generating short chain fatty acids and other signaling molecules which are regulating hematopoiesis they number of T regs that were making so it is very interesting that feeding are got certain types of fiber which are present in vegetables and a variety of you know fruits even do have a positive effect on the immune system via yeah these signaling molecules that are being made in the gut that interesting that is one thing that I consider when I effects of diet on longevity you	Success
Biomarkers to determine the ideal macros for longevity | Peter Attia	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnF0M941NLo	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so I still haven question which is how do you do this with diet but-but-but-but so I think I will explain conceptually how you do it how you do it at the individual level is empirical and I think prescriptive meaning you have to be able to try something iterate on it and make a measurement but here way to do it the conceptual way to do it at least the way I do it is you consume more or less the least amount of protein you can consume to maintain and grow muscle mass but you don it depends on the individual it depends on the timing of that protein ingestion the quality of that protein and the type of metabolic and conditioning stimulus you put into it but there but for most of us I think we probably over consuming protein relative to that actual need so we raise protein level till we hit that amount carbohydrate we do the opposite carbohydrate we are basically lowering it until we reach the highest point I probably the lowest point that we can tolerate where we can maintain and again this is quick and dirty but it lowest possible fasting insulin and in my mind I typically like to see that at below 3 or 4 as IU of insulin and you want to limit sort of post-meal glycaemia and i actually use a standardized test which is an OG TT which has its limits because it you limit that postprandial hyperinsulinemia to a number and I use a reference I use a check point of 30 that I want to be able to see within one hour of 75 gram glucose challenge if you can keep insulin below 30 so in my mind because I can under the curve so they rigorous way to do this would be I a catheter in your arm and I would sample your blood every 30 or 60 minutes over the course of a day while you ate and I would say what that function and there would be an area under the curve of insulin and that actually the number I care about but since I can research setting I rely on these other proxies so the bottom line is your carbohydrate content is highly variable by the individual by their insulin sensitivity by their must mass and their capacity to dispose of glucose and a host of other factors but the bottom line is you don consume any more carbohydrate then you can without blowing through those parameters and you don any more protein than you need to to preserve that and then basically fat becomes the fill and so the point here is that that becomes a highly different diet for different people for some people that and 20% protein and the remainder fat for others that 15% protein in the remainder of fat you	Success
Insulin, carbohydrates and the IGF-1 pathwayÂs role in cancer and aging | Peter Attia	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYOP5M3BH1I	FoundMyFitness Clips 	okay so that right now the hard one IG f yes okay so two schools of thought on this I am in one camp but I will acknowledge the other camp one camp says igf-1 is driven exclusively by amino acids the other camp says no it actually driven by amino acids and carbohydrates yes and carbohydrates indirectly via insulin yes so why are those mutually exclusive oh the way I define it when I certain people who I will not name that are prominent and field who I will argue with that will argue that the carbohydrates play no role it virtually all protein but there is a role that they do play that depending I believe it has been shown I mean there are they erudite people in this field who believe it is entirely an amino acid issue then it is true methionine has probably been shown to be the most active amino acid in driving IGF pathway however as it sounds like you agree it that as insulin levels go down i gfb p3 goes up as IGF bp3 IGF binding protein 3 goes up maybe it moment to explain why that matters so most of these things is maybe the listeners know you know when we have hormones floating around the body whether it be testosterone whether it be cortisol whether it be you know thyroxine these things they don because they they can bloodstream freely they have to be bound and carried just as cholesterol does and so it often don important role in determining how much active or bioavailable hormone is free so in the case of igf-1 it gets trafficked by this IGF binding protein and most of these binding proteins actually bear an unbelievable relationship to insulin so sex hormone binding globulin goes up when insulin goes down it always this complaint that free testosterone levels will drop all things equal in someone who restricts carbohydrates and I remember sort of hearing that empirically and not really thinking much about it until I started to one observe it and to understand why and it things equal when insulin goes down which is usually what happens when you were stick carbohydrates sex and when binding globulin goes up that means if you have no change in testosterone level or even estradiol level free testosterone will go down less testosterone is around to be unbound to the exercise some abiding lobule n so so it that insulin and carbohydrate do play an important role in the IGF pathway and I also think empirically not that I like to refer to ecology or epidemiology but when you look at the ecology and epidemiology of cancer to my knowledge the content of highly refined carbohydrate and sugar is more predictive of cancer in a society than the verb the variety and protein content in other words there are cultures that have consumed larger and lesser amounts of protein that have been without mass amounts of cancer but the same cannot be said with large amounts of these things now the problem by these things I mean sugars and high glycemic in Excel right the problem with that is of course you can negative to me is suggestive that at the very least carbohydrate content matters when it comes to igf-1 signaling absolutely and the way I like to think about it actually when discussing these two things is you know igf-1 is not a cancer initiator like it cause the initial damage that can make a normal cell aberrant a normal cell that acquires whatever problems it acquired to make it you know turn into a cell that good at doing is taking that cell that already acquired damage right and saying here keep growing like no don know there are trying to kill you but don know whereas the refined carbohydrates the way I always think about it is you know that leads to a variety a plethora of physiological process in your body inflammatory processes you know a lot of different pathways that are causing damage that are initiating the type of damage so it you have someone that terrible diet they carbohydrates they releasing endotoxin and their gut they process going on they hypochlorite damage you know they damaging mitochondria damaging DNA blah blah blah well and then you know they slit acquire these damaged cells and then they protein and activating the igf-1 pathway it the damaged cell and here signals to to like keep keep living and keep growing so I kind of yeah I mean I think so you obviously alluded to this and I think many patients when I talk to them are sort of surprised to learn that every one of us has cancer I mean at this moment I have millions of cancer cells in my body as to you the the good thing is virtually all of the time the problem gets eradicated right so either we talk about the a poetic pathways that you describe but even when those pathways fail our immune system is remarkable I did my postdoc in immunotherapy so I spent about two and a half years working with T cells specifically regulatory t-cells and looking at his problem and you know we just take for granted how good the humoral the the cellular immune system is rather so for those again maybe not familiar with immunology you know you have your B cell system your t cell system these T cells which are the ones that fight viruses are unbelievable when you think about how many antibiotics we have in our arsenal to fight bacterial infections it how many antiviral drugs we have relative to antibiotics we have very few and we certainly don most common viruses we acquire and yet virtually all of us recover in the end unharmed from the typical viral infection we get two to three times a year that our immune system is and when you unleash it against cancer it 99.9 percent of the time so yeah the name of the game is avoid the amplifiers now the other reason why I think this is an important thing an important concept that goes beyond cancer but now gets to the broader aspect of aging is when you look at the people who live the longest you look at these people who live to a hundred and beyond for the most part they died of the exact same diseases as the rest of us schleps they just get them later that important because I think it offers an insight into longevity that is often overlooked so if the people who live to a hundred 105 we accidents and plane crashes you might make the argument that there classes of citizens right there people who get chronic disease and then there get it and eventually they just die of something else because remember the fourth leading cause of death or the fifth leading cause of death starts to become accidental stuff once you get outside of the chronic stuff but that not the case the point is we of pre-programmed to go through this process but if you want to live longer the name of the game is delaying the onset of the big three the big three being the diseases that will kill 75% of us so cerebrovascular and cardiovascular cancer and neurodegenerative and and so that brings us back to why we don out why we in check because we them from being able to sort of amplify that you	Success
How amino acids like leucine drive mTOR and affect muscle mass | Peter Attia	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMrfkfJzUNU	FoundMyFitness Clips 	are you familiar with like any of the dietary nutritional research on igf-1 and mTOR and specifically with amino acids and how yeah I mean that my biggest obsession I think is probably around those topics so it I think we have probably a better understanding of mTOR I mean I think it driven in fact what last Thursday eight days ago David Sabatini and his group at MIT published a paper in science that identified the amino acid sensor for M torque one now it which was leucine was the highest affinity but infective is he crystallized that structure so if you even think about it through the lens of like why do bodybuilders or people who you know love lifting weights want to take branch chain amino acids while they through this empirical observation that it enhances muscle growth and/or prevents muscle degradation during exercise what I think is really interesting is that you know we now know exactly what chain amino acids there are three leucine isoleucine and valine it turns out that isoleucine and valine are virtually irrelevant it all leucine and what just from an evolutionary perspective is that M torque in muscle has a much higher affinity for leucine than M torque one in fat or in hepatocyte now that to believe that in times of nutrient deprivation even a trace on of leucine should preferentially provide the muscle with its growth signal before providing the adipocyte or hepatocyte so so from a nutrient sensing pathway what you could infer from that is too little leucine probably a bad thing too much leucine probably a bad thing now what too much into little R I think remains to be seen right the other thing to keep in mind is you know and about one of the questions a friend of mine asked me recently actually a mutual friend Tim Ferriss is you know can we can we take two Lucene during a workout and again I don know extrapolating from the animal data I think five grams of leucine during a workout probably not harmful and it also doesn stick around very long because when we take amino acids in a workout if you sort of sip them throughout the workout you got a relatively short stay in the body in fact one of the pharmaco interests on this front which is to treat diseases of muscular wasting is to actually come up with molecules that are not necessarily more potent agonists of the leucine receptor but would stick around a lot longer because that problem with the nutrition side is we can stimulate muscle growth you	Success
An overview of mTOR and IGF-1 | Peter Attia	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RMUFOvcUB8	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so I what Emma Tory is can you explain why that there are probably depending on who you talk with or would I would say there are two or three major growth pathways in the body that are kind of responsible for growth both in the positive sense and in the pathologic sense the two that I focus on the most are the igf pathway and the mTOR pathway now mTOR stands for mammalian target of rapamycin i think for the sake of time I will not tell my favorite story which was is a story that is both the discovery of rapamycin and perhaps more interestingly the elucidation of how it worked but suffice it to say the compound rapamycin was identified first long before a really amazing guy named David Sabatini as a PhD student at Hopkins in 1993-94 as a side project in a lab made the discovery that this thing rapamycin was actually working by inhibiting a protein complex of which tor target of rapamycin as it became named was the central piece we now know today that it can form into two complexes one is called mTOR complex one or M torque one and the other is mTOR complex to torque to and we also know that it exists in different tissues and it has different activities in different tissues and like most things in the body too much or too little is a bad thing so if you have no end torque one for example in your muscles you debilitating condition and in fact for people with muscular dystrophy one of the things you want to do is figure out how to alter that pathway but similarly we know that over explore activity is predisposing us to aging and of course certain diseases of aging like cancer so for people that you know when Peter mentioned that you might if you don have any M torque one activity you might you know cause muscle wasting well that important role in protein synthesis and what two pathways that you mentioned in being involved in aging mTOR and igf-1 igf-1 actually increases mTOR activity so you know there yeah these aren these aren what they intake right so igf-1 one of the major so igf-1 is also a growth factor that you do need as well so it don you in trouble I mean there positive things about igf-1 muscle growth muscle repair neuronal growth but too much igf-1 also can allow damaged cells to continue growing you	Success
Peter Attia discusses his diet to delay the aging process	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6pveD00qKc	FoundMyFitness Clips 	what are you eating then - to try to delay the aging process like what is so diet obviously plays a very important role in aging and I out exactly the best diet to eat and talk a little bit about what I think but I thoughts so I mean I think the short answer is we don I don definitively if you define definitively as a randomized clinical trial of longevity in humans it we instead we have to rely on proxies so we we look at proxies and animals where you can do virtually anything you want in a totally controlled setting but then you run the risk of two things one are you identifying diets that are clinically and biologically meaningful to your host for example if you put you know a humanized diet into a mouse what you learn may or may not extrapolate to the mouse exactly to the human and then secondly you idea that you an artificial environment and when you reduce the risk of a subset of metabolic or a subset of death a subset of you know causes of death which is effectively a metabolic disease you often unable to measure what in my opinion is an underappreciated risk that comes on which is sort of the more sudden and traumatic causes of death that we take for granted especially in the case of caloric restriction so that what we do in humans is we can rely on our best proxy biomarkers that we think reflect the systems that drive aging and we can measure those things over time and sort of you know estimate what we think is the effect of you know this dietary change or that dietary change or this lifestyle change or that drug change on those things and so I basically try to focus my efforts on those on sort of converging those two worlds but acknowledging that we never going to know the answer for certain and we our best judgment around those things and and hope that in time certain other things do become available for example it would be really great if there was a way in the blood to measure the activity of mTOR we don it would also be great if we could you know measure other growth pathways like the wrasse pathway without having to rely on you know tissue biopsies and things like that you	Success
Human milk oligosaccharides: breastmilk sugars that facilitate a healthy infant gut	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfUQGHmSqXw	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so babies that are fed formula their microbiota looks very different than then breast milk and actually what we see is breast milk has a component of it one of the major components of breast milk is this type of carbohydrate called human milk oligosaccharides or HMOs and for a long time it was really a mystery why those molecules were there because we knew that humans can milk oligosaccharide so why would a mother put so much effort into creating these compounds and putting them in her milk if her baby can we gut microbes that are digesting these HMOs so in breast milk there food for the baby in the form of lactose and fats but these HMOs that are food for the babies growing microbiota so the mother babies growing microbiota and these HMOs are very specific for human milk and so far have not been able to be replicated in formula and so that we think is a large reason why the communities are so different and then of course antibiotics the average American child is on a round of antibiotics every year and we know that that on on that growing community so all these things that happen early in life could really set a child on a trajectory potentially for having potentially a very good healthy robust microbiota or potentially one that that isn and so I think as parents especially of new children we need to be very mindful of the choices that we make early in a child microbes that we have by the time we say the age of five any of these microbes will be with us throughout our entire lives so we really want to get that community started in the best possible way you	Success
Resveratrol: dosage and effect on cardiovascular health | David Sinclair	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vcF0C2cZI8	FoundMyFitness Clips 	you know that was virtual field when I first was following it back in I guess the early 2000s you know I was a very skeptical that there would be any effect in humans taking reservatrol because certainly not from drinking a glass of wine but from supplementing just because it seemed as though like the dose is required to get some really beneficial effects at least in some of the Rhoden studies seem sort of you know high and it wasn but as you know this there was a really sort of compelling primary study in rhesus rhesus monkeys I forgot when that was published it was like mid 2000s or 2011 or something right rough photo covers group at NIH yes that they they gave these rhesus monkeys resveratrol and I think they started out with the lowered it was like 80 milligrams particularly when they went up to like 480 any reason do you know why they start with I one study do that yeah so I just anecdotally what Rafa told me I think is that they started at the low dose and didn velocity in the blood vessels so they upped it and then that of benefit oh okay so well this study was you know the the the doses were very doable in humans when you you know convert and and basically they you know feeding these monkeys they were feeding him like this terrible high high sucrose diet hyster gross and high-fat and they like it caused them to have like forty percent increased a or tech stiffness but the resveratrol completely ameliorated a like yeah so i was like holy crap that pretty cool yeah i think that was the one study that sort of changed my view and then i started to sort of get into the literature and read ones that there was you know there clinical studies as you know and yeah well I literature because that there was there was a hate me Club with resveratrol because it got so much attention there is anything that gets a lot of attention gets to hate me Club right in Reverse but resveratrol I still take whereas we were gram really yeah in my yogurt I don in so it might be half a gram to a grants from your own like - it stash in the basement I privately - it is I resveratrol above 250 milligrams yeah right you made a good point which is it that problems with resveratrol one is it really insoluble so if you just give it as a dry powder to an animal or a human it that as a fact include it with a bit of fat it bloodstream really big effect we in mice and monkeys it was with a bit of fat in the diet as well I mean the second problem with resveratrol is that it and so those people who researchers who put it in a plate with worms or didn treat the molecule with respect it goes Brown it goes off that reasons it cosmetic because you cause medical turn brown if you use brown or resveratrol it won the dark in the cold and it okay so so we and also I think there like trans-resveratrol I go for the trends because when we gave the SIS form to this or to an enzyme it didn activate it but the trans worked brilliantly yeah Rafa de Cobo actually he great colleague he did the study with us on the mouse or his virtual study that showed that on a high-fat diet those mice were extremely healthy and longer-lived and their organs when we they opened up the mice they were pristine so that the mice was still obese because we didn of resveratrol is pretty low dose but their organs were so beautiful their arteries when you stained them for oil of fat it was night and day the ones on resveratrol all the ones without reversal was staying with fatty lumps reversal clean and that alone makes me say you know resveratrol is probably not going to hurt me and it may very well help my cardiovascular system seems to be really important for a cardiovascular system and I why is it we we have a number of ideas and whereas very troll is a dirty molecule so there works sirtuins definitely are involved we now have a mouse that the resveratrol activation of certain one so we now see that some some aspects like endurance of resveratrol seem to be through sir one so one of the effects is through certain ones anti-inflammatory actions in the lining of the blood vessels the endothelial cells yeah that seems to be important and there aspects also in DNA repair as well um infiltration of macrophages in there seems to be dampened and we also looked at oxidative stress in those arteries of those mice treated and it was way down in there is very tall nice yeah with the rhesus monkeys with the free now basically like you know completely reversing that forty percent a or t stiffness that dramatic effect it isn think resveratrol it know always a true is it not at 60 minutes did a story and then there was an argument about how it was working and so people are confused about the molecule night I still stand by it because the results like you say in animals and in there are clinical studies now lists that are really positive in humans not all of them sometimes it has no effect those one study where it interfered with endurance exercise don Foreman was kind of shown to do something similar where I prevented mitochondrial applications yeah I mean maybe Rhonda was maybe happening is that if you radicals too much you that kinetic effect exactly the might of Rome Isis but but I haven downside I one in as you would say in a clinical trial I a 3d movie MRI my heart looks like it 20 it doesn dad any harm so how long have you been taking it how do you since 2003 Wow can you take a battleground give her so yeah okay you	Success
Nicotinamide Riboside vs. Nicotinamide Mononucleotide - dosing and effects on NAD+ | David Sinclair	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vik7auA9QC4	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so with the with the clinical studies you know there to my right aside but I guess the you know the the question is what the nicotinamide right aside there little confusion about like you know whether or not nicotine my right asides you inside cells and different organs other than the liver this was this was this nad flux paper that that was done by Rabbo minutes with Rabinowitz Rabinowitz thank you yes that that study he recently published just a few months ago I aside and how orally at a dose half of what typically is used and all the other nicotine my right aside animal studies so typically they do four hundred milligrams per kilogram body weight per day I don they were doing it but nad flux study he did 200 milligrams per kilogram body weight which is significantly less than what all these other studies like the one you mentioned with Alzheimer disease and other studies that have shown improvements in mitochondrial function in mitochondrial mutator - and also muscular dystrophy and all that so we use double that dose yes so maybe you know the this nad flex study that showed nicotinamide rabbits that given orally did in form nad in muscle but it did in the liver could have been a dose-dependent thing it would make sense because we we mice and now in humans and that there a threshold that you need to cross you need to take a certain amount to get over probably the body mechanisms and then you get up to a level that plateaus after about nine days and they may have just been under that threshold so the body was just clearing it out but you have to seemingly overwhelm that clear out system so that makes begin and that right aside the question is I mean that equivalent dose for like 180 pound man that kind of leads me to that my next question which was the most recent clinical study with nicotinamide right aside where they actually used a much higher dose in the original study that was done with basis the Elysium that had pterostilbene in it this dose was like a thousand milligrams a day and they looked at a variety of endpoints in addition to with Oh guide endurance of dead it was dug seal study yes and and there was no statistical significance and anything it raised any levels but there was no statistical significance there was trending improvement and the basilar system and there no effect on endurance and I again well if we go back to the human equivalent dose what was given to the animals that was still less than half I mean so the question becomes is it not even making nad in the muscle tissue at that dose or you know so which brings me to the nicotinamide mononucleotide yeah you know like now that those studies have been done in animals at a much lower dose than 400 milligrams they have yes we in my 11 and at the company metro biotech we different molecules and different we do what there talk for another hour on one of the big questions people ask me is have you ever put n R and n MN head-to-head in a study and we need to do a lot more of those typically they aware of it being done in humans at this point but in mice what we see and for all the N our folks out there please don I don deliver the message that at the same dose n MN will increase endurance and I figure what that dose was it might have been 200 or 250 200 NM n didn in during I endurance but n MN did we do find that for some parameters and met cable line who I mentioned earlier who he works on dog aging now after doing this or - extension lifespan so Matt also has published that comparing n R and a man only n MN work in his his disease model which was a mitochondrial disease where those animals really need a boost of nad so one of the issues could be that in a man is a better molecule in that regard it could be that maybe the mice just worked better than humans and we need a bigger dose but what I not talked about a lot because it in the commercial realm is there a team of seven chemists working on much better molecules than any of these two that I boosters and we have ones that work far better than any men and these are timed release these are what we call pro drugs and those are the ones that aren really excited about for medicines of the future that don someone diabetes and heart disease and cancer and Alzheimer clinical trial right now with a molecule called MIB 626 MIB is just a metro biotech and that trials that have been done at Brigham and Women group for me it and they that when I come back on your show if I come back back on your show I may be able to tell you if we see some actual efficacy some results we the face to study at strength and endurance in the in the muscle of people after some nmn dosing so we verge of knowing if this is real or not for people you	Success
NAD+ boosters: NR, NMN, and how they affect sirtuins | David Sinclair	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4um8OQH8LtM	FoundMyFitness Clips 	you we probably should should definitely get into that but well they because as I mentioned the proteins many of them like the sort terms who are moving around controlling the epigenome you want to stabilize that as best you can animals like whales and naked mole rats have a very stable epigenome so there moving around at proteins and epigenomic noise accumulating if we we slow that process down I believe let boosters are so the precursors for nad should we make nad in our bodies and we yeah we do and so nad is recycled in the body because there can cycle it nad and it all starts with nicotinamide which is a form of niacin vitamin b3 but you can very effective just overdose on vitamin b3 because you need other things to make the big molecule nad so nad is the reason it dinucleotide is that it three main components and the dinucleotide is related to DNA right but that molecule so that if you give a big molecule to cells it doesn up so we don don is the little end part of nad because it these other parts so n MN and n are a two molecule so it stands for nicotinamide mononucleotide which is essentially the precursor the immediate precursor to nad if you give a cell in a man it will be taken up by a transporter which was just discovered by my buddy Sheena my we used to work together at MIT now he wrote about it I wrote about it that there man and the other man is converted within one step to nad in the cell and now it locked inside the cell and that step is carried out by an enzyme it it up under stress and calorie restriction and in yeast it we showed years ago that that step of conversion of to nad or in yeast what is a nicotinic acid to nad is the critical step for boosting an ad when you your circadian rhythms when you exercise when your cells are stressed and without that step you don calorie restriction your organs start to get old so what is n R so n R is fairly popular a lot of people have heard of it it stands for nicotinamide ribose ID and all it is it n a man without a phosphate on there so there take an hour your body has to first put on a phosphorus and then it has to basically link two of them together to make the nad so with all that said and argit then into nad yes yes it has to yeah but in RNA and in a man have both been shown to raise the nad levels in animals and in humans as well and there nuances about the differences but they both seem to be effective not just in humans actually and I should say and in mice but in yeast they work as well which is nice you	Success
The link between sirtuins, calorie restriction, fasting and the insulin pathway | David Sinclair	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S89Om5XXVuU	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so um I became from with your work back in those days when I was actually I doing doing research on these little nematode worms and I remember the some of your work was on resveratrol and how resveratrol like helps to regulate one of these I guess longevity pathways sirtuin the sirtuins and how that was involved in basically if you could activate them certain ones seemed to delay aging so maybe you could talk a little bit about both sirtuins and also what resveratrol is oh sure oh let start with the sirtuin so when I arrived at MIT it had just been discovered that there was a gene called sir for that when it was mutated would make the yeast cells live longer and a fair amount of work we figured out that the sir proteins which are enzymes that control gene expression genes on and off they would become dysregulated over time and we found out that being distracted by a whole bunch of DNA instability that was accumulating in themselves but the the lesson was that these sirtuin enzymes that were controlling genes were also controlling lifespan which was a real breakthrough no one had really expected to find gene regulators controlling aging we thought we repair proteins that not initially and so the sirtuins became very interesting in the east and met cable line who seattle he was a leader in the field as well he came in and his first project in the lab was to put an extra copy of one of the sorcerer genes number two so two into yeast and those yeast lived 30% longer and later Lenny at Harvard showed that this was through a process of mimicking calorie restriction if you have a lot of sirtuins you get the benefits of calorie restriction or dieting and other types of little stresses on the cell like heat and a bit of lack of amino acids and if you get rid of the sirtuin assert you gene the real breakthrough was that now calorie restriction doesn and that whole setup was the basis of most of the research that the field has been doing since in a certain field trying to understand that concept of what we learned in the 1990s in our bodies and in mice and I happy to say that a lot of it is very similar in our bodies as well and when you say calorie restriction usually you mammals and humans like eating 30% less than you normally would or something yeah well in the old days we typically would take out 30 sometimes even 40 percent of the food of the mice and they wasn you restrict to yeast we just dropped the level of sugar in the the petri dish I think it was fivefold and that was enough to make them live longer and but they still grow quite happily these days as you seems to kick these longevity genes into action so - and still come on but you don eat you know four days of out of a week or even six days out of week and still have a period of fasting that gets this or to an activity up to levels that we think would be beneficial yeah and there overlap at least in the in the scientific literature between calorie restriction and intermittent fasting having beneficial effects variety of beneficial health effects but I do you know some of the differences would obviously be you know when you are in a minute fasting you your metabolism from carbohydrate glucose to fatty acid metabolism and you start to you know ketogenesis can kick in after at least if you prolonged type of interment it fast so there differences as well in between Petronius well one thing that interesting that connects everything is so we showed in 2005 in a science paper that when you take a calorie restricted rat and look at its organs we looked at the liver and muscle the levels of one of the sirtuin genes the number one we have seven of these genes so we looked at number one because we we only had an antibody in those days - number one it went up dramatically I think it was about five to ten fold in levels in the calorie-restricted livers and then we recapitulated calorie restriction in the petri dish we grew cells in serum from animals that had been calorie restricted and we found that that was also enough to stimulate this boost of sirtuin production but getting back to what you did in Auntie Dillon reason it went up in the dish was because of having low insulin and igf-1 levels because when we put back in normal insulin levels in igf-1 the sirtuins went back down and that was a nice link between for the first time in mammals the sirtuins calorie restriction and the insulin pathway you	Success

How to store nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) to reduce degradation | David Sinclair	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVxQVppyhhM	FoundMyFitness Clips 	actually you remind me to say something important for the listeners make sure your NR and your Anna man is kept in the cold if it not in a stabilized form then it will degrade into nicotinamide which is something you don doses off because we showed in my lab many years ago that nicotinamide will inhibit the sirtuins and PARP as well and and interfere with DNA repair what really like like the form that vitamins right it doesn long shelf life that cool I have free 0 the fridge but I mean like if you nicotine my driver-side you know from a variety of companies that make it it certainly not shipped to you a cold so the question is how much of its already degraded just on the shelf I don I mean it probiotics you know you when you get probiotics you want them to be shipped to you cold yeah you know see that they have to also replace our mouse in a man we put it in their water we replace that every week because it goes off but that if it gets wet or gets a bit of humidity in the bottle it degrading you	Success
Discovery of genes that reset epigenetic age (Horvath clock) | David Sinclair	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr1iRlSPSTA	FoundMyFitness Clips 	we haven graduate student one chain will probably kill me for saying too much but we both so excited even today he sent me a text about it and you break through his that we found not only the genes that trigger them to move but then the genes that reset the whole that clock once they get there really if you genes that can make them moot make the methyl groups methyl group yeah and we set the methyl groups and what tells them to go okay yeah okay so I hint to the viewers and maybe this will be published in shortly we I saw using the the what Yamanaka factors huh and so the first because my do this sure well the the the first person to use these factors was Shinya Yamanaka Japanese scientists who looked through a lot of different genes and found a set of four factors that if you put them into an adult cell it would go back to being very primitive so primitive what we call a pluripotent stem cell that you could then turn those cells into a nerve cell or even regrow an eye in the dish it was a breakthrough that led to the Nobel Prize being awarded to him in 2012 you just take a person mean that why not we do think I mean a high school student can do that these days it typically with science once you know how something works it with aging I think but what we decided discovered is that and first of all I want to give a lot of credit to someone at the Salk whose name is Juan Carlos Beaumont it is their good friend of mine and he experiment that we were trying to do so we was just slightly scooped on that but he made a mouse where he could turn on these four Yamanaka genes and for sure if they stand for OS k and M and that Mouse when he switched them on died within a couple of days so that great for those mice but what he then cleverly did was he didn his his postdoc didn did was he turned the genes on for a couple of days and then stopped let the mice recover for a few days then turn them back on and so the you know I feel for the mice because they were headed towards death and they could recover and then they cycled but actually they ended up being healthier the premature aging mouse model that he had lived I think it was 40 plus percent longer but also he that you can use these factors team to improve wound healing and kidney healing so was he boosting their stem cells pools and their what so he was a regenerating tissue what I think he doing is what we which is getting those proteins that have moved around and lost their way to go back to where they were were no young and then reset the methylation clock and now a cell doesn using CRISPR it have but it was a transgenic mouse which means he inserted those four genes into the mouse switch yeah okay we don use viruses that we can give to old mice he has to start from a single egg we can go into old mice and within a few weeks figure out if we tissue or in the whole mouse and we also discovered that it don have to leave one of those off because it it the other three work great and the results that came in through the text today use those three genes to protect neurons from dying in the mouse but also in the dish and that the gene that can restore the the horvath clock was required and so we to seeing the future of where maybe eventually we don have molecules that can do this that we can put in a drip or in a pill that can send us back in other twenty years that pumped up about this whole epigenetic clock research and linking it to you know basically like being able to reverse reverse aging I mean I think that if you know is there any evidence that fasting has any of on that epigenetic lock has that been shown you know I have not seen that I think what I and others is that you can slow the rate of the clock but I haven yet and I just told you and he that someone we figured out why the clock ages what causing it but also what reset that would suspect that fasting can help but probably it what these powerful genes are doing when one day we fasting I still do that as much as I can for one main reason and that is that it that at least slowed down and somewhat stabilized the epigenome decay that we call and but we probably going to need something more potent to really go back 20 years but do we do we slow down aging by fasting and and running absolutely no question you	Success
Resveratrol and NAD boosters lead to positive impact on Alzheimer's disease & vascular dementia	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n6fmXkLgcA	FoundMyFitness Clips 	as you know that there was a couple there studies on Alzheimer they were given 500 milligrams or a thousand milligrams of resveratrol it was a very tall day and both these studies found that there was a reduction in amyloid beta 42 and cerebral spinal fluid there was an improvement in cognitive function and a couple of other parameters so it was kind of interesting because I recently had dr. Dale bredesen on the podcast and he has this whole protocol where he you know diet and lifestyle factors you know improve cognitive function and also by MRI like help shown to like reverse some of the atrophy in the hippocampus and so whereas very tall was honest he got this long list and I kind of like everything in the kitchen sink or it was like geez like what is old and was very trawl was on there I never really knew why until I read very recently was reading a little bit of the clinical studies I thought that was super interesting as well and then the other thing that was interesting as you know is the etapa G because R is very tall seems to be activating a kapha G yeah and I also interviewed Guido Cromer on the podcast you did and he talks about these three signals that are important for tofu G and one of them is the decrease in protein acetylation yeah yeah because sirtuins are histone deacetylases right so that would lead to right a decrease in protein that exactly right so that pac-man enzymes are working and one of the enzymes that they work on is a notify protein that goes and destroys bad proteins so it reasonable to think that if you take resveratrol it might be clearing the body who has protein there I have seen a study with yeah we should Turner I believe he think you really promising and he did what looked like a very convincing study but he actually is still trying to raise the money to do his larger trial and I trying to help him with that but I would love to see that repeated yeah and more people yeah I know that dr. chroma has published a study looking at biomarkers of etapa G and humans after after they think one of the one of those was looking at like lice the acetylation on lysine or something so seem to be working so that interesting the NAD boosters also yes help the brain so at least in mice a couple of labs have published now in top journals like cell that raising the nad levels in the brain also improves memory and slows down the advancement of Alzheimer mice admittedly I know we Alzheimer nicotinamide right aside and nicotinamide mononucleotide i shown to do that in animal studies right yeah you yes you know so that that love to do a human study actually one of the benefits that we might see is also improved blood flow and that might be helpful for vascular dementia because as I men and others have shown for NR that it also helps with blood flow and and actually mimic exercise and regrow the vascular system and we muscle we it also helped restore blood flow in the brain which is badly needed for a lot of elderly people right yeah I know that a that for cognitive function and so and a man was able to do that in Amash mice yeah you	Success
Why we lose NAD+ in aging [DNA repair & inflammation] | David Sinclair	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzZmTrGVzqA	FoundMyFitness Clips 	let me ask you this this is kind of something that it comes to my mind I don this way at least in the field but you know because nad is required for cells that have a really high energetic demand like activated immune cells for example activated immune cells require a lot of ATP for energy and a lot of nad and if you think about like chronic inflammation how you know your especially as you get older and you unhealthy and with a ticket you know basically it is it is increasing if you cells is there any way to test if like the NAD like there is kind of being sucked away to these activated immune cells and like then your mitochondria are now suffering and you get like mitochondrial decay because because you all this nad like take care of you know what your body thinks is potentially an infection that could kill you right so there evolutionary mechanisms at play that say oh yeah immune cells need this nad more than mitochondria or I don be kind of interested in do you follow what I think you being thinking along the same lines that as you get older you the ability to make nad but you chewing it up and as it gets worse and worse as you get older the immune system is a big drain on nad and actually so is DNA repair with the activation of parts and and once you drain in AD a little bit then your pops and your immune system won they more damage and this is a positive feedback in a bad ways that you once you start going down the nad decline the cells just start to need more and more and more with accumulating DNA damage and that yeast cells going back to those little critters that we found that they became overwhelmed with damaged DNA and the sirtuins were overwhelmed they had to go over and repair that genomic instability the DNA instability and one of the reasons old cells became sterile which is a hallmark of yeast aging is because the sirtuins is keeping the cells fertile back here but they distracted by all this other DNA damage that over here that they lose their identity and that is likely trillion mammals as well that accumulations of DNA damage distract the sirtuins from their normal job of keeping a cell with the proper gene expression and seller identity and we see the loss of cellular identity over time in mice at least and our what we trying to do is to raise nad levels back up so that they can fix the DNA damage but also get back to where they came from and make sure the cell doesn its identity too much edit know so trans played a role direct role and I guess they they DNA damage well they proteins to get to a broken chromosome really yeah we we discovered that that a while ago it was a it was a cell paper in 1999 if anyone would like to look it up mills myself and guarantee published that surtout goes to a broken DNA end and then helps recruit other proteins really so like like like gamma h2ax yeah so the first thing that happens is gamma h2x gets lit up on the break and then within seconds sirt1 brings in h deck one remote all the DNA in the chromatin so that it proteins to come in and without sort one getting there these are repair proteins are very inefficient but they distracted swords should actually be regulating genes elsewhere I think right this is all part of my idea my hypothesis is called the information theory of aging is that we losing the information regulation over time and all of these other things that occur such as telomere loss and mitochondrial loss and loss of produced a scissors and he would call it loss of protein folding mechanisms this could be upstream of all of that that we ourselves lose their identity and don turn on the right genes the way they did when we were young but the trick is how do you get everybody to go back and reset and that on you	Success
Dr. David SinclairÂs personal dosage and supplementation habits	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjyD_Ati9ac	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so you mentioned supplements you take a gram of Chris Farrell sorry No yeah Graham it is a ground resort or whatever I pour out into my yard about a gram of in a man and that yogurt as well know that I can just take that as a capsule in the morning down it with a cup of coffee and that big boost I find physiologically those three things with the caffeine included you can ask my friends sometimes I have to temper it a little because I mouse on oxygen running around the cage a little bit too much but it works for me it helps with I believe it helps me with jetlag as well or our lack of sleep I don one so you know what that thankfully I now but sleep is really important for aging as well you	Success
Why NR is more commonly used in studies (vs. NMN)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVHnzROvZWY	FoundMyFitness Clips 	is the reason why there are more studies within our because Ana men is so expensive yeah well historically some companies started making in our early on and made it widely available and cheap to research is in fact so cheap they were giving it away to researchers so it became used much more often than Anna men but increasingly and if any scientist lab once so many men let me know I like but yeah and Anna man was late on the scene because it was harder to synthesize because it molecule needs that phosphate and phosphate chemistry is quite difficult what are so you mentioned the the company that you that that four of Anna men or is this like so I don endorse products um I you can only do one it doesn committed my career to making pharmaceuticals that are proven to work and a proven safe and a watered dark you know so let me by the update it it my early in my career I dabbled in in a supplement world with resveratrol and it only lasted about three weeks before I had to get out because of it incompatible with for me at least me to be able to without getting criticized this is what I think this is the data and I want to be able to say that without making any money off it but also I find that the supplement world is it so controversial and litigious that I was scared away it that I am unable to talk about supplements by name because I obviously know a fair bit but I just can you know I lawsuits I that I my mouth and there are a lot of companies out there who have a lot of money who don unfortunately you know I really am unable to do that I do tweet out on and do social media where I can I blogs about it like I the few scientists that tells the world what I do personally and use myself as a role model for people to judge but I never recommend anything because first of all I physician I mostly study mice so I don yet how this is all going to play out in people it be available without a prescription now well it would but it will also be nice if someone like me did a clinical trial so we knew what would happen and want those to take well that would be that the first and foremost I mean knowing the dose to take that effect right it mean don amount just because it makes you feel good I mean let something it definitely is changing to open meaning and an immune system and stuff but I agree yeah you	Success
The relationship between sleep and insulin sensitivity | David Sinclair	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzowgy7_QOk	FoundMyFitness Clips 	sleep is really important for aging as well particularly the aging brain you know so in fact I was wearing a continuous glucose monitor I wearing one for a few months now and my son like around Thanksgiving time started having teething and stuff and he started waking up in the middle of the night and he and it was like so I was basically having very fragmented sleep and my my blood glucose level was like my fasting blood glucose levels and my postprandial were like 15 to 20 units higher and this was like repeatable very I was you know my diets pretty much I you know eat the same thing so it eating anything like a cookie or anything like that I mean it was just like and doing some high intensity interval training did help and there actually some research on that but I was astounded by the effect sleep had or lack of sleep yeah if you take a rat into privative sleep it within a matter of a month or so I mean it the studies I had a dr. Matt Walker or on the podcast talked all about it but when it happens to yourself and you see the data I mean of course it just an N of one for me but I mean it was just like it was very to me and made it very real I was like this this really is regulating my insulin level my insulin sensitivity right I could see my age changing when I had young kids oh absolutely I have aged for sure I mean you can see it like the the you know especially as a nursing mother and you son being born it was just so hard I mean I mean it was so hard just check out photos of me in my 30s and early 40s when it was lack of sleep and stress and my wife was screaming at me for traveling that kind of stuff that wore me out you can see that I aged rapidly since then I don don then so it important you	Success
NAD+ and resveratrol levels affect the aging process | David Sinclair	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE6OBk22uOY	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so nad levels decrease with age and and that you think this is a causal for plays a causal role in the aging process right right so what why is an ID link to sirtuin so sirtuins are enzymes and this is my picture of an enzyme but things like a pac-man that chemical groups off other proteins telling them what to do like a traffic cop and without nad they don they an idea around otherwise you but if the levels go down as they do as you get older and I so my levels probably a half what they were when I was twenty scary thought so my sirtuins are working maybe half as well as they did telling the troops to go out and fix my body so when I go for a run I get less benefit from that I feel tired I don mitochondria are down but by raising up the levels of nad - when I was young what I think is going on based on the animal work we years now is to trick the body into thinking that it been exercising or dieting and that it allows the sirtuins to do their job the way they once did by just having that level of nad higher like it basically like a signal it is so think of it as the fuel in a car if the sirtuins are driving yeah and then the resveratrol that we worked on years ago works on the same enzymes but it accelerator pedal so it actually the NAD is making it work but research oh we come along and make it work even faster so the combination of those two we find is even better than just one alone you	Success
How stressed plants communicate to our genes (to our benefit) | David Sinclair	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO8FJ8i02Xo	FoundMyFitness Clips 	I suppose people are interested in the plant world and what we eat these same pathways these certain pathways exist in plants as well and they get turned on in response to stress we call this Zener missus the idea that when we eat stress plants we get those molecules and they help our bodies so resveratrol going back to that old chestnut it produced when the grapes get stressed and fungus right well fungus will in stimulate it or lack of water so the when they harvest red wine they don they hope for a dry season that the resveratrol levels and other good good polyphenol molecules and we think that I think that when you ingest those molecules the sirtuins are have evolved to sense the plant world and if your food is stressed out your body will hunker down and become fitter as a result of sensing that because you know we can see crops that are dying or if the water tables drying up maybe we can test sense that but little animals that we evolved from or even you know squirrel it food supplies stressed out its body has to take care of that message yes so the the resveratrol is activating all these stress response pathways that are basically you know in our you know we have in our in our body and and basically turning on all these you know genes that are helping you deal with stress but they activated for longer and so when you know basically aging which is a stress you better right couldn then the opposite if you spend your whole day sitting or typing or you always satisfying your hunger your sirtuins and your other pathways and become a stem tour they say hey times are good let multiply and not build a sustainable body in the long run and because there always a trade-off which which Tom Kirk would call the disposable soma hypothesis and it seemed in very true so you want to always have your body in a state of a little bit of stress hormone I call that yes people listening to the podcasts or heard me about hormesis quite off quite a bit my favorite is sulforaphane that the molecule in the cruciferous vegetables you	Success
NMN supplementation reduced aging in mice (broad array of parameters) | David Sinclair	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQXIZznPc2g	FoundMyFitness Clips 	I was super excited I think it was a 2016 cell paper you mentioned the group that published the Anna man basically that was given to normal mice yes Sheena my study yeah my study that and basically I think it was about 200 milligrams per day like that dose as I remember looking at the dose and going this is significantly lower than nicotine my right aside dose and it it it multiple organs where I mean it was like I don he didn of material and in those days any man was hard to get and it was very expensive it still is very expensive we kilo but what he showed was that over a year of treatment pretty much all the parameters of health in these mice were were improved and if those mice didn live longer I done an animal I it crowd-sourced funded so thank you for your donations but it already it looks significantly different the group that on Anna man in their war supply and also it improves frailty in other words they improves heart function as well the dose I can it what me but yeah I in a man and in our seem to do remarkable things to rodents but like you say like you brought up the challenges a does it work in humans and B if it does what dose is necessary to get those effects right you	Success
Genetic strategies for reversing epigenetic age (Horvath Clock) | David Sinclair	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhd_PuYGzfU	FoundMyFitness Clips 	well if you think about as you know Steve hor bats work on this epigenetic clock and how he several different cell types um you know including from humans that there very distinct epigenetic aging clock that so what what you know I got a jump in because I excited about this what I telling you about the sirtuins in the movement we linked to Horvath really yeah it process so this distracted protein DNA repair system what happens is that you get methyls on the DNA that we use as a clock but what what we is a way of resetting the proteins to go back to where they came from that there are modifications on the genome that say hey so - and these other proteins go back to that gene because that you belong 20 years ago and ignore these other changes which have come on since you were 20 and we literally found what it that signal is to get them to go back now nad is part of that you need the fuel but what genetic trigger to say get off there and go back there and we we think we found that and it clock being a publication it we that exciting has there has there been any and we been any evidence looking at like for example like super centenarians what their epigenome is like very they done the the horvath clock on it yeah and is it different than like elderly for the for the same age yes right and actually the whole that clocks has now been done on people who are smokers or obese and it yeah timber tissues like looks like 10 years older than the same person like age match normal tissue that yeah because we that clock with our new found genetic trick and we having benefits on those cells as well so I think this could be love yeah and damaged neurons in this a cool-ass exactly it seems to be something radically new but it and his research is really interesting in that it is showing that it doesn just predict your chronological age it predicting also how long you have to live and which is a really interesting thing that if you and don instead of Terry Steve can take your blood and he can say hey you years older than you should be even if you let you know and you hadn twenty years and you and eat healthy do you think that more epigenetic mark is there or do you think that that I think it is it well we know the rates of cancer go down but all the other damage that changes it to the epigenome what I my hands this movement of proteins that you suddenly start running in your 60s that it identify the signal well the signal yet we restoring eyesight in old mice and regrowing optic nerves in old myosin it seems to be safe they no downside this is by manipulating the epigenome right Wow you	Success
How NAD+ drives the circadian clock and regulates sirtuins | David Sinclair	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCMdpTj0nm4	FoundMyFitness Clips 	something that comes to mind when you sew you important role that calorie restriction or intermittent fasting plays and activating this certain pathway and also deactivating things like the insulin signaling pathway and igf-1 pathway it is the the fact that these sirtuins are regulated by something called nad nicotinamide adenine nicotinamide adenine adenine dinucleotide that but that is something that actually those levels rise during a fasted State they showed it right and in response to exercise as well and so the reason nad is so exciting compared to the 1980s when we thought it was just a housekeeping molecule for reactions is that the levels of nad go up and down depending on not just what you eat but whether you and even what time of day it is so during the day your nad levels will rise and then you eat a big meal and they go down again and it of the reasons you also get jetlag is your nad cycles are out of whack is it on a circadian rhythm is it completely regulated by bite meal no it combination it will be going up and down with cicada rhythms mostly but you can adjust it within what about macro nutrient composition like if you eat more or a high fat versus carbohydrate yeah no one knows that that would be a good experiment that circadian field hasn aware but what I can tell you anecdotally is that if I raise my energy levels when I better if I have a shot of an nad booster in the morning when I get to Australia which I travel to pretty often and so I don working we need more than one person in a clinical trial but it fits with the mouse studies which is that you can use nad to reset your clock what interesting about this is that nad isn being driven by the clock the clock is being driven by nad mmm okay yeah so for people that are viewing or listening the clock meaning the the what state yeah how your organs coordinate what time of day it is and when you jet-lagged your brain might realize that it know see sunlight but your liver still thinks it you feel queasy that and the reason why nad is I mean nad is really important for a variety of metabolic I mean it metabolism for metabolism metabolizing glucose metabolizing fatty acids or mitochondria need it but it important for a variety of other tissues as well activating store to ends and then DNA repair enzyme yeah PARP right you could argue that nad is the most important molecule in the body maybe with the exception of ATP but without either of them you seconds so nad and ATP were probably the first two molecules that life on this planet used to survive and it amino acids as well and so isn interesting that the amino acid levels ATP and NADH is in our bodies that are sensed as to what our environment is like and whether we need to hunker down and survive or go forth and multiply and those are the three main pathways there kinase which is the metformin pathway and then there which i listeners are aware but we into very early aspects of life that found all over the planet and that I think we in the animals often people say it good to be true you know you tweak one pathway and all this good stuff happens well these are pathways that have existed for going back probably more than three billion years and we easy and seemingly safe it is to tweak them you	Success
ResveratrolÂs impact on the cardiovascular system | David Sinclair	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igzklpXDPj0	FoundMyFitness Clips 	well I still take resveratrol probably a gram or so every gram really yeah in my yogurt I don I just shake it in so it might be half a gram to a crisis from your own like - it privately - it is I doses of resveratrol above 250 milligrams yeah right you made a good point which is it molecule and that there are two problems with for as virtual one is it if you just give it as a dry powder to an animal or a human it get absorbed we know that as a fact include it with a bit of fat it 5 to 10 fold in the bloodstream really the big effect we monkeys it was with a bit of fat in the diet as well I mean the second problem with resveratrol is that it light-sensitive and so those people who researchers who put it in a plate with worms or didn respect it goes Brown it goes off it one of the reasons it in a cosmetic because you cause medical turn brown if you use brown noser resveratrol it won to keep it in the dark in the cold and it basement cold dark and also I think there trans-resveratrol I go for the trends because when we gave the SIS form to the sort to an enzyme it didn but the trans worked brilliantly hmm yeah Rafa de Cobo actually he good friend over the years a great colleague he did the study with us on the mouse for his virtual study that showed that on a high-fat diet those mice were extremely healthy and longer-lived and their organs when we they opened up the mice they were pristine so they the mice was still obese because we didn give him a lot of resveratrol is pretty low dose but their organs were so beautiful their arteries when you stained them for oil of fat it was night and day the ones on resveratrol for the ones without reversal was staying with fatty lumps or his virtual clean and that alone makes me say you know resveratrol is probably not going to hurt me and it may very well help my cardiovascular system you	Success
Resveratrol shown to have positive impact on brain health (or in AlzheimerÂs Disease prevention)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_ewY02BL8	FoundMyFitness Clips 	couple of study as you know though there was a couple there clinical studies on Alzheimer where they were given 500 milligrams or a thousand milligrams of resveratrol it was a very all day and both these studies found that there was a reduction in amyloid beta 42 and cerebral spinal fluid there was an improvement in cognitive function and a couple of other parameters so it was kind of interesting because I recently had dr. Dale Bredesen on the podcast and he has this whole protocol where he you know diet and lifestyle factors you know improve cognitive function and also by MRI like help shown to like reverse some of the atrophy in the hippocampus and so resveratrol was on his he this long list and I kind of like everything in the kitchen sink or I was like geez like what is old and was very trawl was on there I never really knew why until I read very recently was reading a little bit of the clinical studies I thought that was super interesting as well and then the other thing that was interesting as you know was the etapa G because resveratrol seems to be activating a tappa G yeah and I also interviewed Guido Cromer on the podcast you did and he talks about these three signals that are important for a tofu G and one of them is the decrease in protein acetylation yeah yeah because sirtuins are histone deacetylases right so that would lead to right a decrease in protein that exactly right so that pac-man enzymes are working and one of the enzymes that they work on is a notify protein that goes and destroys bad protein so it to think that if you take resveratrol it might be clearing the body you know his project there I have seen a study with yeah we should Turner I believe he that referring to and it looked really promising and he did what looked like a very convincing study but he actually is still trying to raise the money to do his larger trial and I him with that but I would love to see that repeated yeah and more people you	Success
History and discovery of longevity genes | David Sinclair	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx8LOnpxrlU	FoundMyFitness Clips 	I over 30 years now and when we first started out we knew nothing and then we went to little yeast cells and then we worked our way up to worms and mice and now myself and probably a couple of dozen other researchers around the world have broken through a barrier of understanding about why we age and how we can actually reverse it Wow so what the suit oh wait that the breakthrough well there were a number of breakthroughs so in the 1980s the big breakthrough was that there are and early 90s that there are genes that control aging we call these longevity genes do not call them anti-aging genes we don about longevity and health span and so these longevity genes were first found in organisms like a nematode worm tiny little one and yeast cells that we use for baking and bread and that started my career at MIT with Lenny guarantee running a lab and those same genes are in our bodies and in pretty much every life-form on earth and what we a run or you those are beneficial actually is because they trigger those longevity genes to repair your body and make sure that you don I just as a sort of side note because you mentioned these longevity gene genes and the yeast and the worms one of the first so I was in college I went to UCSD in San Diego and I was a chemistry major and I worked in biotech at the time it was a sort of a startup it was Illumina and I worked in the chemistry department now it working there my junior and senior in college and I you know it was sort of like I was making peptides and doing a lot of organic chemistry and after a while I just didn interested in anymore so I went to the Salk Institute to kind of get a little bit of a taste of biology because believe it or not I didn a chemistry major I had a few but it was mostly just you know chemistry and so at the Salk I I joined aunt Dylan and who uses you know nematode worms to understand the genetics of aging and I remember the first time I was working with these these worms that had a decreased insulin igf-1 signaling pathway how they lived like a hundred percent longer and how they were like youthful when they were supposed to be dead and I saw it with my own eyes and I was doing experiments and it was like holy crap this is cool i we have genes that are similar to these little worms and they are like this you know so so that kind of got me interested in at least on the genetic side of Aging well I even I don lab you may be surprised to know and people will tell me results all the mice are living longer downstairs on the nmn or whatever we mice because we and you know this all sounds great and you know I go back to my email it until I go in to the animal room and I see them with my own eyes and these are living creatures that are getting older and getting younger it really is an impact to actually see it and hold them with with your own hands so yeah that a that studies that I was doing back in the late 90s I was very intimate with the East cells it sounds weird that you could really adore a little microscopic organisms but you look at them under the microscope and they live for about a week and you have to monitor these mother cells and they have little daughter cells that you pick up used to pick off with a microscope and a little pick you get to know those cells pretty well you don them numbers but when they were getting big fat old sterile and then they died you know there sadness that these little dudes that you or females in this case were dying so I think we biologists we get attached to these living organisms and it rewarding to see that when we making them sick we actually end up making them live longer and healthier lives you	Success

Resveratrol improves aortic stiffness (in rhesus monkeys) | David Sinclair	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUemMyAPKO4	FoundMyFitness Clips 	you know the resveratrol field when I first was following it back in I guess the early 2000s you know it was a very skeptical that there would be any effect in humans taking reservatrol because certainly not from drinking a glass of wine but from supplementing just because it seemed as though like the dose is required to get some really beneficial effects at least in some of the Rhoden studies seem sort of you know high and it wasn but as you know this there was a really sort of compelling primate study in rhesus rhesus monkeys I forgot when that was published it was like made to thousands or 2011 or something right rough photo covers quick at NIH yes that monkeys resveratrol and I think they started out the lowered it was like 80 milligrams per kilogram they went up to like 480 any reason do you know why they start with I do that yeah so just anecdotally what ruff had told me I think is that they started at the low dose and didn pulse wave velocity in the blood vessels so they upped it and then that they saw the benefit oh okay so well this study was you know the the the doses were very doable on humans when you you know convert and and basically they you know feeding these monkeys they were feeding him like this terrible high high sucrose diet high sucrose and high fat and they like it caused them to have like 40% increased a auric stiffness but the resveratrol completely ameliorated a like yeah so i was like holy crap that pretty cool yes I think that was the one study that sort of changed my view and then I started to sort of get into the literature and read warns that there was you know there clinical studies as you know and yeah well I literature because there was there was a hate me Club with resveratrol because it got so much attention there is anything that gets a lot of attention gets to hate me collaborate in reverse you	Success
Informational theory as a context for epigenetic reprogramming and aging | David Sinclair	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G2gy1zBilA	FoundMyFitness Clips 	to go back we were saying about the epigenetic clock and and the aging and I had always wondered about with the Yamanaka you know these these transcription factors that are able to sort of take a already differentiated cell like a skin cell or a neuron or a liver cell and turn it back into a a stem cell a pluripotent stem cell you know I always wondered what about the epigenome right is it like do you have an older epigenome but you know like I don the epigenome and that yeah so I think of think of the genome as the digital information so this is zeros and ones or in this case ATG see but the epigenome is the reader of that and it maintain over it it has to be the key it yeah but how do you get back that information so I little bit because your audience is a smart one so back in in 1938 there man a brilliant person called Claude Shannon he was at MIT and he wrote a theory mathematical theory on communication and his goal was to correct the loss of noise during a transmission of a radio signal during World War two and and beyond and he came up with a mathematical theorem of how do you make sure that the signal that starts here is pristine when it gets to the actual receiver and what he decided was you can either make it digital or you can have somebody who the signal and then if it gets messed up you then send a replacement signal we now call that tcp/ip it runs the internet that why it works and we wouldn internet if it wasn Shannon think that understanding why we age loss of noise over time analog systems very prone to noise but that system of resetting aging how do you get the original information back that it was when the signal was first sent that that cofactors are able to do they are the group that sits above and says oh that signal is degraded use that signal yeah that Paula five so that it that that I been riding up in a book which is coming out later this year in September and so I haven applications so it may be one of the first times those scientists puts his whole ideas and theories in a book before it comes out in peer-review so we it maybe by September I scientific papers written up as well what an exciting field do you think other scientists in the aging field will start working on this I feel like this needs to be there needs to be a big push like yeah it now i mentioned one carlos Belmonte and the salt he is part of our dream team there another guy unfortunately there are guys currently but hopefully not forever is Manuel serrano he in Spain in Barcelona he these factors into mice but there aren just men working on the epigenome of Aging so a couple of really top leaders so an Brunei is at Stanford she working on the epigenomic causes of Aging and we have Shelley Berger at UPenn who what makes the difference between a short-lived ant and a long-lived and that seems you know I epigenomes and Jessica Tyler works on the epigenetics of yeast cells and try to work out exactly what I was describing earlier about the distribution of proteins between DNA breaks and controlling a cell so but that world aging but it years from now we lives yeah sounds I mean this is cool it whole idea like is definitely in some way come come to my mind with the Yamanaka factor and using that too like a reset you know for aging not just about making I mean there the okay well you can keep you know replenishing your your cell types in different organs and kind of keep it going but like to like turn it back to like think it there away yeah it Yamanaka did us a big big favor actually John Gurdon who won the Nobel Prize with Yamanaka he will really told us years ago back in the 1980s that reversal of aging is possible and we didn get it what he did was he took an adult cell nucleus from a tadpole put it into a frog what that actually tells you is that your genome can be reset to going way back and aging is not a one-way street yeah the fact that you can take your adults on reset it to stem cells is proof right and right and but now we know the machinery at least the beginnings of it and it time I there going to talk about you know you	Success
Indigenous use of ayahuasca, psilocybin, peyote for religious healing rituals	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9hjeI3ECSY	FoundMyFitness Clips 	dimethyltryptamine DMT is is a nut is a very short acting classical ascension of the serotonin type and and its phenomenology is is distinct from Salvadoran is it its phenomenology similar to psilocybin though well that gets complex because it short acting that it compare and DMT is also the active ingredient in ayahuasca which is the the brew that America and by some of these syncretic religions and that combined with an MAO inhibitor that slows down the metabolism in gut and so it changes the duration of action and makes it more like psilocybin and under those cases those effects certainly look more like psilocybin than just smoked DMT but direct comparative pharmacology studies haven any of these compounds so we have yet to tease apart you know the real differences in as it varies and there a lot of the indigenous populations that use some of these these hallucinogens like psilocybin I think - oh sure so psilocybin has been used for hundreds of years in Mexico ayahuasca DMT in the form of snuff sore or as this brew have been used for as far far back as documentation allows in in South America of course we have peyote which is mescaline which is another certain urging to a agnes used by the american indian you know there there probably almost 200 speed seeds of philosophy mushrooms and and those are used have been used around the world so there there indigenous use of these compounds interestingly for the most part if a culture has historical use of these compounds it controlled cultural context in general for religious or healing purposes or for divination you know but it they used casually okay yeah yeah okay yeah so I guess people are obviously using it for you know other cultural reasons and they yes and and yeah it that the use has been enculturated in a context in which the meaningfulness of the emergent experiences has has been thought to be a value to that culture it makes sense to if you mystical experience that hand-in-hand goes with some sort of religion religious sometimes a lot of people and religions have mystical experiences when they whatever reason they you know talk to some higher power that they believe in or something so kind of all makes sense you	Success
Meditation changes gene expression and has long-term benefits | Roland Griffiths	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0JUWOm7gY	FoundMyFitness Clips 	I had read a a study showing that there were gene expression changes that occurred after like the first five minutes of meditation there was like 500 different genes were changing their gene expression which to me is very phenomenal that you can actually just just by actually you know stopping stopping the rumination and sitting there and you know whatever it is yet you there meditation but that you can actually just change the way so many different genes are working many of those in the brain of course yeah in their long term consequences to meditation and there work suggesting yeah sex on telomere yes that show that that annotation or and Eliza Apple I think I met its meditators had longer telomeres than age master control so yeah which makes sense because stress does the opposite right stress accelerates telomere shortening so I mean that surprise you	Success
Parallels of long-term meditation and psilocybin use | Roland Griffiths	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS54HMaQSGg	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so will you compare what were you looking at in that study what was well the studying long-term meditators is something that my heart because I meditators now what define a long-term minute well these these are people by and large that have a daily meditation practice for very often decades and have done a number of prolonged silent meditation retreats okay okay so these are people who spend a lot of time passing hours in sales calm a lot of it is mindfulness we we we have over representation from Buddhist traditions and vaasna would be one of those traditions and so during that study people come into our session room we have them do series of meditations throughout the day and when they when they get psilocybin so we very interested in how the phenomenology of those experiences change we comparing it to placebo we pre and post neuroimaging to see looking for brain changes and preliminary we seeing day after changes which is exciting and gets to this whole issue of neuroplasticity and and we a condition in which we actually administer psilocybin to people in the scanner so we when people are on this case a pretty low double-time of psilocybin yeah so and our interest in meditation is that you know we think of meditation is kind of the tried-and-true path for exploration of the nature of mind I mean that what it is is that this is methodology that years to turn the attention inward and watch one become familiar with the way mind works how it through that process very often people hesitate say gain control but the in effect they can change the repertoire with which the the the brain is activated they can watch thoughts come up they can release thoughts in a way that someone who meditation is much less likely to be able to do so so it of mine and similarly I of psilocybin is also a convergent methodology for investigation of the nature of mind it will because there of the nature of consciousness that that it it wakes people up to the extent to which kind of enormity their normative cognitive processes or the the normative way they hold reality is just one way of holding reality and so there can be something shockingly interesting about that however psilocybin is not a substitution for meditation because it doesn to any stability of of the awareness state so we would say that meditation is kind of the tried-and-true way of stabilizing the nature of awareness and coming to understand mind and psilocybin might be the crash course and that you	Success
Effects of dose on psilocybin mystical experiences and Âbad tripsÂ | Roland Griffiths	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7ankPiNftY	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so it sounds like when then that both the context of we and also pits of potential genetic interactions people that are predisposed to other you know brain dysfunctional disorders those are the two major you know what seems to be at least what we know now things that predispose people having a negative effect how do you when you so how do you you said you spend eight hours where the person is that like part of the selection process or how do you figure out well let in terms of screening people into our protocol we do extensive medical screening and then history screening and so so people are screened out if they have any even second degree relative with history of psychotic disorder or bipolar disorder so we conservative in that regard but we concerned with that as a as a vulnerability in terms of whether people have difficult experiences we we can protect against that so even under our conditions where many people have these greatly valued experiences of transcendence some of those same people may have experiences that that would our classic bad trips that are experiences that are among the most challenging and difficult of their lives the difference in this context is that we can support people through those experiences and and sometimes those experiences can be very a very short duration sometimes they can open into experiences of great insight or transcendence and and for some people the very fact that they components of that difficult experience makes their overall experience more meaningful but we have about 30 percent of our volunteers who will describe it least for some duration of time experiences of significant fear or anxiety come up so we have not learned how to eliminate those we don know whether they should be eliminated because we don the processes that are underlying the nature of these experiences that seem to be so important and furthermore I can say that our ability to predict who is going to have a difficult experience or not is almost zero I mean so in spite of the fact we get to know these these volunteers really well and at this point we have treated over 260 people with psilocybin we have experience of over 570 sessions with psilocybin so we have a lot of experience but it if if we ask the clinicians that are closest to the volunteers to rate the probability of difficult experiences their ability to predict that is almost none at all so we don about dose does dose play a role Odo plays an important role we know these effects their dose our dose dependent all the effects including so like the mystical experiences yeah anyway so we dose is 30 milligrams per 70 kilograms which is a bodyweight high dose of yeah high dose of of psilocybin and the phenomenology of the of the types of things that as you might imagine dose related we gone down to doses of five milligrams and I suspect that their their threshold effects though lower than that and the probability of mystical type experiences and challenging experiences also increase as a function of dose what kind of interesting that the probability of the very difficult experiences increase pretty significantly between twenty and thirty milligrams per 70 kilogram so if we if we dose people at about 20 milligrams for 70 kilogram were much less likely to have the very challenging experiences and with the cancer study for instance the the dose that we used most often and that was 22 milligrams per 70 kilogram so we are holding it back from our full on dose yeah I would imagine that having a really stressful experience like being diagnosed with cancer but also the stress that you obviously that trying to treat but would also maybe shape the experience you in a way well in that you know that was one of our questions going into that study in spite of the fact that there was previous data suggesting efficacy I I was concerned frankly that this is a vulnerable population I mean they they existential question and I was concerned that perhaps some of these deep experiences of the existential emptiness and fullness might end up potentially traumatizing some at least subset of those people maybe they would come out worse for it and I was concerned about that happily the answer is that we have no indication that happened in the 51 volunteers we treated and a 29 that were treated at NYU we have no indication that people were harmed by these experiences but that was a concern initially and it led us to to want to give a somewhat lower dose and that dose as it turns out worked just fine you	Success
Progress of FDA approval of psilocybin, and associated risks and contraindications for use	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgXYpWYZ4lE	FoundMyFitness Clips 	for our mediate therapeutic target it cancer and it anxiety associated with cancer we the groups that I very early stages of communicating with FDA about undertaking a phase three clinical trial which would be the necessary next step and if efficacy were demonstrated then there for approve ability of psilocybin as a as a medication wow that going to be my next question well and were to be approve we we would see it approved under under very constrained conditions perhaps the drug would be held by a central pharmacy it would be dispensed to clinics that offer this kind of therapy with clinicians who know how to deliver this therapy because it is this interaction of context and pharmacology this is not just an effective of psilocybin and in fact there are risks associated with just taking psilocybin that we really shouldn some of the risks that resulted in the deep cultural misunderstanding of these compounds and ultimately the removal of them from from clinical research for decades but we just actually very recently completed and published a large survey study of people who this was about 2000 people and we asked them have you ever had a bad trip after taking psilocybin mushrooms and then and then we asked them to describe their very worst experience with psilocybin mushrooms so so we we don have any denominator to know what the frequency of this sort of thing is but the results of that are sobering so if you ask these people what the you know what were the consequences of their you know their worst experience we have about you know 10% who say that they may have put themselves or others at risk of physical harm during the experience and and and there people who say that they have enduring psychological problems for which they are seeking out and psychological or psychiatric help with a year after the experience so it suggests that there there can be immediate dangers and we know that to exposure to psilocybin people can most often that occurs in fear anxiety responses but under conditions where people take the compound and they they don don they then people can end up dying and so there there populations people who may already have pre-existing vulnerabilities to psychotic disorder or - they might have personality disorders or some other mood pre-existing disposition toward mood disorders that may make them unusually sensitive to these two potential negative effects of psilocybin so we we really need to footnote all all this work and make sure that the take-home message is great everybody should take psilocybin mushrooms know they to be some people who are going to truly be hurt and and we need to do everything we can to protect people particularly young and vulnerable you	Success
Reorganizational psychedelic experiences, neuroplasticity, and their role in treating addiction	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyFJ8TFRUn4	FoundMyFitness Clips 	when you keep saying these reorganizational experiences from in my you know limited neuroscience I keep what keeps coming to my mind is neuroplasticity and and the ability to you know change the connections in your brain which you know happen well as we age that becomes you know worse and worse we that something that psilocybin do we know if that part of the you know neuroplasticity is all effective I mean it has tasks right yeah I passed my definition so yeah they they changes you know how do you measure that can you measure a lot of people I probably I don where you know where to load a lot of the locusts if those changes are going to occur and so if you go into the phenomenology of it people describe this altered sense of self and this touchstone experience and they have now yeah seeing and experience the interconnectedness of all things and so they hold themselves differently in the world they end that in that and that affects their belief systems and that the way they describe it but that their description and so what we don know is you know surely there must there must be corresponding changes that are occurring and that changes right and this has to also relate to your some of your other research that you addiction like smoke smoking cessation right mm-hmm because that is I mean to be able to like change the way you see yourself and change your personality in a way I guess I don accurate but it something that commonly happens at least after I don 20s or something I don actually yeah well that that phenomena is that what we experiences there are enduring changes in the personality dimension of openness and and so that some kind of dispositional characteristic that would correlate with people if you ask them how they changed they free and so so there is a change in in what these dispositional characteristics and the personality theorists would tell you that doesn personality characteristics are locked in kind of from mid 20s and if anything openness decreases then across the lifetime and here you see an increase in openness so something interesting is that and it in in terms of kind of the radical reorganization that occurs there are these other potential therapeutic applications and so one of them is the addictions and and so we study and cigarette smokers 15 smokers we embedded the psilocybin manipulation in the context of a cognitive behavior therapy for smoking cessation and remarkably we had 80% abstinence rates at six months which in the smoking world is just completely unheard of completely the you know varenicline which is probably our best treatment for smoking you know 20 to 30 percent now that uncontrolled group for that trial so we we post we the National Institute on Drug Abuse who looking at brain centers responsible for addiction to and an abstinence from cigarette smoking so we were kind of probing into that but that the point here is that these kinds of reorganization experiences it may be possible to embed them within different treatment contexts for different disorders you know like the the psychosocial distress of cancer patients and in this case for addictions there alcoholism there University of Alabama on cocaine dependence and and so I think this is potentially promising but we don don my guess would be that there about the nature of these reorganizational experiences the opportunity for plasticity and change you know that can be embedded within intention and context that could have a variety of positive therapeutic applications right possibly and things like PTSD OCD I mean you know if he GSD OCD eating disorders other other types of it you	Success
ÂDefault mode networkÂ is suppressed by meditation practice | Roland Griffiths	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8hoXhNwccA	FoundMyFitness Clips 	there the nature of those experiences what what there the immediate effects of psilocybin certainly we know that psilocybin binds serotonin 2a we know you know different areas of brains that are activated and deactivated we know something about the default mode Network I wanted to ask you about that it and so work from the UK and and and in additional work now is showing that at least acutely psilocybin appears to decrease activity within the default mode Network and is that so from my understanding because I don about this and this is all from neuroimaging studies you about the default mode Network is that something that ruminating on something like when you thinking about something that you sort of you know rumination which is associated with depression ruminating on the future or the past or exactly that it right that that activity in the default mode network is actually increased in depression and and in here you know a couple of the hubs are prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate and and and the connectivity and activity in those regions are are decreased now the interesting thing about the default mode network is it is associated with rumination it sometimes thought to be responsible for what processing as you it ideas that relate to a sense of self you know and that is what was me yeah right yeah yeah but and so that and interestingly activity in the default mode network is decreased in long term meditate so oh that fits if you think about it with this whole story about you know goals of meditation being to bring you into the present moment to drop the ego you know you can surrender a sense of self if you will okay and so the curious thing now is that psilocybin looks very much like meditation in that regard so they deep decreases in the default mode Network and that kind of fits with this story we can we we can tell in terms of the phenomenology that one thing that people are encouraged to do when they have these experience is surrender a sense of egoic holding that is kind of get out of the way of the experience and just be present in the present moment that thing that I one of the qualities of that experience where you get out of past and future and you present and your present in a way that it untangles you from this hell sense of self and constraining but the yes of course they don of of of putting a framework around psychological processes you know but they fall short of kind of the empirical heart science that we would like to have so it dealing a lot in metaphor at this point in terms of descriptive framework for how these experiences might affect people you	Success
Therapeutic effects of psilocybin in treatment of anxiety and depression. | Roland Griffiths	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMVRc-RLpNg	FoundMyFitness Clips 	we can do reductionistic neuroscience whether we we can ask questions about pharmacology we can ask questions about biological and genetic dispositions or behavioral interactions or certain setting conditions that modulate those experiences and to bring this to your question we can look at therapeutic effects and so one of the first studies that we therapeutic effects is to look at cancer patients who are experiencing very significant anxiety or fear in face of a life-threatening cancer diagnosis and and it turns out that this kind of very disquieting existential anxiety and sometimes depression very often accompanies these life-threatening cancer diagnoses as you might expect that it would and our treatment options are quite limited so we do have our classic antidepressants and our anxiolytics and there are different kinds of psychotherapy approaches but for for many people these interventions are not very effective and and they can really experience a very degraded quality of life and a sense of hopelessness and depression that really diminishes their their their whole experience in the latter parts of their lives so it was this population that we were interested in in treating with psilocybin to see whether there would be therapeutic effects one of the reasons we chose that population is that there were studies back in the 50s and 60s that produced suggestive evidence that compounds from this category of the classic hallucinogens like LSD some other psilocybin analogs would might be effective in this regard but these trials were not conducted under the rigorous clinical standards that would be expected today and and just a footnote of course work with these classic loose engines really came to a standstill in the late 60s with the psychedelic movement and the in the cultural reactivity we had to that which made the which placed these drugs into schedule one they became very difficult to obtain there was no funding that was available and and the media surrounding the surgeon use of these compounds back in the 60s led people to conclude incorrectly as it turns out that the risks of exposure to these compounds were greater than any possible benefits but functionally what happened was there was a period of several decades where no clinical research was done with these compounds so people had made observations previously that there might be a signal here there had been one pilot study published a couple years ago with a low dose of psilocybin out of UCLA and then we undertook our study at Johns Hopkins a group at NYU ran a somewhat smaller study and we Co published just just as last week in fact our results and the results really were quite striking they confirmed everything we had seen in the healthy volunteers that is these very vulnerable cancer patients who had very significant anxiety or depression experienced these same types of experience is very often classified as this mystical type experiences but they were deeply moved by these experiences and interestingly these people experience very large and sustained decreases in anxiety and depression and and there was effects occurred really quite promptly after the administration of the drug and although the design of the study was such it was a crossover design so people were crossed over between essentially an inactive dose of psilocybin to an active dose or vice-versa so so the strongest conclusion we can make comparing our placebo condition in our active condition is this effect lasted out to five weeks but in fact we followed people out to six months and there was no evidence that there was any significant rate of relapse over that period of time so in other words most people who demonstrated a large therapeutic effect remained having low levels of anxiety or depression out to six months so so there there treatment after one treatment yeah that you	Success

Griffis he was he was mentioning again he he did say that this mystical experience seemed to be important for for the antidepressant effect and of course he doesn but parallel to that there are also some studies looking at part of the brain that what it was called default would yes the default mode Network and how that was like changed oh absolutely and of course rumination that part of depression huge huge part and it studies linking rumination particularly to inflammation oh really so inflammation probably that preferentially drives rumination we know from the interferon studies that one of the places that inflammatory molecules most change in the brain is the Reformation Center and the anterior dorsal anterior cingulate right so there story there now why you should ruminate one year that that I I don to why should information make you ruminate but it does and yes rumination is a big problem yeah and that also sort of leads to the this you know you talking about these transformative experiences which also you know are brought about by meditation and I know you to be at least Roland was talking about some overlap between O this something that this mystical experience that there like comment the comment is absolutely it $50,000 fancy machine right it machine it convinced it know it experience because no every study pretty much this looked at this shows that the more intensely you have one of these sort of mystical type experience tonight depending how you define mystical there the spiritual is almost a better word because people also have these very difficult personal experiences but today makes them feel like their life they see their life in a different way that produces a transformation they get you know that in realm of responsive just been repeatedly associated with a guide a depressant and anti-anxiety effects and not just that but also these agents seem to have a anti smoking effect you help people quit smoking you see the same thing that way so we think that exactly there the psychedelics other than the fact that they can take a wide wide range of people and and on cue and induce these sorts of experiences you know just like if you want to study inflammation it great to have interferon because I can just wait around until you get inflamed you know god forbid but I I give you an affair on shot and away you go right so in the same way I could wait around for you to have mystical experience and and there was a wonderful study down a number of years ago that I unfortunately wasn in my file I just read about it where they did this huge sort of you know an anima survey of Americans and I said crazy percent fifteen twenty percent of people said I experience it changed my life I just never talked about it I was at the kitchen sink you know and I boom the world looked like it was you know you know connected in ways I never meant you know so it happens right but it doesn happen predictably whereas you know I believe me if I you know if it wasn illegal and unethical I could give you a big ol dose of psilocybin right now put you on the couch over there and you know it profound mystery experience right you	Success
How the benefits of exercise can be blocked by NSAIDs and high-dose antioxidants | Charles Raison	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D4rCMlk9x4	FoundMyFitness Clips 	now there showing that if you look at the the beneficial effects of exercise on sort of muscle restructuring this is in humans if you exercise and take a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory that you get rid of all those good you see that I think I another study very similar to the anti-inflammatory they another study that showed taking high dose alpha tocopherol and no vitamin C so antioxidants also suppress the in the insulin sensitivity effects of exercise right possibly through because you not activating that well inflammatory well exactly yeah you know you you what you really would like to do is sometimes activate these compensatory systems right right so you know what you know so you know if you can activate your inflammation and in a way you know she think about exercise right so you know we were talking off-camera about I think we know I Mission Bay here and I increase in my inflammation well with these caveats that is a certain pattern but you get to get so many oh six is gonna go off but over time the net result is a reduction in chronic inflammation so it system a certain kind of way what I think is that yeah it you you know you kind of want the dial to be over here so you think this simple thing to do would be just to move the dial over here but that often weakened this is you right right exactly this idea doing this weakens the systems own sort of internal capacities what you get is a dependence on that external element to keep the system in that state right on the other hand although it seems paradoxical if you take it this way but not chronically but just and you pull the spring back and you let it go right it sort of drives the system into that other state you	Success
How changes in time are a stressor in bipolar disorder | Charles Raison	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnswLdfRvt4	FoundMyFitness Clips 	are you familiar with some of the the gene polymorphisms the snips in there one gene that I think it to yes that that is involved in circadian rhythm but also their susceptibility to bipolar disorder like when it this yes well especially bipolar disorder you know if depression if regular depression is sort of involved human response to the university of relationship bipolar disorder is response to the adversity of time well what you see with bipolar disorder is that of the many so folks with bipolar disorder are also they can be set off into either manias or depressions by stress alright but they fluctuations in circadian patterns right so the great way to induce a manic episode is to just keep people awake so there national institute mental health where they keep really very ill bipolar patients in in psychiatric wards for years and study every you know every episode and and always depressive and but especially manic episodes would be triggered by a night of sleep deprivation right and you see this clinically right so so time time it is time as the university because it it threatening homeostasis right so you know the things we Sun comes up the Sun Goes Down this happens that happens this happened and your body but now many times things move there off the rails and braking right and so bipolar folks are so profoundly vulnerable to disruptions in their circadian sleep-wake cycles in their activity cycles there was one of the originators of this called chrono therapy came out the University of Pittsburgh where they actually you know as a therapeutic thing for bipolar sort of part of it was education about you always go to sleep at the same time to get up at the same time you know you travel right just a beautiful study from Heathrow showing that you know that there people showing up at Heathrow with psychotic mania if they come from America and he throw them if they come from Asia to Heathrow and the reason is because it if you you Europe you oh so many manic patients I saw in my ears running at the emergency psychiatry UCLA many of them were activated by getting on a plane Wow I was normal until I got on a plane I got off the plane and the world looked different and then they patients would say oh yeah and first episodes were often induced I mean people really developed its lifelong psychotic sort of a response do you think those people that are having that are a little more sensitive to the like their circadian there they maybe have some snip and yeah this is probably the end password yeah and wow that kind of drivers or regulators of the circadian things is a predicted by polar sorters because you know it condition where time the changes of time that the the recurrent changes of time are just a big stressor for that disorder yeah problem probably lots of genes are not being regulated properly right that transcription factor regulating a whole host of changes and so their response to things are very different because they pathways that you act okay you know yeah where does you know what is if you don you know most of us are not most of us do not end up in the psych hospital because we missed a night of sleep yeah right yeah we end up in a psych hospital because the person we cared about dumped us or somebody died or we lost we were shamed or or you know it things went something teased it off it a different register of things that T it off which is so interesting it the main differences well not when I miss a night of sleep like if I traveling abroad I certainly feel strange when I land in Heathrow or any other airport in Europe or even Asia but I certainly don yeah I of weird right you did your laughs I caught yeah no yeah no I don have that yes you	Success

And it sleep, showing healthier levels, longer telomeres. But of course, these are correlational. So what we really want are these intervention\\nstudies in humans. How much can we really move these things around? Is it just that they You health behaviors. So we really need to experiment and move these\\nthings. So one study that I believe you just read\\nmaybe just came out was a study by Eli Puterman, who took sedentary high-stress caregivers. So men and women caring for a partner with\\ndementia and he had them exercise for six months. At the end of six months, their stress was\\nlower, their telomeres were longer compared to the control group. And so that our circulating immune cell telomere length. Exactly how that happened, we don Is it per cell? Is it a refreshing of naive cells in the immune\\nsystem? It We don good thing. So another study, Ashley Mason just published\\nthis, we did a weight loss trial. And we found that, first of all, no one really\\nkeeps off a lot of weight a year or two later, right? The handful of people who kept off 10% of\\ntheir weight a year later had telomere lengthening. So that was pretty exciting. And then we had the same thing for the people\\nwho kept at least 5% off, it was just less dramatic. So a proof of concept study, if you change\\nyour set point of weight, that very good for a lot of your metabolic health\\nbut including your telomere length. So that was pretty exciting because there telomere length. So what? Can we change that? Can we move that? What is it? Is it insulin sensitivity? Is it really at a paucity? I personally think forget about weight, don Just look at your metabolic health, your levels\\nof glucose and insulin.	Success
Sugar-sweetened beverages associated with older biological age | Elissa Epel	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLl83J7WmwM	FoundMyFitness Clips 	- [Rhonda]: Back to the sugar-sweetened beverages\\nyou mentioned because I did read that study, your study that was on the sugar-sweetened\\nbeverages and how that was associated with accelerated telomere shortening by something\\nlike close to five years or something. I think if I remember correctly it was something\\nlike that. Where people that were drinking, you know,\\na lot of these sodas and sugar-sweetened beverages had their biological age as marked by a telomere\\nlength looked older than their actual chronological age. And so that was quite disturbing. - [Elissa]: Right. You know, that sugared beverage finding has\\nbeen replicated many times by now. And it It does cause, you know, a big metabolic disturbance\\nimmediately. And so if you of aging biomarkers to have them be accelerated. And so, you know, it which...I So, you know, we can all do our best to not\\nhave it. But what So we just completed a study at our university\\nwhere we just... this university banned all sugar beverages. It I mean, it - [Rhonda]: That - [Elissa]: Yeah, it - [Rhonda]: Go UCSF. - [Elissa]: I mean, it and that reduced drinking dramatically, and it reduced\\nwaist size just getting rid of it at work. People could still have it at home, they can\\nstill bring it to work. So those are kind of things... - [Rhonda]: Limiting the access. - [Elissa]: We have to think about. Like you know, your child children who are still developing habits surrounded\\nby the healthy choices. - [Rhonda]: Right. I remember reading... and this was an animal\\nstudy where should these sugar-sweetened beverages activated dopamine pathways and like a reward\\npathway in the brain. Similar to like some very bad recreational\\ndrugs. I mean, not the same...it wasn I mean these things. And I mean, you know, that is definitely I\\nwould say pretty scary that there aspect to the sugar as well. - [Elissa]: Well, I mean, I think that cannot\\nbe understated about why that is an epidemic that we cannot control yet. So in health span, we we have medications and diagnostics. And so heart disease, stroke, like people\\nare dying less from those, we well at keeping people alive and reducing\\nthose diseases. But at the same time, while those incidents\\nand deaths are going down, the obesity incidence is going up. We cannot control it, we don - [Rhonda]: And I think you just brought up\\na really good point. I mean, if medication is doing one thing where\\nit of years of your life because you you diet or a variety of other types of psychological\\nstress or a combination of them lack asleep. So it is really important to address, you\\nknow, the problem, what you know, be at a higher risk for type two\\ndiabetes or cardiovascular disease, or stroke, and address that problem. Because where a medication may help give you\\na couple more years, the quality isn be improved ... - [Elissa]: That - [Rhonda]: ...if you don - [Elissa]: That And then if you food diet, that medication is not going to\\noutweigh those big lifestyle effects. So like, let Lots of people take Metformin for anti-aging,\\nit in sight that is probably slowing aging in\\nsome ways. But if you with diabetes are doing because they have...you\\nknow, their brain is wired that way right now with the hedonic addiction, that Metformin\\nis doing very, very little. And so it some breakthroughs to slow aging. But we cannot do it in this context of a toxic\\nlifestyle.	Success

How different types of stress affect telomere length and aging | Elissa Epel	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcmzwo5i3UE	FoundMyFitness Clips 	getting to the psychological stress part you have looked a lot at various types of psychological stressors and those seem to be as you mentioned bio marked by a shorter telomere but you looked at a variety of other types of stress which seems to be positive more healthy and that seems to sort of buffer some of those negative effects to some degree yeah so just to be really simplistic when we think about stress I know it has a bad rap but that it dysregulated health and depression and that means something really big not necessarily what we from that neurotic feeling of stress and time pressure and but rather being having traumatic things happen to you particularly as a child sets you up to feel threat response is much more in your brain in your body so there kind of programming that happens it in childhood and then there chronic stresses that we have as adults which are things like caregiving or job stress or domestic violence and relationships so things that go on for years and years so those are the types of things when we do see telomere shortening and inflammation and the other all the rest like work stress is not related to healing or shorten so really burnout is when you really you know it you demoralisation from it but not the typical adrenaline type stress that we deal with a lot I mean it us but I to show up as much or more inconsistently you know what about sauna rumination when you thinking about something yeah that I would say that rumination is part of chronic stress that is when we things happen and we carry it with us moment to moment day to day where can we keep ourselves in a stress day so that one of our targets in our interventions we really like to look at rumination that because it really targets you can you know you can ruminating at the same time so you think that because I you know oftentimes you know with with something high stress if I working on a project definitely work-related yeah I do tend to ruminate yeah but I mean it on it for years so that you think there is a difference between that sort of short-term rumination where you distracted by whatever projects you have to go and your your mind you present as much yeah versus like a very traumatic type of stress that know yeah financial stress yeah anything I think that the it study the big events and the chronic events to see that showing up in our data on accelerated aging what you talking about is much harder to measure and study but I absolutely do think it matters and we are looking at daily stress in our current studies and seeing that people who have this profile of more elevated we call it perseverate of prep for several cognition or thought processes they have accelerated biomarkers of aging telomere length and inflammation what is it what is that so you wake up and you about the day feeling like you can control it feeling anxious so there wake-up response because what what is waking up it it tendencies to maybe jump ahead already in the future right so worrying planning anticipating we find that our caregivers do that a lot more they wake up they are ready and a stress state their cortisol is higher so those nerves are there any other type of race and if they and they feel positive they forward to the day they feel joy they look better in their telomerase enzyme and their cortisol so waking up states are really important and so like a pessimistic view versus optimistic view is that so that and that absolutely related and that the bigger you know personality thing you you take with you and you see the world in that way so if you pessimism you just expect bad things to happen we pessimism is related shorter telomeres we have that scale on our website because I think it important for people to like know their style account instantly change your style but if you know it you can be aware of it you can laugh at it it just going to diffuse its or more like up that my pessimistic thought that I actually find that a good workout a very good like you know if I do a really hard intense run or sprint or ya know a high-intensity bicycling spin class or something at that if I have a you know like a sort of a pessimistic view with something yeah absolutely helps alleviate that yes absolutely your end of one has also been shown up in you know studies of exercise and studies by Eli Putterman showing that exercise actually does reduce ruminant ruminative processes you	Success
Telomerase repairs telomeres and prevents senescence, but is hijacked by 80 to 90% of cancers	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnPzCc6AmUg	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so the telomerase enzyme is a very interesting enzyme that is intracellular that is has the ability to actually rebuild telomeres by adding back base pairs so it transcriptase and this was discovered by Liz Blackburn and Carol Greider and colleagues you know over 25 years ago and they were showing how if you knock it down the cells cannot divide anymore and if you upregulated the cells become immortal so it is a an important regulator of how long a cell can divide it determinants of telomere length because if your telomere is shortened and you have a lot of telomerase you can repair them you maybe even can lengthen them and in telomerase if I remember correctly it cells than in somatic cells right yeah so at UCSF we my colleagues Yulin actually has an assay that sensitive and can measure the level of telomerase in our normal blood cells they but you can still measure the level and that is associated with health with metabolic health with socio-economic circumstances so interesting so you mentioned this sort of potentially double-edged sword with in terms of that you know the telomeres getting critically short and telomerase activity going down and that leading to cellular senescence we on the podcast we yes but or even apoptosis or you said they can become immortal when telomerase becomes overactive and then you know so basically it rebuilding the telomeres and an immortality in some cases with the overactive telomerase associated with certain types of cancer so what do you what would you say like you know measuring you just talking about measuring telomerase activity in white blood cells and that for you know the the aging probably how well a person cells are aging is that is there something like is there like a threshold for when it becomes too active and it like a cancer cell like can you detect that the difference like is when it research we always make sure we measuring any cancer cells otherwise I mean they telomerase so it would mess up our measures yeah so it becomes in cancer cells kind of what I was asking like yeah becomes like out of the physiological normal range okay yeah so it is true that when you that tumors develop a mechanism so that the telomerase is so high and they kind of immortalize themselves in that way so the tumors can be really short and maybe that the first place but the tuam race is very protective so it gets very high yes so you know this is a telomeric aging is complex it in general longer is better and long telomeres genetically or measured in the blood predict less heart disease unless metabolic disease but actually longer telomeres especially by when you measure the genetic index but sometimes also when you measure in the blood long tumors also predict greater risk of certain cancers like glioma and melanoma and several others so it is you know it to be long but not extremely long if you want to kind of have the best ratio of low risk for degenerative diseases like dementia and heart disease and low risk for cancer you	Success

What makes women live longer? | Elissa Epel	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge_Wqav-rtU	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so Rhonda can I ask you something you are such a broad expert on Aging you interviewed you know so many of the experts in the world on this how much does sex differences come up and I asked partly because we meeting here on women just you know recently been scouring the human literature for trying to understand hormones and aging sex hormones and what have you learned i it almost never comes up and it certainly a question that has remained unanswered in my mind for several years and you know over the years I there I variety of hypotheses you know ranging from immune system differences to different differential effects of testosterone on a variety of different tissues yeah I mean system but I don it it really you know you started out this this podcast you mentioned the average lifespan United States for men was about 78 something and women was about 83 and said so and and I did want to act stop and ask you right there yeah why yeah why is that yeah so so I recently tried to read everything I could about this to understand it and so this sex gap in longevity is robust across cultures across countries I mean this is this is a fundamental thing about human biology species women live longer why I kind of obvious of like well there x protective about that backup copies there certain ways to the heart and then there behavior sex differences where men are more risky they they do more alcohol and abuse and risky things that lead to death so there just like tip of the iceberg like the truth is we don those differences so here women have many cases when we look at the cells of women and men where their aging biology is more robust and more n slower example women have much longer telomeres like hundreds of base pairs longer and that starts at birth and that related to sex hormones so twins where there different telomere lengths so there probably a maximization in the womb so the bottom line is this estrogen when we look at these experimental models and in vitro and and mice estrogen is protective and anti aging in a sense in that it up regulates telomerase it improves mitochondrial health those energy stores in our cells those batteries are more robust they create more ATP they leak less oxidative stress so if you like cause menopause in a rat you dysregulation in the brain and cognitive problems and then if you replace estrogen you fix it so all this beautiful models suggesting estrogen is super anti aging but the idea of like okay do we have a new drug and it estrogen and we longer absolutely not the complexity of hormones in general the different types of different receptors hormone therapy it aging and hormones in humans yeah do you are there any people that are really specializing in that field that you know about so there are some people with very you know important programs of research they we know this we know that if you have a longer reproductive lifespan meaning your menopause is a lot later you likely have longer telomeres if you give birth later like in your 30s and so your twenties I have longer telomeres those are also related to longevity to having the longer reproductive lifespan so there are clues like this is really important we should understand these sex differences they obviously related to hormones but we really don act on them we don didn his interior lengths between men and women were present at birth or male and female yeah so I mean that this literature people have discovered that and it become somewhat of a consistent finding in recent years of course there differences with ethnicity and race we also know that telomere length at birth is impacted by the moms health her mental health or nutrition or physical health so that like fabulous important knowledge for us to act on you	Success
Is the relationship between exercise and telomere length dose-dependent? | Elissa Epel	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09XjOmngNWw	FoundMyFitness Clips 	is there a research that indicates that there is a dose-dependent effect on exercise intensity and telomere length though yes there is but the but it linear so when you get up to extreme sports and marathon runners yeah they a little bit longer in their telomeres but not much longer than someone who like running three times a week so so we don things they also have some costs and we don terms of some of the aging biomarkers that we you	Success
Obesity affects genes in sperm DNA involved in metabolism and brain | Elissa Epel	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joWvOQKkorQ	FoundMyFitness Clips 	what was looked at was sperm DNA in men that were obese mm-hmm and men that were non obese Oh healthy healthy men and there was a variety like over 500 genes were changed in terms of like how their expression women right so their epigenetics were changed and a lot of these genes had to do with metabolism they had to do with a cognitive function men these men underwent bariatric surgery so these were obese morbidly obese men they underwent bariatric surgery and their sperm DNA was measured pretty close after and then like a year later and the epigenetics switched back to closer to what the you know lean men looked like so it was really amazing a very interesting kind of pilot study indicating there definitely seems to be a causal like you know obesity is changing the you know a lot of you know the way these genes are in sperm DNA you know which is what you there you you know male mice that are obese have you know offspring like you know female offspring that are you know get typed up one diabetes because they get like some autoimmune thing or you know so there course you can want to translate so much of that so I felt like that human study was really you know a good pilot study to really kind of show look this is happening any humans you know and certainly make people think men aren off the hook either yeah I know and that think that I aware of the fact that their lifestyle actually does matter right they becoming more important than we think right you	Success
Compressing the morbidity window - maximum longevity vs. healthspan | Elissa Epel	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeIxeP3L4tY	FoundMyFitness Clips 	we don get disease we know that aging is one of the main causes of all later diseases except for the genetic diseases so it sounds like you about differences between someone lifespan how long they live and their health ban okay so I that up because it is a hugely important shift for us to rather than focus on longevity and maximal longevity to focus on years of healthy living the health span and so what longevity is it dramatically it four men it expectancies around 78 years in the United States for women it years and that is a dramatic shift from even a hundred years ago so we are doing great in terms of longevity overall but we actual healthy years of living because the longer we well first of all no one wants to live long with disease and suffering it anyway that would be people who have you know taking care of older relatives know that you don you longer we live the more likely we are to get dementia and disability and need to you know live in institutions etc so that living long so what we really want to focusing on is how can we live well with optimal slow aging for as long as we can and then die pretty quickly before we like suffering with dementia right so delaying age-related disease delaying cardiovascular disease delaying no general disease as you mentioned Lane cancer right like having all those things where you the quality of quality of life as opposed to just sort of right you know increasing the how long you live but just living kind of yeah degenerative kind of yeah and it whole formula so it like the levers that control aging are the things that we know about but we but we easily forget so we often hear you know about the lifestyle things so activity nutrition stress so those are really important to manage well and they add up over time so like a healthy lifestyle not extreme but just healthy is in midlife predicts longer telomeres predicts longevity decades later you	Success
Genetics and microbiome affect individualized responses to a variety of foods | Elissa Epel	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssZbp6VveYs	FoundMyFitness Clips 	there is definitely a very personalized response to a variety different foods there was a study the the Weitzman Institute I forgot his name both senior author on it but this was published a couple years ago and Cell Metabolism where he took 800 people and he put a continuous glucose monitor on them and then he gave them there was a variety of foods that these people were given so they they Nanna fat fat foods that were high in fat and then a variety of different genetic variations were looked at so they looked at a variety of single nucleotide polymorphisms also microbiome data and what they found looking at people glucose response was that people had vastly different blood glucose responses according to their genetics and microbiomes so so some people most people had a higher elevated blood glucose level when you simple ones simple sugars of course that seems very obvious right but there was a subset of people that had elevated blood glucose levels too fat and that seemed to correlate with various you know single nucleus hypothesis a company to write they did start some some company yeah I believe I remember what their company what yeah what I it sophisticated models out there for this personal monitoring but it was developed on Israeli so it might be really specific to them right yeah and the microbiome also seemed to play a role and the one thing that was consistent for the blood glucose response was fiber the more fiber the lower the glucose response because it slows the metabolism and everything you bolus like you mentioned earlier in the podcast these sugar sweetened beverages everything hits all at once I mean it like you know you of glucose and that affects the gut and you release inflammatory things like right you know alright right saccharide and so with the you know we about fiber we know how important that is and the biggest thing we have going against us in terms of what you know the public is eating is that that goes against the reward response right so all the quicker the brain can get the hit of sugar the faster it pleasurable and addictive you	Success
Telomeres explained: role in genomic stability, stem cells, replicative senescence | Elissa Epel	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvSyWB2sJxY	FoundMyFitness Clips 	you mentioned telomeres a few times so for people listening or viewing that aren biology maybe you can give a quick just you know background on what tumors are and why they are involved in the aging process biomarkers for aging who so people like to think of them as like the Aglets of the tips of shoelaces those plastic caps to keep shoelaces from fraying so when you think of our linear chromosomes they the ends with this roundup strings of DNA repeating DNA called telomeres and it damage so they way they are sensing chemical signals of stress in the cell and so if there becomes a toxic situation and they think the cell is in danger they are going to well that shell that cell can shut down to protect the body but also the telomeres get worn down very quickly when there stress biology and aging biology are actually really tied up intimately they take the hit so they protect your DNA from potentially acquiring a mutation that could lead to something like cancer yes so they sort of take the hit for the for the cell right right and your experience how much would you say that telomere length so you know the telomeres get shorter with time and and shorter tailor measures are supposed to be in a correspond to to aging how much would you say that t1 or length regulates the aging process like actually plays an active role versus just is a biomarker or something that just bio marking the that question so telomeres are one specific pathway of Halla cell ages and how our tissue ages and the pathway is this it called replicative senescence and it basically how long can that cell continue to divide and divide and replenish into new fresh young cells so the telomeres when they get too short prevent that particular cell whether it in her hippocampus or the lining of our cardiovascular system we need those cells to replenish throughout the decades when the telomere gets too short that cell stops dividing and so it basically a little window into how long can these cells continue dividing if the tumors are long they have a long potential for replenishing tissue so it sounds like the telomeres are much more important in stem cell populations populations that are really responsible for replenishing a variety of self x-rays yes absolutely and so there you know would you say that the there a difference between how telomeres shorten or what the attrition rate of tumors and stem cells are versus other cell types yes yes yes so if we could measure stem cells more easily we would we would realize that partly what we in any tissue is the health and longevity and telomere length of the stem cell so the stem cells lead to progenitor cells and then there all the offspring and so when we look at blood we in the the different circulating cells that roughly reflect the health of the stem cell and and there different so you the damage that that happens with age and how that can accelerate telomere shortening because they sort of take the hit they there telomeres right right and you talked a little bit about that answer but it not active in every cell right so the telomerase enzyme is a very interesting enzyme that is intracellular that is has the ability to actually rebuild telomeres by adding back base pairs so it this was discovered by Liz Blackburn and Carol Greider and colleagues you know over 25 years ago and they were showing how if you knock it down the cells cannot divide anymore and if you upregulated the cells become immortal so it is a an important regulator of how long a cell can divide its determining it of the major determinants of telomere length because if your telomeres shorten and you have a lot of telomerase you can repair them you maybe even can lengthen them and in telomerase if I remember correctly it cells than in somatic cells but right yeah so at UCSF we my colleague zulan actually has an assay that sensitive and can measure the level of telomerase in our normal blood cells they but you can still measure the level and that is associated with health with metabolic health with socio-economic circumstances you	Success
How poor diet, environmental stress and chemical exposure affect telomeres | Elissa Epel	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CF4i-kIqKZw	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so different types of environmental things that can affect aging that lot of focus of your research has to do with various types of stress yeah whether it psychologically related stress right so one way to think about all of those environmental things is to think about the exposome all the factors that affect us that are outside of our skin and so that includes a port I factors that are part of our exposome a poor neighborhood that diet junk food or processed food diet being exposed to a lot of psychological stress at work or domestic violence so these types of things that are outside of us are also related to shorter term there and now there chemical exposure so this is very very disturbing because we these chemicals like BPA and roundup and these a lot of these chemicals in plastics etc are mimicking estrogen they of cancer or other diseases like diabetes metabolic disease and we can see when we look at these aging biomarkers we can see they them inflammation and telomere shortening so heavy metals cadmium lead those are directly in a dose-response way related to our telomere shortness yeah I think I actually read a scammed up recent publication of yours with the cadmium oh yes the meds yeah yeah I mean well chuckling yeah rice I mean that stuff is oh yeah arsenic arsenic right oh it exposed to so many chemicals and even small particles in our air air pollution and all of these are impacting our aging biology in ways we don telomeres are an easy marker that we can measure and index what is the effect of these chemical exposures and the National Institute of Environmental Health has become very interested in using telomeres as an index of exposures so the you know in terms of your question of what in our environment is affecting us more than we know but but but so far we that lead to psychological stress like unsafe neighborhood of course traumatic experiences leave an imprint on telomeres particularly when they youth in early in life and then the the nutrition data is I would say really not surprising and pretty consistent which is whole foods healthy diet are related to longer telomeres and then you have the kind of foods that create this oxidative stress inflammatory milia and those are related shorter tumors so what do i mean by like the pro-inflammatory foods so red meat particularly process me sugar drinks particularly sugared soda high sugar foods so those are those are pretty much the culprits that stand out mostly we know we understand about food patterns but there are some foods that pop out caffeine is sorry caffeinated coffee is associated with longer telomeres yeah and it was quite a bit of coffee right yeah we just enjoyed it Biggs yeah you	Success

Telomeres: controlling aging or just a biomarker? | Elissa Epel	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQi3Sc3veeM	FoundMyFitness Clips 	- [Rhonda]: In your experience, how much would\\nyou say that telomere length...so, you know, the telomeres get shorter with time and shorter\\ntelomeres are supposed to correspond to aging. How much would you say that telomere length\\nregulates the aging process, like actually plays an active role, versus just is a biomarker,\\nsomething that is just biomarking the aging process? - [Elissa]: That So telomeres are one specific pathway of how\\na cell ages, and how our tissue ages. And the pathway is this, it that cell continue to divide, and divide,\\nand replenish into new fresh young cells. So the telomeres, when they get too short,\\nprevent that particular cell, whether it an immune cell or a neuron in our hippocampus\\nor the lining of our cardiovascular system, we need those cells to replenish throughout\\nthe decades. When it to the telomeres gets too short that\\ncell stops dividing. And so it If the telomeres are long, they have a long\\npotential for replenishing tissue. - [Rhonda]: So it sounds like the telomeres\\nare much more important in stem cell populations, populations that are really responsible for\\nreplenishing a variety of cell type including tissue. - [Elissa]: Right, absolutely. - [Rhonda]: You know, would you say that there or, you know, what the attrition rate of telomeres\\nand stem cells are versus other cell types that are non-stem cells? - [Elissa]: Yes. So if we could measure stem cells more easily,\\nwe would realize that partly what we in any tissue is the health and longevity\\nin telomere length of the stem cell. So the stem cells lead to progenitor cells. And then there And so when we look at blood, we cells that roughly reflect the health of the\\nstem cell. - [Rhonda]: And there with age and how that can accelerate telomere\\nshortening because they sort of take the hit, they There - [Elissa]: Right. - [Rhonda]: Talk a little bit about that enzyme,\\nbut it - [Elissa]: Right. So the telomerase enzyme is a very interesting\\nenzyme that is intracellular, that it has the ability to actually rebuild telomeres\\nby adding back base pairs. So it And this was discovered by Liz Blackburn and\\nCarol Greider and colleagues, you know, over 25 years ago. And they were showing how if you knock it\\ndown, the cells cannot divide anymore. And if you upregulate it, the cells become\\nimmortal. So it is an important regulator of how long\\na cell can divide. It and you have a lot of telomerase, you can\\nrepair them, you may be even can lengthen them. - [Rhonda]: And telomerase, if I remember\\ncorrectly, it than in somatic cells, for the most part? - [Elissa]: Yeah, so at UCSF, my colleagues,\\nJue Lin actually has an assay. It They And that is associated with health, with metabolic\\nhealth, with social economic circumstances. - [Rhonda]: Interesting. So you mentioned this sort of potentially\\ndouble-edged sword in terms of the, you know, the telomeres getting critically short and\\ntelomerase activity going down and that leading to cellular senescence. We apoptosis, or you said they can become immortal\\nwhen telomerase becomes overactive. So basically, it with overactive telomerase is associated with\\ncertain types of cancer. So what would you say like, you know, measuring...you\\njust talking about measuring telomerase activity in white blood cells and that aging or how well the cells are aging. Is there like a threshold for when it becomes\\ntoo active and it Like can you detect the difference like when\\nit - [Elissa]: So in our research, we always\\nmake... we otherwise... I mean, they - [Rhonda]: 10 fold. - [Elissa]: So it would mess up our measures,\\nyeah. So it becomes in cancer cells... - [Rhonda]: It Like, what degree... - [Elissa]: It becomes like out of the physiological\\nnormal range. So it is true that tumors develop a mechanism\\nso that the telomerase is so high, and they kind of immortalize themselves in that way. So the telomeres can be really short, and\\nmaybe that first place. But the telomerase is very protective, so\\nit gets very high. Yes, so, you know, this is a... telomere aging\\nis complex, it In general, longer is better, and long telomeres,\\ngenetically, or measured in the blood, predict less heart disease, less metabolic disease. But actually, longer telomeres, especially\\nwhen you measure the genetic index but sometimes also when you measure in the blood, long telomeres\\nalso predict greater risk of certain cancers. like glioma, melanoma, and several others. So you know, it You want to be long but not as extremely long\\nif you want to kind of have the best ratio of low risk for degenerative diseases like\\ndementia and heart disease, and low risk for cancer. - [Rhonda]: Definitely the complexities of\\ntelomere length always sort of fascinated me, particularly because rodents which don are so long. - [Elissa]: Yes. Right. - [Rhonda]: So I never quite understood that,\\nyou know, what - [Elissa]: They telomeres, unless you - [Rhonda]: Exactly. And there are some human diseases where telomeres\\nare short and that does have a progeria type of effect, like Werner. - [Elissa]: Right. So that So in these certain handful of genetic disorders,\\nwhere people might have half a dose for telomerase, so their telomeres shorten quickly, they develop\\ndiseases that are... You know, the diseases of bone marrow, they\\ndon you know, lung diseases. And so what is interesting about that is we\\nknow in those cases that it and the short telomeres that are causing this\\nearly aging. And they can transmit, you know, the mutated\\ngene to offspring and they get the aging syndrome. They also can transmit just the short telomeres\\nepigenetically, like in a direct epigenetic way... - [Rhonda]: That - [Elissa]: To the offspring. So the offspring may, thank goodness, not\\nget the mutated gene but they still get short telomeres. And they might have a mild aging syndrome\\nfrom that. So that in us, too. We might be epigenetically transmitting short\\ntelomeres directly to our offspring, whether we have a gene for that or not, just based\\non what our telomeres are. - [Rhonda]: So let So we just talk about genetics things, you\\nknow, various environmental stressors, good or bad. - [Elissa]: One last point about genetics. So you were you earlier asked, like, is this\\na marker of aging or is it a mechanism? So it is probably both. And the way we know that it I mean, partly the example to some of these\\ngenetic disorders, but even more so, now we know that if you have a genetic propensity\\nfor long telomeres, it directly predicts less heart disease and dementia. So that was those kind of Mendelian randomization\\nstudies are one of the best ways that we can say there - [Rhonda]: Right yeah, I didn it. That is very interesting. So cardiovascular disease and dementia are\\ntwo one effective. - [Elissa]: Right. And then as I said the higher cancer risk\\nfor some of these.	Success
How telomere length varies at birth and may impact longevity and healthspan | Elissa Epel	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC21nnH73vI	FoundMyFitness Clips 	sperm are unlike the other types of cells where the longer they are around and replicate the shorter the tumors form opposite so older fathers have sperm with longer telomeres and there is an effect in the offspring so when we do studies when we have the data to know how old was your father when you were born that shapes telomere lengths and that effect and the Oscar means that short longer yeah so longer and so sperm is a telomere length is longer and that can affect the offspring telomere length to be longer are there studies that have looked at whether or not having a longer telomere length to start predicts you know healthy aging okay so that is I believe right I think many of us in this field believe that that is probably one of the biggest stories out there which is tumor length at birth that initial setting which we know is partly genetic but partly prenatal environment and you know health of mom and dad and their sperm their gammy their germline you know epigenetics so that is one of the biggest determinants of their tale more length in late life we all you know we can change it a little bit but you know what you start with is a big factor so no one has followed people to say like is it true that what you then predicts you know how soon you get sick and when you die we don we think it probably is pretty big so you guys gonna look at that yeah yeah no one should I guess it lifespan but like you said you know look does it predict cardiovascular disease is it well let me tell you how important it is National Institute of Aging which must do Studies old people they have started to fund they started to say ok midlife determines older health so now they fund studies of midlife and they even funded us and pal and our colleagues to look at pregnancy now to see telomere length how its transmitted and affected at Birth from social and economic health just socio-economic disparities race at sex stress how all of those shaped him alike at birth because they believe it is going to create a healthy trajectory of aging or not and so that now you	Success
Shorter telomeres can be transmitted epigenetically to offspring | Elissa Epel	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1j5i5mAJQk	FoundMyFitness Clips 	and there are some human diseases where telomeres are short yeah and that does not have a progeria type of effect correct like right so that interesting so in these certain handful genetic disorders where people might have half the dose for telomerase so their telomeres shorten quickly they develop diseases that are you can you know diseases of bone marrow they don have enough white blood cells or these you know lung diseases and so what is interesting about that is we know in those cases that it the short telomeres that are causing this early aging and they can the they can transmit the the eight you know the mutated gene to offspring and they get the aging syndrome but they also can transmit just the short telomeres epigenetically like in a directive genetically Hutson to offspring so the offspring may thank goodness not yet the mutated gene but they still get short telomeres and they might have an a mild aging syndrome from that so that something new that we know from these genetic disorders that might happen in us too we might be epigenetically transmitting short telomeres directly to our offspring whether we have a gene for that or not just based on what our telomeres are you	Success
Sauna decreases blood pressure (strong impact) | Jari Laukkanen	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljzZW-UmLKs	FoundMyFitness Clips 	you know I how the sauna effects and different vascular functions but you cardiologist so do you have some sort of you speculate on some of the mechanisms by which using the sauna can improve cardiovascular health yeah yeah we have we have been studying also these mechanisms which can be explained to our findings and one of the most important is to blood pressure because I only used long-term sauna use can decrease blood vessel level actually we have studied in the same population and found that there there is a reduction of incident hypertension among those who are using more sauna compared to those who have a only let say one session per week and so blood pressure is one of the most important factor which can explain into the findings and in do you know why fauna lowers blood pressure do you there there may be many many reasons we know that it can balance autonomic nervous system as well and also it can improve the vessel function in the folio vessels yeah and elephant ourselves and another thing is that sound may have some effect on arterial stiffness and compliance of arteries can improve after a long term sound use you	Success
From hot to cold: benefits and risks associated with cold water immersion after sauna use	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwadE1I6RdQ	FoundMyFitness Clips 	having been in Finland now for a few days and having the privilege of going to the Finnish sauna society and also hanging out with some some other friends here in Finland I experience the sauna culture the traditional sauna smoke saunas and also the other you know dry saunas and but what I also noticed is that almost a hundred percent of the Finnish people that I that that use the sauna after the sauna like to go run into a jump into a cold lake or the Baltic or something cold very very cold yeah and they do this you know several times I mean this is it seems to be a very normal part of Finnish sauna culture yeah is that accurate you would say yeah yeah many people are using I know it so I have a question on whether you know what what is the safety you know is there any safety issues cuz I couple of case reports where because you dilations occurring and then you going into cold where Raisa constrictions occurring norepinephrine is being released and we constriction it been a couple of documented cases of like corn coronary artery spasm I think it think there from hot to cold in terms of people with maybe a pre-existing heart disease or something yeah among those patient who have coronary heart disease and especially if it condition then you have to be very careful you cannot do that because there is there can be a spasm in coronary arteries and it can be harmful yeah but for the most people part of the population it seems to be pretty safe I mean I really good I mean you feel amazing after doing a hot and cold also interested in if it blunts any of the the positive effects but what interesting is I activates heat shock proteins because no who heat shock proteins are part of the stress response you know it it familiar with hormesis it little bit of good stress where it too much stress but it to activate all these genetic pathways that help you deal with stress well heat shock proteins are one of those genetic pathways and so cold is also a little bit of a Matic stress like and exercise activates heat shock proteins as well and then robustly activates them very robustly so the cold truck it good to know that both the hot and the cold are activating some of the same good genetic pathways so maybe you not negating all the good stuff you just did with the sauna right maybe there synergy we would be really happy to investigate those possible mechanisms between sound and memory because we have been thinking through you know more more like improve cardiovascular system and circulation on these if they have an effect on the memory disease because some cardiovascular diseases and memories are sharing the bit similar risk factors and yeah yeah yeah what flow is absolutely linked to dementia so it mechanisms yeah man it we gotta get the word out there you know more research more people using the sauna I think I think that that there are there are nowadays there are so many studies showing to positive effects of physical exercise on these outcomes and and vessel function zone but there are quite limited Tate on sonny similar outcomes so there are space to do these you know and explore a new territory yeah no one know and it that someone is you know so please keep up the good work yeah I mean the best case of course we can combine these positive effects in like exactly exercise and sound are you going to look at that as well are you going to see if we tried to do something yeah what is also important for for pop the curve of health level but also we have to emphasize that there are many other factors in addition to exercise and so on there are other also of course we have to take care of other respects like blood pressure lipids smoking obesity in addition to that yeah you	Success
Can sauna use improve your mood?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePx2S6NSnrg	FoundMyFitness Clips 	something else that I find very interesting is the the effect on mood actually it the song in the first place so when I was in graduate school I was very stressed out you know exams and failed experiments and lots of pressure so I was using the sauna and it noticeably improved my mood so and helped me deal with stress it helped me deal with the anxiety I was experiencing and and there speculative reasons I think that possible but one is related to cardiorespiratory fitness so there has actually been studies one very recently done published in a very large sample of people I believe it was like a million people looking at cardiorespiratory fitness and depression and the study found that people with poor cardiorespiratory fitness had a 75% increased chance of being not being you know diagnosed impression yeah so I sort of interested in clearly the saunas affecting you know cardiovascular health and do you know like cardiovascular cardiovascular fitness would be you know one one way to a measurement of cardiovascular health yeah have you ever looked at cardiorespiratory fitness yeah we have been measuring also cadres pedro new study part we have measured and we can see if there is association between the fitness and sauna use and these different parameters yeah yeah so that yeah I population-based study study although we are tested for the level of fitness yeah the the they associates right right between the use of Sonnen outcomes oh cool so your but you people obviously there that are physically active you that and then to look just specifically at how the sauna may in and of itself yeah itself yeah yes that great I look forward to that the other one which I won detail because I don much but it affects endorphins so sauna releases endorphins yeah after orphans make you feel better feel better yeah yeah yeah is this relaxation yeah yeah also in Finland I think we quite many used for that purpose day they want to some real sation you know after working day and so on it day and go the sound and you after that you feel more relaxed do you think that also that may also have something to do with the improve longevity because stress is also linked to meet up longevity and sometimes it that more relaxed and that seems like it goes hand-in-hand with longevity as well yeah can be can be and there are studies showing the role of autonomic nervous system and cardiovascular disease is how how they are related together and and also in our study we want to explore how the sauna may have a fittin on heart rate and heart rate variability which is one of the measure which candy can be used to assess to other non autonomic nervous system it you	Success

Rhonda Patrick on optimal sauna duration and temperature	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWp1XOSvjW4	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so a lot of these these parameters that you just described are also known to be affected by cardiovascular exercise yeah right yeah aerobic exercise so I have to mention that like you know as a someone that uses the sauna when you sit in the sauna for you know long enough period of time your heart rate starts to elevate you know as if you were doing cardiovascular work in fact I think it something like 120 150 beats per minute yeah it is quite high actually it is it is something like the moderate level of physical activity so you that you mentioned the the duration that the time people spent in this in this sauna also was important factor on the robustness of lowering cardiovascular related mortality so people that stayed in the sauna I believe it was longer than 19 minutes had the most robust effect compared to men they stayed in less than 11 minutes yeah yeah yeah the risk reduction can be seen among those who more than 20 minutes per session in some there was risk reduction among those men yeah I hesitant to tell people like they asked you know well how long how long should I stay in the sauna because on the one hand you don yeah but you also don long enough to get these important benefits you know cardiovascular benefits yeah so do you have any sort of parameters that are guide that you know someone that long to stay in the sauna in order to get this sort of benefit how long they should stay in probably depends on temperature as well yeah yeah on the base of this study we 51 to 20 minutes it could be enough but at the moment actually we are exploring more carefully what could be the time what stay at the sauna on the sound and it can be that very short time let minutes or 15 minutes it get all these health benefits maybe so we try to clarify what is the optimal time to stay in Sona great so you on those those parameters right now yeah what was the average temperature that the sauna that these men were using how hot was it it was 79 about 20 minutes in 79 degrees Celsius sauna was yeah what was important for at least in the context of the yeah lower cardiovascular mortality and also all cause mortality as well yeah primary finding yeah what was the type of sauna that men are yeah it clear that it is finished right dry sound yeah it yeah so they weren it called when you dump the water on yeah so when you make the humidity yeah yes was that also it was also how loud you	Success
Rhonda Patrick discusses sauna use associated with lowering risk for dementia and heart disease	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io6dblyRCGw	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so the all-cause mortality is also interesting because your study showed that again there was a dose-dependent effect where men that used the sauna two to three times a week had a 24% lower you have all cause mortality than men using it one time a week and I believe it was men using it four to seven times a week was a 40% yeah we are calling those deaths dose-response oh right yeah you this the paper was accepted that you gonna get a blush which will probably be published yeah by the time this video is published so yeah that so you found that sauna use is associated with lower alzheimers disease and dementia that is extremely interesting to me because you know of my interest in in heat shock proteins so the sauna one of the most robust molecular mechanisms you know that happens upon heat stress so when you heat stress the body what happens is you activate a signaling pathway called heat shock proteins they play a very important role in maintaining the three-dimensional structure of a protein which is important obviously for proteins function but it important for the half-life of a protein and when the three-dimensional structure of a protein becomes misfolded because of damage that damage that damaged our DNA the same damage that does that damage these proteins you know byproducts of normal metabolism reactive oxygen species byproducts of you know immune activation these things are damaging our proteins our DNA our cells but um he Chuck put so when those those proteins become damaged they miss fold and they they don properly so when this happens in the in brain you know proteins can start to then aggregate and form these plaques protein aggregates and plaques so probably the most well known one is amyloid beta 42 yeah which is Alzheimer heat shock proteins what their function is inside of the cell is to actually repair and miss folded protein so that it maintains its proper three-dimensional structure again so that are basically preventing the protein aggregation and this has been shown in multiple studies and in in rodents in lower organisms there many many studies associative studies looking at heat shock proteins and neurodegenerative diseases so there lot of interest in how heat shock proteins may be a therapeutic target for preventing neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer disease and I the connection between knowing the sauna activates heat shock proteins I mean that know they of stress particularly heat stress so I think that would be a very interesting thing to look at I think there are some interesting findings some acute changes after EPS only this yeah a single system in in vessel and vessel function oh wow and also heart rate and there is there actually quite DeRose gradual increase in heart rate during this on a single sound session I yeah yeah you	Success

How sauna mimics cardiovascular exercise: a comparison to stationary bike | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDx1bwymA00	FoundMyFitness Clips 	I would say that some of the most exciting things that have come out in the last year or so have been that a lot of these positive effects on the sauna on heart health also even on brain health you know are very similar to what right basic physical exercise which is not that surprising because what happens when you your core body temperature right you getting hot yes so your skin heart rate goes exactly so these are the things that happen your skin and core body temperature rise there 70% redistribution of your blood flow away from the core all the way to your skin and the reason for that is to facilitate sweating you start to sweat your heart rate increases up to 150 beats per minute you know so all this stuff is very similar well there was a study that came out that showed in fact that what happens the sauna has been shown to mimic some of the effects of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise so a 25 minute sauna was comparable to 25 minutes doing like a hundred watts on a stationary bike and it improved both blood pressure and also lowered heart rate after the so during the obviously during the activity heart rate increase and blood pressure increased in both instances but then immediately after heart rate dropped below baseline levels and also blood pressure drop below baseline levels hmm it really mimic that effect that cardiovascular exercise has say you mentioned 150 beats a minute in the sauna like who gets that high I can sit there for 20 minutes at 175 and I even cross 105 oh really yeah how high do you get about a 120 so I so I usually sit in and the sauna I going in is is probably around 168 because it that about 30 minutes and at the end of 30 minutes here at how many beats I probably get close to around 120 close to it I those my body gets more and more used to it you adapt yeah you	Success
Does contrast therapy reduce the benefits of sauna? | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAhVtr71k24	FoundMyFitness Clips 	on the sauna side of things is there anything new to report on research-wise and then also when you do the sauna are you doing it with a hat or without a hat again have you thought about does the exposure of the heat to the head cause any benefits and then also what are your thoughts on cold showers in between like doing say 15 20 minutes on do a cold shower and hop back in does that is that a good thing or bad thing okay so the sauna the newest stuff that I about is you know there studies showing that frequent sauna bathing has a positive effect on a variety of different heart related diseases you know where it doing it four to seven times a week and lower fatal cardiac heart disease by like 50 percent you know stroke by 51 percent 60 percent lower sudden cardiac death just on and on right multiple studies have shown that there some intervention studies showing that like a single thirty minutes on a session can improve your arterial compliance which is like the ability of your arteries arteries and stuff to respond to stress we hundred and seventy-five or so degrees Fahrenheit for this right exactly for about twenty minutes and and so this and there know the effect on cardiovascular disease also there mortality also lower like 60% lower Alzheimer more - sometimes right and of course cardiovascular health is very related to Alzheimer there shock proteins that also could play a role basically saying in the sauna for longer than 19 minutes there was there a much more robust effect on these lowering of the cardiovascular and all cause mortality than staying in the sauna for like 11 to 18 minutes here the question let minutes when I leave the sauna am I just doing a normal cooldown slowly or can I do the cold shower right afterwards I get to that let me get to that okay okay so let then because all that to answer that question I say there have been some studies that have done a cold so they protocol well they 15 minutes and then they water or something like cold shower I think it was and then back into the sauna again and they were still like some of the same benefits on different parameters of like mitochondrial function and things like that that to do yes yes it that kind of like and again a lot of these studies that I just cited come out of Finland where a good 10 to 20 percent of the population there they the sonnet occult sonnet occult sound of coal right so they not everyone does it but a lot of them do you	Success

Magnesium deficiency and inadequacy is hard to measure accurately | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNJN8wFvPAw	FoundMyFitness Clips 	I would say that I absolutely think magnesium is really really important and as you said you know like they know half at least back back in 2014 you know 45 percent of the u.s. population was not getting adequate amounts of it what does that mean for people like if they feel like I do okay I or something like what is what does that mean in terms of symptoms like why do we need this much magnesium well for one it magnesium is stored in muscle tissue and in bones your your body anytime it it pulls it out of those so your plasma levels unless you deficient your plasma levels aren going to really indicate much of a deficiency so the way that inadequacy or deficiency like I measured is from dietary intake so people aren supposed to be getting you know depending on if they it a day of magnesium and most people aren eating the right foods you know these foods magnesium is high in dark leafy greens it center of a chlorophyll molecule chlorophyll giving plants or green color so things that are dark and green plants how we course it it know affect the bioavailability nuts also a great source but the thing is is you clinical symptom like you to wake up and and go oh my you know like I can see DNA damage happening because magnesium is critical to repair damage of your DNA but that something you can see it something that measured right I mean it you had scurvy right your but you were so vitamin C deficient you had scurvy that your gums started bleeding wake up in the morning you oh my plums are bleeding maybe I like you know should should get some vitamin C but magnesium I mean this is this is one of those things where it types of damage that over the course of decades builds up and starts to lead to diseases of age right you know defects and DNA repair absolute play a role in cancer big-time mold answer and also just in like cellular dysfunction when you start to accumulate damage instead of cells don well including in the brain so magnesium is also critical for the production of ATP and the utilization of it so you can have low energy that is one of you know potentially maybe but see you know the thing is is that it because you need to make energy to survive that that your your all your magnesium then will be used for things that are critical to prevent death in the short term right so this is um part of my mentors theory triage theory on Aging but that he about and published on where you know some of these some of these little insufficiencies in in micronutrients like magnesium they are they are resulting in insidious damage that builds up over decades things that you aren life and actually as diseases of Aging and so you know regulate the aging process itself so I don you a real clinical symptom unless you severely magnesium deficient you	Success
Sauna use promotes changes in immune function that may bolster COVID-19 defense	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwjiMSNqX0Y	FoundMyFitness Clips 	the next question has to do with saunas and the question is can you discuss whether sauna use may help prevent Coppa 19 first of all there to suggest that using the sauna or other modalities of heat stress such as steam showers or hot baths will have any effect on Kobo 19 illness I can discuss other data that is published on pneumonia and the common cold and also the effect on just the immune system in general but I can Coba 19 because there is no data to suggest whether or not the sauna will have any effect on Kobo 19 let by discussing lung health sauna use has been associated with a reduced risk of developing certain chronic or acute respiratory illnesses including pneumonia sauna use promotes mild hypothermia which in turn induces a wide array of physiological responses these responses reduce oxidative stress and inflammation and activate cellular defense systems that provide protection against many diseases so data from a 2017 studies suggest that sauna use reduces the risk of developing certain chronic or acute respiratory illnesses including pneumonia which is a acute respiratory illness characterized by cough fever chills and difficulty breathing it influenza and other viral illness infections including Koba 19 as well as bacterial infections pneumonia affects people of all ages but children older adults and people who are immunocompromised seem to be most vulnerable so this study drew on data from a population-based prospective cohort study of more than 2,000 healthy middle-aged men between the age of 42 and 65 years old and it was conducted in Finland where most people have a home sauna the average sauna exposure reported in the study was approximately 20 minutes per session and the temperature was 174 degrees Fahrenheit or 79 degrees Celsius the data was adjusted for a variety of potential confounding factors like body mass index smoking status education level alcohol consumption total energy intake socioeconomic status physical activity inflammatory status and a history of diabetes heart disease asthma bronchitis or tuberculosis so the study revealed that the frequency of sauna use was inversely associated with the incidence of respiratory illness men who used the sauna two to three times weekly were 27% less likely to develop pneumonia than those who use the sauna once a week or not at all men who used the sauna four to seven times a week were 41 percent less likely to develop pneumonia compared to the infrequent sonic users the saunas protective effects on the lungs may be due to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation associated with hyperthermia or the direct beneficial effects on lung tissue frequent sauna use may decrease pulmonary congestion and lead to other improvements in lung function including vital capacity tidal volume minut ventilation and forced expiratory volume sauna use has been shown to improve lung function in people with obstructive pulmonary disease typical Finnish saunas are not the only type of heat stress that have been shown to be beneficial for lung health way on therapy which uses far infrared dry saunas also has been shown to improve lung function in patients with chronic pulmonary disease also known as COPD the temperature of far infrared saunas are significantly lower than typical Finnish sauna so they around 140 degrees Fahrenheit since the temperature is lower the duration in many studies is longer around 45 minutes and the frequency in many studies is daily for a few weeks one of the major differences between dry saunas or finished on us and far infrared saunas is that both dry and Finnish saunas the heat the ambient air and that heat is transferred from the air to the body but in far infrared saunas the thermal radiation is directly used to increase body temperature sonna bathing was shown to reduce the incidence of common colds in 25% participants that use the sauna 1 to 2 times per week for 6 months compared to 25 controls that did not it took 3 months before the sauna had a protective effect the mechanism by which frequency on use reduces the incidence of colds is unknown but it could have to do with the modulation of the immune system white blood cells lymphocytes and neutrophil counts were all increased in both trained and non trained athletes after sauna use while these findings are interesting they and larger studies are needed to confirm one of the protective adaptive responses to heat stress is the production of heat shock proteins heat shock proteins are a conserved class of proteins with critical roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis and in protecting the cells from stressful conditions heat shock proteins have been shown to be increased by approximately 50% after 30 minutes in a hundred and 63 degree Fahrenheit sauna in healthy young men and women once activated they can remain so for up to 48 hours it acclimated to heat such as from regular sauna use results in the production of more heat shock proteins under normal conditions and even more so under stressful conditions such as cell and tissue injury this is good because as we age we make less heat shock proteins so anything to boost them is beneficial heat shock proteins like heat shock protein 70 are also readily induced by fever and when released from cells heat shock protein 70 can can stimulate the innate immune response through toll-like receptors 2 & 4 the relationship between exposure temperature and maximal heat shock protein 70 protein levels was linear between normal body temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit and a hundred and five point eight degrees Fahrenheit so increasing approximately 50% per degree Celsius in human lung epithelial cells increasing evidence suggests that certain heat shock proteins player role in both innate and adaptive immunity he Chuck proteins can directly stimulate the innate immune responses such as the maturation and activation of dendritic cells and the activation of natural killer cells this means that there may be a direct role for heat-shock proteins in regulating the innate immune response which plays an important role in the body fight off a disease that it exposed to before he Chuck protein 70 when given to mice acts as an adjuvant and stimulates the innate immune missus but in it stimulates the innate immune system it confers a protection against for example HSV you when exposed in addition to directly impacting the immune function heat shock proteins such as heat shock protein 70 have also been shown to directly inhibit viral activity and replication of influenza virus a while the effect of heat shock proteins on viruses is a bit nuanced the more important thing is that heat shock proteins activate the innate immune system and sauna use has been shown to increase white blood cell and other monocyte levels I know many people don have access to a home sauna and without gyms open you know gyms or gyms are closed at this time so it impossible for a lot of people to use the sauna so let about hot baths since most people do have access to a bath tub hot baths have also been shown to increase heat shock proteins which is good news one study found that participants that sat in a hot bath from their waist down for one hour were able to increase their heat shock protein levels so just in in summary it appears as though sauna use is protective against um respiratory illnesses like pneumonia and as well as COPD and has been shown to be protective against the common cold it to increase the innate immune response in terms of increasing white blood cell numbers and other monocyte

Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia: how it works | Ashley Mason, Ph.D.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZmZw2T8FwA	FoundMyFitness Clips 	was gonna say things like napping things like and i can talk a little bit about napping because it double-edged sword but right things like napping things like trying to sleep in on the weekends using sleep pills like over-the-counter sleep aids to try and get to sleep using things that aren over the counter to try to get to sleep um canceling activities canceling workouts skipping them because you just too tired so starting to do all of these handicapping activities that are actually detracting from what you really want to be doing which is building up adenosine during the day and i know that you and dr matthew walker talked about how caffeine impacts sleep and how you really want a crew sleep drive during the day so you can fall asleep at night well guess what if you long naps during the day you decreasing the sleep drive that you have at the end of the day that helps capitulate you into sleep and keep you asleep and if you never used to take naps because you used to sleep fine because you didn other things it forward process and like you podcasts caffeine i don caffeine but if you in the day it trying to go to sleep it messes with all kinds of things similarly you might develop patterns of using your bright bright computer screen very very late at night when you didn before you had a major stressor that happened so all of these different kinds of behaviors can perpetuate sleep problems and in the treatment that i do cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia we focus on a bunch of things we focus on sleep hygiene something called stimulus control we focus on something called sleep restriction which is not sleep deprivation i minute cognitive techniques and then relaxation techniques so the sleep hygiene i just went over stimulus control is going back to basics with the bed nothing in bed except for sleeper sex that watching tv no fighting with your spouse no wondering where your kids can apply to college none of that no ipads social media none of it in bed stimulus control the only thing we do in bed no phones in bed no oh my gosh i in bed um just sleep or sex and that means that if you can and you you are violating the rule you have to get out of bed and you have to go to the couch or go somewhere else and finish your worrying or finish whatever you doing and then you can go back to bed and a lot of people don think it sounds so hard and awful but by the time someone me for sleep problems i basically say look treatment with me is five weeks of your life how long have you been struggling with this sleep problem worth it i know you waitlist for at least six twelve months so if you do this give it a college try really do it how much worse can it get and there guide people by the way through this whole treatment on their own if you want um and i can i can give you the link for that what called quiet your mind and get to sleep okay that because you mentioned it yes i got three copies oh so i outstanding she needs it dr rachel manber at stanford wrote that book and the forward was written by dr richard bootson who was the professor from whom i learned this treatment at the university of arizona so we we talked about sleep hygiene stimulus control sleep restriction what that means is we take the amount of time that someone is in bed every night and we focus on that instead of just being in bed doing things what i do to figure out how long someone should actually be in bed is the first week that they are with me they wake time they have to wake up at that same time every single day for seven days i always joke with them any day ending in diy you have to get up at that time include saturday and sunday right and dr panda spoke all about how important it is to not wake up at different times and how that giving yourself artificial jet lag and all that stuff so um i have patients do that for seven days and then but they go to bed whenever they actually sleepy and we calculate how much time each night on average are they sleeping and over the course of that week we get an average per night amount of time that they that it turns out that on average you sleep seven hours a night and that your wake time is 8 a.m would mean that in order to figure out what your bedtime should be i work backwards from 8 a.m i go from 8am to 1am and then i add 30 minutes of grace because that and so then i would say rhonda your bedtime is the bedtime of your childhood dreams your bedtime is 12 30 at night you get to stay up all the way till 12 30 and guess what not only do you get to stay up that late you can then you have to go to bed at that time or after once you and what this actually does is this restricts the amount of time that people are in their beds the amount of time that they can actually sleep and and pretty quickly patients will start to get pretty darn good quality sleep during that seven and a half hours for the first few weeks it they can eventually they sleep during that time pretty good sleep because they sleep pressure during the day and then during treatment we extend it back by 15 minutes a week as they demonstrate that they can keep their efficiency at least 85 what is efficiency the amount of time that you amount of time that you have patients keep detailed sleep logs about that there that book that you just ordered so we do that sleep restriction then we do the cognitive techniques where we work with people and how those serve them and how they don are and how much they need to be changed you	Success
Sauna Use for Depression: The Hyperthermia Protocol (Clinical Study)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMRsbvMzs9M	FoundMyFitness Clips 	whole body hyperthermia is a new term for a lot of people and it important one because there there that is what you know clinically was used or is used to um to treat were shown to help treat uh depression and um it there with whole body hyperthermia and how that just going in the sauna sure sure so it said a lot of people are familiar with sauna it in their house it vacation and going in the sauna and sweating and then leaving it is very pleasurable it is often relaxing calming people enjoy doing it they often report that they feel better afterward whole body hyperthermia protocols are a little bit more intense so if you asked someone who went into one of the saunas in one of the studies that i today they might just not tell you it was a spa like experience it intense there you get very very hot and whereas with sauna you might go in it for 15 20 minutes go out of the sauna to cool down for a bit go back in with whole body hyperthermia protocols you getting heated pretty consistently for quite a while until you you a going in and going out and going in process and with whole body hyperthermia protocols especially in studies there have been a lot more steps to control the experience than say going to asana at your gym and we can get into what some of those are if we want to talk about the specific studies but um they although they both involve heat and maybe like um let bit about some of the preliminary findings that got you interested in this research in the first place yeah absolutely so in 2016 this paper came out by jansen and a bunch of other co-authors where they reported on a whole body hyperthermia protocol that they had used to test as a treatment for clinical depression and this study was impressive for a number of reasons they recruited 30 some odd participants who had pretty significant depression and they randomized half of them to get a whole body hypothermia treatment or half of them to get a sham whole body hyperthermia treatment and i talk about what the differences are there in a second but it was a very good idea for a placebo condition for this study so the whole body hypothermia condition the folks randomized to receive this were put into a kind of whole body hypothermia machine that involved infrared heating lamps and this is a pretty fancy machine they run about fifty thousand dollars you only find them in hospitals they germany it involved experience so these people who were randomized to receive whole body of hyperthermia went into this sauna tent if you will the heckle machine and they were heated until they reached a core body temperature of 38.5 degrees celsius after that time the sauna was turned off and they stayed in there anyway for another hour just lying there and during that time their temperature actually continued to rise all the way up to about 38.85 or so degrees celsius and all during that time they are sweating sweating sweating they are hot and what important to know about this sauna tent is that their head is outside of the sauna so you asked about one of the differences between regular sauna and whole body hypothermia this is a major one when you go into a sauna your whole body is going into the sauna including your head with these whole body hypothermia protocols in many cases your head is not in the heating element it it so you can be drinking a person can be attending to your head putting cool cloths on it and so on like they did in that jansen study now the other half the people who didn whole body hypothermia they were actually put in that same machine but it wasn and they the lamps turn on and they got a little bit warm but they didn warm i think it was like 99.5 degrees fahrenheit that they that the control condition got into and what that the authors of the study actually asked all of the participants so what do you think you got do you think you got the real deal the whole body hypothermia or do you think you got the the control condition some 71 percent of people in that control condition thought they got the actual sauna treatment so why is that exciting because when you actually look at the change in the depression scores for these people it was pretty remarkable the drops in depression within a week were pretty impressive and what were maintained six weeks later and this was one whole body hypothermia session and so the difference between the groups was pretty notable six weeks out and especially one week out and this study caught my eye for a few reasons one is that as a whole in this country many other countries we depression it antidepressants work for many people therapy works for many people but we still have a long way to go in developing treatments for depression and when you see a treatment like that with that strong of a control condition and those effect sizes and those reductions in depression it catches your eye so i got really excited about that started looking more into well what else has been done with this and it turned out there was one other study in 2013 the hanush paper um where they just recruited depressed participants they gave them the sauna session and then they looked at them afterward and there findings about that study as well but it was it was a single arm study so there was no control condition but those two studies got me really excited and started me down this path um in particular with looking at temperature you said for the there with with you know dr charles razon study 2006 study um with this heckle machine this whole body hypothermia would that are really um important and and those are that one you said that there was an effect within just a week of treatment which is quite quickly it think about classical like serotonin reuptake inhibitors which are ssris which are used very you know widely for you know depression treatment they don work immediately like that so that was one thing and to get your thoughts into the the fact that they did one session and it lasted six weeks like they didn have to keep going every day or even every week i mean they just did it once and it was a six week like there was a lasting effect yeah so what are your thoughts oh it was it was pretty it was a big moment for me and what i realized when i was thinking about that very ssri thing was that well wait a minute what do ssris have in common with all of this and i went back and i looked at some of the ssri literature and it turns out that one of the most common side effects of ssris is hyperhidrosis it so then i thought huh sweating one of the most common side effects of ssris and yet with whole body hyperthermia what are we actually doing we should probably actually go back into into why this some of the mechanisms a little bit here with this but that really made me think okay wait a minute do we have actual data now has anybody published on whether sweating in response to ssris is associated with if they are effective or not i has done that it a great analysis to do um i hope someone love to work on it there that um we could use to test that but getting back to your question about wow this works really fast yeah ssris take weeks can take months before they start to work whereas dr rezon noticed these effects in just a week in his study design and yes they did last out to six weeks now they didn don key area of future research but um maybe we should talk a little bit about the hypothesis underlying why this might be working and that that 2016 paper i thought my goodness what there is literature showing temperature dysregulation in people with depression back early 1980 82 and then 97 a researcher dr avery published some work showing that people with depression often have higher nighttime body temperatures and they thermoregulatory cooling they don sweat as much to cool themselves down and what there people with depression get better when their depression symptoms lessen their core body temperature also can decrease and that other treatments that aren sauna treatment for example electroconvulsive therapy ect was a paper that showed that with successful ect treatment the patient alongside their depression and from that hanush paper that single arm sauna trial what they found was that the decrease in body temperature was correlated with a decrease in depression and they measured that decrease in body temperature pretty carefully they were using an indwelling rectal probe so they were really measuring it those five days afterward um and that says something about the mechanism here with body temperature so let about that study which hopefully will start yes very soon so we looking forward to this study um it going to be a three-year project to do this pair of two studies the first study will be 16 people and everybody same thing and i is in a second and the second study is going to be 30 people and half of those people get one thing and half of those people get another thing so let about what everybody first study so first of all in both these studies we of those biomarkers it pretty exciting you number of them so far bdnf heat shock proteins inflammatory cytokines um gosh crp there laundry list we don brain derived neurotrophic factor and what role does that play in depression just like generally speaking my goodness so i up to snuff i would say on all of the biological underpinnings with these molecules with no it that exercise has been trying to increase and it help with neuroplasticity right but there to dr charles roseanne called cytokines sing the blues looking at how depression may be and quite inflammatory right for some people who have it and so we know that exercise is temporarily inflammatory when you do it but it actually in a good way because of the adaptive changes that follow from that the anti-inflammatory yes right um so the thought is well sauna is hopefully quite similar and we have a bunch of data that suggests that it is looking in that direction we still need to do the research though so in this first study we will have 16 people with major depressive disorder we will recruit them they will all be adults and in addition to getting a whole body hyperthermia treatment they going to get something called cognitive behavioral therapy for depression so what is that cognitive behavioral therapy is a psychotherapy used for depression it it depression it doesn medications it provides this treatment it structured it there are very specific tools that are often used across all of the different ways of administering this treatment but the idea is that thoughts impact our feelings and how we feel impacts our behavior so for example if you have someone who has let 2 diabetes and they come in and they say i blood sugar under control never going to be able to do it i just can stick to this diet i fail i this when someone has those series of thoughts how do you think they feel not so great they don and when you don you do well the chocolate cake sounds pretty good maybe i to feel better but then you eat the chocolate cake which reinforces the thought i can to be able to stick to this diet and so on and so forth so thoughts feelings behavior thoughts beyond the paper and so interrupting that loop is a major part of cognitive behavioral therapy for depression and there different ways that that anyway this treatment is known to work however it doesn do it and what is one of the major reasons why people with depression can psychotherapy they can super depressed notwithstanding of course there are huge problems with our medical health care system in terms of being able to get therapy that nother can of worms that we don to go into but the point that i is just that if patients can engage in therapy they can the benefits out of therapy so in this treatment everybody get whole body hyperthermia as well as cognitive behavioral therapy sessions not at the same time they might be on separate days and or they might be on the same day but one after the other and you might be wondering well where did this idea come from like why give cognitive behavioral therapy with whole body hyperthermia and that dates back to a few different things and i think this i think you and dr charles rezan talked about this during your discussion about some of the traditional origins of sauna it often been a communal process native american sweat lodges people don themselves right there in the korean kilns or in the russian banyas right it experience and one thing that uh chuck told me about the 2016 paper and about that study was that during the study the patients who were getting the whole body hypothermia often started chatting i don talked about this part or not but i just from personal experience it absolutely true i mean you become chatty when you you talk to people and yeah yeah started wanting to connect started wanting to and so the research assistants went back to the investigators and said the patients are talking what should we be saying to them what should we be doing and i remember when chuck told me this story and just thinking huh well if whole body hypothermia is making people want to talk more and one of the major reasons why people don do well in therapy is that they don want to talk and they don engage should we be pairing these things could using heat then cause people to be able to be more engaged in therapy and so this is the ultimate mind-body type intervention right there and if we can develop something like this that gets around prescribing people medications maybe this is a good way to go so propose this dual intervention with a mind and a body component and that what we developing that combined intervention and then in the second study with the 30 people we to just get the cognitive behavioral therapy which we know works it literature there showing that cognitive behavioral therapy for depression works half people will get that and then half will also get the whole body hypothermia sessions and we will see does adding the whole body hyperthermia lead to larger depression decreases and you might be wondering well why don you just do just the sauna versus like just cbt or something like this well it tricky ethically to recruit patients with depression and then not provide them with a treatment that we know works and tell them oh and by the way don anything else while you thing that do the better thing to do is to say okay here we do better than that so one of the key gaps that we going to be giving people eight weekly whole body hyperthermia sessions right so that people willing to do this do they get more benefit this way because all of those other two studies that i mentioned they only gave one whole body hypothermia session and we saw that huge drop one week later right what happens if we give a second session one week later are we going to see another huge drop we don we body hyperthermia sessions we going to be measuring body temperature at night during their entire time they going to use a wearable device when they instead of using you know an indwelling rectal probe that to get people to wear that for like i don they to measure depression symptoms daily using smart phones so that we can actually see when symptoms are changing we biomarkers and we these in relation to each other and one of the things i really hope we discover too is how willing are people to do this kind of sauna treatment and then you know obviously seeing how long it lasts we outcomes further than one week and six weeks obviously but what my hope is that is that we might be able to develop almost a booster method if if in the future this seems like a good idea after this next study and i really hope it does but you see on the internet that you can buy all these sauna tents that you can use at home you know people with people there they they heads out and it looks kind of funny you could see them on all the different websites well what what what if we actually need to do a certain number of this intensity of whole body heating like the kind that we here but then at home it could be supplemented and it could be maintained or sustained in this way and that would people rather you know take drugs that maybe aren come with a certain number of side effects or say oh once a week i have to sit in this thing for 45 minutes and read a magazine right so if we can develop a longer term model for maintaining wellness and maintaining reductions in depression symptoms that would be a huge win you	Success

The INSANE Cardiovascular Health Benefits of Sauna Bathing | Dr. Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhaBQdX8KaA	FoundMyFitness Clips 	if you only had a couple minutes with someone who was totally new to saas how would you Briefly summarize the benefits well I would start with um a lot of the studies that have come out of Finland which have been large you know very very large population-based studies these are observational studies where an association has been made and um there have been quite a few that have found that frequent sauna use is associated with a lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease a lower risk of sudden cardiac death a lower risk of coronary heart disease a lower risk of stroke a lower risk of dementia of Alzheimer lower risk it it it occurs in a dose dependent manner so what that means is the more frequent the sauna bathing the more robust the the the health benefits are so for example people that use the sauna two to three times a week are about about 22% less likely to die from Sudden cardiac death compared to people that only use the sauna one time a week but people that use the sauna four to seven times a week are 63% less likely to die from Sudden cardiac death compared to people that use the sauna one time per week so there more frequent sauna bathing more robust effects on cardiovascular health and I would say that to people that are not familiar with the sauna a lot of people think of it as a time to relax it very it out of your day and and and and have it to to yourself um so so there is an aspect of this relaxation almost a meditation type of um Quality to to sauna bathing but there interesting aspect of it which is sauna use is essentially mimicking moderate aerobic cardiovascular exercise and so a lot of the same physiological response that happen when you example your heart rate elevates while you body temperature you get hot you start to sweat these are the same things that are occurring while someone is in the sauna so heart rate elevates it elevates to around 120 beats per minute you sweat your core body temperature is elevated after the sauna and after exercise and this has actually been compared head-to-head comparison of these two blood pressure is lower after sauna bathing or after exercise your resting heart rate is lower than before you did the exercise or before you started using the sauna so um I think that really interesting aspect of sauna that most people are unfamiliar with that it moderate intense cardiovascular exercise and then the other thing is is that there really profound effects on the brain and I don been teased out just yet we can certainly dive into some details but you know there link between cardiovascular health and brain function you know having proper blood flow to the brain is very important for for lowering dementia risk so there but you know there observational studies looking at dementia risk and Alzheimer sauna bathers and again it dependent robust effect frequency matters and so people that use this on a two to three times a week you know they have some somewhere like a 20% lower dementia risk 20% lower Alzheimer more or less but using the sauna four to seven times a week it between a 60 to 66% reduction in dementia and Alzheimer compared to people that use thisa one time a week so um it seems like you know four times a week is kind of The Sweet Spot and we can talk about all the details of that um in a little bit but but there sauna use seems to help prevent nerd deener of diseases like Alzheimer disease and dementia so um I certainly have some hypothesis and hypothesis I guess they I um I think that start into the sauna oh and also all cause mortality that too because you know there studies these large populational studies finding that people that use this four to seven times a week have a 40% lower risk of dying from all causes of death um than people that use the sauna one time a week so um to me it really is is the beginning of understanding that you know sauna you seems to really be beneficial for our health and much like a lot of these lifestyle factors that that are well known to to modify our our disease risk so exercise for example so you don you know a healthy diet meditation I think these are pretty common knowledge at this point to be beneficial for overall health and I think that sauna use should be up there I think it should be included in that in that sort of um you know bag of things that are known to improve what our health span is it diseases that we get into a a shorter time period so it extending the youthful part of our life so you may not necessarily live you know X many years longer although you may if you don probably end up not dying from cancer earlier but ultimately it improving your health span is about improving the quality of your life not getting Parkinson Alzheimer not getting cardiovascular disease type two diabetes and and having a better quality of life so that you essentially enjoying your life and and living living healthier for a longer period of time I do want to make sure to distinguish the difference between um my publication on the sauna which was a a very comprehensive review article covering multiple aspects of sauna health and someone doing primary research where they doing experiments and having people you know come into a sauna and measuring heart rate and blood pressure changes for for example um so I am I am not doing those experiments and a lot of the research that that has um been done on the the health benefits of the SAA have actually come out of Finland uh from Dr Yari Lenin so I just wanted to give him a little shout out because uh his work has been invaluable in in in our understanding of the health benefits of the SAA well let deeper into the cardiovascular system because you mentioned there potentially excellent benefits from the sauna on the cardiovascular system so could you review what the cardiovascular system is briefly and then what known about the saa I think this is so important because um as you know it neck are cardiovascular disease and cancer as the number one and two killers of both men and women in the United States so what impact on the cardiovascular system well what impact of I mean I think generally speaking when people think about cardiovascular health they think about their cholesterol they think about the health of their arteries they think about not having a bunch of plaques build up inside their arteries and block blood flow and and oxygen from getting to different tissues it known that a lot of dietary and lifestyle factors can modify cardiovascular disease risk one of the best ones being exercise I don that there cardiovascular health than than exercise so um you know the fact that sauna use mimics moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise as I as I mentioned a moment ago is it of principle that you know sauna sauna is going to be good for cardiovascular health the same sort of physiological changes are happening you know you have an increased blood flow to the skin um also to the muscle so that facilitate sweating um plasma volume increases heart rate elevates during sauna bathing you you know you and you thing that happening while you exercising and changes in blood pressure go down as well afterwards just like exercise so I think that that is partly probably responsible for some of the cardiovascular benefits Dr Yari Lain and and his colleagues have looked at so many different aspects of cardiovascular health with respect to sauna bathing and and they found time and time again whether you cardiac death whether you about death from cardiovascular disease or coronary heart disease um and even talking about stroke risk um stroke risk is also significantly lowered something in the realm of like 40% lower for people that use the sauna four to seven times a week versus once a week so there that suggests that sauna use does mimic moderate aerobic activity and and this is potentially why it cardiac you know for cardiovascular health excellent and does it lower cholesterol and hypertension as well regular sauna use hypertension yes like so there studies looking at hypertension risk so this again these are observational studies and again it dependent effects where you see people that use this on a two to three times a week they have like a 24% lower risk of hyper hypertension versus people that use the sauna four to seven times a week who have about a 46% lower risk of um hypertension but there like studies where they single sauna use again where they just one a person goes into the sauna uses it for you know 20 minutes and they measure blood pressure before and after the sauna and one even just a single sauna use lowers blood pressure so both systolic and diastolic blood pressure after the sauna bathing similar to what exercise does and so I think um that helps sort of establish causality because there associations and how much Association how much can you you know derive causality from these associations when it comes to observational studies you mentioned how you know sauna use mimics exercise in many ways moderate intensity exercise so with regard to that can it also just improve overall Fitness and endurance as well that question uh we cover this in um my co-author terresa Johnson and I our review article that we published um last year in experimental gerontology and I say um so far the evidence seems to suggest that sauna use May improve endurance exercise um there there have been a variety of studies that have looked either at Runners for example that use the sauna and then they time and running distance um there have been some studies looking at people wearing a sauna suit so this is like a type of clothing that of mimics the sauna because it makes you you know warm up and so people train in that sauna suit um and that to help improve endurance but I think there lot of evidence out there um looking at just acclimating yourself to heat and so you know when you sauna there there changes that start to occur where your body starts to adapt so like if someone it talked about temperature duration yet in any of these you know studies that I are referred to with respect to cardiovascular health and all cause mortality for example but um you know if you degrees fhe and you before and certainly if you that that are Physically Active also are sort of adapted to heat because they elevating their core body temperature when they they you take a person that person that to heat and it them to stay in that sauna hot sauna for more than five minutes um But as time goes on and um as people start to use this SAA more and become more acclimated then people start to sweat at a lower core body temperature and this helps facilitate cooling down and so they able to tolerate it more and they also there can talk about uh at the molecular level that occur as well and and so I think that um it all comes down to basically if you are adapted to heat well then when you Marathon you more heat adapted because if you to using the sauna and you you temperature and all these physiological Chang are happening then that affect you when you your core body temperature through another modality that modality being running or exercise you know fill in the blank type of exercise so um you know it kind of makes sense when you think about it definitely	Success
Rhonda Patrick's Sauna Routine (temperature, duration, & hydration protocols)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TXdgFbABQY	FoundMyFitness Clips 	well if you would love to get into details about your specific sauna protocol that you adapted in your life how often do you use the sauna uh what temperature what humidity um you know how long do you stay in there so let those details and I I saying this is not medical advice anyone that is considering using the sauna good idea to check it out with your medical professional first in case you have a health condition that may make SAA use dangerous but um with that said yeah let incorporated into your life sure well let data that I referred to and and what the temperature duration Etc I talked a lot about frequency four to seven times a week but I didn temperature or how long people were in the sauna so in almost all of those studies the temperature of the sauna um these were these were saunas in Finland and and they were 174 Dees fhe around um and the humidity was between between uh 10 to 20% humidity I think something like that and so um what was very interesting to me when I was looking at the data coming out of Dr Yari lacan the sauna seemed to matter with respect to robustness of um of the results so I mentioned for example you know people that use the sauna four to seven times a week were 50% less likely to to die from like you know cardiovascular disease related death well that number was referring to people that stayed in the sauna greater than 19 minutes so this was about 20 minutes so 20 minutes is this is is The Sweet Spot at about 174 degree Fahrenheit you know humidity 10 to 20% um people that sat in the sauna for like 11 minutes on average their their reduction in cardiovascular disease related um death from cardiovascular disease was like 8% 8% versus 50% big difference there so um duration definitely matters uh with respect to the sauna so that where I started out with my my sort of okay what am I what am I going to do and then I also mentioned earlier about heat chock proteins I in activating my heat shock proteins um and so the the 163 degree Fahrenheit for 30 minutes activated them by 50% over Baseline levels and so um typically what I do my protocol is I do um typically when I go for my long runs I don don do do a Jacuzzi at night so um when I doing my pelaton bike I do a lot of high-intensity interval training you know uh pelaton and I crank the the sauna up you know about an hour an hour and a half before I get on the pellaton and then I go into the sauna immediately after and I in the sauna for the sauna is typically around 186 degrees Fahrenheit for me when I get in there and I stay in there anywhere between 20 and 30 minutes depending on um Pro mostly depending on how intense my workout was because I already elevated my core body temperature from my my high-intensity workout um and then there are times when I don end up staying there longer for sure I in there for 30 minutes about 186 Fahrenheit but I can doing this I certainly um did not start out doing that uh so so um definitely uh keep that in mind I also like to to put hot water so I have um I have my little bucket and um I do I do put some hot water on the rocks my hygrometer like broke um when I when I was measuring it uh I was getting about 20 to 30% humidity and then once I got 30% I was like I couldn down to 10 to 20% humidity because it just feels so hot so uh that those are my settings that I do and um I like it frequency how how often I do it it really depends on what I have going on so there are times when I know I but then there like twice a week you know so um I I do try to my my my you know my Baseline I try to keep is four I try to do about four times a week but I have been um doing a lot of jacuzzi so I doing jacuzzi at nighttime um it like the only time my husband and I have to ourselves um you know once once our son goes to bed and and so we like to go out in the jacuzzi look at the stars and it together but um our jacuzzi is about4 degrees Fahrenheit and there have been a lot of people have asked me you know can you get the same benefits from the sauna as you do from a hot path and we don have all the empirical evidence to say that yes for sure but we have quite a bit that seems to be accumulating so a lot of the you know heat Shack proteins have been shown to be elevated with hot bath brain Drive neurotrophic factors increased with hot baths um there some effects on um depression as well and cardiovascular health and so you know I I I might be going out on a limb here but I would say I really think that hot baths and jacuzzi um can have a similar effect now staying in there staying in the jacuzzi for 20 minutes with your shoulders submerged down is kind of key and some of the hot bath studies were the same the hot bath studies used 104 degree Fahrenheit water and they were people were submerged from from their shoulders down as well but that follow so you extend your workout you heart rate up on the bike or or going for a run and then your heart rate remains elevated once you get into the sauna I do yeah that is that kind of my jam I do but there are times when I I I get in there without without working out but like yeah that you know sometimes it going to get in the sauna for 20 to 30 minutes like I can I can hop on my pelaton and just push it for 10 minutes do a 10-minute high-intensity workout um and and just and take you know so basically what I my workout to the next level you know that is doing where it my workout and boom I next level so um and I always go back to that cardiio respiratory Fitness study where it better than exercise alone yep and you mentioned the hot bath could potentially be a replacement for the sauna how about just a long long extended hot shower for people that don bath yeah that you do I mean you get a lot of steam from showers as well so um you know I do think steam showers um can have some beneficial effects I don nearly anywhere near like the the data that I mentioned you know just because you you like when you can get really hot um just not getting quite as hot with with a hot shower but I do think there can be some some some benefits perhaps um I I would I would tend to go for the hot bath though if you have most people do have a bathtub I know not everyone does uh but if you do have a bathtub I would go for the hot bath over the hot shower got it and how about hydration how do you what kind of hydration protocol before and after the sauna yeah that um you know you do lose a lot of sweat in the sauna and um with sweat you also can lose a lot of sodium uh and sodium is the main one but you can also lose you know some other electrolytes like magnesium potassium so um I definitely try I definitely stay hydrated and I I switch between um sometimes I juice that I make um with like some kale a little bit of lemon um some cucumber um or so you know I the magnesium and pottassium and stuff or I supplement noon they have like a a sugar-free version of it or sometimes I do um some keto it salt and it it has a lot of it has like magnesium it has potassium it has a lot of electrolytes in it and so I I use that in fact I now um but so that what I do cool after after the sauna not before got it and speaking of after the sauna I know this is a whole another discussion but um cold therapy you know do you ever get in the cold shower or do a cold plunge jump in a frozen lake after the sauna definitely don lake um unless I country like Finland um but uh yeah I do so um I I do have a cold plunge and I also do like cold showers as well I don you know there the cold as well and and in fact a lot of these cultures that we talked about earlier like Finland and Russia like they they a large percentage of them go from hot and then into cold um I don go immediately into it um I because when you this in the heat in this like a sauna or a hot bath vasod dilation is occurring um you you know you Vaso dilation and then the complete opposite happen happens when you go into a cold plunge or cold water cold water immersion to in some shape or form you is happening and so um I some scary incidents where going from one extreme directly into the other without waiting like five minutes or a few minutes you know where my blood pressure or something just goes really low and I just like I get super dizzy and it think that EX in caution when going from extremes like that uh is important uh so but I do especially in the summertime I like to to run run out into the the cold plunge like you know a couple minutes after I do the sauna after I like rest for a few minutes two to five minutes you mentioned that you heat adapted to the sauna because of all your regular use um for someone that kind of building their heat tolerance up is there a way that they can kind of tell how long is too long in the sauna are there any kind of signs they should be looking for Like O I should probably take a break and not push it yeah I think you know your heart starts to really your heart rate starts to get elevated and you know you you definitely want to to push past that point um once you you know and you start to feel uncomfortable but you reach a point where your heart you just feel you just feel really really uncomfortable and I think that that get out I think people people should definitely listen to their bodies I mean getting out when you just experienc most slight bit of uncomfortableness maybe not the way to go but like you know when you feeling like this is I getting really hot and again like once you hit the 20 minute Mark that all that 174 degree Fahrenheit um that these Studies have shown have been beneficial for reducing cardiovascular disease mortality and all cause mortality and Alzheimer at risk so so that good rule of thumb as well you know 20 minutes and you can also have a timer outside of your sauna I used to do that I used to have a timer clock and it like okay I reached my time um so so that	Success
Can the sauna amplify the benefits of exercise?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8FmIFswS_M	FoundMyFitness Clips 	exercise plus sauna is better at increasing bdnf than exercise alone so it does seem to have an additive effect at least in animal studies now also the same goes for cardiorespiratory Fitness so human Studies have found that that endurance exercise like aerobic exercise I should say not endurance aerobic exercise can improve is associated with improved V2 Max compared to like not exercising right obviously um but if you if you add sauna on top that the VO2 max improvements are even better and that in both observational studies as well as a Interventional trial	Success

Rhonda Patrick on the Crazy Brain Benefits of Saunas	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5LzvgD8tzc	FoundMyFitness Clips 	well shifting gears to you mentioned the the mental and um potential benefits that protect against neuro degenerative diseases like Dementia or Alzheimer that research on that that keeps me using the sauna regularly even if I don have time is that potential significant reduction in dementia risk so could you talk a little bit more about that research and yeah what protection from neurod degenerative diseases well the research looking at sauna use and specifically it at Alzheimer really limited to just observational data in which case son use is associated with a much lower RIS so like I said around 60% 60 to 66% lower if people are using the sauna four to seven times a week now why that is is um a probably you know again very interesting question probably something coming down to cardiovascular health right so if you if you cardiovascular health you have increased blood flow to the brain and that protect against dementia um but there also some evidence and this kind of gets into some into some of the molecular details with um son use and something I shock proteins and heat shock proteins as their name implies are activated by heat stress um and so sauna robustly activates them there looking at people that have sat in a about 163 degree Fahrenheit sauna for 30 minutes they their heat chock proteins about 50% over their Baseline levels so what are heat shock proteins and why do we even care about them well heat shock proteins are a stress stress response protein and we can talk a little bit more about what that means later but um essentially what they do is they help proteins inside of your cells they help keep their three-dimensional structure so every protein in your body has a threedimensional structure and that these proteins in our body that are doing everything all the work inside of our cells they they don forever they eventually you know they get chewed up and degraded like in a in a in a garbage can basically can think about it and so um sometimes you know that doesn age it definitely starts to go arai and so heat proteins kind of help prevent that from happening so they help prevent proteins from um becoming disorganized and destructured because when they become that way they tend to Aggregate and they can form Aggregates and these Aggregates can then form plaques and these plaques can form in places like the vascular system or they can form in places like the the brain so probably the classical example of plaques in the brain are amalo beta 42 plaques that are associated with Alzheimer there animal studies that have found that elevated levels of heat Tru proteins can protect against the formation of amalo beta plaques and they can help prevent Al an Alzheimer disease in in animals so um there been a lot of evidence of that and that I think is one interesting angle because saunas are well known to activate heat shock proteins and once they stay activated for about 48 hours I mean they um you know so constant when you talking about someone that four to seven times a week you know we don a person and measuring their heat shock proteins like each day but you know one could imagine that you would you would see that heat shock proteins are way act way elevated over what their normal Baseline levels are and so what you having is almost this constitutive activation of this of this family of proteins that essentially help prevent plaques from forming um among other things so so I think that interesting angle as well uh with respect to to neurogenerative disease and in fact one of my first experiments um when I was an early researcher at the Suk Institute for biological studies in La Hoya I was doing some research on nematode worms celegans where we were injecting them with amalo beta 42 the peptide fragment that associated with Alzheimer causing these plaques in the brain we injecting them into these worms and um into their muscle tissue and it it causes the worms to become paralyzed because they have all these protein aggregates in their muscle and they can distinct phenotype you look at them under microscope and they they their nose around and feed but they can experiments where I would boost up their heat chock proteins and like it totally corrected that like these worms even though they had even though we were giving them amalo beta 42 it it totally corrected them from um the paralysis because the amalo beta 42 wasn I original study that I you know had done with my own hands and it kind of made this this aha moment I heog proteins are doing something cool is that how you actually got interested in sauna use in the first place from that re um it the molecular some of the molecular aspects of sauna use I would say that uh the real way I became interested in in the sauna um and this will take us into other brain function aspects if you okay with that um so when I was in graduate school I lived across the street from a YMCA and I used to go use the sauna almost every day before I would go into the lab and do my experiments and um as any graduate student or buddy young scientist or even senior scientist will tell you um experiments fail they they fail all the time and it hard uh so so graduate school can be very hard because you being just bombarded down it you work well that didn goes six months of work you know and it what I started to notice was that using the sauna before going into the lab my my ability to handle stress was is noticeable like I was much more capable of handling stress my anxiety was much lower I mean it was very very noticeable for me where to the point where I was like like something don and so I started diving into the literature you know way back then in in like 2009 you know so um that kind of got into the sauna um and the effects on the brain and actually in the publication that that um we published last year I kind of uh Rift a little bit on some I would say it more of a hypothesis than anything um in terms of the reason for that you know when you you endorphins much like exercise so um it sort of the same same effect so endorphins are those feel-good opioids that your brain is producing the counter to that Feelgood endorphin is the it called dorphin the endogenous counter to it dorphin is is that chemical in your brain that is responsible for making you feel dysphoria not so good um so the kind of feeling you get when you really hot you you is hot or you know or when you for your long-distance run and it feeling of of you just don but you have to push past it right you push past it so um dorphin is something that that period and dorphin is actually involved in cooling the body so I think that brain is making it when you you temperature um and the interesting thing about dorphin is that although it responsible for the dysphoric feeling it binds to a receptor in our brain called the Capa opioid receptor um when it binds to that receptor it ends up doing this whole feedback loop and this is like the beauty of biology and the feedback loop is that those feel-good endorphins that we make bind to another type of receptor called the MU opioid receptor and this is the same type of receptor that morphine and opioids also bind to that help make people feel good um they help with pain and stuff well Kappa opioids when you when you buy into that receptor that dysphoric feeling it changes the MU opioid receptor it basically um makes them more sensitive to endorphins for a longer period of time and so uh you know I sort of have this hypothesis that like well you get in the sauna and you you you know you you push past that like this feels terrible it you push past it a little bit um you get done with it and and and then the endorphins that you make a day later or two days later or five days later from laughing at a joke or forgiving giving your loved one a hug or whatever it is that you they bit of a tangent but that got me interested in in using the sauna and um as as you mentioned and alluded to earlier there is there lot of empirical evidence that has now come out since that time looking looking at the effects of sauna use on mental health and specifically depression so um Dr Ashley Mason right now uh who I looking at sauna use and um people people with depression um that have not able been able to manage it with um different types of standard of care treatments and so um she a work from her former Mentor Dr Charles Rison who found that basically elevating a person to 2° was able to give people an anti-depressant effect that lasted like up to six weeks with a single use and this was compared to a sham control um they use this device that basically um made people feel like they were getting a little bit hot but it wasn hot enough so it was a really great Placebo control because people thought they were actually getting the treatment um Placebo controls are very important particularly with depression studies because a placebo response is a very real response so um so that was that was a really a seminal study looking at you know just a single session of son use and how it had a very robust anti-depressant effect up that lasted six weeks in these depress depressed patients compared to blissa control now Ashley Mason is now she on this and she sauna and she the core body temperature you know one to two degrees and um and she one session she sessions and and uh we variety of biomarkers to understand why that is like is there are there changes in the immune system um and and there some preliminary evidence to suggest there are you know there there have been quite a few observational studies looking at SAA use and how SAA use is associated with lower biomarkers of like SE reactive protein so these are markers of inflammation inflammation plays a major Ro in depression as well son use also can increase il10 which is an anti-inflammatory so that shown in a um intervention study so people that have used the sauna had their blood drawn um before and after there was some evidence that that I 10 was elevated after using the sauna so there you know the immune changes may be going on and changing it in a positive way much like exercise so exercise also um it it increases is six which is another cyto kind that mocine it and it can cause inflammation but it also this type of cyto kind that can cause a uh very powerful anti-inflammatory response so there we can talk about what this means hormesis there aspect to it um so so that interesting as well yeah and and with those depression studies and the hypothesis for why um SAA use wow I mean it potentially a six- week benefit for patients that are um uh having depression could part of the hypothesis be that they because you mentioned are endorphins and our internal opiate system and how son use can sensitize those receptors so the opiates our own opiates inside of our body work better is that one of the hypothesis too of why this can help patients who are depressed it is it is and we out how to measure that like there there we collaborators and actually we do have some some collaborators that are um potentially going to help us kind of figure out how we can test whether or not that that is playing a role it it playing a role for sure I think there multiple things that play here and I think that one of them is is the the change in the opioid system in the brain for sure but you can receptors and and sensitivity and UPR regulation like you can in an animal right like in people like that know we yet um with with our technology so that would that would be something that would be really cool but um but there are some other things that can be measured in plasma	Success
The biggest benefit of saunas no one is talking about	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7SU2hBle7g	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so that interested in the sauna was the effect on my mood when you get in the sauna um or when you heat exposure say a hot bath something similar you release endorphins and that when you um but you also release something that the opposite of that it and that is the opioid that responsible for that discomfort feeling that dysphoric feeling like it this I hate it why am I doing this myself exactly and that running what it it happens during physical activity as well and um and so what it does it actually cools down your core body temperature somewhat and that and um but when you release that discomfort feeling there loop it actually tell it actually you actually make more receptors and you make them more sensitive to the feel-good endorphins so that you feel better later	Success
How the sauna amplifies the benefits of exercise	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF8IAe9lOKM	FoundMyFitness Clips 	there people that exercise and use the sauna have a lower all cause mortality than people that exercise and don sauna but he Interventional studies where he two groups of people and put them on an exercise protocol aerobic exercise on a stationary bike and then only half of that group then went into a sauna after the exercise and he measured cardiorespiratory Fitness and found that people that use the sauna in addition to aerobic exercise improve their card cardiorespiratory Fitness even more than people that uh only did the exercise and there were other cardiometabolic parameters that were also improved um cholesterol was improved blood pressure was improved more as well so it seems as though adding the sauna in addition to an exercise routine is another way to improve some cardiometabolic end points and also cardiorespiratory Fitness	Success
This is how often you should use the sauna for maximum benefits	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXIw4mADWwI	FoundMyFitness Clips 	and it seems as though like the minimum effective dose to get some benefits is really two times a week of Sona use if you get up to four times a week then you of four to seven times a week people are getting reductions up to 50% in their cardiovascular related mortality 40% related to reductions and they all cause mortality and this sauna doesn be so hot I mean this isn something degree temperatures that you some often hear people site that they using um in fact I think that bit too hot I mean these people are using 100 on average 175 degrees Fahrenheit often there is a little bit of a humidity you know 30 up to 30% humidity as well but they for about 20 minutes	Success
The Biggest Benefit of Saunas No One Is Talking About	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmaYZEW1S3k	FoundMyFitness Clips 	um so starting with deliberate heat exposure drawing from um some of the leading experts in the this area of sauna research um Dr Yari linin being one of the world sauna is affecting cardiovascular health I ago and he has published just numerous studies on how this sauna affects cardiorespiratory Fitness how it affecting blood pressure cardiac compliance arterial compliance just are a lot of different cardiovas ular Health parameters and his research has shown in a couple different ways so there observational data showing people that exercise and use the sauna have a lower all cause mortality than people that exercise and don he studies where he people and put them on an exercise protocol aerobic exercise on a stationary bike and then only half of that group then went into a sauna after the exercise and he measured cardiorespiratory Fitness and found that people that use the sauna in addition to aerobic exercise improve their cardio cardiorespiratory Fitness even more than people that uh only did the exercise and there were other cardi metabolic parameters that were also improved cholesterol was improved blood pressure was improved more as well so it seems as though adding the sauna in addition to an exercise routine is another way to improve some cardi metabolic end points and also cardiorespiratory Fitness there well um something that i about before on the podcast in fact you Brady use the sauna in your exercise uh protocol I do and you know a lot of that has to do with some of the research that you has published so I informed kind of my strategy based on this not only you know the studies show that you can improve your view to Max you know additionally by using the sauna but it also improves your exercise performance not only in the heat you know which kind of makes sense you becoming more heat acclimated but it also improves your performance just in normal weather or like not hot weather I guess as you would call it so I integrate that in my training not only just do I like the sauna for the cardiovascular benefits and the Brain benefits you know after reading these studies kind of hearing you talk about it I think you know it makes sense to use it so about three times per week two to three times for week I into the sauna immediately or within 5 to 10 minutes of finishing one of my runs so I gym I don have one at the gym that I use and I finish my run I sauna for another 20 to 30 minutes that seems to be the protocols used in many of the studies they do typically a 20 minute sauna bath afterwards so I right in there try try to keep it so that my heart rate is like staying a little bit elevated from the end of the run into the sauna so I think of it as a way to sort of extend that cardio session a little bit um that endurance training session because when you the sauna you know might the heart rate might not be as high as it was when I was running 130 40 50 beats per minute but it of the sauna so um I use that as a strategy again one because it feels good and I just like it but two to gain maybe some additional benefits uh to that endurance exercise training session I did the same um I I I get in the sauna um after both aerobic exercise training as well as doing my strength training resistance training exercise you know and a lot of the the data that Dr uh Lan has published has been observational data looking at people that are routinely using the sauna and the effects of that on cardiovascular related mortality all cause mortality and it seems as though like the minimum effective dose to get some benefits it really two times a week of SAA use if you get up to four times a week then you of four to seven times a week people are getting reductions up to 50% in their cardiovascular related mortality 40% related reductions and they all cause mortality and this sauna doesn be so hot I mean this isn something degree temperatures that you some often hear people site that they using um in fact I think that bit too hot I mean these people are using 100 on average 175 degrees Fahrenheit often there is a little bit of a humidity you know 30 up to 30% humidity as well but they for about 20 minutes and so um I find it it it is nice to get in get into the sauna after a workout out and extend that sort of aerobic exercise mimicking capacity a little bit further another area that using deliberate heat exposure could be beneficial is combining it with resistance training or even using it during perhaps an injury when you able to work out and I would say a lot of this evidence is preliminary and more needs to be done but going off the preliminary evidence and just knowing that there health as well why wouldn um there has been at least some preliminary evidence in one small study that people that got in this on after the resistance training protocol increased signaling molecules that are involved anabolic signaling molecules that are involved in muscle hypertrophy there humans that underwent I mean it was this experiments that are done where they they mobilize a muscle for a period of time and they look at atrophy after that right disuse atrophy is what it called and it seems as though um heat exposure at Le at the local level in this in this regard for this study people that had the heat exposure were about almost 40% less likely to to lose their they lost 40% less of their muscle mass um which is quite a bit so a lot of potential reasons there heat chock proteins have been shown to be activated a lot of disuse um atrophy studies done in in animal models with heat exposure and then you endocrine effects as well growth hormone is elevated when you and that can have aspects for Recovery as well so there to combine deliberate heat exposure with also resistance training workout and I would say that is not the case for deliberate cold exposure yeah and in fact I think a lot of the evidence would suggest the opposite lately where getting in cold immediately after resistance exercise in particular seems to blunt some of the hypertropic V benefits um there those studies now where it the cold after your resistance training work out so yeah it makes sense to really embrace the heat not only for recovery but for the anabolic potential um the endurance exercise benefits I think you know the the anabolic potential is interesting because you know I I don are any studies out there showing greater hypertrophy after using heat but like you said with the heat shock protein all the mechanisms kind of make sense and so um there was recently like a review paper that just came out that we write about on that because I think it heat is becoming kind of embraced and yeah again the cold maybe not something to do around your resistance exercise sessions right and and Dr Luke Van Lon who was a a guest on the podcast as well had done some he has done some research on that in fact showed that doing deliberate cold exposure like a cold death um immediately after resistance training workout does blunt hypertrophy I mean so that protein synthesis all goes down if you get in the cold ride afterwards so something to avoid probably	Success
The one benefit of saunas no one is talking about	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfhWlzVED9g	FoundMyFitness Clips 	what about sauna sauna you mostly is through sweat and there are a lot of toxins that we we do excrete through sweat a lot of those are heavy metals so for example um cadmium and aluminum so aluminum is associated with Alzheimer are more readily excreted through sweat than through urine and so when you get in the sauna you really you can you can excrete a little bit of BPA it does it does come out through sweat as well however the majority of excretion um chem that are being excreted through sweat are things like some heavy metals and things like that	Success
Sauna use associated with reduction of heart disease and all-cause mortality | Jari Laukkanen	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7rENb-5kt0	FoundMyFitness Clips 	our study is based on middle-aged population from eastern finland and at baseline we measured the use of sound how many times per week and how long time per one session and what was the temperature and on the basis of this information we have studied association between the use of sound and fatal cardiovascular outcomes and mortality and in this study we found really that sound use was inversely associated with risk of fatal coronary heart disease events and all cause mortality and after adjustment for other risk factors which have been also measured in this big population based study there was still significant association between the use of Sona and these outcomes yes if I remember correctly your your study showed that men that used the sauna two to three times a week had a 27% lower cardiovascular related mortality compared to men that used it one time a week and men that used the sauna four to seven times a week actually had a 50% lower cardiovascular related mortality than men that use the sauna one time a week and that is very robust yeah I mean so you follow these men for 20 years yeah yeah the total pull up town was 20 years and we have annually measured new outcomes and we have followed carefully from baseline until to end of the follow-up and yes the risk reduction was really really obvious and earlier yeah and you said you adjusted for other risk factors meaning like obesity you looked for people like obesity smoking alcohol cholesterol type 2 diabetes these sort of factors yeah I remember correctly you also looked at socioeconomic status yeah physical activity which is important yeah so these are all the data is reflective really of sauna use yeah not you know because people that use the sauna tend to also exercise more so you know it that you have to correct for all those other possible confounding factors what you did you	Success
Sauna decreases blood pressure (strong impact) | Jari Laukkanen	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljzZW-UmLKs	FoundMyFitness Clips 	you know I how the sauna effects and different vascular functions but you cardiologist so do you have some sort of you speculate on some of the mechanisms by which using the sauna can improve cardiovascular health yeah yeah we have we have been studying also these mechanisms which can be explained to our findings and one of the most important is to blood pressure because I only used long-term sauna use can decrease blood vessel level actually we have studied in the same population and found that there there is a reduction of incident hypertension among those who are using more sauna compared to those who have a only let say one session per week and so blood pressure is one of the most important factor which can explain into the findings and in do you know why fauna lowers blood pressure do you there there may be many many reasons we know that it can balance autonomic nervous system as well and also it can improve the vessel function in the folio vessels yeah and elephant ourselves and another thing is that sound may have some effect on arterial stiffness and compliance of arteries can improve after a long term sound use you	Success
Rhonda Patrick on optimal sauna duration and temperature	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWp1XOSvjW4	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so a lot of these these parameters that you just described are also known to be affected by cardiovascular exercise yeah right yeah aerobic exercise so I have to mention that like you know as a someone that uses the sauna when you sit in the sauna for you know long enough period of time your heart rate starts to elevate you know as if you were doing cardiovascular work in fact I think it something like 120 150 beats per minute yeah it is quite high actually it is it is something like the moderate level of physical activity so you that you mentioned the the duration that the time people spent in this in this sauna also was important factor on the robustness of lowering cardiovascular related mortality so people that stayed in the sauna I believe it was longer than 19 minutes had the most robust effect compared to men they stayed in less than 11 minutes yeah yeah yeah the risk reduction can be seen among those who more than 20 minutes per session in some there was risk reduction among those men yeah I hesitant to tell people like they asked you know well how long how long should I stay in the sauna because on the one hand you don yeah but you also don long enough to get these important benefits you know cardiovascular benefits yeah so do you have any sort of parameters that are guide that you know someone that long to stay in the sauna in order to get this sort of benefit how long they should stay in probably depends on temperature as well yeah yeah on the base of this study we 51 to 20 minutes it could be enough but at the moment actually we are exploring more carefully what could be the time what stay at the sauna on the sound and it can be that very short time let minutes or 15 minutes it get all these health benefits maybe so we try to clarify what is the optimal time to stay in Sona great so you on those those parameters right now yeah what was the average temperature that the sauna that these men were using how hot was it it was 79 about 20 minutes in 79 degrees Celsius sauna was yeah what was important for at least in the context of the yeah lower cardiovascular mortality and also all cause mortality as well yeah primary finding yeah what was the type of sauna that men are yeah it clear that it is finished right dry sound yeah it yeah so they weren it called when you dump the water on yeah so when you make the humidity yeah yes was that also it was also how loud you	Success
Rhonda Patrick discusses sauna use associated with lowering risk for dementia and heart disease	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io6dblyRCGw	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so the all-cause mortality is also interesting because your study showed that again there was a dose-dependent effect where men that used the sauna two to three times a week had a 24% lower you have all cause mortality than men using it one time a week and I believe it was men using it four to seven times a week was a 40% yeah we are calling those deaths dose-response oh right yeah you this the paper was accepted that you gonna get a blush which will probably be published yeah by the time this video is published so yeah that so you found that sauna use is associated with lower alzheimers disease and dementia that is extremely interesting to me because you know of my interest in in heat shock proteins so the sauna one of the most robust molecular mechanisms you know that happens upon heat stress so when you heat stress the body what happens is you activate a signaling pathway called heat shock proteins they play a very important role in maintaining the three-dimensional structure of a protein which is important obviously for proteins function but it important for the half-life of a protein and when the three-dimensional structure of a protein becomes misfolded because of damage that damage that damaged our DNA the same damage that does that damage these proteins you know byproducts of normal metabolism reactive oxygen species byproducts of you know immune activation these things are damaging our proteins our DNA our cells but um he Chuck put so when those those proteins become damaged they miss fold and they they don properly so when this happens in the in brain you know proteins can start to then aggregate and form these plaques protein aggregates and plaques so probably the most well known one is amyloid beta 42 yeah which is Alzheimer heat shock proteins what their function is inside of the cell is to actually repair and miss folded protein so that it maintains its proper three-dimensional structure again so that are basically preventing the protein aggregation and this has been shown in multiple studies and in in rodents in lower organisms there many many studies associative studies looking at heat shock proteins and neurodegenerative diseases so there lot of interest in how heat shock proteins may be a therapeutic target for preventing neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer disease and I the connection between knowing the sauna activates heat shock proteins I mean that know they of stress particularly heat stress so I think that would be a very interesting thing to look at I think there are some interesting findings some acute changes after EPS only this yeah a single system in in vessel and vessel function oh wow and also heart rate and there is there actually quite DeRose gradual increase in heart rate during this on a single sound session I yeah yeah you	Success

Can sauna use improve your mood?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePx2S6NSnrg	FoundMyFitness Clips 	something else that I find very interesting is the the effect on mood actually it the song in the first place so when I was in graduate school I was very stressed out you know exams and failed experiments and lots of pressure so I was using the sauna and it noticeably improved my mood so and helped me deal with stress it helped me deal with the anxiety I was experiencing and and there speculative reasons I think that possible but one is related to cardiorespiratory fitness so there has actually been studies one very recently done published in a very large sample of people I believe it was like a million people looking at cardiorespiratory fitness and depression and the study found that people with poor cardiorespiratory fitness had a 75% increased chance of being not being you know diagnosed impression yeah so I sort of interested in clearly the saunas affecting you know cardiovascular health and do you know like cardiovascular cardiovascular fitness would be you know one one way to a measurement of cardiovascular health yeah have you ever looked at cardiorespiratory fitness yeah we have been measuring also cadres pedro new study part we have measured and we can see if there is association between the fitness and sauna use and these different parameters yeah yeah so that yeah I population-based study study although we are tested for the level of fitness yeah the the they associates right right between the use of Sonnen outcomes oh cool so your but you people obviously there that are physically active you that and then to look just specifically at how the sauna may in and of itself yeah itself yeah yes that great I look forward to that the other one which I won detail because I don much but it affects endorphins so sauna releases endorphins yeah after orphans make you feel better feel better yeah yeah yeah is this relaxation yeah yeah also in Finland I think we quite many used for that purpose day they want to some real sation you know after working day and so on it day and go the sound and you after that you feel more relaxed do you think that also that may also have something to do with the improve longevity because stress is also linked to meet up longevity and sometimes it that more relaxed and that seems like it goes hand-in-hand with longevity as well yeah can be can be and there are studies showing the role of autonomic nervous system and cardiovascular disease is how how they are related together and and also in our study we want to explore how the sauna may have a fittin on heart rate and heart rate variability which is one of the measure which candy can be used to assess to other non autonomic nervous system it you	Success
From hot to cold: benefits and risks associated with cold water immersion after sauna use	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwadE1I6RdQ	FoundMyFitness Clips 	having been in Finland now for a few days and having the privilege of going to the Finnish sauna society and also hanging out with some some other friends here in Finland I experience the sauna culture the traditional sauna smoke saunas and also the other you know dry saunas and but what I also noticed is that almost a hundred percent of the Finnish people that I that that use the sauna after the sauna like to go run into a jump into a cold lake or the Baltic or something cold very very cold yeah and they do this you know several times I mean this is it seems to be a very normal part of Finnish sauna culture yeah is that accurate you would say yeah yeah many people are using I know it so I have a question on whether you know what what is the safety you know is there any safety issues cuz I couple of case reports where because you dilations occurring and then you going into cold where Raisa constrictions occurring norepinephrine is being released and we constriction it been a couple of documented cases of like corn coronary artery spasm I think it think there from hot to cold in terms of people with maybe a pre-existing heart disease or something yeah among those patient who have coronary heart disease and especially if it condition then you have to be very careful you cannot do that because there is there can be a spasm in coronary arteries and it can be harmful yeah but for the most people part of the population it seems to be pretty safe I mean I really good I mean you feel amazing after doing a hot and cold also interested in if it blunts any of the the positive effects but what interesting is I activates heat shock proteins because no who heat shock proteins are part of the stress response you know it it familiar with hormesis it little bit of good stress where it too much stress but it to activate all these genetic pathways that help you deal with stress well heat shock proteins are one of those genetic pathways and so cold is also a little bit of a Matic stress like and exercise activates heat shock proteins as well and then robustly activates them very robustly so the cold truck it good to know that both the hot and the cold are activating some of the same good genetic pathways so maybe you not negating all the good stuff you just did with the sauna right maybe there synergy we would be really happy to investigate those possible mechanisms between sound and memory because we have been thinking through you know more more like improve cardiovascular system and circulation on these if they have an effect on the memory disease because some cardiovascular diseases and memories are sharing the bit similar risk factors and yeah yeah yeah what flow is absolutely linked to dementia so it mechanisms yeah man it we gotta get the word out there you know more research more people using the sauna I think I think that that there are there are nowadays there are so many studies showing to positive effects of physical exercise on these outcomes and and vessel function zone but there are quite limited Tate on sonny similar outcomes so there are space to do these you know and explore a new territory yeah no one know and it that someone is you know so please keep up the good work yeah I mean the best case of course we can combine these positive effects in like exactly exercise and sound are you going to look at that as well are you going to see if we tried to do something yeah what is also important for for pop the curve of health level but also we have to emphasize that there are many other factors in addition to exercise and so on there are other also of course we have to take care of other respects like blood pressure lipids smoking obesity in addition to that yeah you	Success
Lifestyle interventions that have positive effects on healthspan and lifespan | Eric Verdin	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMDqWaNbJdo	FoundMyFitness Clips 	I think scientists at Berkeley actually have been able to this data is comes out of a book that was based on data from Berkeley suggesting that a child born in nineteen 2007 has a 50% chance of living 204 after reading that code I was thinking well maybe some of these lifestyle interventions that we know to regulate the aging process that we know that can have a positive effect on health span can you explain lifestyle interventions that are known to regulate the aging process at least in animal models yes and in humans as well I think there are you know four broad categories of things that are being considered by the aging field one is exercise is to this day this surest best intervention that we have to increase health span and lifespan the second one is nutrition and there trying to understand what is it about nutrition is it carbohydrates vs. fat versus proteins what is the relative role of all these nutrients in your lifespan and health span the third one which is actually an active field of Investigation is the identification of molecules that mimic either exercise or the sort of exercise mimetic or mimic restriction in terms of nutrients or what we call calorie restriction memetics and finally the last part of the whole aging field is the idea of rejuvenation so the first three approaches are geared towards slowing slowing down the process of Aging rejuvenation takes the approach that once the aging has occurred how can you repair it and how can you fix it so I think you know we have programs here that are studying all four different approaches I think you probably familiar with Jack LaLanne who was the in one of the gurus that started the American sort of infatuation with exercise and he said he lived to a hundred years old and he he said that exercise is king nutrition is queen but together and you have a kingdom which i think is it it colleagues I think exercising nutrition is the cornerstone of what we to do today until we we have better drugs you	Success
High intake of carbohydrates associated with increased all-cause mortality | Eric Verdin	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXCB88NnfHI	FoundMyFitness Clips 	in the past you know a couple of decades there the research has seemed to show that you know limiting these certain macronutrients you know protein fat carbohydrates you sort of tweak the amount that you take in you can alter the way in animal ages at least in terms of the way their tissues are aging not necessarily going to you know increase their maximum life status that you may increase their average lifespan which is yes I think we in the last 20 years we research has been actually causing a revaluation of some of the public policies that have been enacted in the last 20 and 30 years in terms of what should we you should what should you eat why should you eat so a lot of work is ongoing today and actually generating lots of really interesting data along with this the basic science of aging I think what people have studied is trying to understand what are the pathways that control aging and C elegans and Drosophila the food flies and a little nematode or and mice one of the major pathways that has emerged is insulin signaling pathway that was the work of since a Kenyan back in 1990s showing that the insulin signaling pathway is one of the major pathway that controls aging well if you know this you can already sort of backtrack and say well what isn hormone that allows you to utilize carbohydrate and so the implication of this is the more carbohydrate you eat the more you active in it activates the insulin signaling pathway and the prediction would be that the more the faster you age and I think real data really suggests this model now it flies completely in the face of what we assumed to be correct you can walk into any store and find low fat diet and low fat products turns out that we really believe that the culprit is more carbohydrates and the recent paper just came out which is really remarkable showing analyzing in thousands of humans fraction of their total calorie intake that is represented by carbohydrates and they were able to so just by interviewing them and what do you eat and what they showed in this paper is the all cause mortality was directly correlated to the amount of carbohydrate that one eats people ate the least amount of carbohydrates at the lowest all cause mortality Wow was it did they differentiate between refined carbohydrates and for example vegetables which are carbohydrates they did they didn obviously not all carbohydrates are created equal but I think possibly founder irrespective irrespective total carbohydrate was a very strong predict well yeah but obviously you know if you total carbohydrate intake is it it very hard to eat a high amount of carbohydrates that are all sort of a low absorption that carbohydrates so typically the people who eat a lot of carbohydrate will eat a lot of the bad ones right yeah most people that are getting that are probably eating more of a standard sort of American diet you know where it and cookies and I think people that are following more like of a Paleolithic type of diet where they know Whole Foods and me you know probably would eat their carbohydrate intake the bulk would be from vegetables or things like that you	Success
Plausible mechanisms by which intermittent fasting may be effective against aging | Eric Verdin	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze8syND8IpU	FoundMyFitness Clips 	[Rhonda]: Maybe you could talk a little bit\\nabout, you know, fasting, because fasting is one of the well-known, you know, dietary\\ninterventions that can regulate the way we age. [Dr. Verdin]: Yes. And the key question about fasting is there’s\\ngrowing evidence that it is beneficial. Intermittent fasting, episodic fasting can\\nactually illicit a response in our bodies and many animal models that are protective\\nagainst aging. The question is, how does it happen? So, fasting has growing evidence that it actually\\nincreases lifespan and healthspan, and the so-called fasting mimicking diets are emerging. A group, Valter Longo’s, suggesting that,\\nyou know, these diets have really beneficial effect on healthspan, even in humans. Now, the key question is how do they work,\\nand there are multiple possible mechanism. And it’s possible that the resulting effect\\nis a combination of all of them, of all mechanisms. So, one is decreasing carbohydrate intake. So, that would lead to a decrease in insulin\\nsignaling. Second one is restricting protein intake,\\nwhich would actually lead to decreased mTOR signaling and so on. The third one is induction of ketosis, which\\nis a small nutrient which is generated by your liver during the fasting process, and\\nall works indicates that just ketosis and a ketogenic diet might have beneficial effect\\nall by itself.

Cyclic ketogenic diet improved healthspan and improved memory in mice | Eric Verdin	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKPf2a4BZO0	FoundMyFitness Clips 	you recently published a paper your lab recently published a paper where you had taken mice male mice and give given them a cyclic ketogenic diet yes so that started in midlife yeah actually it started at one-year-old when you saw this is about a third of their normal lifespans so it would be the equivalent of a thirty year old human okay and and and you found that it so exactly what you found that they increase the health span of these animals and there there was some effect on the brain yes very interesting data suggesting again the whole experiment started on the idea and on the observation that there are many similarities between what happens during ketosis on a ketogenic diet and what happens on calorie restriction or fasting and so we with a colleague in the lab John Newman a number of years ago we started asking the question you know could with my son on the ketogenic diet live longer so we spent about a year and a half with John trying to identify the conditions where these mice would be on a fat and protein diets essentially had zero carbohydrates after one year of age the problem we had initially is that they actually loved the stuff so they would just devour this this diet and and he got fat so we were worried that by becoming obese we were sort of counterbalance the beneficial effect of they get to change diet so we spent a bit of time trying to solve this eventually were able to put them one week on one week off and that result in a stable weight in the mice and that allowed us to look at their health span and life span at the end of their lives and what we saw was an increased medium life span but about 10% so the early mortality was decreased but eventually they ended up having no increase in maximum lifespan we also found a number of other there are variables associated with health span that were significantly increased in particular men this mice the most remarkable thing we saw is that these older mice on the ketogenic diet are actually better memory than younger mice Wow and and and certainly did not see the loss of memory function that one would normally see associated with the aging process so I think it was a pretty profound observation should say also John Ramsey and his colleague at UC Davis conducted the same type of experiment except that instead of putting the mice on a cycling one week on one week of diet they allotted fixed portions to the mice so they couldn same amount of calories that they would have been eating had they been on a normal diet and so these mice did not get fat and were continuously on the on the ketogenic diet and what they saw is essentially parallel to what we saw but the effects were even a little better which suggests that the cycling might have been actually a bit stressful for the mice over the long run and so I think we studies because they they were conducted independently we find our only that we were pursuing the same thing right at the end at the time of publishing and then we decided to coordinate publication the stories and they came out in the same journal together so I think they both reinforce each other there is really clearly intriguing biology there happening and this was the first time that this have been reported you	Success
?-Hydroxybutyrate protects against oxidative stress as a nutrient and as a transcription regulator	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFSN1shTSCo	FoundMyFitness Clips 	paper what got us into this field was an observation that we published in science in 2010 showing that so Bellatrix period in addition being a nutrient as we just discussed is also a signaling molecule and what we found at that time was that beta hydroxy period which is quite similar to butyrate now butyrate is a byproduct of bacterial fermentation in our gut and when we eat fibers these bacteria will digest the fibers into butyrate and this butyrate actually circulates and many of us as we as we live the purely rate was the first known or first identified inhibitor of H tags histone deacetylases which are epigenetic regulators and so that suggested that maybe better hallux period might be an endogenous regulator of these H tags now the reason why we were interested in htdocs they there Steve Health Science work has shown that an enzyme called RP d3 in yeast is actually a regulator of the sirtuins which are themselves regulator of aging so there that yeast has been established action drosophila as well linking our pd 3 - sir - to aging the aging process and these age stacks and I our in the same pathway so that god has to start thinking what could better hydroxy butyrate be also an HVAC inhibitor and it was and then this implicated and it might actually be able to regulate gene expression and some of the key targets that we found were enzymes such as fox or 3 for now which is a major sort of transcription factor in humans linked to aging and it turns out that Fox 2 3 actually controls the response to oxidative stress so there another link there that that you know brings not only the pentose phosphate on a ad pH but better it protects against oxidative stress as both as a nutrient but also as a as a transcriptional regulator that cool do you know what what levels of beta hydroxy butyrate are required to sort of flip that switch and so the and this is probably it good question it reasons why no one did the experiment before us it beta butyrate and Bella hundred hydroxy butyrate or pore inhibitors there have very low efficiency as H lock inhibitors it as an inhibitor nobody wants to work on milli molar inhibitors because it potent enough what most people did not realize is that the concentration of beta hydroxy butyrate in your plasma and your brain drawing fasting can go in the millimolar range very quickly and that when I was reading a paper discussing these concentrations and was astounded I thought well milli molar concentration this means that it might really work as a niche attack inhibitor and so we tested this by putting a pump under the skin of mice with better hydroxy butyrate and then measuring histone acetylation throughout the mouse and we found that histone marks acetylation marks were going up suggesting that there was indeed an inhibition of H dark and I think that was the turning point for I giving them exhaustion is a hydroxy yeah not even the fasting cuz of fasting or a ketogenic diet is much more complicated than just giving better and every day they were on a normal child I a normal child I it they were not fasted and we found that their ketone body levels were going very high in the millimolar range and within a few hours their histones were becoming high porosity late and so that for us I think signified that here that is produced during fasting under conditions that we know are good for your health and so ketogenic diet has been indicated that some beneficial effect and there know under a series of circumstances all of a sudden this we had a potential signaling malate mechanism and that pursued you	Success
Supplementing with exogenous ketone esters vs. eating a ketogenic diet | Eric Verdin	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcf-iZlloLA	FoundMyFitness Clips 	what do you think of exogenous ketones esters like do you think that they safe I mean I how is that something that you about well we are experimenting with them as well it is one of the central questions is most of the beneficial effect that we have seen have been with the ketogenic diets again it beta hydroxy butyrate level and one of the remaining or at least the next step in this whole field is really to understand what can we recapitulate with better hydroxy butyrate alone and I think we so are many other groups right the ketogenic diet itself it realize it on I mean there are you know I don mean to be diminishing the mayor actually I highlight the merit of people who are in a long-term ketogenic diet it takes a lot of discipline you basically cannot eat a significant amount of carbohydrates many people who have been on this diet for a long time actually targets benefits and and and the fact that they healthy and and they present there are a lot of brain effects are linked to to ketogenic diet now big question is what can we replicate just by administering administering BH be better attributed alone yeah I I think that you and and not to mention that with with the ketogenic diets there know some some people can them you know there polymorphisms I know there PPR alpha with gene which is important for the whole process of making ketone bodies and that people have that they they actually can and so it can be sort of dangerous and they can have inflammation so does the opposite profile will happen you know so it then not to mention like you found in your paper that you just published this this year was it last month yeah yeah last month that you found you know there were multiple changes going on there was a I think there was a decrease in insulin obviously an igf-1 and mTOR activity went down and and then you know that something you beta-hydroxybutyrate maybe we don I don the nth or part but we also saw we compared the ketogenic diet to a high-fat diet which was not ketogenic that is there which mice ate a large amount of fat and enough carbohydrates to suppress ketogenesis and one of the biggest difference and I think actually between these two was the activation of people our alpha and this is also very exciting because that indicates that maybe a lot of the beneficial effect that we see unlike you to change that comes from people are activation and there literature they seem quite quite quite a bit of information there that really hasn to try to dissect these these effects because because people are alpha is doing something in the mitochondria what a key enzyme of the fasting response and but it seems to be more highly activated in response to the ketogenic diet than men to a pure high-fat diet so what about fasting if you compare fasting it is activated which is we know we did not compare to fasting we compared it just high fat too but I think it just points to a new direction in which we can start dice like okay what is the role of people outside in these responses you	Success
Increased protein intake during caloric restriction | Eric Verdin	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D-iErxZ5a0	FoundMyFitness Clips 	ketogenic diets have grown in popularity. Uh, and you know, so do you think that do you think that if the the ketogenic diet you use, you hadn done a 10% protein if they had done a little bit more? I that technically wouldn ketogenic diet, but would it have changed the IGF-1 mTor axis as much? you is that uh a number of people who go on a ketogenic diet tend to compensate by increasing their protein intake which might actually put them at risk from exactly what you IGF-1 signaling and increase actually uh risk of cancer. There correlation between your IGF-1 level and your risk of cancer. So, I think um this is something that needs to be considered in the future for people who are on a long-term ketogenic diet and and with the um with the caloric restriction diet. So, well, I think I read there was a study I remember reading that humans that end up doing caloric restriction like there caloric restriction. They end up eating a they they they eat, you know, 30% less calories than they normally would or whatever, something like that, but they end up eating a higher percentage of protein because it humans sort of naturally gravitate to eating more protein when they less food. Yes. And so what interesting is a lot of those I think you even published a study recently looking at um biomarkers of aging and lymphosytes or monocytes. Yes. And we saw no difference between people on calorie restriction. This points again to and this is something important to disc to to to consider when a lot of the work that we do in the lab are done on mice that are isogenic or conjenic. So these are mice that are all similar to one another when when we when take takes discoveries and and bring when you bring discoveries to the human population. uh it it is critical to take into consideration the incredible variation between different people and how they might respond to the same interventions. We know from everything that we studied in medicine that uh I am not the same as you are and and and you are different from your neighbor in in in many biological responses and that includes response to calorie restriction. I suspect that in a number of people it will actually do them harm and number of people it will do them good. We know this when we strain when we test different strains of mice in by calorie restriction. Half of the strains actually responded by a shortening of lifespan. The other half by an increasing lifespan. So we we take calorie restriction for example as a universal modification that will increase lifespan. it in the literature and and I would say the same is going to be even more true for humans. So I think this brings for me brings up the one of the key thing that is lacking in the field of aging is the identification of biomarkers that will allow us to test on an indiv individual basis whether the intervention or the modifications that you in the right direction or in the wrong direction. And I I would caution anyone who long-term in terms of their health to be very careful and how they feel and how because we don of aging. They not validated. It human populations. They mice models and other models. But um that the next few years is really having true biomarkers that allow us to predict whether a given intervention is is beneficial or actually hurtful.	Success

Replenishing falling levels of NAD+ may be a strategy for reducing some symptoms of aging	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bsVUSMxy5g	FoundMyFitness Clips 	something else that really seems to change with fasting is the nad levels yes and that your lab has studied extensively with mr. Timmons is maybe could you talk a little bit about because nad is also extremely exciting to me and it pretty pretty popular these days as well yes so nad is emerged as one of these critical intermediary metabolites think of ketone bodies nad are all I call them currencies I mean so think about your organism as a as a country you need to circulate energy and nad is one way that our body is utilizing within the cell to convert to transfer energy it like the Brinkmann truck carries the money and nad action can actually is a high to so-called hydride acceptor during what we oxidize food you can actually serve as a as an acceptor for electron and it can transfer them for example to your respiratory chain so it circulated within the cell and there growing evidence that it decrease during aging why that happens is still one of the big mysteries and so this has yielded a whole approach that trying to understand first what are the consequences of decrease energy levels and one of the consequence is that enzymes like sirtuins which rely on an ad to exert all of their beneficial activities actually function less well that during aging but also many other enzymes that are involved in our metabolism are relying on nad and so they function as well so you your intermediate metabolizers as well the sirtuins which are global regulators function as well you essentially you know everything becomes a little less yeah a little less efficient so out of this these discoveries came the idea that maybe should replenish the decreasing level of nad and so that this has yielded some discoveries such as nicotinamide ribose ice nicotinamide mono nucleotides which are now being taken by a lot of people and with the hope that it will you know correct some of these problems I one word of caution I think there is we do not know why these levels decrease they could decrease because we have decreased production of nad but it could also decrease because we have accelerated destruction of nad which means if you are if it bringing more into it it pouring more an ad in the leaky sink so I think a lot of our work right now is trying to understand what is the cause of the decrease in an ad during aging and because I think it will yield very different solutions if you find that there filling blood plugging the sink yeah this is keeping pouring water I have a theory yes so I know you know coming from I did a lot of work with DNA damage yes and knowing that one of the main enzymes work exactly I mean if you think about you know so one of the main enzymes that repairs damage as we age DNA damage harp is requires nad and it like if you more damage as you age you have to repair more of that damage and the more and more damage you sucking the nad you know sort of like sort of like almost a triage where it like well you got to keep repairing that damage so then other things like the mitochondria suffer you know so I completely agree and actually that there are two two major theories right now that have been proposed in terms of why doesn activated part and indeed as we age we accumulate DNA damage it it and so the idea is by activating PARP you constantly depletes in your energy levels the second one is we all have in our body a so-called salvage pathway for nad for nad is nad turns over there salvage pathway that allows it to be recycled back to so we can get an ad from the food but also we salvage the one that we utilize them and the salvage pathway has been shown to be to becoming paralyzed while you age there enzyme called an EMP T it has received a lot of attention that enzyme tends to be inhibited by chronic inflammation and and a high-fat diet so one way so it could be a combination of both of these things but it could be other mechanistically we another mechanism which is that they might be accelerated destruction by other enzymes beyond par and getting some exciting results in this direction cool you	Success
Nicotinamide riboside for prevention of hearing loss and the importance of NAD+ for mitochondria	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HBhATHiXQI	FoundMyFitness Clips 	[Rhonda]: In terms of what role it plays,\\nyou know, in the aging process, you know, it seems as though, at least in some of the\\nstudies that I’ve seen, that mitochondrial function really seems to be important and\\nthat you’ve shown that the sirtuin-3 in the mitochondria itself seems to be really\\nimportant for the mitochondrial function, keeping your mitochondria young. Mitochondria play a very important role in\\naging as well. [Dr. Verdin]: A critical role. You know, many of the aging pathways that\\nwe know, be it the unfolded protein response, or mitochondrial biogenesis, all point to\\nefficient mitochondria as one of the key ways to stay young. And one reason is because this is a way so\\nyou can generate energy from glycolysis, which is glucose, carbohydrates, which, as we know,\\nis linked to aging, but also via mitochondria via a process called oxidative phosphorylation,\\nand that process is not necessarily depending on glucose, but is depending on an efficient\\nmitochondrial function. So, we talked about NAD-dependent enzyme. Many of these enzymes reside in the mitochondria. And we found that, for example, the NAD supplementation\\nthat is being tested in a variety of aging model requires sirtuin-3 quite often, this\\nmitochondrial sirtuin, yes. [Rhonda]: Oh, really? Nicotinamide riboside? [Dr. Verdin]: Yes, for example, the paper\\nwe’ve published was focused on the age-associated or noise-induced loss of hearing. So, if you actually subject mice or humans\\nto very acute noise, they have a dose-dependent loss of hearing. You can protect the mice completely from this\\neffect by supplementing with NAD. [Rhonda]: Wow. [Dr. Verdin]: But with nicotinamide riboside,\\nso if you’re going to a rock concert… [Rhonda]: Right, musicians. [Dr. Verdin]: …and you wanna protect yourself,\\nthis is definitely something that… [Rhonda]: Harley-Davidson riders. [Dr. Verdin]: Yes. In mice, it actually had an enormous effect,\\nand we found that this effect was dependent on sirtuin-3, so in sirtuin-3 knockout mice,\\nthe effect was lost. [Rhonda]: Do you know if that was dependent\\non sirtuin-3 in the mitochondria of stem cells, or was it just any cell, or do not know? [Dr. Verdin]: So, in the case of hearing loss,\\nit’s dependent on some really uniquely sensitive cells in the inner ear. But, generally, there’s been sort of an\\nassumption in the field that most of the effect of nicotinamide ribosides, protective effect,\\nare dependent on sirtuin-1. I think in… [Rhonda]: Oh, really? [Dr. Verdin]: Yes. And, in some case, it is. In this particular case, noise-induced hearing\\nloss, it was really clearly sirtuin-3. [Rhonda]: So, even the studies that have looked\\nat, for example, I think there was a mouse, had some sort of mitochondrial disorder, even\\nthat one was dependent on sirtuin-1? [Dr. Verdin]: No, actually it did not. In that case, I think the assumption was that\\nit might be helping global mitochondrial function. And so there’s a growing number of cases\\nand, for example, DNA-damage-associated disease where you see accelerated aging where people\\nhave been testing the effects of supplementation, because those conditions are associated with\\ndecreased PARP activity, just like you mentioned. And, in those cases, I think it hasn’t always\\nbeen clearly mapped what is the real target of NAD that is dependent for the beneficial\\neffect. [Rhonda]: So, NAD levels do decrease with\\nage. Has it been looked at, like, for example,\\nin animals, like in rodents, when they’re fasted, because fasting increases NAD when\\nthey’re fasting and they’re older? Does that help rejuvenate the NAD irrespective\\nof their age? Does it… [Dr. Verdin]: I don’t know. I don’t know the answer to that question. It’s a great question. I think, you know, one thing that I remember\\nalso about fasting and other critical effect of fasting that is really essential in our\\nthinking is autophagy, and so, you know, there’s growing evidence also that autophagy by itself\\nresponds to nutrient availability, so NAD levels, acetyl-CoA levels. This is a new area that people are starting\\nto work in, including my labs, trying to understand what is it about acetyl-CoA, which is another,\\nthink about, currency exchanger in the cells, intermediary metabolite that appears to have\\nnot only a role as a nutrient, but also as a signaling molecule. Acetyl-CoA is in the Krebs cycle. It’s one of the key intermediary product\\nof the Krebs cycle, but it’s also the substrate for a whole family of enzymes called the acetyltransferases,\\nwhich are the opposite of what we were talking about, the HDACs, earlier. So, I think there’s really a lot of crosstalk\\nbetween all of these pathways, and we’re working very actively now on modulation of\\nsignaling the acetyl-CoA and these acetyltransferases. Another approach is to mimic calorie restriction\\nin the fasting stage. [Rhonda]: Yeah. I had Dr. Guido Kroemer on the podcast, and\\nhe has been studying that as well. You know, it brings up a question I remember\\nI wanted to ask you that was sort of, you know, biology is never just black and white,\\nbecause I remember him, with his work, he was talking about how important decreasing\\nprotein acetylation was for activating autophagy, which happens during fasting, but also, during\\nfasting, you have these beta-hydroxybutyrate, which is now…was it class 2 inhibitor? [Dr. Verdin]: Class 1. [Rhonda]: Class 1 inhibitor of the histone\\ndeacetylase, which is kind of the opposite, a little… [Dr. Verdin]: No, because you have to think,\\nso beta-hydroxybutyrate is one step above the sirtuins, and actually the class 1 inhibitors\\nare inhibitors of… [Rhonda]: Oh, they’re inhibitors. That makes sense. [Dr. Verdin]: Exactly. And so it fits perfectly if you go back to\\nthe… [Rhonda]: So class 1 is an inhibitor of histone\\ndeacetylase. That makes sense now. Okay. [Dr. Verdin]: Yes. [Rhonda]: Thank you. There was a disconnect in my brain when I\\nfind to… [Dr. Verdin]: So, the whole idea of… If you think about acetyl-CoA, and we really\\ndraw a graph of acetyl-CoA regulating HATs, histone acetyltransferase, and NAD+ regulating\\nthe sirtuins, and these enzymes quite often stay in opposition, not all of them. But one of the key players in terms of histone\\nacetyltransferase is p300, and that’s the one we’ve worked on and Guido Kroemer as\\nwell has worked on, and it makes sense. You get the same beneficial effects by activating\\nyour sirtuins, which lowers acetylation, as you do by inhibiting an acetyltransferase,\\nwhich also lowers acetylation. So, the message is that nutrient feeding or,\\nyou know, low histone acetyltransferase activity or high sirtuin activity all lead to low protein\\nacetylation, which is beneficial. [Rhonda]: And doing the ketogenic diet? [Dr. Verdin]: Regulates one step above. [Rhonda]: Does also, yeah. [Dr. Verdin]: But, obviously, there’s some\\ncomplexity, because there are some histone marks that are depending on one enzyme. So, this is an oversimplified model, but so\\nfar it holds.	Success
Is the liver stressed by a ketogenic diet? | Eric Verdin	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejyjf0Z35zk	FoundMyFitness Clips 	[Rhonda]: The other question I would have\\nis, you know, there’s a lot of stress on the liver when you’re doing that sort of\\ndiet, right? You’re relying on it for gluconeogenesis\\nto make glucose. You’re oxidizing fat. Has anyone looked at sort of long-term ketogenic\\ndiets? [Dr. Verdin]: Yeah. We did. The liver seemed perfectly fine. Just imagine the liver is really…think about\\nit as sort of an energy redistributor. If it’s not dealing with fat during fasting\\nand transforming fat into ketone bodies, it is dealing with food coming in from the intestine\\nduring feeding. So, it’s always busy in one way or the other. So, I don’t think that there’s anything\\nto be worried about it generating ketosis. I haven’t heard of any side effects linked\\nto, you know, liver function and so on.	Success

This Type of Exercise Reverses 20 Years of Heart Aging, Improves Brain Health, & Fights Cancer	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxAIUH9S5b8	FoundMyFitness Clips 	but I think one of the most convincing studies that I intensity exercise has to do with structural changes in the Aging heart so as we age our heart undergo structural changes it gets smaller in size and it gets stiffer and this translates to functional um you know deficiencies like Exercise capacity goes down but also it increases the risk for cardiovascular disease a lot of different changes to happen in the cardiovascular system when that occurs and so um there was a study done at UT Southwest and Dallas by Ben lavine year-olds that were they were disease-free but they were sedentary right so they didn diabetes or cardiovascular disease but they weren put them on one or two two different exercise protocols one that was the control group which was more like a stretching a little bit of a body weight um training it wasn they weren rate up a little more like yoga is type of workout and the other group did that but they also had a high-intensity like vigorous exercise workout program and this was a two-year intervention um study and so the first six months was like a progressive building up their their their endurance and um once they got to the six-month part U Mark uh most of these people were doing about four to five hours a week of training and a good portion of that time was spent in what called maximal um your maximal state exercise state where they they were doing like 20 to 30 minutes a day of maximal intensity exercise not maximum intensity but um steady state so they were able to basically maintain the maximum amount of intensity they could for 20 or 30 minutes so it was it was vigorous they were going 75 80% Max Max heart rate um they also did the Norwegian 4x4 protocol once a week and after those two years the structural changes in their heart reverted back almost 20 years so this their hearts got like more malleable and they got larger and it was like looking at a 30-year-old heart and these were 50-year olds and so I mean to me it was just so astounding that you could get structual changes in the heart essentially is reversing the Aging Heart by just about 20 years from doing this vigorous intensity exercise protocol in 50-year olds that were sedentary and there blood pressure improvements in um with blood pressure with vigorous intensity exercise so there randomized control trials and meta analyses of these trials that have found people that work out and do more vigorous intensity exercise 3 to four days a week about 20 to 60 Minutes of vigorous intensity exercise can improve their blood pressure similar to medications like anti anti hypertensive medications and blood pressure is not high blood pressure is not just um a risk factor for cardiovascular disease it the most important early risk factors for dementia and Alzheimer the fact that you can comparably get these improvements and blood pressure um like you would get with a pharmaceutical drug is also I think extremely encouraging right so I want to shift gears just for a minute and get into um some of the brain benefits I think probably one of the most convincing reasons to get your heart rate up high when I say High I mean 75 80% max heart rate to do that is from brain benefits and that largely has to do with something called lactate which probably many of you are familiar with so when you force your muscles to work so hard that they they you can them fast enough to make energy they they have to adapt right and they use glucose as energy without the mitochondria which is generally how you byproduct of that you you thought to be this sort of metabolic byproduct um it turns out it than that and so lactate gets into circulation and it tissues including the muscle the brain the heart liver and it in those tissues so it energetically favorable source of energy it lactate than from glucose so it takes less energy to make energy from lactate than glucose but also it acts as a signaling molecule it mus your muscles to communicate with other parts of your body um because you know when you stress on the body and so adaptations happen right when you working your muscles hard you can you know increase muscle hypertrophy um these adaptations happen cardiovascular improvements you stroke volume cardiorespiratory Fitness improvements well the brain also works really hard during exercise and so lactate is communicating with the brain um and there lactate go into the brain and one of those is that it signals to the brain to make something called brain Drive neurotrophic factor or bdnf and what this is is a growth factor that is involved increasing new neurons inside the hippocampus um and other regions in the brain but mostly the hippocampus which is important for learning and memory um and there intervention studies showing that aerobic exercise after you know older adults that do it for 2 years increase their hip cample volume by like 2% so um it increases neurogenesis but it also is important for neuroplasticity um this is this is the way your brain adapts and um is able to adapt to the changing environment and still function it plays a big role in um depression people that are depressed have a very uh low level of neuroplasticity and so they a hard time adapting to the changing environment and that causes depressive symptoms so brain Drive neurotop factor is like amazing for your brain you want more of it and high intensity you know exercise is the way to get more of it it ALS lactate also signals to the brain to make neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and serotonin these Studies have been done in humans um lactate again made from muscles when you when you over the bloodb brain barrier and your brain is working hard during exercise and so lactate is fueling that your brain function during exercise but it also increasing things like norepinephrine which is involved in focus and attention serotonin and there have been studies showing that even 10 minutes of a high-intensity interval training workout can um improve cognition improve mood I mean it really easy to get those improvements in just a short amount of time by like you know just getting after it pretty hard some of the protocols that have shown improvements in U maximizing B bdnf um really are intensity and duration dependent so the harder you go 80% max heart rate for 30 to 40 minutes is one of the most robust ways there also another really good protocol so this would be 6 minutes of high-intensity imal training where you do about 40c allout intervals separated by some recovery periods that also has been shown to pretty robustly increase brand dve neurotropic Factor as well so I just want to spend just a second talking about some of the anti- metastatic effects of a vigorous intensity exercise most of us here know that exercise is one of the best things you can do to prevent cancer but also as an adjunct cancer or treatment many different ways that interesting way that most people don know about is through the shearing forces of your blood just blood flow so just getting that blood flow flow to go faster by exercising by getting that exercise um kills what are called circulating tumor cells um these are these are tumor cells that have escaped a primary site of the tumor get into circulation and they go and you know try to travel to other tissues and take Camp there and you know metastasize well circulating cheer cells are very sensitive to the mechanical forces the shearing forces of blood flow and they can anormal cells can and they die um and so I think that to think about it because it like oh yeah I need to get my blood flow up I need to I need to get my heart rate going and my blood flow up and that is something that has an antimetastatic effect	Success
A single pill that improves cognition AND delays brain aging	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kuO8CeLdbg	FoundMyFitness Clips 	there was very recently a new study um one out of three very large randomized Placebo control trials where they giving one group a placebo and another group a multivitamin okay this is a multivitamin which is the micronutrients I vitamins folate uh vitamin K it stuff people aren they diets and um they gave older adults so these were people that were 65 and older and um there was three different Trials of this study it was called the cosmo trial and there participants in total and the evidence was clear that just giving them a multivitamin improved cognition and it slowed brain aging which was it was estimated to slow brain aging by about two years	Success
This Type of Exercise Reverses Heart Aging, Lowers Blood Pressure, & Has Anti-Cancer Effects	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4Bzos1hTA	FoundMyFitness Clips 	this uh this this study out of um UT Southwest um in in Dallas by Dr Ben LaVine was is really what has convinced me that vigorous exercise is extremely important for for for the heart and the way the heart ages so I mentioned cardiovascular disease I mean that number one killer in developed countries right um so as we age our heart go undergoes certain inevitable changes um it it gets smaller it shrinks it gets stiffer less flexible and this affects a lot of things it affects our cardiovascular disease risk it affects our cardiorespiratory Fitness they have ability for us to do aerobic exercise um and so what Ben did in the study Dr LaVine did in the study was really remarkable he took a a cohort of participants that were 50 years old on average and these were sedentary individuals that were otherwise healthy so they didn of diabetes hypertension Etc they they were quote unquote healthy but they were sedentary and he separated them into two groups so the first group was the control group who did sort of stretching and yoga for two years and then the second group was the exercise intervention group so these are the people that were going to be doing the exercise uh and it ended up being a vigorous exercise protocol but because they were saries started out sort of lower to moderate intensity and by the time it was six months these individuals are doing 5 to six hours a week of aerobic exercise with a large percentage of that time um being in What the the maximal steady state so that what I you and you maintain that for about 20 or 30 minutes so it max heart rate and you about you know 20 to 30 minutes they also did the Norwegian 4x4 protocol once a week and after 2 years they essentially reverse these structural changes in their aging Heart by like 20 years so they were essentially looking more like a 30-year-old heart after that two years of vigorous intensity exercise now like I mentioned they were doing five to six hours a week a vigorous a lot a large portion of it in vigorous vigorous exercise but it you know the structural changes that they found so there was more more than 25% Improvement in the elasticity of the heart after after those two years um particularly in the left ventricular muscle of the heart um of course they did increase their their their V2 Max by about 20 20% as well so um it quite a sounding that you can take a 50-year-old put them on a pretty intense exercise program for two years and essentially reverse a lot of the structural changes that happen you know in in with the heart with the aging process blood pressure improvements are also um you know for people that are willing to put in the effort most of the time and there but they can have drug-sized effects in other words it can be comparable to some drugs that are given to reduce hypertension so there of 24 different randomized controled trials found that six weeks of a pretty you know moderate to vigorous intensity um exercise 20 to 60 Minutes of that 3 to four days a week like had almost drug size effects in reducing blood pressure so you know High hypertension is not only a a risk factor for cardiovascular disease um it important risk factor for dementia and Alzheimer reason to want to not have hypertension and 20% of young people aged you know 18 to 39 have hypertension and then half the you know about half the US population of you know older adults have have hypertension so it um you know thing that um again can be modified to a to quite a bit of an extent with aerobic exercise particularly in vigorous intensity exercise um let about on the molecular level why why I talking about vigorous exercise and and really that 80% max heart rate it has to do with the fact that you are pushing when you push your muscles to work harder than um the oxygen can get to them them to make energy they shift to um from using mitochondria and using oxygen for energy to using glucose through glycolysis and it process that doesn it makes lactate as a byproduct only it about it as a metabolic byproduct but it generated from muscles is um is what it it circulation and it is consumed by the brain it liver also by the muscle it consumed as a a very easily utilizable source of energy but also as a singling molecule as we called the lactate shuttle it was pioneered by Dr George Brooks at um out of UC Berkeley and when I say A sing molecule it directly communicate with other parts of the body like the brain um and so lactate itself has been shown to be responsible for increasing brain derived neurotropic Factor both in the plasma this is in human studies um humans at exercise lactate correlates with the bdnf activation in plasma bdnf can cross over the bloodb brain barrier but also animal studies showing that it directly increases brain derive neurotropic factor in the brain so bdnf is um a very important neurotropic factor it respons responsible for um neuroplasticity so that your your brain your neurons in your brain to adapt to changing environment it process you know as things are you know changing and stuff uh you you want your your your brain to adapt to those changes it depression um people with depression don environment and it is partly responsible for some of the depressive symptoms but a brain Drive neurotropic Factor also is important for neurogenesis the increase of new neurons particularly in some brain regions like the hippocampus which is involved in learning and memory um it neurons survive there have been animal studies that have shown that when you when you induce them to do exercise and they get those learning and memory improvements that have also been found in human studies that if you give them a drug and block brain Drive neurotropic Factor they don memory benefits so really seems as though brain Drive neurotropic factor is important to get those learning and memory benefits from exercise and again lactate is a key signaling molecule that increases brain dve neurotropic Factor lactate is generated from your exercising muscles when you them to work hard this isn on a brisk walk this is really getting your heart rate up sweating getting flush in the face lactate is also a singling molecule to increase neurotransmitters in the brain um this has been shown in both human studies and animal studies so uh it Serotonin so Studies have found that people that exercise produce a lot of lactate this correlates with an increased in serotonin which also correlated with improved impulse control uh serotonin plays an important role in many neurological processes including impulse control so they um um have this inhibitory effect which also plays a role in focus andent and attention uh norepinephrine is another one that exercising really hard our muscles are working harder our heart is working harder but our brain is also working harder and there have been human studies out of I believe it found that the lactate produced during vigorous intensity exercise crosses the blood brain barrier is consumed by the brain and this correlates with a burst of norepinephrine production um which fuels the brain to work harder during exercise it attention and some of those effects that you get after uh you know after you do like a vigorous intensity workout so there have been shown to maximize brain Drive neurotropic factor in humans and some of these have also correlated with lactate levels um it seems as though like the the the best is getting getting the The Best of Both Worlds so you want vigorous intensity about 80% max heart rate but you also want duration so you want to get like 30 to 40 minutes of that is the most robust at increasing brain Drive neurotropic Factor as measured in plasma and people but 20 minutes will also increase it as well just 30 to 40 minutes does it even more um there also some protocols that are more high-intensity interval training so doing six rounds of 40 second intervals where you for 40 seconds followed by a recovery period um also really increases brain Drive neurotrophic factor in fact it increases it four to five times more in people um compared to to individuals that are doing about an hour and a half of more lower intens intensity cycling at about 25% their their BO2 Max Peak I want to just um shift gears for a minute and talk about some of the anti-cancer effects of vigorous intensity exercise um you know independent of the immune system so the immune system exercise activates the immune system there a variety of um you know anti- antimetastatic effects there but um just the mechanical force of blood flow blood flow actually affects what are called circulating tumor cells so circulating tumor cells escape from the primary site of the tumor get into circulation eventually travel to distant sites and then they take residence and establish a new tumor elsewhere so this is metastasis um so circulating toer cells you obviously uh do not want to have them in circulation because they can uh play a role in metastasis well the sheer in forces of blood flow itself can kill these circul circulating tumor cells because on every cell surface we have a mechanical um we have these mechan mechano receptors that respond to movement and cancer cells are all wonky and disrupted and messed up and so they just can die so the um the more intense the exercise the more the greater the blood flow the the higher um proportion of circulating tumor cells that are that are actually um undergo apoptosis and die there at people that undergo about six months of aerobic exercise anywhere between 50 to 70% max heart rate for 150 minutes a week that significantly reduces the circulating tumor cells in people with anywhere between stage one to stage three colon cancer other Studies have found and correlated that circulating tumor cells are linked to a three times higher risk of Cancer recurrence and a four times higher risk of cancer mortality in people with cancer um also stage three colon cancer patients that engage in aerobic exercise have a 40% reduction in Cancer recurrence and a 63% reduction in cancer mortality so exercise is also a very important plays a very important role in in you know cancer metastasis and also in in helping as an adjunct therapy to treating cancer as well	Success

Should You Supplement With Creatine? - Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaynC1xbjfU	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so the next question was submitted by Peter and the Peter asked about creatine um Peter says creatine as a supplement is long touted as a stimulate is stimulating muscle growth is there any evidence for this um so we have a topic page on Creatine it goes into everything and Under the Sun on Creatine so foundy fitness.com toopics they click on C and you will find Creatine please go look at that up if you want to learn um what my team and I have put together on Creatine so how does creatine work it does it does play a really important role in how our muscles produce energy inside of our muscles creatine is transformed into phosphocreatine through the action of a of an enzyme called creatine kisee which by the way requires magnesium to function magnesium to function so phosphocreatine is a key player in the production of ATP this is the primary primary source of energy and most all of our cells particularly during high-intensity short duration exercise or long duration endurance exercise as well um supplementing with creatine can sort of supercharge this whole energy production process it boosts our muscle capacity to produce ATP it enhances energy available particularly under intense you know Anor robic activities um this increase in available energy can lead to improved muscle power uh it can you know help help performance as well um these enhancements can lead to you know even gains in muscle performance and growth so you know creatine has there data out there to to sort of make those statements um additionally creatine has been shown to help speed up with Muscle Recovery post-workout so potentially making it easier to bounce back after really intense training sessions um the international Society for Sports Nutrition regards creatine monohydrate as the most effective erogenic so this is a performance performance-enhancing nutritional supplement on the market for athletes and fitness enthusiasts looking to increase their strength their power muscle mass again go to our topic page because it has all those studies um backing up backing up those statements with respect to dosing um I the Research indicates that creatine monohydrate supplementation a lot of times a lot of these studies were done with a loading phase so they approximately 0.3 gram per kilogram of body weight of creatine taken four s a four or five times a day so that of creatine um and that was able to increase creatine stores in muscle tissue by 20 to 40% with continued supplementation 3 to 5 grams per day required to kind of maintain those elevated levels um you know a lot of the there the 1980s where oral creatine supplementation was routinely used to enhance physical performance I there many studies now showing that you know muscle creatine uptake improves exercise performance while low creatine phosphate levels are related to muscle fatigue particularly during physical activity so in particular there suggesting that these people that are participating in heavy resistance training while supplementing with a total of 20 to 30 grams of creatine per day they can maintain higher intensity training they can increase their fat-free Mass they can increase their endurance strength and um it promotes Muscle Recovery after exercise training as we age we do face the challenge of declining muscle mass bone density strength that aging process or should I say natural sedentary aging process um engaging in resistance training is a way to counteract these you know age related training these age related sedentary related changes so this you know adding the creatine supplementation into that mix particularly for older adults may may increase those benefits even more they may amplify them so there analysis again which pulls together data from a lot of different studies and it is found that combining resistance training with creatine supplementation um does improve strength it improves upper and lower body strength it increases fat-free mass and it enhanced muscular endurance and Bone mineral density there of studies looking at creatines effect on brain function as well that are very interesting I you can find those on our our topic page um on our creatine topic page so make sure you check that out adverse effects misconceptions of creatine there over a thousand studies that have been conducted um using creatine and the really only consistent reported side effect from creatine supplementation has been I I would say um weight gain but not fat Mass so this probably is water gain um but that main I would say in consistent main adverse effect with creatine supplementation there short-term and long-term studies in healthy and also people with diseases ranging from infants all the way to elderly and the doses of creatine R ranging from 0.3 to 0.8 grams per kilogram body weight per day for up to 5 years and they supplementation really has no adverse serious adverse risks and again may even promote a variety of health and performance benefits there in kidney damage or renal function and there support to support a negative effects on Kidney Health with respect to creatine supplementation does creatine cause hair loss and baldness I think that another I would say misconception that that that sort of makes makes its rounds in the in the blogosphere in in people um Minds so that the link between creatine supplementation hair loss originates from this one study it was in in college aged male rugby play rugby players and in the study the participants took 25 grams of creatine a day for a week just one week and um then they did that was their loading phase and then they did five grams a day for two more weeks and after the end of the 3-week trial there was a notable increase in their serum DHT levels their dihydrotestosterone levels so it was a 56% rise uh after their initial week and then a 40% increase from Baseline even after the maintenance period so this outcome was significantly different from the placebo group which consumed glucose instead of creatine so the the the DHT has been increases in DHT has been associated with hair loss in some cases so the concerns about creatine contributing to baldness have come from the study and DHT levels not not any you know indication of actually those participants losing hair or anything like that there have been there have been some subsequent studies exploring creatine to look at a little bit more of a broader perspective so among 12 additional studies that have looked at creatine doses ranging from three all the way to 25 grams a day over periods of 6 days to 12 weeks only two two of those studies out of the 12 observed minor increases in total testosterone that were um that were deemed you know actually they were deemed physiologically uh maybe relevant the majority of them 10 studies found no change at all in testosterone levels and then furthermore um in the studies that measured free testosterone so this is the precursor for the DHT production the dihydro testosterone production there were no increases at all that were detected so I think that that initial study has now sort of been called into question because there have now been a variety of studies that have come out that have shown there evidence to support um you know an increase in the testosterone or the free testosterone or anything that would be um leading to the DHT now why they didn directly who knows um but I I would say right now it does it doesn it and um the quantity of those newer studies and so one one study versus you know these other 12	Success

The INSANE Mitochondria, Glucose, & Heart Benefits of Vigorous Exercise | Dr. Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAZeNEnj_xc	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so as we age the heart undergoes specific inevitable changes right related to the a aging process so it tends to get smaller uh it gets stiffer and this can impact the heart efficiency uh potentially reducing our Exercise capacity elevating our risk for cardiac issues um but there can be exercise interventions like consistent aerobic exercise with a high proportion of it being vigorous intensity that can actually combat some of these effects so there was a landmark study published from Ben lavine intervention study and it showed that two years of vigorous exercise in 50y olds was able to reverse the aging of their hearts by as much as 20 years effectively making their hearts look more like a 30-year-old which in my opinion is simply astonishing you taking a 50-year-old heart and making it look like a 30-year-old heart now now the exercise protocol used in this this particular study uh it was a protocol that that gradually increased the exercise intensity and also frequency so again I mentioned it was a two-year intervention by the end of six the first six months participants were exercising about 5 to six hours a week with a large portion of training being in that maximal steady state um intensity exercise I which I referred to earlier in the podcast it called zone three it is a type of vigorous intensity exercise um they also were incorporating more High higher intensity exercise so they also did the Norwegian 4x4 V2 training V2 Max training protocol I just referred to and they did that once a week and um I just think it astonishing that you know you take these 50 year olds and after two years of a more vigorous intensity exercise exercise um training protocol it essentially reversed the effects of Aging in the heart okay so let gears yet again and talk a little bit about metabolic adaptations and again this is where I think vigorous exercise really shines um particularly high-intensity interval training it improves glucose control insulin sensitivity um more more efficiently and more potently than even continuous you know moderate intensity workouts and uh you know I do think that of course both exercise type you know training protocols can enhance muscle adaptations and glucose regulation um hit really seems to to do it quicker and um again more robustly whereas moderate intensity exercise kind of Demands longer sessions for comparable outcomes so research has found that high-intensity inal training can enhance the muscle up glucose and improved glucose transport capacity so during high-intensity interal training and during vigorous exercise there demand a rapid you know a demand for Rapid energy production and so the body relies both on aerobic so oxygen using and anerobic non oxygen using metabolic pathways to generate this energy the Anor robic pathway can lead to the production of lactate especially when the intensity of exercise surpasses the point at which the oxygen intake can keep up with the energy demand um and and so this is sometimes often referred to as the lactate threshold as we talked about for a long time lactate was considered primarily as a waste product contributing to muscle fatigue and uh you know this has of course been completely reversed Recent research has you know totally changed this understanding um lactate generated in muscle tissue is transported not only back into muscle and into mitochondria to be used as an energy source but it also when it starts to accumulate at higher levels travels systemically into circulation and gets transported to other tissues like the heart the liver the brain where it it so this is known as the lactate shuttle and was pioneered by Dr George Brooks who has really changed the field and um he also happened to be my second podcast guest ever on on this podcast um anyways lactate you know it it it I mentioned it acts as a signaling molecule in those tissues as well and you can think of a signaling molecule as a chemical messenger that is sending a message to other cells one of those messages is the upregulation of gluc glucose transport capacity so vigorous intensity exercise high intensity interval training when when that lactate production accumulates Ates it stimulates the expression and activity of glucose Transporters known on the muscle known as glute 4 and this is on the muscle cell membrane and so that lactate acts as a signaling molecule to increase the transport of glucose Transporters on on the muscle cells and this then allows for more efficient uptake of glucose into the um from the bloodstream into the muscle even at rest and so consequently then in insulin sensitivity is also improved and blood glucose levels are better regulated there demonstrated that hit can improve glucose uptake enhance insulin sensitivity and decrease the risk of developing type 2 diabetes this may be due to the intense metabolic stress created during hit which leads to Greater activation of glucose transport great glucose Transporters um and improve glucose clearance um so as I mentioned both high-intensity Nal training continuous moderate intensity exercise can also be effective at improving glucose transport capacity in the muscles um hit promotes rapid increases in glucose Transporters allowing for that efficient glucose uptake and utilization whereas continuous moderate intensity exercise although it also enhance glucose transport capacity um it improves the overall Fitness of muscles as well so you know again it just a longer duration of exercise time to to get there and um with the with the lactate generation that happens with you know high-intensity high-intensity exercise you signal from lactate to increase the gluc glute for Transporters and so it it that happens there adaptations so um just just kind of talking about mitochondria mitochondria are very important and they play a lot of roles in the body but one of the most important ones is the production of energy in the form of ATP this is obviously very important for muscles but also hugely important for the brain um the heart the liver pretty much every organ athletes are very interested in mitochondrial health because they want their muscles to efficiently and effectively produce energy when they training but mitochondria are also very important in the context of Aging as we age our mitochondria become less efficient at producing energy and this poses a problem for physical activity but also just for normal functioning of our organs now that problem of mitochondria not producing enough energy can actually be overcome by increasing the mitochondrial volume or what called mitochondrial biogenesis and exercise particularly vigorous exercise is one of the best ways to do that so one of the most powerful indicators of healthy mitochondri Andria is the ability to generate new healthy young mitochondria called mitochondrial biogenesis vigorous intensity exercise like high-intensity high-intensity interval training I mentioned um it one of the most powerful stimulators of mitochondrial biogenesis this has to do with the metabolic stress that is induced from vigorous intensity exercise the lactate itself again lactate is a signaling molecule when you greater amounts of lact at that actually activates one of the major Pathways that regulates mitochondrial biogenesis it called pgc1 Alpha and again lactates acting as a signal to produce more of that pgc1 Alpha so when we perform vigorous intensity exercise such as hit that lactates generated from the muscles it because exercise increases the um the number of mitochondria per cell again mitochondrial biogenesis and the more lactate that um energy	Success

Protocols for Increasing VO2 Max (and why zone 2 cardio might not be enough) | Dr. Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYdkMmtjBs	FoundMyFitness Clips 	but I want to start by talking about cardiorespiratory fitness health span and Longevity so V2 Max is a measure of maximal oxygen uptake which reflects an individual during exercise it the best indicators of cardiorespiratory Fitness and it improved healthspan increased lifespan higher cardiorespiratory levels as measured by V2 Max have been consistently leaked to A reduced risk of mortal ity and longer lifespan so in the podcast when I use the term V2 Max just keep in mind that it cardiorespiratory Fitness the greatest longevity benefit that comes from improving your V2 Max is from people starting from a below average V2 Max and moving anywhere above average so even going from a below normal VO2 max for your age group and gender to a low normal is associated with a 2.1y year increase in life expectancy bumping that up going from a below below normal to high normal V2 Max is associated with a 2.9 year increase in life expectancy and going even further to the upper limit of normal is associated with 4.9 years so almost 5ye increase in life expectancy on average each unit increase in BO2 Max so that 1 milliliter per kilogram per minute is this associated with a 45 day increase in life expectancy in another study involving only men for every 10 unit increase in V2 Max so this would be then 10 ms per kilogram per minute there was a 70 177% lower risk of death from cancer and a 11% lower all cause mortality so dying from many different um non-accidental causes of uh death another study publ in Jama in 2018 found that there was no apparent upper limit to the benefit of cardiorespiratory Fitness on mortality within normal ranges of human life expectancy of course um in fact the study reported that Elite performers these are people that performed in the top 2.3% on the fitness test had an 80% reduction in mortality risk compared to the lowest performer so they performed in the bottom 25% on the fitness test and if you compare the elite performers to the high performers so these folks did really well but they were just under the elite they were they were between the top 25% and the top 2.3% the elite performers had a 20% mortality risk decline compared to even those High performers but going back to what I said earlier about just moving out of that low fitness group will give huge advantages to on life expectancy so people in the low fitness group had a fivefold higher risk of death than the the elite performers but what is also so interesting is that the risk of dying due to low Fitness was similar or even bigger than risks associated with having heart disease smoking or diabetes so being fitter is really good for your health at every level of fitness and there the question is well how can we improve our BO2 Max um lots of different training protocols Zone 2 training for example High intensity interval training you know vigorous intensity exercise all improve cardiorespiratory Fitness and can increase V2 Max um hit has been shown to significantly improve E2 Max even with shorter training durations this is because hit recruits both aerobic and Anor robic Energy Systems and increases the intensity of the workout resulting in um greater greater cardiovascular stress and then adaptations um but this is important there are individuals who engage engage in more moderate intensity you know steady state zone 2 training that do not experience significant improvements in V2 Max in fact research has shown that approximately 40% of people do not see a measurable increase in their V2 Max even after engaging in guideline-based moderate intensity exercise which is about 2.5 hours of uh of this type of exercise per week for several months but when these what are called non responders Incorporated more vigorous intensity exercise such as high-intensity interval training they do start to see improvements in BO2 Max so this suggests that adding higher intensity exercise to an exercise routine can help eliminate that non-response and also can lead to Greater benefits in cardiorespiratory Fitness the reason for non-response um to Moder intensity exercise it completely understood but um the addition of vigor vigorous intensity exercise is important for overall improvements in BO2 Max and engaging in more vigorous exercise seems to provide a stronger stimulus for physiological adaptations that lead to increased cardiorespiratory Fitness so again I think these findings do really sort of highlight the importance of incorporating vigorous intensity exercise particularly incorporating maybe uh high-intensity interval training into a training routine and obviously for individuals who are time pressed and can per week to doing a more type zone two type of training including shorter sessions of higher intensity exercise can still have significant improvements in BO2 Max and overall health uh so you might be wondering you know how much time do I dedicate to my more vigorous type of exercise versus a more moderate intensity Zone 2 type of training and I really think that answer depends on a lot of factors your individual goals um what you enjoy doing most what you going to do the most I mean all those things are important because at the end of the day uh establishing a habit having an exercise routine that you going to consistently do is what is most important uh for endurance athletes I mean the answer is easy right you already dedicating several hours a week to doing more zone two training and about 20% of that training is dedicated to to Shorter higher intensity workouts more vigorous intensity workouts and this is commonly known as the 8020 rule but um remember this is this is people that are doing extensive amounts of training anywhere between 10 to 30 hours a week um it misconception to apply that 020 rule to like any committed exerciser and any casual exerciser who are doing well under less than 10 hours a week as you think about um someone who is a committed exerciser maybe you work out 3 to 5 days a week how much of that time should be spent doing vigorous intensity exercise I would say for VO2 max and other adaptations we including the brain um about half of that exercise training time I think should be spent in vigorous doing a vigorous exercise so again you want to be uh 80 at least 80% of your max heart rate or or more uh obviously there resistance training to to incorporate as well into any training program um there work out maybe two to three times a week uh they should probably spend more than half of their time doing more vigorous intensity exercise I think this this ensures you you know making sure that you adaptations Fitness gains in a shorter period of time there are a variety of V2 Max training protocols so for people that are looking for that more vigorous exercise using you know using high-intensity interval training to improve their v2x um the key here is longer intervals so incorporating longer intervals such as 2 three four maybe even 5 minutes at the highest workload you can sustain for that time and then performing four intervals with rest and Recovery in between um each of those so this protocol may require maybe a 20 minute time commitment but it can lead to significant improvements in V2 Max there training um Dr Martin cabala who was a recent podcast guest gave a variety of of examples of this so there minute repeats at the highest sustainable intensity we talked about you doing um those 3 to five minute intervals that you can maintain and then you rest and recover and repeat those intervals uh for for a total of 20 minutes I think uh a popular variation of this is called the Norwegian 4x4 interval training protocol so the intervals are 4 minutes long and you aiming for about 85 to 95% of your max heart rate or the maximum level of intensity you can maintain for the entire 4 minutes um these interval these intervals can be brutal so the recovery period is 3 minutes long and the intensity is significantly lower like light light exercise more like a Zone one training exercise you want to allow yourself recovery time the clearance of lactate you want your heart rate to come down significantly so that you can prepare for the next 4minute interval so these 4minute intervals are repeated um four times and again in between each interval is a 3 minute recovery so that training um there Max training protocol it minute on one minute off protocol this is where you perform one minute of intervals at the highest intensity you can do for 1 minute and then it recovery period and then you repeat this interval pattern 10 um or maybe five times for about 25 minutes or so and this protocol also is effective at improving BO2 Max and it does provide a lot of flexibility in terms of time commitment um it it know grueling in terms of like doing a four-minute interval versus a one minute interval one minute intervals are a little bit um you know less intense and and less painful obviously it important that you know these Protocols are sort of templates they vary a lot based on individual fitness goals um you know there that can improve V2 Max the key is like a longer interval longer than like a Tabata like a 20 second interval and so you know probably about at least 1 minute at the highest sustainable intensity that you can do I think the Norwegian 4x4 protocol is probably one of the best out there um one of the best hit protocols out there for improving V2 Max so how do you measure V2 Max um without equipment found in an exercise physiology uh physiology lab um it obviously challenging there tests that have been developed and verified for getting an an an estimate of your V2 Max so they don measure maximum oxygen uptake but they predict your V2 Max based on the relationship between your exercise and intensity and your oxygen consumption um they whether or not you if you protocol so the there really like I said validated tests that have been validated in scientific literature um that can that can sort of be done probably one of the best ones is the 12 minute run or sometimes called walk test depending on your level of Fitness um it as the Cooper test and and um it involves having the participant run or jog as far as possible in 12 minutes so you you don test should be conducted on a flat surface so like a track field is the best you don stuff because it the the maximum amount of distance you can cover in 12 minutes and if you have Hills and stuff that that it and um you know the distance won quite as far so uh you device something that Rec can record your your distance an Apple Watch or you know Fitbit or something and depending on your Fitness level you can walk or you can run um or a combination so the distance covered within that 12-minute period serves as the primary metric for evaluating BO2 Max which is then estimated using a formula so it distance and meters minus 54.9 and then divided by 44.7 3 and you can look this formula up just look up the Cooper test to find the formulas um online again um you know there some other validated test but I think that better ones out there you device like an Apple Watch uh or some some sort of other device that can measure your distance but there the some of these devices and wearables do estimate V2 Max during exercise using heart rate and your motion data um you know for best results you have to make sure all your personal informations in there like your age and your weight and gender you know all that stuff but that would say the 12 minute run or walk test is a a more it particularly if you something like the 4x4 nor Norwegian um hit protocol to to measure V2 Max improvements you want to see if what you estimated V2 Max	Success

These Are the Best Magnesium Supplements | Rhonda Patrick, Ph.D.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpmEEIAqx8	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so naturally the next question on people supplements where do they fit in what if I don dietary sources can I supplement so let doses so how much is too much the US Institute of medicines food and nutrition board has set the upper safe limit for daily supplemental magnesium intake at 350 milligrams per day so this is the level considered you know that it gastrointestinal issues for most people diarrhea is the first sign of excessive magnesium supplementation it used therapeutically as a laxative but this is a bit of a conservative dose it does not include magnesium from dietary sources so in other words there evidence that going above the RDA for magnesium is harmful in fact some evidence suggest that it may even be beneficial particularly if the Magnesium is mostly coming from dietary sources for optimal bioavailability of magnesium ium supplements it effective to take the total daily dose in divided smaller amounts rather than a single large dose so this approach allows for more efficient absorption by the body it can also minimize the potential GI discomfort so smaller spaced out doses they better by the digestive system and this also ensures maximum absorption utilization of the Magnesium the bioavailability of different magnesium supplements does vary and it standardized in studies clinical research on organic magnesium salts so these include magnesium citrate magnesium glycinate magnesium tarate these indicate um magnesium malate is also in there these organic salt forms of magnesium are generally more bioavailable and effectively raise plasma magnesium levels compared to inorganic forms of magnesium magesium like magnesium oxide magnesium chloride magnesium sulfate so organic magnesium salt are better absorbed in the digestive tract it can lead to more significant increase in magnesium levels in the blood and I think this for this reason it makes them more effective choices for supplementing magnesium and also of course addressing deficiencies but just to eliminate any confusion um the term organic in this context refers to the presence of carbon being in the acid molecule so we standard of being organically grown here it sulfate can be taken orally but and this is an inorganic form but it commonly used as epson salt for a transdermal through the skin applications when it can act as a laxative and it therapeutically as a laxative the effectiveness of epsin salt particularly in baths is unclear we this a little bit later because the transdermal absorption of magn magnesium through epson salt baths really hasn been conclusively proven but let about another form of magnesium called magnesium threonate magnesium 38 is a form of magnesium that has garnered a lot of attention because of its potential impact on brain function so generally only a small portion of the Magnesium ingested in a supplement form reaches the brain and this is due to the intricate active transport systems that control the progression of magnesium from the digestive tract into the bloodstream and then subsequently from the bloodstream um across the bloodb brain barrier the body establishes and manages a very tight concentration gradient it creates a higher magnesium level in the blood compared to the cerebral spinal fluid and that allows a very controlled quantity of magnesium that can actually get transported into the brain this precise regulation is really important to maintaining this equilibrium of magnesium necessary for optimal brain function so in humans it been found that even an increase up to 30 100% in blood magnesium results in less than 19% change in the cerebral spinal fluid magnesium content and I think this really highlights the significant role that physiological processes in maintaining magnesium balance play which then influence the brain health and function so some animal evidence suggest that magnesium 3 andate can easily get across the bloodb brain barrier and at a human equivalent dose of 8.1 mg per kilogram body weight so that would be around 662 mg for a 180 lb person can improve cognition and decrease amalo beta plaques now this is in the brains of mice and it that the Magnesium 3na is uniquely effective in crossing the bloodb brain barrier due to its specific molecular structure so this form of magnesium is chelated to thonic acid and that is a metabolite of vitamin C so this cation enhances its ability to pass through the blood brain barrier or so it um the precise mechanism by which magnesium 3 and8 bypasses this tightly regulated concentration gradient between the blood and the brain is not fully understood it is believed though that its molecular structure does somehow facilitate easier entry into the brain thereby increasing concentration of magnesium in the brain more effectively than other forms of magnesium that is solely based on a very small and limited number of animal studies when we turn to human studies only a couple have explored the effects of magnesium 3 and8 so these studies are I want to point out industry funded which does invite us to consider a potential conflict of interest so the initial study that I I think garnered a lot of attention was published in 2016 it was a small scale study that only had 44 participants total um those in the treatment group took daily doses of about5 100 to 2,000 millgram of magnesium threonate so this is mar marketed as magine and they took it for over 12 weeks based so this was based on their body weight that range in dose the findings of this study I personally think are underwhelming so the treatment group only achieved a marginal increase in plasma magnesium levels with no elevation noted in red blood cell magnesium levels compared to the placebo group additionally there was a significant increase in urinary magnesium which suggests that most of the supplemented Magnesium 3 and8 was actually being excreted through urine there was some cognitive tests that were also done there was no significant difference observed when each of these four different measured cognitive tests were looked at in isolation compared to the placebo group but if the data was all pulled together so all four cognitive tests were then pulled together then there was a a statistically significant difference in cognitive function compared to the placebo group obviously this suggests a degree of statistical uncertainty in the study was just due to a small sample size they said there study perhaps if there were 444 people there would have been more of a stronger signal and the data wouldn have been pulled together or maybe there really isn no telling the second study was also industry funded which I think is important to keep in mind this study was published in 2022 and it involved 100 participants and the treatment group was given 400 milligrams of magnesium 3 Anda along with vitamins c d B6 and phosphole Serene in contrast the placebo group received only 2 grams of a starch capsule so despite the absence of any elevation of serum or brain magnesium levels the treatment group did have improved cognitive test performance compared to the bbo group I would say this study raises pretty significant questions around causations because the treatment group was not just given magnesium 38 they were given a variety of vitamins they were given vitamin C the B vitamins vitamin D B6 but they were also given phosph tidal Serene so I I think to be able to establish a solid conclusion that magnesium 3on is responsible for improving cognitive function the placebo group should have gotten all those other vitamins and the phosph tyal serine but not the Magnesium 3 and8 uh however that was not the way the study was done so in my opinion I think it really no conclusions can be stated directly about magnesium 3 and8 itself so I think a concluding statement with respect to supplemental magnesium um there to enhance bioavailability it advisable to take smaller frequent doses of of magnesium supplements organic magnesium salts like magnesium glycinate or magnesium tarate are generally more readily absorbed than in organic forms like magnesium oxide I also think there organic salts for example taking magnesium glycinate also gives you some accompanying compounds like glycine so glycine could potentially be beneficial at least According to some studies also magnesium Tate would give you tarine which also may have some Health advantages but that another podcast there is some caution that should be taken without you know not wanting to exceed um super super high doses of magnesium so 350 milligrams per day is the the safe upper limit and um that is for either organic or inorganic magnesium supplements if you go above that you may get GI side effects so that mind I would say a really important takeaway from this section is magnesium threonate is not the best option for meeting daily magnesium needs as outlined by the RDA it shouldn included as contributing to your recommended daily allowance of magnesium and that is because magnesium 3 andate contains a very low amount of Elemental magnesium so if you are considering supplementing with magnesium 3 andate for its potential brain health benefits which I would say have not been established do not count that magnesium dose towards your RDA goal so to ensure you you need to to calculate what you getting from your foods but also consider supplementing with other organic magnesium forms like magnesium glycinate which does have a higher amount of Elemental magnesium content as you can tell there are many different forms of magnesium available a natural question is what do I take the answer is I hedge my bets I take a supplement that has many different forms of magnesium salts which seems logical to me there are not many products I have found that offer that one of them is magnesi om by Moon Juice the other one I sometimes take at night is magnesium glycinate by pure encapsulations there are many different brands I either of those but I know many of you want to know what I take so there you have it	Success
Rhonda Patrick Reveals the ONLY 5 Supplements You Actually Need	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIvhWYpLplc	FoundMyFitness Clips 	What do you recommend? And and and does it have to be difficult and ownorous and expensive? Uh h how do you sort of stack the deck so you basic things you need and and not running into this trouble? Yeah, I do have some of the basic things that I think well that I take but also that I think that would help a majority of people that are insufficient in a lot of these micronutrients. And um first and foremost, vitamin D supplement. And again, I think generally speaking, vitamin D, 4,000 IUs a day pretty pretty for the most part gets people to a sufficientish level. You have to do a blood test to really know for certain. You may have to take a little more, you know, but starting at 4,000 IUs a day, which is the upper tolerant is safe. And it National Academy of Sciences saying this is a safe level. Exactly. Number two, omega-3 fatty acids. And you know this is something where um Bill Harris has published studies published studies looking at how do you get someone who is low omega-3 index so 4% omega-3 index up to an 8%. Takes turns out it takes close to about two grams a day. So two grams of of EPA and DHA. So so when you get just for clarification purposes if you get a pill and it fisha it might not have a gram of EPA and DHA. it might be like 300 or 200 milligrams. So, you have to look at the concentration of EPA and DHA in the milligram amounts on the label. Otherwise, you know, might take one pill or it could take five pills. Exactly. Um, so that I think is a pretty simple solution. So, 1 to two grams, 1.5 to two grams, you get get most people that are in a 4% low range to an 8%. And the balance of EP and DHA, does it matter? Is it 50/50? Usually, usually it a 2:1 ratio EPA to DHA. Yeah, for the most part. Something close to that. Okay. But I wouldn stuff. Like number three and number four are kind of tie. But I think I think a multivitamin is a really good insurance because, you know, there you know, boron. Yeah. There know, the the B vitamins, you know, you there and it really covers a lot of the bases. So I think a pretty high quality multivitamin is good along with magnesium. So magnesium because such a large percentage of people are not getting enough magnesium. Magnesium it is so important for a variety of you know processes DNA damage brain function muscle function. You know people that are physically active they sweat out magnesium. So you might need anywhere between 10 to 20% more than the RDA. And stress and coffee also stress and alcohol. Exactly. So you is the American life? Stress, coffee, and alcohol. Exactly. Right. That we it out. Yes. And so you want to make sure you that would be something like magnesium citrate, magnesium malate, magnesium um glycinate, and citrate if you constipated, right? So So those so those are the organic salts which are more bioavailable. I tell a funny story. I just decided I was in the hospital recently for a back surgery and I wanted to get magnesium and I talked to the hospitalist and he gave me magnesium oxide and I bioavailable and I sort of went through this with him and like you did with that. It wasn that but but you know he you no true. I the main nutrient uh form of magnesium that you get in in a lot of the supplements that you buy over the counter because it So, magnesium oxide, if you see that on the label, just skip over it, right? Um so, that would be another one. And then I add to my essentials the sulfurophane. Um I used to sprout and I no longer do that because life is busy. My excuses. Yeah. I world how to eat better and be healthy. It your health. But um I I I I trust the the science that I the supplement that I take which again it and they have about the advanced formula is what I take. I take about two to four a day depending on and we link in the show notes for that. They great and they like published studies on them um improving autism. So it affecting the brain. So it autism um spectrum disorder in kids with autism, adolescence with a autism, but it glutathione, right? So NRF2 pathway. Um so that actually wrote a blog about glutathione years ago. If anybody wants to sort of find out more about glutathione, go to highman and glutathione and you it. And it it detoxifier, the master antioxidant, the master immune regulator. It it some of these plant foods. You get it by sulfur containing amino acids, you know, which are found often in animal foods or in whey protein. It is. Yeah. So, it major antioxidant in in the body. So, um I think those are really some of the the vitamin D, fish oil, vitamin D4,000, fish oil, one or two grams of the actual EPDHA, a multivitamin, and high quality. high quality meaning it shouldn blue or purple or green or yellow and titanium and dyes and should be just you know the right and and the the bioavailability the formula nutrient matters I mean I I think you and I both done a lot of work on this and people can dig around but it like go to get your uh you know Walgreens or CVS multivitamins a little more judicious and then magnesium and how much magnesium um you know it depends so some people get a laxative effect and they want that that citrate um even with even with higher doses of of other forms they can but um yeah so I mean I think it depends on your diet like if you lot of plants shame on you you need to increase that but you know you about three 250 300 milligrams you know is a good is a good range. Now, if you trying to to treat like migraines and stuff, you might have to go higher. Like some studies show like 600 milligrams. And then there magnesium 3N8, that the bloodb brain barrier more effectively um for brain health because magnesium doesn barrier very well. But magnesium 3N8 isn necessarily going to uh do the DNA damage repair aspect of magnesium. So, make sure you doing doing that. Um yeah so like for me I take like 250 milligrams maybe 300 millig	Success

Rhonda Patrick Goes in Depth on the Benefits of Omega-3s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVI8oKmFSnw	FoundMyFitness Clips 	and the same goes for omega-3 you know there one of the most important you know nutrients that um is it even really think about it so omega-3 there acids there find in plant sources so that linolic acid ala and then there iosa OIC acid and then DHA um and those are the two Marine sources that you find in um in fish but also you can find them in micro algae which is more of a plant-based Source there was a study that came out of Harvard I think it was 2009 which identified the Marine sources of Omega-3 as basically one of the top six preventable causes of death uh in other words people are not eating enough seafood and fish and um because of that it was it was calculated that about I think it was something like 84,000 deaths per year were attributed to not getting enough EPA and DHA from the diet and this was really comparable to people that were eating trans fats everybody knows trans fats are bad you walk into any grocery store it on every packaging thing you can see it that trans fets are bad well trans fets were responsible for the same number of deaths as not getting EPA and DHA so it was responsible for 82,000 deaths per year um before I kind of go deeper into that I mean it makes you think about it it wow so the the the same number of deaths were attributable to eating trans fats as not eating enough EPA and DHA from Marine sources you know fish for example and it kind of really makes you think about things because you don a supermarket and nothing says oh this isn EPA and DHA this is processed this you know but yet everything tells you about trans fats and it was you know just as important important to get those you know omega-3 fatty acids from Marine sources um now I say Marine sources because ala which is the the the common um source of Omega-3 found in plants like flax seeds walnuts for example that is actually considered the essential fatty acid because we can convert ala into EPA and DHA and so you know all the government agencies that comes up with these rdas and you know all those standards that are set um basically it goes down to oh well because we can make EPA and DHA from Ala that the one that we focus on the problem with that is that the conversion of ala into EPA and then subsequently DHA um is it widespread genetic differences with respect to that conversion so um people some people are great they have a they have a a alteration in the desaturase gene that does the conversion of ala into EPA and they do it quite well um I would say the majority of people have another version that are not so great at it and to kind of add fuel to the fire having too much of vegetable oils um omega-6 fatty acids I don demonize them so much because like you can get you need linolic acid you need arachidonic acid it membrane it getting them from whole food sources like wal like nuts is great um you know but the vegetable oils are very very concentrated and a lot of cooking if you eat out if you buy processed foods they with vegetable oils that Omega 6 when it enzyme that into EPA and so you may be getting enough ala by the way that problem people aren seed and walnuts they getting enough ala so there layers to this there but that conversion is very inefficient when there of that uh you know I would say the one the one Saving Grace there is that estrogen does dramatically increase that conversion it makes it I mean I mean it this is probably because DHA is so important for brain development and when you when a woman becomes pregnant estrogen skyrockets I mean it times higher than what it normally is it that that nature has figured out a way to at least um convert all that ala is possible into EPA and DHA um anyway so that know there regulation there but on top of that I think the best way you know to get the EPA and DHA is from eating you know a dietary source and um and measuring What omega-3 index is measuring omega-3 fatty acid levels the EPA and DHA and other there red blood cell membranes and it important because most of the time when you go and get a omega-3 blood test uh the the plasma phospho lipids are measured which is better than not nothing but uh you looking more at your dietary intake in the last week or two versus red blood cells which are 120 days before they turn over it your omega-3 kind of like the difference between looking at fasting blood glucose and your hba1c right like fasting blood you could have you could have had you know you for that day and your fasting blood glucose looks great but is that a snapshot of what your daily like blood glucose levels always look like might not be right so um long-term status omega-3 index and there of studies from um Bill Harris Bill Harris uh he Omega omega-3 fatty acid um test I had him on my podcast about a year ago I actually joined the fat acid Research Institute which is a nonprofit Institute studying a variety of um the roles of fatty acids in human health um I joined as a associate researcher and so I brain health uh but but Bill has published a variety of studies looking at omega-3 index and all cause mortality cardiovascular rate related mortality so um I would say when you get the omega-3 index measured um most most people in the United States have an omega-3 index of less than 5% and um what what bill has shown from multiple studies is that people that have an omega-3 index of 8% have a five-year increase life expectancy compared to those that have an omega-3 index of of 4% so 4% versus 8% there you know related to cardiovascular related mortality as well but also a very interesting piece of data um that bill published was looking at smokers and everybody knows smoking is terrible for your health like what do to accelerate the aging process like smoking right smoking um cigarettes tobacco is is just it terrible and um this was so interesting the omega-3 in smokers that had a high omega-3 index so they were smoking but they were also eating a lot of fish supplementing with fish oil they had an 8% omega-3 index they had the same life expectancy as nonsmokers with a low omega-3 index in other words smoking was like being deficient in omega-3 I was just like I was blown away by that like there paper um forgot what Journal was published in it was a couple years ago but I mean it mind-blowing so omega-3 is you there so many different roles that it plays in the body it membranes um plays an important role in in the way Transporters and receptors function because all the those things are embedded in the cell membrane and so you know for example glucose Transporters at the blood brain barrier are altered they functioning well when DHA is deficient and that can cause you know less glucose to get into the brain that obviously leads to many problems uh it the metabolites of EPA and DHA they resolve inflammation in a very efficient and timely manner these are the marison the protectins um you know their their the spms the resolvents these are playing a very important role in inflammation and I think there has been now enough evidence that inflammation chronic low-level inflammation is a driver of the aging process itself in other words not just driving you know increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and dementia cancer which it does but just the process of aging and and so um and so it affecting all those things and you know inflammaging is is a term that which is kind of like it activation of the immune system is accelerating the aging process and it known as inflammaging there inflammate neuroinflammation and there been like these Seven Pillars of Aging where you look at all these like physiological processes that are happening like genomic instability is one you know protein misfolding is another and there neuroinflammation um the only thing that was really overlapping between brain aging and just aging itself was the the inflammation that was the most important thing that was accelerating you know everything in the brain and also aging you know in in the body so um having omega-3 is I think one of the easiest things that someone can do to improve their inflammatory process to improve the structure and function of their transport and receptors and um I know you most excited about um I preview of that I new role of Omega-3 in muscle mass and and also sensitizing amino acids in skeletal muscle um so so so there some work from Chris mcglory um who I had on my podcast just yesterday he he playing a role in disuse atrophy and and through a mechanism where it it know anti-inflammatory effect of Omega-3 it it protein synthesis and um he thinks it actually sensitizing muscle to amino acids through some unknown mechanism they um I research coming out muscle mass obviously is an important factor in aging as well but I do think that you know so so when it comes to omega-3 what do you do I mean obviously you know if you can eat fatty fish that salmon mackerel sardines these are all pretty good sources of Omega-3 that are also low in contaminants like Mercury pcbs um by the way there have been now studies that have come out showing that even though fish have you know these contaminants that the omega-3 fatty acids protect against them and even during pregnancy so there was this big push you know decades ago about pregnant women should avoid eating fish because of the Mercury I think that was a huge mistake huge mistake and I involved in a study looking at um omega-3 index in Cord Blood and uh neuro neurodevelopmental outcomes but um there there know one one I think big one was in 2015 American Journal pediatric published that that basically the omega-3 fatty acids women eating fish the omega-3 fatty acids protected against any neurotoxicity and in fact um you know those children had you know better neural outcomes than women that avoided fish uh there looking at omega-3 like fish intake and um intelligence in um so so fish intake during pregnancy and intelligence um you know one year seven years of life I forgot all the you know the followup times but um it was shown that you know omega-3 was correlated with improved intelligence if the mothers were were eating fish and they were actually using mercury as a biomarker to to basically validate their dietary recall because the the women that were taking in more more omega-3 had higher Mercury and guess what the higher Mercury was correlated with higher intelligence in the children not because Mercury is improving intelligence but because the omega-3 is and the omega-3 you know the Mercury does does doesn you have the omega-3 there it really protecting against any potential toxic effects of mercury so um I know that was a bit of a tangent but it people are kind of scared of eating fish and you know there are some fish that you should be scared of like swordfish which is terribly high in mercury and not so high in omega-3 but things like salmon wild Cod salmon is low in mercury high in omega-3 uh also supplement supplementing is is I think a really important option so um looking at the 4% omega-3 index comparing it to the 8% I mentioned the fiveyear increased life expectancy I think that um there some studies showing that 1.5 to two grams a day supplemental omega-3 can bring people from a 4% omega-3 index to an 8% omega-3 index uh now to keep keep in mind you know the FDA people are prescribed for grams a day of either laesa or vaspa which which is the um purified EPA and and that um you know this is this is a this is a omega-3 the way I like to think of it is it profile of a nutrient but it is pharmacologically active and you know and and so many people are not getting enough of it I think something like 80% globally do not get enough EPA and DHA and like 95 5% of people in the US do not get enough so uh very important in respect to the way we aging um you know I think it for cardiovascular health I think it important for brain health in throughout the lifespan from infancy to old age important so that Spiel on omega-3 I I think it low hanging fruit and important thing that people can can um take in	Success
Why you DON'T need to lift heavy to put on muscle	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_SPct_Yj6M	FoundMyFitness Clips 	do people need to lift heavy well that that question that first two Phillips he showed that years ago um that people he he didn he showed that untrained men um could gain just as much muscle mass and strength uh lifting lighter weights as people as the men gain uh lifting heavy weights as long as they put in the effort so the volume and effort has to be high so you have to like you probably do a longer duration it know more more effort but you can gain as much muscle mass and strength if you you then Brad shenfeld came in after because he was like ah Stu that was that was untrained men come on and he then did it in trained men and lo and behold guess what same data same results so uh the trained men also could gain as much muscle mass and strength by lifting lower doing lower weights as long as the effort that have to put in enough you have to be fatigued	Success
These 3 Things Help Excrete Microplastics, BPA, & Phthalates | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRj30mD-MNw	FoundMyFitness Clips 	okay lastly I want to cover some excretion methods I want to talk about how our bodies handle the influx of microplastics and the chemicals associated with them including BPA BPS phalates and the forever chemicals the pasas so once these chemicals enter the body whether it inhalation or through skin contact they are quickly absorbed and processed primarily by the liver the liver is equipped with a variety of enzymes part of these enzymes are called Phase 2 detoxification enzymes these are enzymes that convert these chemicals into more water soluble forms making them easier for our body to excrete them mostly through urine for example BPA is cleared relatively fast within about 6 hours under normal conditions ballades take a bit longer ranging between 12 to 24 hours depending on the specific compound while that might sound reassuring the problem is we are exposed to these chemicals almost constantly so our bodies are in a near continuous state of processing them but this is where it gets even more complicated so past again these are forever chemicals do not break down easily so unlike BPA or phalates the past have a halflife of 2 to 5 years meaning they accumulate in our organs like the liver and the kidneys and their persistence in the body makes them much harder harder to eliminate they stick around and they build up over time then there microplastics do vary in size larger particles could pass through the gut and be excreted in feces but the smaller nanoplastics these are the really really tiny particles these are crossing biological barriers and they the bloodstream once they get into circulation systemically we don fully understand how or if they excreted efficiently what we do know is that they are accumulating in our organs in our tissues and this is a growing concern when we talk about long-term Health implications so how do we help our bodies clear out chemicals like BPA BPS and phalates more efficiently one promising strategy revolves around tapping into our body detoxification systems and we can do that through dietary and lifestyle interventions one compound that really stands out here is sulfur F you probably heard me talk about this before it broccoli sprouts and other cruciferous vegetables sulfurane activates a key pathway called Nrf2 think of Nrf2 as a master regulator of detoxification it controls the production of enzymes that helps our body clear out many many toxins it boosts The Phase 2 detoxification enzymes these are enzymes that bind to harmful chemicals and make them more water soluble so we can excrete them through our urine animal Studies have shown that when rodents are exposed to BPA and given sulfurane their Phase 2 detoxification enzymes go into overdrive and they experience less overall BPA related toxicity now while there lot of direct evidence on sulfurane ability to clear BPA and phalates specifically I think the mechanism here is very solid and we do have compelling human data in other areas for instance studies show that sulfurane can increase the excretion of toxins like Benzene and acryline which we get exposed through through air pollution and food by up to 60% so in my view incorporating sulfurane rich foods into our diet like broccoli Sprouts which contain up to a 100 times more sulfurane than mature broccoli or considering a highquality supplement of stabilized sulfurane or its precursor glucoraphenin could be a viable strategy for helping detoxify BPA BPS and phalates and by doing so we do Boost our body Pathways that has been shown in human studies that could help us more effectively eliminate some of these microplastic Associated chemicals another Avenue Worth exploring is the role of dietary fiber in helping our bodies eliminate chemicals associated with plastics and perhaps even even some microplastics themselves consuming fiber rich foods can bind to lipophilic chemicals like BPA and phalates in the GI tract and reduce their absorption into the bloodstream promoting their excretion via feces so feces is another way our bodies detoxify BPA phalates and even microplastics some animal studies support this mechanism indicating that higher fiber intake leads to increased fecal extre of these compounds but what about microplastics themselves while research is still emerging here I think there fiber could Aid in the excretion of some larger microplastics so since microplastics can be trapped within the gut Lumen a fiber rich diet could potentially help encapsulate these particles and facilitate their removal through regular bowel movements essentially fiber might help sweep the gut clean and reduce the residence time of microplastic therefore limiting their chances of causing harm and getting into the bloodstream this means incorporating foods that are high in fiber like legumes fruits vegetables whole grains could serve a dual purpose not only do they provide essential nutrients and micronutrients and phytochemicals and fermentable fiber that supports overall health and gut health but they also could enhance the elimination of both harmful chemicals and microplastic particles let powerful tool for eliminating some of these microplastic Associated chemicals physical activity and practices that induce sweating so exercise things like sauna hot tubs even Hot Yoga sweat it not just about cooling down the body it chemicals and compounds from the body so sweat does can trace Trace Amounts of BPA and phalate metabolites Now While most of these chemicals are excreted through urine Studies have shown that sweat can help too one study published in the Journal of environmental and public health found measurable levels of phalates in sweat of participants I think this tells us that regular sweating whether through exercise or sauna or hot yoga can be a viable root for excreting some of these harmful substances so while the amounts of BPA and BPS and phalates that are excreted in sweat are smaller compared to urine I think consistent sweating could really still play a meaningful role in lightening the toxic burden load on our body and lastly I do want to make one last mention that these excretion strategies that we are less effective for the forever chemicals the past because of their resistance to metabolic breakdown because their Half-Life in the body is 2 to five years so really the best way to avoid past is to avoid the exposure in the first place and reducing our exposure to Plastics does Remain the most effective way to reducing our burden of past chemicals so this means avoiding plastic chemicals avoiding mineral Waters with high concentrations of past and really just trying hard to reduce our use of plastics	Success

Coffee and amino acids effect on fasting | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4_8AMztCJQ	FoundMyFitness Clips 	the first question from John Phillips is can you discuss in further detail why you recommend a water only fast versus consuming coffee or amino acids while in a fasted State I my morning workouts with amino acids or a caffeine boost and want to know what benefits I am potentially missing out on versus the benefits I likely still receive so coffee amino acids yeah there but the coffee question as you mentioned is something that certainly it quite frequently and to sort of address that question I think people mostly are asking it in the context of a type of fasting called time restricted eating time restricted eating it has a fasting component to it but it also has a circadian biology component to it and people Michael what is circadian biology and really you know just sort of think about the fact that you know you awake during certain time so you awake in the morning you know early in the morning your body produces a stress hormone called cortisol wakes you up you do all your activities and then as the day progresses and nighttime comes on you get sleepy you making melatonin it helps you with you know getting tired and then you go to sleep and things sort of shut down right so there sort of this rhythm this through kadian rhythm that it you know circadian rhythm so it turns out you know every cell in our body has one of those and including you know pathways like metabolism so it important to make sure that you consuming food when you know the metabolic pathways are active you know you don active and so a lot of this work has been done by dr. Sachin Panda at the Salk Institute and some of his colleagues you know they what activates metabolism is you know basically when you take in your first food you you activate those metabolic pathways and then there a certain amount of time and then as the day goes on they become less active for example if you look at men who eat the same meal early in the morn and they eat the same meal later in the evening same calories same macro nutrient content everything they insulin sensitive in the morning and they evening fatty acid metabolism is the same way so you may think well maybe I well it turns out your fatty acids and being able to use those as energy with you know as energy is also on a circadian clock and they active in the evening as well so with that said where does coffee come into place you know coffee if you you with cream you know obviously cream is got calories and fat and and and that you know something that would be considered you know food right cream if you coffee without you know any any more espresso like a shot of espresso exactly or espresso something without any calories essentially right then the question becomes does that count as you know starting your clocks and you know there has addressed that question a couple of my thoughts are for one we do know that caffeine itself changes the circadian clocks so if you you know give someone a cup of coffee later later in the day it actually shifts the body clock that natural rhythm by like 40 minutes so coffee itself is changing the circadian clock it essentially yeah it exactly right and additionally you know caffeine is metabolized by the gut it also metabolized by the liver so the question is does that you know activating that those metabolic pathways does that start your clocks we don really know if it what we do know is that you know there have been some studies for example a study done by dr. Ruth Patterson at UCSD she looked at time restricted eating in women that had previously had breast cancer women that that ate all of their food within 11 hours and they fasted for 13 hours during that 13 hours they were allowed to consume caffeine so so black coffee or tea without cream and even though they consumed the coffee during their fasting period they still had a 36% reduction in breast cancer recurrence so they had positive benefits along the same lines there pilot studies in people with type 2 diabetes where they restricted eating for anywhere between a six to eight hour window so what they eating within a shorter window and they hours a day they consume caffeine or tea and they had positive effects on blood glucose regulation insulin sensitivity weight loss you know so clearly there evidence in the scientific literature that if you consume black coffee within that fasting window there still positive effects happening so if I can paraphrase while coffee or caffeine may slightly interrupt the circadian window the metabolic benefits from black coffee or tea without additives are maintained it seems as though you know at least according to these studies that you know it metabolic benefits okay however the question becomes if you were not to consume that would you have a more robust effect we don study on this because this is like one of the most common questions we get but right I guess the early directional research is and for a lot of people coffee including myself coffee is crucial okay for right now and and we learn more about the detail level of what what also think that if you just you know like I mentioned time restricted eating this is something that you this is you an eight to you know twelve hour time window and you 16 or and or up to you know 12 to 16 hours right there fasting which we can talk about you know where you right different modalities at fasting yeah and in that in that case research has also shown if you coffee or tea without any calories that there about the amino acid aspect right that a great question as well and this this sort of touches on another you know aspect of the of the fasting literature and that is you know there are there are many benefits that occur during a fast and there are many types of fasting and you when you some of the things that are occurring are your your you Pat you are typically like a grow pathway for example and it grow grow pathway mTOR is another grow grow pathway both of those pathways are activated by amino acids and so if you acid intake along with your calorie intake and everything else you deactivate those pathways and the deactivation is down igf-1 will go down and torpor go down and those are essential for the activation of some of the benefits of fasting including a process called etaf adji which is basically when your your cells start to recycle and interestingly they seem to recycle damaged components of themselves so like mitochondria which are you know they cell damaged mitochondria can be cleared away so spring cleaning is the process of autologous right body you know pieces of protein dead sellout things are just in there it gets rid of them but mTOR has to be you know deactivated igf-1 has to be deactivate for that to happen you know so and then there other things as well like which what we can talk about when we get into more of a prolonged type of those things also need to be activity so amino acids would be something that would sort of negate that interrupt that natural reduction of igf-1 which may interfere with some ontology right got it you	Success

These Are the 7 Best Ways to Reduce Inflammation - Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq-RQ9iq8fI	FoundMyFitness Clips 	all right so the top voed question was in your opinion what are the top five ways diets supplements that you can do to reduce inflammation and um I think that you can address this question by thinking about things that you can cut out of your your diet or your lifestyle or things that you can add and so um I address both of those in most cases probably counter to what a lot of people talk about people always talk about cutting out cutting out cutting out and I think there with not getting the right things and I think by there when you actually start to get the right things you naturally cut things out right so because there everything right um but one of the the top cutting out things would be the most intuitive and obvious and you probably all know the answer and that is cutting out refin sugar but I highlight that point um the people people that are healthy um so not overweight not no sedentary these are just about 29 healthy normal healthy young men were given 20 ounces of a sugar sweetened beverage to drink so like a like a Coke right for 3 weeks and the men experienced 60 to 100% increase in a biomarker of inflammation called sea reactive protein many of you have heard of it CRP C reactive protein is probably one of the most standard biomarkers of inflammation that increase after 3 weeks that is enormous um you know higher than normal C reactor protein levels are associated with you know long-term disease risk cardiovascular disease risk cancer disease risk Alzheimer to like play a role in depression so we Behavior so there every reason to not take in added sugar when you know like you know you got to live once in a while right but like that it to have family members do you know is cut out the refined sugar it also um in that study the healthy young men had a pretty big jump in their small dense LDL particle number which as we about many times in this Q&A the small dense LDL particles are really the most atherogenic so they playing the biggest role in causing atherosclerosis and increasing cardiovascular disease risk in general so um they didn saturated fat to do it either all they had to do was drink a bunch of soda right I mean so it really makes you uh think about how terrible drinking sugar sweetened beverages are and it in um I would say in uh in the United States at least the next obvious uh to me a pretty obvious lifestyle Factor would be adding a relatively robust dose of omega-3 fatty acids you know so the questions about inflammation you know chronic low-grade inflammation is it promotes many of the Hallmarks of aging and it you know there called inflaming and inflaming is um you know it immune system being activated because of a pathogen right it activation of the immune system like I said sugar sweetened beverages is doing it and there we our environment that are also leading to chronic inflammation and so the res resolution of that inflammation is really where omega-3 shines and so um for example there something called specialized Pro resolving mediators SPM for short and the there families ofms that have been identified so there protectins and the marins and these spms basically um are resolving inflammation through a variety of different mechanisms it they can have on lowering the overall inflammatory burden even when you want your immune system to be active when you want your immune system to be hyperactive and um you know that that that your body is posed with a threat your immune system responds but often times the innate immune system so this is the part of the immune system that making antibodies um it different what are called cyto and these cyto are signaling to other immune cells to come and um you know engulf and and basically get rid of pathogens whether that you know the there damage with that and so this the specialized you know the specialized uh Pro resolving mediators the spms are just so important for resolving that inflammation and so there was actually a clinical trial that um with healthy people where omega-3 fatty acid supplementation for basically 24 hours after 24 hours of supplementation um there was a huge boost in these spms in people and 2 4 6 24 hours later like I mean it was like it was pretty pretty robust and so what you is that biomarkers of resolving inflammation are are really um they occurring even just 2 hours after s after taking omega-3 and they for up to 24 hours so there longtail effect um there clinical studies that have shown omega-3 supplementation can lower biomarkers of inflammation but also can lower um biomarkers of disease risk right um cardiovascular disease risk being being a big one I mean it people with cardiovascular risk factors like high triglycerides for example so I think that major point of loow hanging fruit things that can be easily done to mitigate inflammation and um it know the there there showing that low omega-3 intake is responsible for you know almost as many deaths a year as eating trans fats actually was more a little bit more than that you know so basically just not getting enough omega-3 is causing a lot of problems and that talking about there and then there your diet and it away obviously refined sugar is a big one and and but but the the not getting the important stuff is also a big one so I would say um two anywhere two to four grams of Omega-3 seems to be a real good sweet spot um probably I tend to be more on the high end and sometimes I go from four to six grams but I viously not telling you to do that I just telling you that think that we start to have an exponential increase in data coming from omega-3 and people are going to start it really show that that literally taking a a pretty quality omega-3 supplement is is a is a loow hanging fruit for basically improving the way we age by keeping inflammation in track and inflammation is a major plays a major role in accelerating aging so um I see people in the chat like Colleen asking about what about Omega 6 overload and and this is a question that is often asked is you know what about the omega-3 to Omega 6 um ratio and you know you see a lot of people especially in like the anti-plant communities focusing on that because it it sort of is a uh subtle way of basically uh proving their hypothesis that that you know plants are bad because you can get omega-6 from plants and it at all that um that that that the problem is not getting the omega-3 and when you take the omega-3 um the Omega 6 really doesn you actually need quite a bit of Omega 6 Omega 6 plays a huge role in your uh all your cell membranes and the fluidity of them um not getting any Omega 6 is actually bad so I don that as much I think like what can you do uh you can avoid vegetable oils and and why do I say that because like heating the omega-6 is really where it becomes an issue getting omega-6 from nuts or Whole Foods um is like there just no evidence that that issue I mean obviously there that have allergies and stuff but like there don concern so the next obvious I would say out of my top I I have here would be exercise big big big one and um this has a lot to do with the hormetic effect and hormesis you know and this will kind of bleed into the next factor that I think also is really important for for lowering inflammation but you know exercise causes the release of pro-inflammatory cyto kindes like is six and what your body does to respond to that is it has a massive release of an anti-inflammatory cyto called Isle 10 now Isle six is you you know I just talked about like inflammation and there have chronically elevated levels of il6 and you anti-inflammatory response to that because it chronic inflammation it it that you get from something like exercise where your body is responding to that um with an anti-inflammatory response it inflammation and um and so is six it it cyto kind because it can be good it can be bad right it can be good if you talking about Isle six being elevated in response to exercise or in response to sauna because sauna does the same thing H but but it aisle six that exercise and sauna both have been shown to come with a counter response of aisle 10 which is anti-inflammatory and the counter response is even greater so you anti-inflammatory effect right so exercise is one of the the big ways that people can modulate their inflammatory burden uh and and then kind of to just transition to the next factor that would also be heat stress from the sauna or a hot bath or a steam shower or you know doing things like Bick Room yoga yoga routinely um again the aisle six and Isle 10 same effect with the with the sauna it it you know we sauna mimicking you know moderate cardiovascular exercise in many ways and so that does it but there showing that c reactive protein as we talked about you know elevated Ser reactive protein is associated with the development of Asos sclerosis arterial you know like arterial um compliance problems arterial compliance means the ability of your arteries to expand and contract with changing pressure and you want your arteries to be able to do that if your arteries can that can lead to uh a stroke um it can lead to all sorts of problems and so um C Rector protein is associated you know High elevated C Rector protein is associated with loss of your arteries being able to do that and there there reduces blood levels of caor protein um there um over you know that the one of the big um Finland studies where there was more than 2,000 people um sauna bathing basically lowered C or was associated with lower C reative protein in a dose dependent manner so the more frequent the sauna use the lower the C reactor protein um Isle 10 also very potent anti-inflammatory there small study involving just 22 healthy male athletes and non-athletes and they received uh two 15 minute sauna sessions at about um it was hot it was like 208 degrees Fahrenheit and this was separated by so the two 15 minute sessions at 208 degrees were separated by a 5 minute cooling period and after that their Isle 10 levels like really dramatically increased um there proteins increasing as well but you you get the point sauna also is way to lower the inflammatory burden and I think that there cardiovascular health for um for brain health um as we later I also think for bone health for for skin and joint health as well through um collagen synthesis with you know with the increases in growth hormone so um so we have cutting out refined sugar we have adding omega-3 exercise sauna and then another one I think is important is urane sulfurane is something that is found in broccoli Sprouts um for people that are that are on more of a budget it the the cheapest and most economical way to get sulfurane is to grow your own Sprouts uh you can go for the store-bought ones um you know in a pinch but you know the the the risk is twofold one they may be on the Shelf too long and there may be bacterial contamination at that point and two is that they the Shelf too long and uh the urane level is just not as concentrated as it would be if you were to eat the Sprouts right after growing them um when the sulfurane is much High much higher so um sulfurane has been shown so there animal studies showing that it can basically inhibit the activation of a powerful inflammatory pathway called nfca B uh but but also it affects other um there humans that healthy people that took about 14 gram of cruciferous vegetables per kilogram body weight per day uh they decrease their their circulating levels of is6 by 20% so again it it it chronic associated with that chronic low-grade inflammation um 20% is a pretty that um it but it cruciferous vegetables these people were eating um there showed that a broccoli sprout powder extract containing about I would say close to anywhere between 30 to 40 migs of sulfurane um that you were actually eating fresh broccoli Sprouts you could eat about 100 grams of the sprouts and and get about 40 migs of sulfurane so um that study showed that tnf Alpha which is a very powerful cyto kind involved in aging and cardiovascular disease all sorts of problems Alzheimer that inflammatory marker by 11% um it lowered C Rector protein by 16% uh and and so that that then there humans showing that basically the top 20% of people that basically the top 20% of consumers of cruciferous vegetables again cruciferous vegetables broccoli cauliflower cabbage um you know collared greens these are these are vegetables that contain sulfurane so the top 20% of consumers of those types of vegetables had on average lower a 25% lower is 6 and 133% lower tnf Alpha compared to the bottom 20% consumers of cruciferous vegetables so um I do think that that consuming the cruciferous vegetables and you know through broccoli sprout would be the best way um ringa powder could be another way to do it and then there also supplements and there there about what I think about different types of sulfurane supplements um that I get to but um so that other one time restricted eating is another one so time restricted eating um there was a study showing that after 12 months of time restricted eating body mass and fat Mass were lower compared to people that had a normal diet but inflammatory biomarkers so is 6 Isle 1 beta tnf Alpha which I just mentioned um were significantly lower and improved after doing Tim restricted eating for 12 months so like a full year um there improved LDL was lowered HDL um went up fasting glucose was approved so there a lot of different biomarkers that were improved uh Tim restricted eating really there think I think the main the main and easiest way to think about it is basically you like minimum 3 hours before you go to bed and um that usually ends up being like eating all your food probably within like a 10-hour window um some people do eight hours as well but like basically you have you want to have a period of rest a period of your body has to not be digesting in order to go into repair mode and if you if you going to um have that you know repair mode then you basically I mean if you have that um not digesting mode you basically not going to go into repair and that you need to you need to be uh repairing you know all sorts of damage that accumulating throughout the day okay and then I would say the last um Factor again I have a little bit more than five let sugar high omega-3 exercise sauna sulfurane so I have seven TR um and and the other one that could Al does also affect inflammation I would say this would be my my lower like like do the others before this um but cold exposure also does reduce inflammation and the reason I say the others is because because um of all the other health benefits associated with doing Tim restricted eating and sauna and sulfurane uh omega-3 it just inflammation right like there there beneficial things going on with these with with these uh various lifestyle factors and supplements but um cold exposure is another one a lot easier to do now when it probably will be getting in my um cold plch today it Southern California uh norepinephrine which is one of the major most repeatable most robust responses to cold exposure actually reduces inflammation I don that but um you know depending on the temperature of the water and the duration that you in it like you can have up to a fivefold increase in circulating norpine levels so they can really go up and really just 20 seconds at like 50° Fahrenheit can boost norepinephrine twofold so you don right I mean you know obviously you can start to build up some adaptation so the the more and I myself so for example when I plunge I absolutely it I can stay in there longer um you know but when I the minute I stop doing it for even like a couple of weeks it it it I have to start from the beginning like adapting again so um part of the adaptation has to do with you know you of mitochondria and your atap tissue this is called Browning your fat and um so you you know the more mitochondria you have in your adapost tissue the more the easier it is to generate energy and heat as a byproduct so you kind of feel warmer and so it kind of tolerate the cold um so norepinephrine does inhibit tnf Alpha so it inflammation but it also decreases other sort of nasty chemicals that are immune cells are secreting like macras inflammatory protein 1 Alpha and so you know like when you um inflammatory protein I just mentioned plays a major role in arthritis and people that have arthri arthritic pain that why there looking at Cold exposure from you know you know the the the cold water immersion and also from cryotherapy and how it seems to help people with arthritis because it likely affecting the macras inflammatory protein one I haven directly measure that I connecting the dots I norepinephrine is known to be increased by both doing cryotherapy and doing cold water immersion and norepinephrine is known to lower macras protein or inflammatory protein one alpha but no one tested in people with arthritis doing Cal exposure and then measure their their actual levels which that would be a good study to do but it just hasn been done so so those are my top seven um I know you asked for five but I I think that um those are those are those are the top ones that I would uh that I think are the biggest bang for your buck and also have other health benefits as well it um so that my list	Success

COVID-19 spike protein vs. vaccine spike protein: key differences | Dr. Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEZ8QSAiFp0	FoundMyFitness Clips 	Patrick, this next question We know that the spike protein can\\nbe dangerous and cause a significant immune response, and there spike protein is dangerous from the\\nSARS-CoV-2 virus, therefore, the COVID-19 vaccines must be as dangerous as well. What are your thoughts on that? [Dr. Patrick] : Well, I have a lot\\nof thoughts on that, Kyle. I But sort of before I get into some of the\\ndetails, I think, the spike protein has really become a common household name. At this point, most people around\\nthe world know what the spike protein is mostly because it virus to get into our cells. There are about 26\\ndifferent spike proteins. I shouldn There are about 26 spike proteins that\\nline the surface of a SARS-CoV-2 viral particle, and these spike proteins\\nwill bind to a receptor on many different cell types we have in our\\nbody that have a receptor called ACE2. And when the spike protein then binds\\nto the ACE2 receptor, it undergoes a conformational change that essentially\\nrefers to the structure of it changes. So it binds on to this receptor, and\\nit then elongates, and sort of twists and turns around, and then it fuses\\nwith the cell membrane and is, you know, engulfed inside of the cell. Another way it happens\\nis through endocytosis. But essentially, the point I want\\nto make here is that conformational change happens because when the spike\\nprotein initially binds to the ACE2 receptor, it You can think of it more like\\na closed type of conformation. Once it binds, this triggers\\na conformational change for it to, again, like I said, elongate\\nand sort of twist around. When it does that, that is referred\\nto as the post-fusion conformation. And the reason that available in the United States under\\neither emergency use authorization or under FDA authorization or up and coming\\nvaccines, so that includes the Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccines,\\nthe Johnson & Johnson adenoviral vaccine, as well as the Novavax vaccine, they\\nall contain an insertion of two proline amino acids into the spike protein to\\nlock it into the pre-fusion conformation. And this was brilliant work done\\nby the structural biologist, Dr. Jason McLellan. He And he thankfully had figured out\\nthis way to lock viral proteins into the pre-fusion conformation. First it was with the respiratory\\nsyncytial virus, RSV, and then later, he had figured out for the other beta\\ncoronavirus, the MERS coronavirus. And so he really had\\na running start there. And the reason that is so important is\\nbecause, when you protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as I\\nmentioned, there viral particle, to the spike protein that\\nis in the vaccines, including the mRNA vaccines and the vaccines in the United\\nStates, it It It does not elongate and, you know, dig\\ninto the cell membrane and fuse with it. It acids that were inserted to lock it\\ninto the pre-fusion conformation. And one of the first things you learn as a\\nscientist, as a budding young scientist is that you can You can You have to compare apples to\\napples or oranges to oranges. And so when you structurally, it You can the surface of SARS-CoV-2 and say\\neverything that that spike protein is doing applies to the spike protein in\\nthe vaccines that are available in the United States because it And so, I think, that And the burden of proof is on, you\\nknow, people making the claim that the spike protein from the mRNA vaccines\\nis dangerous because some studies have shown that the spike protein from the\\nSARS-CoV-2 by itself can be dangerous. You have to show that,\\nand it has not been shown. So, what these studies that have shown\\nthat the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 virus, how it can be dangerous, there means cells in culture in a dish. When you dump spike protein on them, it\\ncan cause the activation of cell signaling pathways that could lead to cell death. This is often referred to as cytotoxicity. There which is just basically made in a lab,\\nso they make the spike protein, or what called pseudovirus expressing the spike\\nprotein, so this is not the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but it sort of acts like a virus\\nto allow it to get into cells, if you directly inject the pseudovirus with\\na spike protein into the trachea of hamsters, it causes severe lung damage\\nand also gets into the circulation and causes circulatory damage and\\nvascular damage to the vascular system. And so these studies, and there really spurred this idea that the\\nspike protein from the vaccines must be dangerous because these studies\\nshowing the spike protein that found on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 is. And again, you can You can aspect of, you know, this story. The other aspect has to do with where\\nthe spike protein goes in the body. And, you know, I think, first and\\nforemost, anyone that about these studies showing that the\\nspike protein by itself is dangerous should be terrified about getting\\nSARS-CoV-2 because, for one, you getting, as I mentioned, 26 of those\\nspike proteins on one viral particle. How many viral particles are replicating\\ninside of your cells at any given moment? You know, thousands of them. And on top of that, there have been\\nstudies that have shown that SARS-CoV-2 virus is detected in multiple organs. You know, this isn lungs, which in and of itself is bad. I mean, the damage to your lungs\\nis, you know, one major concern. But the SARS-CoV-2 virus, again,\\nwith spike protein has been detected in the heart in humans. It It It It It It Oh, and it So, again, you know, the concern\\nshould be amplified for actually contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus if you\\nare concerned about the study showing spike protein itself is dangerous.

Why Skipping Breakfast Is No Longer A Good Idea (latest research)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qannV7XrTmY	FoundMyFitness Clips 	Talk to me about timerestricted feeding because for a long time that was like the hot new goal in school and everyone loved it and it was really interesting but it seems like the trend is swaying at least a little bit away from timerestricted feeding especially on a morning. So what conceptualize all of this now? Um, so timerestricted feeding or timerestricted eating, you know, it it intermittent fasting, right? And I think that many people when they think about intermittent fasting, they think, okay, well, I just need to skip a meal. I need to like have a period of I need to extend my period of time where I eating. And the easiest way to do that is skip a meal. Um, and that what happened. So, you know, Dr. Sachin Panda, good friend of mine, big, you know, circadian biologist, researcher, does a lot of research on time restrictive feeding. And um, you know, we talked about this like almost 10 years ago. Essentially, there reason to eat your food within a certain time window and then have a period of rest and fasting, right? So everything on our body runs on a clock and including our metabolism and um you know so so we most insulin sensitive in the morning least sensits insulin sensitive in the evening right so you know your blood glucose levels will go much higher with the same carbohydrate intake in the evening versus the morning even you know just calories are same everything is the same there made by you just need a period of rest like your gut digestion all that like energy is being diverted to do that when you that lot of responses that happen after you eat a meal causing inflammation and things like that that divert energy there. So, it other things like repair. So, so repairing processes usually happen when you when you down, right? Like your brain, if you didn repair. It you need that rest period. Well, the same goes for like other organs like it need they need a rest period and and so it period, right? So the longer the rest it the longer the rest period is the better in terms of like having enough energy to like do those repair processes. Things like that require energy and there also you know other reasons as well. But generally speaking um there argument why it period, a fasting period, right? And is that does it need to be 16 hours? Does it need to be 20? Does it need to be 12? Like I don know the exact time um to that. But what we do know is that talking about this to the public was translated to I need to skip breakfast. That was like the take-home was okay, I need to do a 16-hour I need to do eat my food within 8 hours and do a 16 hour fast. And the way I skip breakfast and keep extend my fat. Lunch at 12, have dinner at 8, graze between then and that was hands off. Exactly. And that was that was kind of the the take-home the practical implication there that everyone started doing. Um the problem with that is that you know so our muscle is the biggest reservoir for amino acids just like you know we store glucose as glycogen in our liver and our muscle. We store um triglyceride as you know you know we fat as triglycerides in our atapost tissue. We don don can kind of think of the muscle as a reservoir for it because when we have a period of um basically we an intake of amino acids. We need it. We need amino acids to survive. Like we need them and so our body pulls from our muscle. So in the morning if you think about it what go without having amino acids? as well. It is actually really important. It important to get protein amino acids in that first meal because if you extend that me if you extend that fasting period by skipping breakfast, your body is going to be like, I need protein. I need I got to make a bunch of proteins to like have my heartbeat and my kidneys function, right? So, it amino acids out of your muscle and so um that can cause muscle atrophy particularly if you resistance training. So amino acid is one way to stimulate muscle protein synthesis. Um the other way to do it would be resistance training. So there have been studies done like for example women that are doing timerestricted feeding, they will not lose muscle mass if they does it mitigate the gains of resistance training by doing that? It mitigates the the atrophy. So it it mitigating sorry does timerestricted feeding i.e. skipping breakfast limit the gains made from resistance training if both of those things are done together. Not not if you enough protein I mean not in that study at least. I think I think if you getting enough protein within 24-hour period yes but like if you so the to get your gains in and I you but like the RDA for protein is 0.8 8 gram per kilogram body weight. And that was like determined like forever ago when we were using older techniques. We as in scientists, not me because I haven but um the scientific community was using techniques that uh underestimated amino acid losses. So, so these committees were set up to determine, okay, how many how much amino acids do, you know, how what quantity of amino acids do we lose every day and how much do we make sure we have to get each day to replenish that, right? Um, and so those losses were underestimated. In other words, we thought. And so, what what does that mean? That means, oh, maybe the RDA for protein is too low. So, people like Dr. Dr. Steuart Phillips and others have now redone these experiments with like newer, more sensitive technologies because that right? We get better technologies, more sensitivity, and they that it just bare minimum prevent losses. Another 50% on top of what was originally 50% on what originally. And if you physically active, if you resistance training, that goes up to 1.6 grams for the minimum. And well, 1.2 22 is the minimum, but like to like build muscle to get the gains you about. And there done in older adults. This is a big problem. Older adults are they sensitive to amino acids. It anabolic resistance. So with the same protein intake, they won muscle if they were 35. So granddad needs to be cooking twice as many steaks. He needs twice as many steaks. And there looking at the actual RDA if older adults get 0.8 8 g per kilogram body weight. And then the other group gets 1.2 g per kilogram body weight. The group that got 1.2 has much higher muscle mass gains. Y and and just actually prevents the atrophy that is is happening just with age. Okay. So getting back to the timerestricted Yes. eating thing. Yes. How should someone incorporate this into their lifestyle? What it sounds like you meal at some point early in the day. Uh but if you important for us to have a period of rest and digest so that it rest and repair can actually happen. How should people think about about doing that? Especially given the fact that sorry later in the day insulin sensitivity is uh skewed. Anyone that did carb night, a carb backloading 15 years ago because they read a bodybuilding.com forum like me knows that. So, you it the day. There way, but there breakfast. So, it sounds like eating all day to me. When do we when do we stop, right? Um, yeah, sorry, I went off on a tangent there, but yes. So, um, the the the timerestricted eating, okay, there there about it. You want to stop eating about 3 hours before you go to bed if possible. Okay. That in mouth. Yes. Yes. Because it you got to add another five. So last bit bit of food in mouth doesn now in a fasted state. You got to calculate five hours after that. It takes about five hours to digest. Okay. So after the five hours after your last bit of food in the mouth, now you a fasted state, right? So that to be when you Um, you don can eat your food within an 8 hour period and fast for 16 hours without having to skip a meal most of the time unless I guess unless you entertainer and your meals do come later then. But still you can still like everything you sensitive later in the day but you can like do some air squats for two minutes. It there are things you can do to improve insulin sensitivity and also to improve glucose blood glucose levels like later in the evening if you and we can talk more about that later but anyway so there are things you can do I think that the way to think about it is the easy way is to to stop eating about 3 hours before bed that easy and also your sleep improves because you you eat like right before you go to bed your body right it energy it happening physi ologically just the sense of being full. So, I was a club promoter for 15 years, which meant that we would work from we at 9:00 p.m. and we the morning and I food that I day before morning would be there waiting for me. Oh, well, you know, I haven something like that. Okay, so I in, I having a lot of food in you, like even that sucks, right? Uh and you know the other thing is with with the thinking about it I think um a lot of people got all like you know in a tizzy over over the fact that like if you looked at the the time restricted feeding and the weight loss a lot of the weight loss was due to caloric restriction because people were just actually eating less. they were skipping meals and it yeah so a lot of weight loss I mean when it comes to weight loss like calories in calories out matter like energy balance right so that where a lot of people were like oh timerestricted eating doesn because it restriction and it you looking at are you trying to lose weight then yeah caloric restriction like you should be not eating that however you want right and most people that are like obese even overweight they can actually they can actually fast and not lose as much muscle. Like some people will go on a fast or do you know limit their they can lose like up to 30% of their weight will come from muscle. So that unless you do resistance training. Resistance training is which will mitigate that which will presumably only if you outside of that intermittent fasting window. Not necessarily. Um that will help you gain more but like mitigating the atrophy because you got the stimulus. You got the stimulus. Okay. What would you suggest as a good selection of breakfasts that people could have that kind of meet the criteria that you What would be some eggs, right? Eggs would be like like four, depending on your body weight, you know, some if you going to have like five eggs. Scrambled eggs are great. You got the protein and eggs are really high and they have like luteine and choline in them. I mean, choline is important for brain function. Um, luteine is much higher in greens like kale, but there some in at least pasture-raised eggs farm the the farm, you know, the non conventional eggs or whatever they called. Those are terrible. Um, but what is there just to interject that? What is there to know about eggs? How do you select your eggs? Pasture-raised. Um, because you want them to eat like grass and stuff, the chickens, because they get they the greens, and luteine is really important for brain function and eye function. I would love to talk about that more when we talk about cognitive function because it actually there like a lot there an egg to substitute what clinical studies but there is in kale. So u but still it of it. So I think I think eggs is a really good source of um protein for breakfast because it just it choline as well. Choline in egg yolk. Bacon and eggs. Steak and eggs. Yeah. I mean like whatever your your jam is like for the for the protein. bacon and eggs, sit steak and eggs, you know.	Success

What type of fasting is best? | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqO9XZ8E4M	FoundMyFitness Clips 	you talked a little bit about time restricted feeding next question I think we Reyes the question is has there been any evidence suggesting one method of fasting is is more beneficial than than others right I think that good question raagh it sort of gives me a chance to describe some of the different types of fasting which I kind of touched on already but you know you here you here in like popular culture or you hear everyone say intermittent fasting right and intermittent fasting becomes this like blanket term for all things fast like Valter Longo like doesn right it Volk Valter Longo from USC who is a really an expert he research on fasting he has mentioned how you know intermittent fasting can be considered in humans fasting up to about you know 24 hours and then prolonged fasting happens when you get into like the 48-hour mark so two days or longer and then of course there a intermittent fasting component to it but it also has that circadian biology component to it you want to eat within the time when your metabolism is optimal and when you obviously fasting and and so you know people end up doing up to 16 hour fasting periods so if they within an 8 hour window they for 16 hours Network locally is called sixteen eight sixteen eight yeah exactly right so that so that would also be time restricted eating that something that you I had already mentioned with the time restricted eating you know there get you get the benefits of the fasting part so you of the benefits you know with that are things like you do start to have repair possible processes that are activated in order to repair damage whether it damage to your DNA or you know damage to proteins or just damage like I mentioned mitochondria are just pieces of you know dead cells floating around that stuff is is cleared away and repaired during a fasting state so you get that with the inter minute fasting and time restricted eating which has a fasting component in addition the time restrict you have the the benefits and this has been shown by dr. sergeant panda Ruth Patterson others that you within your your circadian biology in terms of when your metabolism is this most optimal so you don know for example if you if you eat your first you know bite of food at 8 a.m. in the morning and then you dinner at 8:30 or 9:00 you you past 12 hours or metabolism at 8:30 or 9:00 isn and what may end up happening is you not going to be as insulin sensitive so your blood glucose levels are going to be higher your fasting blood glucose is gonna be higher your fatty acid metabolism sounds good so you start to store fatty acids and adipose tissue rather than using them as energy so you fat mass which just has all sorts of problems in addition to that you may also your body because you have been going it when you eat that food in the evening you may be resetting the clock and your body thinks it start time of metabolism so the whole time you metabolism is at its best then you wake up in the morning and it misaligned so everything is misaligned in terms your metabolism so that that means that you higher blood glucose levels your your fatty acids are gonna be more likely to be stored in adipose tissue rather than used as energy so that misalignment so that eating or time should be feeding as it called with animal studies and then as you mentioned dr. Bob ultra-long was research he does a lot of research on what typically 48 hours or longer again as you get into that you may want to do that under medical supervision now he has done a lot of research and animals showing that you know if you do a prolonged fast not only do you have this etaf EG start to act to activate which we talked about as the fast becomes more prolonged you actually start to get the clearing away of cells damaged cells seems to be preferentially damaged cells that are cleared away and in the process of that happening you actually activate stem cells and sort of replenish those damaged cells with new the young sells he animals where literally during the fasting period organs will shrink and then during the refeeding period which we regrow so you damaged cells mostly it seems and then you new young cells and they that he has some preliminary evidence in humans where it seems as though looking at various markers of like stem cell activation for example that does seem to be happening but he studies where they in much more detail so you know that benefit of the prolonged fasting which you don right because you need to really have a stronger stress you have to have your igf-1 levels really dip down that takes time I think they which you know we won into but it day but that so are you really looking at kind of five days to get most of those benefits you discuss it that that mimicking diet right which was developed by dr. Valter Longo and it specific has a very specific macronutrient content so a specific amount of fat and protein and carbohydrates yeah and a total calorie cap so you know I think that like the first day it and then the second the fifth day you doing getting a little bit a little over 700 calories a day and he has shown again he same benefits with the organ shrinking and then regrowing yeah and then he sent some clinical studies in humans showing a variety of metabolic benefits you getting you know of course improved glucose levels insulin sensitivity he shows igf-1 does go down and and and you know cholesterol like there benefits with your cholesterol metabolism and things like that right so so that fasting where it prolonged fast that you mentioned where you getting the etaf AG and the stem cell production over a multiple day fast except in his case bringing low calories into the equation ostensibly to probably make it just easier for people to stick with and then a water only found definitely seems like it stick with or at least try out you know in animals he has shown that you do get a lot of the same benefits as a water fast but you have to remember you know animals have a much faster metabolism human right in fact if you want if you fast a mouse a rodent for 48 hours they lose 20% of their body weight well a human loses may be tough I can tell you from experience that doesn question then becomes well you know how much of the organ shrinking regrowing you get with just a fasting mimicking for five days versus you know actually not eating or you know so though there lots of little nuances that aren figured out yet yeah but certainly there are benefits and he to wrap up the question it sounds like you know the question is as a fastened type more beneficial than other it sounds like it instruments different tools for different outcomes and you know maybe combining some of these modalities may be doing you know timers sugar feeding circadian more regularly and then periodically for to kind of get those cleansing benefits metabolic cleansing you do maybe a longer one if again if your doctor says it cleared for it could that be a good sort of sequencing for people yeah and I think that think I should probably also mention another benefit that comes from the in both interment fasting and certainly a prolonged fasting is your body shifts from glucose metabolism metabolism carbohydrates to fatty acid metabolism ketones and you just put it yet there you get the production of ketone bodies like beta hydroxy butyrate which is in and of itself been shown by people like dr. Eric Verdun to be anti aging in a sense where there it shown activate genetic pathways in the body that are known to delay age-related diseases that are known to help increase repair processes it reduce damage that mitochondria which are you know basically what energy inside of your cells but that whole process of generating energy we known as known as metabolism generates a lot of you know very harmful reactive byproducts and beta-hydroxybutyrate lowers that so it kind of makes your mitochondria more efficient got it that for intermittent fasting and certainly the prolonged resting cool you	Success

Stop Walking 10,000 Steps/Day (do this instead)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GauqFwNOtmo	FoundMyFitness Clips 	Part of me was worried like if you training too hard, does that make you die younger? You know, it you you going for 20 years for that elite level, but I guess you your body too for performance. Your body is I that that is true. But if you again look at studies that are published looking at generally like you know average population of like there Olympian athlete study and then there like are the there athlete study that looks at multiple different Olympic athletes from around the world. Um and then just looking at some of the studies uh looking at people that have an elite level of cardiorespiratory fitness, right? So that would be your ability to take in oxygen during maximal exercise is measured by V2 max. Um there showing that people that are in the elite level. So, these aren athletes. Like, they 2.3% of V2 max have an 80% reduction in all cause mortality compared to people at the low end, like the the people with low uh V2 max. 80%. And what mind-blowing is that first of all, the elite people, so people that are like, again, these are the athletes, if you compare them to people that are like me, like high, I have a high B2 max for my age. I elite. Like they still had a 20% lower all-c cause mortality than So it seems like there going up. Um but the people with the low V2 max, those people had a mortality that was comparable or worse to people that were smokers, had hypertension, diabetes. I know it sedentary, like not being physically active, is a disease. It is a disease. I I think it should be talked about as being a disease because it has the same mortality risk as people that are not I mean people that have diseases that we identify as disease, right? Like hypertension. What do you what do you consider as uh sedentary? What type what is a sedentary lifestyle? Good question. Um typically I mean it what I about is the context of studies. And so typically what would be defined as a sedentary lifestyle is someone that has no leisure time physical activity. So they don soccer or basketball or baseball or any type of leisure type of you know hockey whatever fill in the blank. Kickball kickball, handball. Exactly. Yeah. So um or you know they don they don themselves as taking time to engage in some type of physical exercise. They get up, they go to take a shower, they walk to get food, whatever, but they go to their school or they go to their office, but that that would be considered sedentary. There thousand steps a day, 2,000 steps a day maybe. What is that like? Yeah. I mean, it depends on if you know maybe they are walking if they walk their dog more, they mean, I think that nothing. It like a speed walk. It people walking their dogs are not doing brisk walks. Yeah. Or stopping. Yeah. Yeah. So, um probably I would say that that scientists actually ask them, do you walk your dog? If that I don that might be considered sedentary. I would I would call it sedentary, right? Because it intense activity, right? And I do think I think that 10,000 steps should be replaced with like the 10 minute of like vigorous exercise like more like a day. What do you need a day? 10 minutes of vigorous exercise. That Not 10,000 steps. Not 10,000 steps. Really? Yes. Because it comes down to like you can walk slow, right? And it also takes, you know, how long it takes? Takes a long time. Takes like hours. Yeah. Like an hour and a half or something. like it I just told you that, you know, 10 body weight squats every every 45 minutes for an 8 hour, you know, work week is better at glucose regulation than 30-minute walk. Wow. Right. So, I I do think that um the the 10 10,000 steps a day should be replaced with 10 minutes of vigorous exercise. I personally feel that way. But like the sedentary aspect, you know, we There was a classic study that was um Ben, Dr. Dr. Ben Lavine, he was on my podcast. Um, he in how the heart adapts to stress, whether it whatever. He in the exercise physiology world. And his mentors had done a study when he was a young boy where they took these like 10 guys and measured, you know, their cardiorespiratory fitness and a variety of cardiovascular end points and and then um they put them under bed rest for 3 weeks. So you being sedentary at the extreme level of being sedentary. We guys were in bed for 3 weeks using it. They used a catheter to go to the bathroom like Yeah. Yeah. No, there was that would drive me nuts. No, it totally would. But these there people that volunteered to do this. They must have got paid a lot of money for that. I don I I agree with you. Three weeks. Three weeks. Couldn bathroom. Get up to go to the bath. This is the extreme. They wanted to really understand what full sedentaryism what happened. Oh, so their cardiorespiratory fitness was just it went it was just shot to the ground. I mean, it was terrible after 3 weeks. But here real kicker. So, so Ben Lebin was a young boy when this was done. This was done by his mentors. Okay, you know, fast forward 30 years. Okay, they found these same 10 guys. They found these same 10 guys. Okay, now here this is Ben study. Gets these They get these same guys and they measure what 30 years because they have all their data from before the bed rest, right? They measure what 30 years of aging does on their cardiovascular system. And do you want to know what is insane? 30 years of aging was not worse than what three weeks of bed rest did. Oh my gosh, that weeks of bed rest in terms of their cardiorespiratory fitness, which I personally think is one of the best markers for longevity that we can measure.	Success
The Crazy Brain Benefits of Vigorous Exercise | Dr. Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bncxtea5L94	FoundMyFitness Clips 	exercise intensity like high-intensity interval training has been shown to have unique benefits for brain health um obviously all types of exercise are beneficial for the brain but high-intensity exercise may have additional neuroprotective and cognitive benefits and one of the mechanisms that know the the unique effects of you know vigorous intensity exercise or hit on the brain because of the lactate production so during high-intensity exercise lactate is produced in large amounts as we byproduct of the metabolic stress you you threshold and when you produce lactate it cross the bloodb brain barrier there are lactate Transporters MCT Transporters on the bloodb brain barrier and it can you know cross the blood brain barrier and get into the brain where it then acts as a signal and it triggers a variety of beneficial adaptations so um let about some of those first you know lactate can be used by neurons as a preferential energy source so it actually energetically favorable it takes less energy for mitochondria to to mitochondria to use lactate versus glucose so um in fact neurons are are used to using at because asites in the brain which are a supporting cell for neurons they means they energy they and they byproduct so asites are turning out tons of lactate in the brain and that lactate is be being taken up you know by neurons through the the MCT Transporters and used as energy so um there even been studyed is showing that the brain is working harder during exercise much like the muscles are working harder your heart been shown that lactate actually fuels the brain during exercise so that that lactate that being transferred into circulation is being just soaked up by the brain and it during exercise now another benefit of of neurons in the brain using lactate as an energy source instead of glucose is it spares glucose it glucose to be used by another biochemical pathway um known as the pentos phosphate pathway and this pathway uses glucose to make precursors called nadph that of one of the most powerful antioxidant systems in the brain called glutathione so the less glucose is being taken up by neurons to be used as energy the more it can be spared to be used in this pentos phosphate Pathway to make glutathione and this has really important relevance not only for just you know normal brain aging right I mean if you lactate as energy and spare glucose and make more glutathione in the brain generally speaking that more beneficial for just normal brain aging but it has special relevance also for traumatic brain injury TBI because because you know that when there you know bolus of damage that been been done that that traumatic um brain injury then glutathione is needed the most but you know glucose for neurons as well um and so and and it awful because you know asites which are usually making glct tap for the neurons also become damaged during a TBI and so there um and there showing that a infusion um PE when there get infused with sodium lactate this actually improves TBI outcomes and this is you know measured by the the glass cow scores so um you know generally speaking I think that this glucose sparing effect also you know there some evidence again obviously direct evidence with TBI outcomes that shown to have you know improvements in TBI TBI outcomes I mechanism here with glucose sparing um with respect to the with respect to lactate um lactate again also stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis animal Studies have shown this in the brain and neurons as well um we don evidence of that but um there reason to think that wouldn conserved mechanism so I think you know we covered the importance of brain lactate energetically speaking it energetically favorable right neuron neurons preferentially they prefer to use it um we talked about the glucose sparing but let signaling molecule aspect as we talked about earlier in the muscles we talked about it increasing glute for Transporters um it molecule in the brain um you know it it for the muscles to communicate with the brain directly and um when neurons in the brain are using more lactate they they neurotrans mters they release more norepinephrine for example so to help the brain working better to to have more focus and attention um it also signals to the brain to make more brain Drive neurotrophic factor bdnf and I mean this is a very powerful neurotrophic Factor it promotes the survival the growth and the function of neurons it plays a crucial role in neuroplasticity so this is the the ability of the brain to to adapt form new connections higher levels of bdnf have been linked to improve cognitive function enhanced memory protection against neurod degenerative diseases like Alzheimer to put this in a sensational words uh to explain it bdnf is the youth Elixir for the brain and exercising muscles produce lactate to help you bathe your brain in it so um that simplistic and more Sensational way of thinking about it but essentially that what increasing bdnf in the brain um lactate is also a messenger not only in the brain but at the bloodb brain barrier um you know this is made up of tiny blood vessels we covered this in a podcast with Dr Axel Montaine so lactate signals to increase another growth factor at the blood brain barrier called veg F and um this is vascular ular endothelial growth factor this helps grow new tiny uh vessels it called This is called angiogenesis the growth of new tiny blood vessels it helps them grow at the bloodb brain barrier it also helps repair damaged blood vessels I mean these are these are these are things that are you know important for preventing the breakdown of the bloodb brain barrier so essentially VF is increasing the vascular density and breakdown of the blood brain barrier is a major cause of blood of brain aging um it neuroinflammation it contributes to the Vicious Cycle of neuroinflammation and there emerging evidence that now suggests breakdown of the bloodb brain barrier is one of the earliest signs of dementia so again um another reason why vigorous intensity exercise through that just generation of a lot of lactate then getting to the brain get into the blood brain barrier has unique benefits on overall brain health uh it this is you know there there are benefits to high-intensity exercise on the brain that are not just exclusive to lactate right so there flow uh there cardiovascular fitness the release of neurotransmitters the release of endorphins you know all all of these things contribute to the positive effects of physical activity on the brain but vigorous intensity exercise I do think has some unique and very robust effects on brain health because of that lactate and so I really wanted to kind of dive deep into that so that you guys understand that you know your muscles are being pushed to work extra hard and this is then now causing adaptations in the brain that are pretty substantial	Success
Eating THIS Stiffens Your Heart and Inflames Your Brain	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW8BffeRf6E	FoundMyFitness Clips 	lots of people that listen to the podcast will probably have a good indication of well where weight at and I probably go to the gym and I do all the rest of the stuff what else is happening how else can I motivate myself to pick the healthier option even if I know that my waistline isn determining factor for this I obesity isn so what is it that could be happening so I think it break it apart like that I guess another area that I is brain health and energy levels when it comes to the impact of the ultra processed foods the added sugar stuff like that and that biggest areas that it it also has an impact on you know so if you added sugar then you know you can have higher than you can basically be on the high end of the normal range for blood glucose levels so you normal range but on the higher end right so you think oh I don I there are studies showing that people on the high end of the normal range have increased atrophy in the hippocampus part of their brain that learning and memory and they have higher atrophy in the amydala part of their brain that regulation compared to people on the lower end have you know blood glucose levels in the lower end of the normal range so that right um there forgetful right um but but again it Association study there studies showing that higher blood glucose levels are associated with increased like 54% Risk um increased risk for vascular dementia so so glucose what it constant intake of glucose and that glucose let you that glucose get get disposed into your muscle which is really where you want it right you want it to go get taken up into your muscle exercise really helps with that so when you exercise you cause a lot of glucose Transporters to come up to your muscle which opens up the gates to allow glucose in you want it to go to your muscle instead of your adapost tissue if that doesn not exercising enough the glucose will stay around in your bloodstream and what happens is yes there response and all that metabolic stuff but there that that and it lipids it reacts with um DNA a in your body it reacts with proteins and damages them and when it reacts with proteins like for example collagen lining your your pericardium surrounding your heart your myocardium surrounding your heart lining your blood vessels it causes the collagen to become stiff it changes the properties of the protein it makes them stiff kind of like trans fats actually that think about that but it the similar thing it causes your blood vessels to become stiff it causes your um the the tissue surrounding your heart to become stiff and that plays a major role in the stiffening of the heart with age which affects you know it affects cardiovascular disease risk right um so you accumulation of these this this mailer reaction what happens is it it forms something called Advanced glycation end products and that stiffening the proteins like collagen which are around forever you don your collagen surrounding your heart and it to make get stiffer right so um that something to consider as well as the fact that um it it is affecting cognition and the Brain as well so we talked about brain aging it causes inflammation so for example I mentioned the the study of of men that consumed the the sort of 20 ounce sugar sweetened beverage and they had 100% increase in their inflammatory markers after 3 weeks well inflammation essentially is is those molecules are getting into the brain crossing over the bloodb brain barrier and they was thought for a long time that inflammatory molecules don bloodb brain barrier but that years ago was debunked we now know a lot of cyto kindes and inflammatory things are crossing the blood brain barrier and when they get into the brain they are doing a variety of things for one they we know that for a fact we know causally you can take a healthy person and inject them with lipopolysaccharide which is something that it membrane so we have a lot of bacteria in our gut makes up our microbiome when you have leaky gut intestinal permeability lipopolysaccharide gets into your circulation refined sugar does do that um you can inject normal PE normal healthy people with lipopolysaccharide or placeo which is saline and it causes massive inflammation okay like like what I just talked about with the sugar sweetened beverage and those people then end up getting depressive symptoms so it plays a role in Co their their mood but if you blunt that inflammatory response with something like um EPA which is a component of Omega-3 it omega-3 fatty acids it doesn depressive mood so inflammation does affect mood we also know that when you have a high inflammatory state which I just gave a lot of evidence for in terms of added sugar um it changes the metabolism of tryptophan tryptophan is an essential amino acid we get from our diet it precursor for serotonin serotonin is a neurotransmitter that cognition executive function it involved in mood what inflammation does is it causes tryptophan instead of being converted into serotonin it causes it to be converted into something called curine which is involved in inflammation it is going oh I pathogen okay there actually just added sugar too much added sugar right constantly um and and so your body thinks it it can to activate immune cells to take care of the pathogen right but the problem is is that it so curine um helps with that whole activating the immune system but also what it does is as it can form something called quinolinic acid which is a neurotoxin and it depression so you inflammation now affecting you know key metabolic processes that are important for cognition executive function mood and dampening those process right so you an effect on cognition I mean you you get like a quick sugar high but but boy does that go away pretty quick right I mean it feel like that sort of yeah if you wanted to reliably make your mental performance bad having a dut and a a Coke an hour before you were supposed to do something important is probably a pretty good way to do it exactly it almost like when you feel right feel foggy brain foggy because your your inflammation your immune system is activated	Success

Are Eggs Actually Bad for You? - Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R_YgnoBrGQ	FoundMyFitness Clips 	okay so there were two egg related questions one from Lisa one from Stephanie and they both have to do with you know are at the end of the day like is is it bad to consume eggs every day how many eggs can you consume every day people like Dr Michael Gregor are saying that eating eggs every day are um are negative for your health have negative effects on your health so so really the the the question is is you know are eggs bad for you and I have addressed eggs in several different q&as if you want to go back to Q&A number 37 Q&A number 25 are both different q&as I um a study that Michael Gregor had cited and it was this and we talk about this study um it replacing 3% of egg protein with plant protein so the original study was developed at the National Cancer Institute to improve our understanding of the relationship between diet and health and um you know eggs eggs is eggs as part of that diet and so it was a very large P perspective study that looked at data from over 400,000 individuals and they were followed for 16 years the data extensive was extensively adjusted for a variety of confounders so physical activity vitamin supplement use energy intake intakes of a variety of saturated fatty acids mono unsat saturated fatty acids polyunsaturated F fatty acids and trans fats fiber vegetables fruits lots of things like that and so these but these were food frequency questionnaire so these were people just filling out questionnaires based on um all those questions so what this study found was that plant protein intake was significantly and inversely associated with mortality from all causes so there was a significant reduction in all cause mortality so this was there was a 12% and 14% reduction in all cause mortality for every 10 gram increase in uh plant protein powder or plant protein replacement I guess and this was in both men and women in contrast animal protein intake was not significantly associated with mortality in either men or women but when they when researchers went on to look more specifically at that data the animal protein data and what called a sensitivity analysis researchers examined what happened if people then substitut substituted 3% of that energy from um animal protein with plant protein instead and they did find that when people did substitute that protein there was a 20% 21% and 24% reduction in all cause mortality in women and men respectively and then there was a smaller but significant reduction when plant protein was substituted for red meat and dairy products but not when it was substituted for white meat so it seemed as though uh the substitution W with plant protein and the effects on reducing all cause mortality were only when it was for red meat and dairy products now there couple of ways of interpreting this study so on the one hand you could look at this and say a very extreme view animal proteins are always a health risk compared to plant proteins and you should avoid them completely on the other hand you have to realize this is observational data there lots and lots and lots and lots of problems with observational data right um you know I think on the one hand you look at this data and you go oh well they didn look at different types of meat like the processed meat which we do know is bad and processed meat is typically red meat and so maybe some of the reason why substituting the red meat with the 3% plant protein was because they were now not eating some of the process Meats we don that if you were to take those people eating the animal proteins and and look at only the people that have no unhealthy lifestyle factors which another very very very large study did do then they had the same all cause mortality as people eating plants and so it there was a lot of adjustment of data looking at you know people activity and vitamin supplement use and all that stuff you have to then really look at the people and and say okay in a person that is completely healthy they overweight they not consuming a lot of alcohol why is it those people have the same mortality as plant eaters well maybe because people that are unhealthy and then eating a lot of meat on top of that and they sedentary they acids to build muscle the amino acids are growth signals maybe they know growth signals that are allowing damaged cells to become a cancer cell right so there and observational studies do not always pick up that Nuance so I think that is important to keep in mind as well there was another um another big study and this was this was also oh sorry no that was the same study okay so what I what I meant to say the other large study is one I just mentioned was also a very large study and did find there was no difference in mortality again when you healthy and have no unhealthy lifestyle factors that eat meat and they have they have and eggs and they have the same mortality as plant eaters so it those it have to then you really have to think about all the data and all the nuance and go okay well maybe it healthy to eat eggs and meat as long as I unhealthy lifestyle factors and if you are sedentary and overweight and smoke and or do any one of those then stop doing that and unhealthy lifestyle you know thing or you lot of meat and eggs I think that that also the the take-home let back to the eggs because I do think that it the question just talking about nutritional composition of eggs so they are really packed full of a lot of nutrition they have a lot of really different goody you know good micronutrients in them and um macronutrients as well so choline is high in eggs choline is good for your brain there vitamins in in eggs as well and egg yolk and Coline is in egg yolk also for energy um pantic acid for metabolism phosphorus is really good for bones there iodine selenium everything from you know your vision to your immune system I mean all these things all these micronutrients are important important for a lot of physiological Pro uh processes as well not to mention they a really good source of protein right and also monounsaturated fat now a mediumsized egg also contains about 1.3 grams of saturated fat and 177 milligrams of dietary cholesterol which used to raise concerns about their effects on you know cardi metabolic Health however we now know that dietary cholesterol is not a major contributor to total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol inside of our body right it those are the major players with respect to diet for increasing total cholesterol LDL cholesterol um Etc so uh let about some other studies that were done looking just at eggs so one study examined um this was a very large analysis looking at 40 different studies involving over 3.6 million people to look at the effects um of eating eggs on people looked at what happens when people eat one extra 50 gr egg each day the study initially suggested that eating an additional egg each day could slightly increase the risk of death from heart rated issues however after considering the amount of cholesterol consumed from all dietary sources eggs alone were not associated with higher mortality rates so again it just it indicates that the broader context of one and you know there factors playing a role here that affect that of cardiovascular disease there been a variety of randomized control trials looking at egg intake as well and a variety of biomarkers so there was a metaanalysis of 27 randomized control trials people that consumed anything from five eggs a week to three eggs a day in the intervention group did show that eating a lot of eggs a day can increase LDL it can increase HDL it can it can increase a lot of the the lipoproteins and so for example there was a a mean increase in LDL by about 5.6 milligrams per deciliter and an H an HDL increase of about 2.13 milligrams per deciliter compared with the control group um overall you know eating eating eggs in moderation I think is likely to have any significant adverse effect on cholesterol and it it did seem to have at least a beneficial effect on HDL but obviously there are people that are very sensitive to um saturated fat and also to so there are some people that are sensitive to dietary cholesterol even though in general it regulator of cardiometabolic Health for most people there are some people that are very sensitive to it so the American Heart associ Association put together Advisory Board and they analyzed a variety studies involving eggs they looked at dietary cholesterol intake from egg consumption they looked at um cardiovascular risk from egg consumption and here their of their findings they said overall consuming eggs was not found to have a significant association with the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases in the general population and they State this suggests that eggs can be part of a a balanced diet and does not necessarily increase the risk of heart disease for most people people and in fact when they did a more detailed analysis of several several studies what they found was that people who ate a high number of eggs so seven or more per week had a slightly lower risk of a stroke compared to people who ate fewer eggs so less than one per week and this was about a 9% reduction in stroke risk I mean it huge but again it beneficial when it comes to coronary heart disease eating eggs did not show a significant impact in in the risk of developing coronary heart disease in the general population however there were individuals with type 2 diabetes and um where people with type two diabetes did have an association between egg consumption and increased coronary heart disease risk so there could be uh a rationale for why people with type two diabetes might be at a higher risk for coronary heart disease if they again comes down to some of those other studies where if they people that have diabetes maybe they haven it maybe they all those things are going to affect that observational data um there was also a an a meta analysis of 17 different of these randomized control trials looking at egg intake and this was about 3 to seven eggs per day and it did raise total cholesterol LDL cholesterol and HDL like I mentioned but um it wasn a significant enough enough risk to raise coronary heart disease and so it seems like people that are very very sensitive to those types of elevations in in in LDL for example total cholesterol um maybe they need to kind of monitor that a little more closely but I think generally speaking the ongoing debate about whether or not eggs are bad for your health or bad for heart health is somewhat settled and they not for most people there are certain individual ual that may want to limit their egg cons consumption and those are people with genetic reasons maybe they cholesterol or maybe they have type two diabetes but generally speaking I don think the data you know is supportive of of the statement that eggs are bad for your health in fact I think that um they they of vitamins and protein do you have but the question is do you have to eat you know five eggs every day not NE necessarily right you don especially if you it if it is raising your your LDL or your apob for example and you trying to work on lowering that then you know every little step you can take to lower those apob levels is a good thing right and so maybe instead of eating four eggs a day you eat you know one or two eggs a day and Walter free range eggs yeah so that question pasture rais chickens have lay eggs that have a lot higher the much higher levels of micronutrients um even things like lutein which still pale in comparison to what you find in kale but um you you vitamins that I mentioned and and um also it quality egg for sure um and you can even look at the yolk and see the big difference it when you get like an egg from a pasturised chicken versus you know just like a standard you know conventional chicken that the egg yolk is like light yellow it it	Success
This supplement lowers your blood pressure	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILOZ00I5rvg	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so hypertension or high blood pressure it so it affects nearly half of us adults including 20% of young adults aged 18 to 39 it young adults people in their 20s and 30s to be aware of their blood pressure elevated blood pressure is not only going to increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases but it also significantly raises the risk of dementia later in life so where does magnesium come into this well magnesium helps control blood pressure by boosting the production of substances like prostacyclin and nitric oxide which relax blood vessels and improve overall cardiovascular health so there was a comprehensive meta analysis involving 34 different randomized control trials there was over 2,000 participants and researchers discovered that magnesium supplementation at an average dose of 368 milligrams per day notably lowers both systolic and diastolic blood pressures	Success
The biggest benefit of saunas no one is talking about	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7SU2hBle7g	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so that interested in the sauna was the effect on my mood when you get in the sauna um or when you heat exposure say a hot bath something similar you release endorphins and that when you um but you also release something that the opposite of that it and that is the opioid that responsible for that discomfort feeling that dysphoric feeling like it this I hate it why am I doing this myself exactly and that running what it it happens during physical activity as well and um and so what it does it actually cools down your core body temperature somewhat and that and um but when you release that discomfort feeling there loop it actually tell it actually you actually make more receptors and you make them more sensitive to the feel-good endorphins so that you feel better later	Success
The INSANE Cardiovascular Health Benefits of Sauna Bathing | Dr. Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhaBQdX8KaA	FoundMyFitness Clips 	if you only had a couple minutes with someone who was totally new to saas how would you Briefly summarize the benefits well I would start with um a lot of the studies that have come out of Finland which have been large you know very very large population-based studies these are observational studies where an association has been made and um there have been quite a few that have found that frequent sauna use is associated with a lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease a lower risk of sudden cardiac death a lower risk of coronary heart disease a lower risk of stroke a lower risk of dementia of Alzheimer lower risk it it it occurs in a dose dependent manner so what that means is the more frequent the sauna bathing the more robust the the the health benefits are so for example people that use the sauna two to three times a week are about about 22% less likely to die from Sudden cardiac death compared to people that only use the sauna one time a week but people that use the sauna four to seven times a week are 63% less likely to die from Sudden cardiac death compared to people that use the sauna one time per week so there more frequent sauna bathing more robust effects on cardiovascular health and I would say that to people that are not familiar with the sauna a lot of people think of it as a time to relax it very it out of your day and and and and have it to to yourself um so so there is an aspect of this relaxation almost a meditation type of um Quality to to sauna bathing but there interesting aspect of it which is sauna use is essentially mimicking moderate aerobic cardiovascular exercise and so a lot of the same physiological response that happen when you example your heart rate elevates while you body temperature you get hot you start to sweat these are the same things that are occurring while someone is in the sauna so heart rate elevates it elevates to around 120 beats per minute you sweat your core body temperature is elevated after the sauna and after exercise and this has actually been compared head-to-head comparison of these two blood pressure is lower after sauna bathing or after exercise your resting heart rate is lower than before you did the exercise or before you started using the sauna so um I think that really interesting aspect of sauna that most people are unfamiliar with that it moderate intense cardiovascular exercise and then the other thing is is that there really profound effects on the brain and I don been teased out just yet we can certainly dive into some details but you know there link between cardiovascular health and brain function you know having proper blood flow to the brain is very important for for lowering dementia risk so there but you know there observational studies looking at dementia risk and Alzheimer sauna bathers and again it dependent robust effect frequency matters and so people that use this on a two to three times a week you know they have some somewhere like a 20% lower dementia risk 20% lower Alzheimer more or less but using the sauna four to seven times a week it between a 60 to 66% reduction in dementia and Alzheimer compared to people that use thisa one time a week so um it seems like you know four times a week is kind of The Sweet Spot and we can talk about all the details of that um in a little bit but but there sauna use seems to help prevent nerd deener of diseases like Alzheimer disease and dementia so um I certainly have some hypothesis and hypothesis I guess they I um I think that start into the sauna oh and also all cause mortality that too because you know there studies these large populational studies finding that people that use this four to seven times a week have a 40% lower risk of dying from all causes of death um than people that use the sauna one time a week so um to me it really is is the beginning of understanding that you know sauna you seems to really be beneficial for our health and much like a lot of these lifestyle factors that that are well known to to modify our our disease risk so exercise for example so you don you know a healthy diet meditation I think these are pretty common knowledge at this point to be beneficial for overall health and I think that sauna use should be up there I think it should be included in that in that sort of um you know bag of things that are known to improve what our health span is it diseases that we get into a a shorter time period so it extending the youthful part of our life so you may not necessarily live you know X many years longer although you may if you don probably end up not dying from cancer earlier but ultimately it improving your health span is about improving the quality of your life not getting Parkinson Alzheimer not getting cardiovascular disease type two diabetes and and having a better quality of life so that you essentially enjoying your life and and living living healthier for a longer period of time I do want to make sure to distinguish the difference between um my publication on the sauna which was a a very comprehensive review article covering multiple aspects of sauna health and someone doing primary research where they doing experiments and having people you know come into a sauna and measuring heart rate and blood pressure changes for for example um so I am I am not doing those experiments and a lot of the research that that has um been done on the the health benefits of the SAA have actually come out of Finland uh from Dr Yari Lenin so I just wanted to give him a little shout out because uh his work has been invaluable in in in our understanding of the health benefits of the SAA well let deeper into the cardiovascular system because you mentioned there potentially excellent benefits from the sauna on the cardiovascular system so could you review what the cardiovascular system is briefly and then what known about the saa I think this is so important because um as you know it neck are cardiovascular disease and cancer as the number one and two killers of both men and women in the United States so what impact on the cardiovascular system well what impact of I mean I think generally speaking when people think about cardiovascular health they think about their cholesterol they think about the health of their arteries they think about not having a bunch of plaques build up inside their arteries and block blood flow and and oxygen from getting to different tissues it known that a lot of dietary and lifestyle factors can modify cardiovascular disease risk one of the best ones being exercise I don that there cardiovascular health than than exercise so um you know the fact that sauna use mimics moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise as I as I mentioned a moment ago is it of principle that you know sauna sauna is going to be good for cardiovascular health the same sort of physiological changes are happening you know you have an increased blood flow to the skin um also to the muscle so that facilitate sweating um plasma volume increases heart rate elevates during sauna bathing you you know you and you thing that happening while you exercising and changes in blood pressure go down as well afterwards just like exercise so I think that that is partly probably responsible for some of the cardiovascular benefits Dr Yari Lain and and his colleagues have looked at so many different aspects of cardiovascular health with respect to sauna bathing and and they found time and time again whether you cardiac death whether you about death from cardiovascular disease or coronary heart disease um and even talking about stroke risk um stroke risk is also significantly lowered something in the realm of like 40% lower for people that use the sauna four to seven times a week versus once a week so there that suggests that sauna use does mimic moderate aerobic activity and and this is potentially why it cardiac you know for cardiovascular health excellent and does it lower cholesterol and hypertension as well regular sauna use hypertension yes like so there studies looking at hypertension risk so this again these are observational studies and again it dependent effects where you see people that use this on a two to three times a week they have like a 24% lower risk of hyper hypertension versus people that use the sauna four to seven times a week who have about a 46% lower risk of um hypertension but there like studies where they single sauna use again where they just one a person goes into the sauna uses it for you know 20 minutes and they measure blood pressure before and after the sauna and one even just a single sauna use lowers blood pressure so both systolic and diastolic blood pressure after the sauna bathing similar to what exercise does and so I think um that helps sort of establish causality because there associations and how much Association how much can you you know derive causality from these associations when it comes to observational studies you mentioned how you know sauna use mimics exercise in many ways moderate intensity exercise so with regard to that can it also just improve overall Fitness and endurance as well that question uh we cover this in um my co-author terresa Johnson and I our review article that we published um last year in experimental gerontology and I say um so far the evidence seems to suggest that sauna use May improve endurance exercise um there there have been a variety of studies that have looked either at Runners for example that use the sauna and then they time and running distance um there have been some studies looking at people wearing a sauna suit so this is like a type of clothing that of mimics the sauna because it makes you you know warm up and so people train in that sauna suit um and that to help improve endurance but I think there lot of evidence out there um looking at just acclimating yourself to heat and so you know when you sauna there there changes that start to occur where your body starts to adapt so like if someone it talked about temperature duration yet in any of these you know studies that I are referred to with respect to cardiovascular health and all cause mortality for example but um you know if you degrees fhe and you before and certainly if you that that are Physically Active also are sort of adapted to heat because they elevating their core body temperature when they they you take a person that person that to heat and it them to stay in that sauna hot sauna for more than five minutes um But as time goes on and um as people start to use this SAA more and become more acclimated then people start to sweat at a lower core body temperature and this helps facilitate cooling down and so they able to tolerate it more and they also there can talk about uh at the molecular level that occur as well and and so I think that um it all comes down to basically if you are adapted to heat well then when you Marathon you more heat adapted because if you to using the sauna and you you temperature and all these physiological Chang are happening then that affect you when you your core body temperature through another modality that modality being running or exercise you know fill in the blank type of exercise so um you know it kind of makes sense when you think about it definitely	Success

You'll Never Eat Processed Food Again After Hearing THIS	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cZUJdN2WQc	FoundMyFitness Clips 	okay so we going to talk a lot actually about processed foods so this was a deep dive I really wanted to look into this um well for one reason it know there studies that have been really well done and and it additives in processed foods aside from the sugar um that seem to be detrimental to human health and so um so James submitted a question and says what substances in in processed foods are the most detrimental to our health food colorings preservatives sweeteners binders anything that keeps stuff from separating I am unclear on what are the bigger concerns and what qualifies food as processed so there chemicals that are allowed in food sold in the US 10,000 that it the back of your mind when you go oh that that we we allow 10,000 chemicals to be added to our food sold here in the United States like how are you going to keep track of 10,000 chemicals that lot um some are direct additives and others are indirect additives like um heavy metals which contaminate food during processing and storaging and packaging right so so there things like if you dark chocolate for example maybe has high levels of cadmium um arsenic right it the chocolate it processing of the cocoa plants you know the cocoa plants take up these heavy metals from the soil depending on particularly depending on where they grown and processing always concentrates things right and so a lot of times you additives as well almost 99% of food chemicals that were introduced since the year 2000 were greenlighted for use by the food and chemical companies rather than properly reviewed by the FDA so these substances end up in what we eat thanks to the legal loophole that allows them to be in there um so essentially what I the food chemicals since the year 2000 that are in our food that we can buy in the grocery store were get in there not because FDA directly reviewed them and found them to be safe but because they chemical companies and they recognized as safe so um it the FDA when they whether or not a chemical is safe they looking at that food chemical and whether or not it consume um so it different and it opening when you go oh so that everything anything anything that after the year 2000 mo more or less was not even directly reviewed by the FDA it was just allowed because of a legal Lo loophole into our food so there nitrates um which are found in plants but there preservatives using cured meats nitrites can form um nitrosamines which are carcinogen they of cancers colon cancer stomach cancer esophageal cancer um and Poss believe in thyroid and brain cancers potassium bromate this is a another carcinogen that used in packaged baked goods then there which is a preservative that in pastries it tortillas it Developmental and reproductive harm then there or BHA so this is another preservative that you can find in some cured meats and other few Foods um it identified as a carcinogen and um again a lot of a lot of processed Meats have been linked to cancer and it data when you hear about meat consumption in cancer a large portion of that is coming from processed Meats which are different than eating you know a a a whole lean source of meat right so um that mind um there food like Pop-Tarts it tbhq um that system then there that mostly in candy and it damages DNA so um it basically there oil so that to stabilize Citrus flavors in like sodas and fruity drinks um that there it neurological harm then there floro alkaly so that pfas these are the toxic quote unquote forever chemicals um sometimes people call them like fast like the pfas um they packaging of food so um it food itself but it let prepackaged food because you don time and it looks like the what whatever you the the the packaging itself has these pfas in them and they leech into Foods um particularly I mean if you foods that are like soups or something that heated that almost is like it it goes like a h hundredfold higher in terms of leeching a lot of these chemicals into the actual food itself and the um pfas they associated with increased risk of cancer um also associated with damaging the immune system but really a lot of sort of emerging evidence about damaging reproductive systems so um there there say associative studies that have linked these for forever chemicals to you know decreasing sperm um counts you know and things like that so um it really it seems to be affecting reproductive systems as well there these are like you know red number three 40 red number 40 yellow number five yellow number six blue number one these are in a lot of different processed foods particularly candies and pastries and things that are targeted towards cereals like children things that children are eating and they have been shown not only in observational studies but like randomized controlled trials to cause behavioral difficulties in children particularly um ADHD and in children that already have ADHD they just it like goes off the chart like they just get really like it exacerbates it so um a lot of those artificial colors um they linked to again behavioral difficulties then there sweeteners so um sucrose being one um the these have been associated with affecting hormones affecting you know having a negative effect on metabolism and I think the international Agency for research on cancer recently C classified aspartame as possibly carcinogenic to humans like this was a very very recent thing like within the last month or so that that was um that made made some headlines and again those aspartame like that stuff um those are found in a lot of you know diet Beverages and stuff like that then of course there those do leech in those are indirect um like contaminants and you know uh sometimes they can end up in baby foods and slow growth and development as well so that there foods right the chemicals now there ultr processed foods and there was a study that was published in 2021 I think it was Kevin Hall study that that found it it it defines Ultra processed foods as industrially manufactured ready to eat or ready to heat formulations of foods so they like not Whole Foods but but you know they also known as junk food I guess and these are um you know even things like flavored yogurts breakfast cereals you know enriched you know that are that are thought to be enriched with beneficial nutrients right like the these are all the ultr processed foods and um there on those that they they harmful they role and causing metabolic dysfunction and um weight gain as well so um and and and links to cardiovascular disease risk so every you know everything that we talk about with like too much refined sugar or saturated fat well like these ultr processed foods are doing similar things as well um and so then you add in addition these ultr processed foods also have you know they have a high caloric density so there there everything together just makes them so much more dangerous trans fats those are now really band um but like they were in foods for a very very long time and they really adversely affect lipoprotein profiles and the risk of coronary heart disease and then there effects on endocrine Pathways and these These are um you know things like inorganic phosphate salts so those are those are absorbed to a greater extent than organic phosphorus which n naturally occurs in foods and there been observational data that have looked at serum phosphate and you know excess dietary phosphorus basically associated with cardiovascular disease also disruption of hormonal regulation so um you know it hormonal you know properties as well and um again affecting things like oxidative stress arterial calcification um it endocrine function so um another another big one that most people are aware of is the BPA that also affects endocrine function so this is in a lot of Packaging materials now you of materials that say BPA free but they have BPS as a substitute now BPS is being linked to endocrine dysfunction so it I mean like take your pick I think you water bottles and going for something like this you know that um I I raised up my Yeti container here by the way uh so you know it like just because something says BPA free um doesn the hook I think it just means you trading one chemical for another you know bpa similar to 17 beta estradiol and you know there lot of different pre preclinical um research showing it C you know can promote insulin resistance inflammation uh pancreatic beta cell dysfunction it binds to estrogen receptors um and then there observational data as well so there that are linking um what are called upfsf4mggas are formed bya heat treatments so um it makes things like acryline acrylamide by the way acryline sulfurane intake increases AC acryline excretion through urine after like 24 hours like by it increases about like 40% so acryline um is also something that is it can be formed just from like cooking food really hot at high temperatures and stuff as well but it is in this food additive the the UPF so there this stuff that that people eat that they aware of and and um and I think at the end of the day you know these these continual exposures to these things day in and day out particularly for people that are eating large volumes of processed foods I mean once in a while it whatever um but I I think day in and day out it ways um on multiple systems endocrine system brain function um you know our DNA and being a carcinogen on metabolism obesity heart disease it to be affecting all the systems and um you know I it goes back to that whole paleo diet concept I know there many fads that have come around right there start and then the keto and carnivore and I think at the end of the day you know sticking to Whole Food don just sticking to a Whole Food you doesn choosing one of the fat diets but just eating you know fruits vegetables like yes fruits vegetables meats you know poultry um um fish you know nuts like these are these are healthy foods to eat	Success
Rhonda Patrick on the CRAZY Longevity Benefits of Vitamin D	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVMsyMs2jKo	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so first up um I think there three main micronutrient deficiencies that I want to talk about for a couple of reasons one because they widespread um prevalence in terms of either deficiency or inadequacy and two because I think they played a very important role in a lot of physiological processes in our body that affect the way we age so first we going to talk about vitamin D and most of you guys probably have already heard enough about vitamin D but um it important to talk about because it it gets converted into a steroid hormone and it goes into the nucleus of cells and interacts with DNA so it recognizes a very specific sequence of DNA called the vitamin D response element and and this is encoded in our DNA um and that interaction then either turns genes on and activates them or it does the opposite it sort of of turns them down and represses them so it important for orchestrating I mean we talking about over 5% of the protein encoding human genome is regulated by vitamin D which is quite a lot um and so you know you can imagine if if you running a car and your Pistons are are firing um out of sync with each other I mean that when you when you don levels of vitamin D your genes aren being regulated in the way they supposed to be so things aren activated when they repressed when they things are kind of you know going going arai um and as I mentioned about it widespread prevalency in terms of inadequacy so about 70% of the population has inadequate levels of vitamin D which we minute it milliliter or less and it simple solution and that like to talk about it because um it almost just as simple as taking a a basically a supplement that cost a penny a pill Vitamin D supplements are one of the most affordable supplements out there and and there reason other than lack of you know education about vitamin D for people to be so deficient and insufficient a lot of reasons for the widespread deficiency um you know we make vitamin D3 in our skin so UVB radiation is essential to make vitamin D3 anything that blocks out UVB radiation is going to stop that production of vitamin D so we sunscreen um melanin which is the dark skin pigmentation that protects us from the burning rays of the sun um also is a natural sunscreen so that is also a form of sunscreen also depending on where you live so a northern latitude um UVB radiation can atmosphere you know several months out of the year so when you combine some of these factors let with darker pigmentation from let East Asia and they move somewhere like Chicago or they move to Sweden where you know 6 months out of the year you even getting that UVB radiation you talking about just a you know compounding effect on vitamin D deficiency because um you know there have been studies out of the University of Chicago that have shown that for example African-Americans have to stay in the sun anywhere between 6 to 10 times longer than Caucasians with Fair scale to make the same amount of vitamin D3 In Their Skin So you it effect with respect to to the to the melanin production as well and then age plays a role so as we age you know everything is less efficient um so you know a 70-year-old makes about I think it skin than their former 20-year-old self so and then of course modern day Society so we have we our computers we we we Society we much as we used to be and so um vitamin D is just not being made in our skins like it was 100 years ago so there lot of reasons why it widespread um I like to show this this slide it was a study published several years ago was 2009 and and it showing um when you knock out the vitamin D receptor in in mice that it affects the way they age um so the top of the panel you can see that both mice that wild type and then the vitamin D receptor knockout sort of Aging the same and then four months later the vitamin D receptor Mouse is is just it accelerated aging model and you know yeah it looks terrible but like the organs on on every level things were um sort of accelerated in the way they were aging so um it nice visual to see but of course we not mice and I why mice even need Vitamin D because you know they just one of those things where it I don translates to humans so let some human studies um we know that there observational data that vitamin D levels to low vitamin D levels to higher all cause mortality risk higher uh cancer mortality but there always that question of healthy user bias maybe people with higher vitamin D are outside and more physically active and of course you try to correct for as many you know confounding factors as possible but you never really can establish causation that randomization comes into play so this is we you know we have a variety of genes that are responsible for converting vitamin D3 into 25 hydroxy vitamin D which is the um most you know active circulating form of vitamin D and then subsequently into the steroid hormone which is 125 hydroxy vitamin D um some of these G genes that make enzymes we all are different and so some people have ones that don efficiently um and so melan randomization takes these genes the these single nucleotide polymorphisms in these genes and says okay we randomize them people that have these genes that we know make them basically have lower levels of 25 hydroxy vitamin D and see what their you know correlate that to health outcomes like all cause mortality so it of randomizing people and people that have genetically low vitamin D levels independent of what their lifestyle is they have a much higher all cause mortality they have a higher cancer related mortality and they have a higher respiratory disease mortality um with very little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality and there been um with randomized control trials obviously you lifelong randomized control trial looking at mortality but there know there be looked at one is epigenetic aging which I yesterday so um one study that took people that were vitamin D deficient and that with a cohort of participants that are deficient right because if you already have someone that them a vitamin D supplement really shouldn already at a sufficient level so um these were African-American individuals that were also overweight and um so they were they were very vitamin D deficient they were given a vitamin D supplement with 4,000 IUS of vitamin D a day and it decreased their epigenetic age by almost 2 years so the question is what is deficiency insufficiency um adequacy uh so technically it depending on what institute you looking at but the um Endocrinology Institute defines deficiency as Vitamin uh 25 hydroxy vitamin D levels less than 20 nanograms per M sufficiency is about 30 getting you know so if you insufficient you you and it seems as though The Sweet Spot for vitamin D is between 40 to 60 nanograms per milliliter and um you know there studies also looking at vitamin D levels there ranging for from 1960s all the way to the you know mid like 2015 and it really it seems like 40 to 60 is a really good sweet spot for the lowest all cause mortality with vitamin D as I mentioned 4,000 I mentioned 4,000 I use of vitamin D a day because um that the tolerable upper intake for vitamin D so it 1,000 IUS of vitamin D generally raises people nanograms per mil so the key is to just get get a vitamin D blood test do it you know after you make sure your your levels are adequate because again a lot of these single nucleotide polymorphisms and genes that affect our enzymes that are metabolizing vitamin D also affect how we respond to um supplemental vitamin D and some people can require a much higher dose than other people so really the key here is blood test and measuring um you don know what you don	Success
If You Drink Alcohol, Follow These Damage Control Tactics - Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUWPQKzp4VM	FoundMyFitness Clips 	okay friends we have covered a lot of information and I want to end this episode with a section I think you all been waiting for and that is some practical advice and tactics for damage control I because if we are people who enjoy consuming alcohol on occasion and I you whether you should or shouldn drink alcohol is a part of many social occasions and knowing that people will consume alcohol from time to time it makes sense to think about the lowest risk ways to have alcohol and strategies to reduce some of the adverse effects of consuming it we just talked about exercise being one potential way many of these we this podcast so I and I quote unquote damag control strategies that I think are going to be the most impactful first I think an important note it number of alcoholic drinks per week that will be associated with Optimal Health is zero I know that through throughout this episode I that low and even moderate levels of alcohol consumption are associated with lower risk of certain diseases but none of this evidence suggests that someone who doesn to consume alcohol to obtain that health benefit rather they suggest that if your currently drinking habits reflect low to moderate alcohol consumption you may have you may be within a safe range and if you amount reducing your intake should provide a health benefit but of of course your Baseline health status and predisposition to diseases like cancer should play a role in your decision to drink or not so if you are going to drink what is the safest level of alcohol consumption from a disease reduction standpoint the literature suggests one to two drinks per week this recommendation is largely driven by the evidence on cancer which has a very lowrisk threshold for drinking even though one to two drinks per day seems to lower the risk for cardio vascular diseases and diabetes this amount seems to elevate the risk of dementia and cancer and reduce life expectancy and I don or glucose lowering effects of alcohol outweigh the greater risk for cancer or cognitive decline also it you should avoid consuming four to five drinks on any single occasion or binge drinking because binge drinking is associated with adverse health effects even when your weekly alcohol consumption Falls within the lowrisk or even cardioprotective range there is admittedly a very poor quality literature about things that may or may not mitigate these adverse effects of alcohol regarding sleep the dose and timing are probably the two most important factors if you have your last drink four hours or more before going to sleep this seems to drastically reduce the impact on Sleep Quality and sleep architecture consuming a meal before having any alcoholic drinks at night and even adding some fruit to this meal and ensuring that you with electrolytes and water may also minimize alcohol there really isn support this just anecdotes lastly because magnesium glycinate has been suggested to help with sleep in general I think that taking this before sleep on a night when you were drinking may be worth trying especially because as we discussed alcohol increases magnesium excretion these same tactics for Sleep also apply for reducing the severity of hangovers eating a heavy meal supplementing with electrolytes and hydrating only seem to help mildly with hangover symptoms while speculative supplementing with an acetylcysteine and liposomal glutathione both of which are intended to increase glutathione levels in the body and brain May reduce some of alcohol detoxification processes in the liver because sulfurane has also been shown to increase glutathione plasma levels and brain levels in humans this represents another supplement option that could reduce alcohol lowcost and risk-free strategy would be to supplement with a micronutrient risk multivitamin to replenish your body micronutrient stores which may become depleted after a day or night of consuming alcohol remember that some vitamins like vitamin B3 and zinc actually are crucial for helping convert alcohol into less harmful metabolites before they leave the body in this case you should also ensure that your micronutrient levels are adequate in general in order to make sure your body has the enzymatic Machinery necessary to metabolize alcohol but of course micronutrients are important even if you don advise against taking insides like ibuprofen or acetaminophen to reduce hangover symptoms and you should especially avoid taking them with alcohol as they could slow down alcohol metabolism or increase the liver toxicity of alcohol the same goes with mixing melatonin with alcohol in an attempt to sleep better this will lead to increased drowsiness and may not be safe briefly let supplements that may work for mitigating some of the adverse effects of alcohol remember that most of these things on this list are speculative liposomal glutathione an acetylcysteine and sulfurane to increase glutathione levels and help with liver detoxification processes zinc magnesium and B vitamins to Aid in the metabolism of alcohol electrolytes sodium magnesium potassium because alcohol may increase the loss of them in urine how to track assess the effects of alcohol on health one of the biggest issues surrounding low and moderate alcohol consumption is that for some people the effects on health aren readily apparent it assess whether drinking one to a few drinks per week is affecting your overall chronic disease risk but nearly everyone these days owns some sort of wearable Fitness and sleep tracking device if this is true for you then you have a very valuable tool literally at your fingertips to measure the effects of alcohol on your sleep although this data may not be as useful as laboratory biomarkers I think that it could still be useful in helping you make decisions about alcohol consumption take a look at your sleep metrics your resting heart rate after a regular night and a night of drinking and you may realize something very interesting lastly I think that overall the number one thing that you can do if you want to consume alcohol occasionally without experiencing increase in your risk for disease is to live an overall Physically Active lifestyle in fact engaging in regular exercise lessens the all-cause mortality risk associated with drinking and almost completely nullifies the association between Cancer mortality and drinking I am not saying that you can justify an extra drink or two because you worked out but I am saying that you can probably worry a bit less about one or two social drinking occasions each week if if you regularly exercise that brings us to the end of this episode I sincerely hope you enjoyed and at least learned a few new things about alcohol and took away some actionable advice that you can use in your everyday life when it comes down to it we adults who can make decisions for ourselves if you struggle with substance use or have a family history of substance abuse disorders then maybe completely avoiding alcohol is the best decision for you but if you are someone who enjoys an occasional drink I think that all of the evidence discussed today suggests that you can make it a part of an otherwise healthy lifestyle if you engage in low risk drinking behaviors you exercise routinely and you might use some of the other tools I at length	Success
Rhonda Patrick recommends these 2 fish oil brands	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVwOwAyRSyc	FoundMyFitness Clips 	John that I I recommend I was actually pretty surprised with the with the Costco brand of fish oil for one if you budget you can look at consumer lab and I do think that there they they do measure um oxidation and concentration of EPA and DHA and a variety of brands that are pretty affordable so I would start there there brand that metagenics what you want to look for is a brand that has has it in triglyceride form because it really it really is more bioavailable it really is and so I like metagenics because it does have triglyceride form	Success
The Top 7 Ways to Boost Cognitive Function (according to science)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lCPj5brRUs	FoundMyFitness Clips 	What are the most important things to consider when it comes to improving cognitive function? A lot of people want better focus. They want to be more productive. They want to improve their mood. They want to do all of those things. Like what are the big movers when we think cognitive function? So there there things that require effort and there like lowerhanging fruit, right? So this is things that like you could take a supplement perhaps. And I would say the big movers are the ones that of course are going to require more effort. Like that it think it that exercise and particularly vigorous exercise is one of the best ways that you can get a cognitive enhancement. You know, memory, executive function, processing speed. So, there have been studies that have been done in older adults, in middle-aged adults, in children, like across the lifespan. And it heart rate up, you know, getting getting your heart rate up and blood flow up and sweating is going to make you smarter and feel better. It both. So, um, like there was there was even one study that was done in older adults, and this was like a classic study that I I just remember I talked about it for years, but other studies have like repeated it since then, but it was like 2011 or 20 2012 published in PNAS and um this this researchers took these older adults and they put them on a year-long intervention exercise program. And there was a lot of um more vigorous intensity, so they up to about 80% max heart rate, 75, 80% max heart rate. And um for one year they did this intervention um and after that year they had a 2% increase in their hippocample volume. So hippocampus is a part of your brain that involved in learning and memory and they increased it by like 2%. So people that in that age group lose between 1 to 2% of their hippocample volume per year. So they essentially countered that loss that atrophy that they related you know experiencing each year. And um and so part of the reason that happens is when you type of exercise, you are increasing brain derived neurotropic factor BDNF. And that is responsible for growing new neurons in the hippocampus. It responsible for neuroplasticity. So that adapt and change to the changing environment, which is what older adults don much more plastic when it Like you can adapt to things. That that saying you it old dog new tricks, right? Okay. I mean, that BDNF plays a role in that. So, you want more BDNF, like you and exercise and particularly vigorous exercise. If you they can enough, and that um, then they make energy without oxygen. And that happens by just using glucose. And then you make lactate as a byproduct. And lactate is what is signaling and increasing that BDNF. And lactate is really, I mean, you can measure it. There you can buy and measure it. But I don think you need to. I think you can just measure your heart rate. And if you getting, if you intensity exercise, 10 minutes, that all it took was 10 minutes to have improvements in cognition, uh, executive function, processing speed. So, even just a 10-minute workout, and like I did one before I was came here, like that like that it game. So, you just can do a 10-minute, you know, workout. It could be high-intensity interval training where you vigorous exercise and then kind of resting a little bit and then so you do these intervals or it could just be like I and I to do it. So um exercise exercise is the number one I would say big mover as you said it most effort. The other things, and this is where I kind of like I because there was very recently a new study, um, one out of three very large randomized placeboc control trials where they another group a multivitamin. Okay, this is a multivitamin, which is the micronutrients I magnesium, B vitamins, folate, u, vitamin K. It getting enough of. They enough from their diets. And, um, they gave older adults. So, these were people that were 65 and older. And um there was three different trials of this study. It was called the Cosmo trial and there about 5,000 participants in total. And the evidence was clear that just giving them a multivitamin improved cognition and it slowed braid aging which was it was estimated to slow brain aging by about two years. And I this is like it so it I was like doing I was out there podcast talk you know talking on podcast about huge studies that were coming out saying enough is enough multivitamins are a waste of money don were saying the exact opposite and they were terrible studies and I like tore them apart u but here we are 10 years later complete opposite baby full circle what does that mean a young person can take a multivitamin it them, you know, I probably not insurance. Yeah, it that you can start now and certainly older adults it made a difference. So that that again I mentioned that there these phyitochemicals in plants that are beneficial. They they blueberries, blueberry extract or even the equivalent of one cup of blueberries, this has been done like the equivalent of one cup of blueberries improves cognition, executive function. It in it improves um memory. Um also processing speed. So that would something like if you fast reaction time. I guess it relevant for like maybe someone who athletic but you know fine motor coordination things like that. Um multiple studies showing this. I mean there This is across the lifespan. There been studies in kids. There there been been studies in middle-aged adults and there And it smarter and they make you feel better. At least they make me feel better. So blueberries are the king of fruits I think. I mean it raspberries and pineapple I think for like the top spot in my world of fruits. Blueberries. Yeah. No, blueberries are So they have something in them called anthocyanins and it blueberries their like pigmentation. Raspberries have them too. Blueberries are very concentrated them in them. Um they also have So anthsyanins are a type of polyphenol. They flavonoid. They Polyphenols are a sort of wide class of phytochemicals. And phytochemicals, there lots of different types of them. And they really are beneficial in humans. And like I said, there control trials comparing giving this to to a placebo. And if it was bad for you, then it would be clear, right? It for you. So, uh, blueberries are are are at the top of the list for that, uh, for improving cognitive function. Low hanging fruit. How easy is it to eat a cup of blueberries a day? I eat two. It blueberries a day. It Yeah. So that that would be another one. Um I think another one on my list would be similar to that would be cocoa polyphenols. So like from from like dark chocolate. Um they have another type of polyphenol called kakans. And um the best one so there have been studies lots of studies on this and it this. So some studies have shown benefits. They increase blood flow to the brain. they increase, you know, vascular flow. So, you can get an immediate effect where, you know, if you increase blood flow to the brain, which is what exercise does, right? But we talking lowhanging fruit. It do, take a pill, that would be um something to do. It is it cognition, executive function and there no affiliation with them but they published their they they have studies published with their um proprietary blend which is again um one of the highest concentrated I would say cocoa flavinol out there the kakans consumer labs tested them and I it they just out compete all the other brands out there and they also have the lowest contaminants So they good but expensive way to get those cocoa flavonols which are really good. And then the other one would be for cognition would be luteine which I mentioned earlier. It concentrated. It concentrated in kale. Almost 24 milligrams in three kale leaves. And I say three kale leaves because that what I put in my smoothie. So I calculated it. But um so there milligrams of luteine. So luteine is a type of carotenoid like beta carotene, like lycopine and tomatoes. You of those things before. Well, luteine is in that same category. It is a carotenoid. It accumulates in the rods and the cones of your eye. It protects against singlet oxygen from blue light like this light we also the sunshine when you go outside that damages our eyes. It causes macular degeneration. And so luteine and zeazanthin is another carotenoid. they against that but they also accumulate in the brain and um there have been a variety of studies so there observational studies correlating plasma levels of luteine and zeazanthin with certain cognitive scores so like c crystallized intelligence older adults that have luteine and zeizanthin higher levels have more crystallized intelligence so that use all the information you learned over a lifetime and like use it um there been randomized control trial is looking at giving 8 milligrams of luteine. Now I said 24 is in three kale. So they give 8 milligs of luteine and something like 23 milligs of zeizanthin to older adults and it improves neural neural efficiency. So this is the ability to basically your your neurons can function with less energy which is nice. So that obviously improves cognitive function because it process. So, so luteine uh is another choline. Yeah, I know it Choline. Yeah. You know, cholineergics generally very important for brain function. It is. Yeah. It important um it and there with pregnant women. If you give pregnant women about 500 milligrams of choline per day, their children score better on int um the intelligence test. Yes. So, so I learned about this of course when I was pregnant and I was like, well, it was actually before I was pregnant, but I was like figuring out like what I I need? Y and that eggs during pregnancy because I also supplemented. But now you mastermind babies. I do. Yeah. Wow. But so choline is also important. Yeah, for sure. Brain function. But that it comes down to again getting trying to get everything you need from your food. Um and then omega-3s. There randomized control trials on omega-3s improving cognition, especially when they more. That mixed data if it them 500 milligrams. It wasn So, the studies that were consistently showing improvements in cognitive function or at least two grams a day of the omega-3. So that of I think lowhanging fruit for for cognitive function things you can	Success

Effects of magnesium L-threonate on the brain: animal vs. human evidence | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL2rQCB46bc	FoundMyFitness Clips 	I know back in the day you are big you were one of the early people to come and realize that there deficiency in the United States and you were one of the very first to start talking about that online which is awesome not too long ago maybe years or so ago I learned about a new form that was developed at MIT called Elfi innate I think I say that right via tieran eight three nine four brain three nap yeah for brain health I you are you familiar with this form and given that you health what are your thoughts on it I am familiar with this form my interest was also peaked when I read some of the earlier animal studies that had shown so that meant that this specific form this magnesium L 3 & 8 was a specific form of magnesium that could cross the blood-brain barrier better than magnesium not in that form and that it like improved cognitive function and prevents the loss of synapses and reverses memory deficits and all sorts of like amazing stuff of course it was very high concentrations in animal studies but my excitement for that is still kind of on hold because there was a clinical study pop one clinical study published actually showing a high dose of magnesium three and eight something like 1500 to 2,000 milligrams a day depending on a person 12 weeks the study claimed that it improved cognitive ability and it relative to placebo but when you look closer at the data the first thing that kind of jumps out is that they looked at whether or not this you know then this is pretty high dose they were giving people you know 1.5 grams or 1500 milligrams a day is a lot there was a very meager increase in plasma magnesium levels hmm very small no difference in red blood cell magnesium so like getting inside tissues would be some and red blood cells are at by the way usually a marker for brain things that get into red blood cells are sometimes used as biomarkers for things that get into the brain for example like DHA and so there was no change in red blood cell magnesium and there was tons of magnesium being excreted in the urine so people that were taking this versus placebo so people are taking this magnesium 3 and 8 were essentially peeing out most of it there was four cognitive tests that were done and if you look individually at each of those cognitive tests there was no like the confidence interval like there was no real significance but when you pulled all four together then you could say that it was an improving cognitive performance with all four of them pulled together a little kind of a little you know I would say yeah a little manipulation there just to get the p-value you want the significance you want so I would say that I absolutely think magnesium is really really important you	Success

Fasting before exercise and the effect on endurance, aerobic, and strength training | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF0AkfJqq2s	FoundMyFitness Clips 	this is from angel or on hell hope I got the name right so I practiced a simple 12-hour eating window and a 24-hour fast once a week so there for the 24-hour fast per week my question is are there any downsides to training fasted as I usually do the exercises involved are heavy weight training and moderate cardio afterwards just wanted to know if I doing harm or having adverse effects of the intended goals thanks and love your work great question um there have been meta-analysis of studies done so that just means just lots of studies that have been that have looked at for example trip doing physical activity either aerobic or anaerobic activity in a fasted state versus pre exercise feeding so you eat before exercise and a meta-analysis just kind of aggregates all those studies that have been done and looks at what the data says and so meta-analysis that have been done on that topic have shown that pre feeding before exercise improves it seems to improve long-duration aerobic exercise the duration is longer than 60 minutes but it doesn of an effect on performance if it aerobic exercise less than 60 minutes on a similar no it know eating before you exercise has also been shown to improve an aerobic exercise so like run till exhaustion but it doesn significant effect on high-intensity interval training so so there is a little bit of a performance hansman with eating before you work out in terms of long duration aerobic I triathletes long long distance running right right yeah which actually makes sense for weight training sounds like you within 60 minutes so so on even even less than yeah even even running you know less than 60 minutes or a high-intensity interval training class but what meta-analysis showed that eating before you exercise so if you if you fat your training fasted you get really robust and instruments in glucose you know sensitivity but really robust enhancements in your mitochondrial adaptations to using fatty acids so you become really primed for fatty acid use which makes sense if you state they depleting your glucose and you have more of these fatty acids that are available for energy there activity in genes that regulate fatty acid metabolism that when you train in a fasted state interestingly when you feed before you train those adaptations are blunted mm-hmm with respect to the fatty acid the tap uptake yeah like the really priming your mitochondria to be like robust to use fatty acids as a source of energy you still get glucose you know effects and enhancements and stuff even when you something but it seems as though those those the fatty acid adaptations that the mitochondria shift to are blunted somewhat so it sounds like for on hell or angel that you know if you weight lifting with cardio shouldn a dramatic effect I will I will add to that because I think even one of the previous questions you were asking someone was asking about the amino acids wanting to amino acid it takes before they trained and they were wanting to like for hypertrophy yeah you know so basically wanted to grow more muscle I will say that there have been studies looking there that has been done looking at you know is there this anabolic window that you have to take in amino acids in protein to like you know increase muscle growth and I think over the past few years studies have it that there have it used to be thought like this is one our window you have to down this protein shake immediately or you gonna miss it right I don the case I think that there of research that has come out showing that you actually can take an amino acid or you know protein hours after a workout however if you are doing if you into your workout fasted let you yes you don storing proteins so in that case if you are doing a fasted strength training workout you may want to consume protein within an hour after got a good distinction yeah if you you pretty a pretty fast like that a great recap for for on Allen or angel you	Success

This 2-Minute \"Snack\" Improves Blood Glucose, Mitochondria, & Longevity	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDvJ7hPm98o	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so I want to shift gears for a minute and talk about exercise snacks so we going to talk about improving metabolic Health but also longevity and exercise snacks it it really can refer to either a deliberate sort of type of exercise that you do for one minute two minutes three minutes and this is anything from burpees to squats um you can do high knees you can do you know there variety of different things that you can do to to get your heart rate up really high and short period of time and um we rate and there real there even doing a minute or two of of this exercise snack type of exercise and that again comes down to lactate lactate you know mus you work really hard lactate gets you know into circulation gets taken back up by the muscle and it causes glucose Transporters to come up to the muscle and sort of open the gate so that glucose can come in and um you know so this really improves blood glucose levels and there looking at this particularly in people with type two diabetes doing exercise snacks around meal time so anywhere between 30 minutes to an hour before after a meal can really dramatically decrease the post prandial glucose response and and improve blood glucose levels now sure that people that are metabolically disregulated people with type two diabetes but like who doesn improve their postprandial glucose response I mean that makes you feel sleepy and you reduces mental Clarity after a meal so doing timing these exercise snacks around meals is a great is a great and sort of easy way to improve your blood glucose levels as well and it do um the other way it improves metabolic health is these exercise snacks when you high-intensity you know interval training sort of thing even one or two minutes but mostly when you higher than that like 10 minutes 20 minutes uh it to increase the number of mitochondria in your muscle tissue again it adaptation you are forcing your muscles to work so hard that they can their mitochondria because it they again oxygen can so they way but your muscle is smart it oh I need to like adapt so that the next time I mitochondria and the way it adapts is by making new mitochondria it mitochondrial biogenesis and high-intensity interval training is one of the best ways to increase mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle again lactate plays a role in that because lactate is that signaling molecule increases a protein called pgc1 Alpha that regulates mitochondrial biogenesis exercise snacks have also been associated with improved longevity so there snack that advantage of like everyday situations it lifestyle um sorry Vig vigorous intermittent lifestyle activity and um these these types of exercises are like let floor of a you know some office building so rather than just walking up the stairs every day which is better than taking the elevator you sprint or let say you you know walk to your office well rather than just walking you interval walk or you you sprint there you you do some sort of interval where you there have been multiple studies showing that doing 1 to two minutes of vigorous intensity exercise so people these large studies people are wearing wearable devices and so um researchers are getting their data their heart rate data and and able to measure something and identify people that are getting their heart rate up right um and so people that do one to two minutes of vigorous intensity exercise a day um sorry three times a day had about a 40% reduction in all cause mortality so that all like non-accidental causes of death and a 50% reduction in cardiovascular related mortality which is like the number one killer in most developed Nations so this is again just one to two minutes three times a day where you just you snacks it adds up it and clearly it people benefits were also found in people that identified themselves as non-exercisers in other words they don gym they they deliberately engage in a sort of exercise routine and they still have these benefits so how do you implement you know exercise snacks in your day why would you want to well there there being sedentary so like right now we all sedentary you guys are I you been in here for about what an hour or so um that is sedentary time when you sitting at your desk at your computer for 6 hours or whatever fill in the blank time even though you go to the gym later or maybe you went earlier that time that you sedentary and being sedentary is an independent risk factor for cancer um so there is reason to kind of break up your sedentary time with exercise snacks and again these would be like a deliberate sort of thing that you can do so I think that maybe if we all just kind of stand up for a second and we we feel like that thing to do right like there space for that like I don do burp right here all right actually so the to wrap this part of my talk up all you need to do is some high knees right no um yeah so finding something that you to do consistently that important right I vigorous exercise but it needs to be something that you consistently whatever it is is a region 4x4 if it definitely like you amazing um so you know the the thing is to really just measure your heart rate right that make it make it

Why you shouldn't do OMAD unless you're obese	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wPyJphfxyc	FoundMyFitness Clips 	one meal a day is not I don beneficial way to eat food unless you are uh ex you know obese or extremely overweight and trying to lose fat um and remember that going on a caloric restricted diet and we just put out an Alo quat on this if you are if you calorie intake your and know your skipping meals up to 30% of your weight loss can come from muscle now that mostly from people that are just overweight not like obese or extremely overweight when you are obese you have a lot of fat to get rid of and so the body does pull from that fat first you losing as much muscle but if you you know extremely like if you extremely overweight or obese um it really like the calorie you know restriction stuff like you are losing a lot of muscle if you meal a day I I really think that something that should be restricted to people that are really trying to you know they to lose a lot of weight	Success
Are you one of the few people who don't need 7-9 hours of sleep?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ik8uknlfag	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so the first question is how much sleep do people need Believe It or Not There are something called chronotypes where people actually there much sleep they actually need and most people okay most people need s to n hours of sleep at night however we caveat that with that you know those outlier people that have certain genes that make them not require quite as much and they can actually function quite well with less than 7 hours that that the exception not the rule	Success
The One Supplement That Actually Stops You from Getting Sick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVmi8x8s33w	FoundMyFitness Clips 	What about glutamine? Yeah, you you can do that. So, we will use glutamine conditional amino acid, right? So, in our populations when amino acid need is really high and again you it with caloric reduction and you don have that much room to go like I just can you more chicken breast. I can you more turkey or elk or whatever we doing. Okay, fine. So, we have some argument for the conditional actually coming into practice with those people. Then you have the kind of area of glutamine with gut health stuff and then we actually see that a little bit transfer over to even brain health and you specifically like postconussion protocols. That whole line then starts to come together and you go okay for our population there likelihood of all that stuff. Okay, pretty reasonable. Add on top of that safety profile. No no real downsides here. We of it. Uh yeah, we use that quite a bit actually. That few thoughts on glutamine. Um one that interesting TBI because Yep. glutamine is it you know it gets used by mitochondria as well as a source of energy. Totally. Um, and in fact, I did a lot of research in graduate school with glutamine and te-c cells and activated tea cells. And this is kind of where I got into this. I now take glutamine for immune reasons. Yeah. And I got I don seen any of the literature on long endurance athletes, you know, taking glutamine. Yes. Um, I imagine you taking mult are taking it two times a day. Are you splitting up your dose? I not. Sometime if if there I if my son all of a sudden starts sneezing, I\\ scooping. But um so glutamine is it by activated tea cells and and it just dawned on me. I research. I out of a cell culture as long as there glutamine there. Those cells are fine. They are fine. Um because they consume glutamine as an energy source. Um it used it ketoglutarate. So basically it gets converted into that. Um but I started taking it and this is total anecd often I was getting sick. I was like I was wondering if I had cancer. I then I started to glutamine and I don ever get sick anymore. Really? I serious. I the flu came up or something like that doesn respiratory tract infections, like if I get a little bit of anything, it tiny bit of a runny nose for like a couple of days. And like I haven haven really unusual as a parent, as you know. Oh my god. So, um that I take it not for recovery reasons, but for I take it prophylactically every day. Now, gut 5 10 grams. I So, like I said, so I right now I take five grams a day. No, 5.6. 6. It It if I have any inkling, suspicion that it like 20 grams. I the only downside for me is I can get a little gas when I start high dose. I think you were talking about no no downsides. I would say the only downside is if someone has cancer, they have Yeah. Yeah. colon cancer or liver cancer or something like that. Cancer cells like glutamine. I was talking about tea cells, but cancer cells can thrive with glutamine. It it people don thinking about the TBI thing that I totally you know going on off a you know tangent here, but I TBI thing if there to it. Oh no, there absolutely is. There whole we we published a paper a few months ago myself uh Tommy Wood and Federica Ki who works with me at uh Parker now as my research scientist published a a review on preventative as well as post brain injury concussion all the supplementation dosage timing all that stuff as well as whole food equivalents and that whole paper is open access so you can go through that whole thing but yeah this came out as a pretty clear one when you start than poking around into the gut health literature as well. You start going, up, this is such a clear connection between this entire chain from being sick to the brain health to the energy. You pay attention to how it what it\\ this is one of those times where it lines up and you go, get it. such cross benefit, right? Absolutely makes sense. In the gut, too, it it your gut cells are using alpha ketoglutarate. I mean, it it interesting. I think there there glutamine. Yeah. Um that I hope people are going to, you know, research that more. But we do almost always 10 grams twice a day, morning and night. Like that have any inclination or direct evidence of actual gut issues. That one. If we want to drop then back down to 10 grams total a day, like we will do that, but we will generally live at at least 10 grams a day. That said, um I I I ever get sick again, I send a a letter to you. I everybody I gave it to my son as well and he much. It thinking it was place. I was like, it could be placebo. honestly, if it was placebo, I don care. If it works, it works. But my son doesn glutamine. What are you giving? Three grams. I full five. Almost five. Yeah. Yeah. And it night and day difference in terms of the effects on the immune immune system. I mean, I know that it it doesn illness into our house, not getting a cold. This season has been unbelievable. And it has been the worst for all of my friends. Like everyone Crushed. Yeah. Everyone haven My wife probably has had one cold in a decade. Like it doesn could soak her in a bath of 16 cold viruses, she will get nothing. I envious of those people. Nothing. My my daughter is like okay, but she gets a lot. My son and I just You bring it home, it so done. And I get so mad because I like I know all these things. I do this whatever. this is my job and I can I try it. Um I put it in my coffee um or you know my tea and it does you can the coffee if you put like monk fruit or stevia you won as you probably know. You probably remember it. I put it I just act like enough water just right down and we just dose it with all the rest. It all in there. Deal with six ounces of the light and just get it out. Now, what recovery? Well, if it has that conditional effect, if it has any immune effect, it there. So, you the primary outcome to pay attention to there. Like, is it doing anything anabolically um in cexium maybe or like some other situations cyclopenic, but for normal people? No. Why we do it is the other stuff for the most part. Like all good health. I just wonder how much of the glutamine, you know, cuz I remember, gosh, it these like substrate labeling studies and it was like, you know, a lot of it getting converted into glutamate and alpha ketoglutarate and being used as energy. Yep. So, it fascinating. You you kind of wonder how much of the glutamine that you in is going as an amino acid versus the energy source. So, um, that	Success

The ULTIMATE Guide to Saunas & Heat Exposure | Dr. Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veZlasPrtTY	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so engaging in deliberate heat exposure from something like a sauna or even hot tub hot bath there physiological um adaptations and effects that happen that are very similar to aerobic exercise and those things are like increased heart rate you increased plasma volume you increased stroke volume you are getting hot your core body temperature is elevating so uh you sweat to kind of cool yourself down there similarities between deliberate heat exposure from the sauna and more like moderate intensity exercise I would say uh your your heart rate can go up to about 120 beats per minute some people can get it up a little bit higher particularly if they go in right after a workout but there comparisons of moderate intensity exercise and sauna use and it like the the Studies have shown they pretty comparable so like when you doing the activity rate goes up uh your blood pressure goes up while you doing the activity but then after the activity whether it you improvements your resting heart rate is improved and so and these things are comparable so really in some way I would say do engaging in deliberate heat exposure from the sauna is mimicking moderate intensity aerobic exercise and there have been observational studies and some intervention studies we about in a second but observational studies looking at people that are and this is in Finland where saas are pretty ubiquitous and most people are using them um so people in Finland that have a sauna are using sauna and they exercise have a better cardiorespiratory Fitness than people that exercise alone we talking about you know same volume of exercise and these people are the ones that do that but also sauna had had a better cardiorespiratory Fitness than people that only engaged in exercise and then there by Dr Yari in that have shown so he taken um he put them on an exercise protocol it was a stationary bike and then he had two groups one that just did the stationary bike with passive recovery and the other ones that did the stationary bike but then they went right into the sauna for 15 minutes and and he looked at a variety of parameters one of them being VO2 max so what he found was that those people that did the the excise bike and the sauna had a better V2 Max than the ones that only did the exercise bike and to me that makes sense because again it you little bit more um there were also better improvements in blood pressure and other lipid parameters as well in the group that also added a sauna plus the the exercise so I think there benefits to deliberate heat exposure for people that are Physically Active but also you know people that are not people that are disabled people that can on a bike people that can people that can get into a SAA and get somewhat of that cardiovascular benefit and there sorts of observational data out there looking at people that use the sauna um 4 to7 times a week they have a 50% lower cardiovascular mortality 40% lower all cause mortality and it it goes on and on so I think there utility there for people that really just can so another really important adaptation that happens when you deliberate heat exposure for something like the also a hot bath is the increase in something called heat Chu proteins and these are this is an Adaptive response so as you core body temperature you hotter these heat Chuck proteins are activated and they are the main role that they the main function they serve is to prevent proteins from aggregating and forming plaques in your cardiovascular system in your brain um in fact there know animal studies showing that if you a mouse you know like a amalo beta plaque sort of what we we get with humans in Alzheimer express the heat trock proteins make them highly Express that uh they don get the alers like symptoms and it helps with the plaque uh Aggregates and stuff so heat heatshock proteins play an important role in preventing protein aggregation they have somewhat of an antioxidant effect they important for slowing muscle atrophy uh and this is again has to do with a variety of mechanisms there lot of animal studies on this but there people you know there trials where they they basically immobilized one of their limbs for a period of weeks and then did some local heat exposure and the local heat exposure prevented the disused atrophy by like 40% so um you know I think that relative again a very relevant um weight for people that are injured or again people that are older and they experiencing a lot of muscle atrophy as well but there was also a very recent study and this is small so it needs to be repeated but people that were engaging in resistance training either just alone or then went into the sauna right after the resistance training they had greater gains in muscle mass if they went to sauna right after resistance training compared to resistance training well they actually it was biomarkers of it so I they didn muscle mass it was B markers but but anyways I think it promising area that of course I excited about I there researching um but it possib possibility for um a Synergy between resistance training between like vigorous intensity exercise your exercise program and then engaging in deliberate heat exposure as well so what are the parameters in a lot of these studies well a lot of the parameters um in many of these studies are coming out of Finland the temperature is about 174 degrees Fahrenheit and the duration spent in the sauna is about 20 minutes and that spent less than 20 minutes like let say they were in there for 11 minutes they didn so it really is a a temperature dependent duration dependent but also frequency so how many times a week you know people are getting in the sauna for anything to occur two times a week was like the minimum effective dose so if people did something twice a week it was more beneficial than once a week but people that did four times a week four to seven was really the the most robust effects so if you the most robust effect the minimum time would be four times a week you know compared to to one time a week um the humidity is usually around 10 to 20% and the question a lot of people ask is what about you know what kind of SAA what if you don sauna what if you have an infrared sauna that goes up to 145 like is that can you get comparable effects um again temperature duration dependent right so you same effect in 20 minutes in a 145 degree sauna in terms of the heart rate and the cardiovascular adaptations as you degree Fahrenheit SOA right so uh you might have to stay in there twice as long you might have to stay there 45 minutes to an hour to start to get your heart rate up again you can wear some kind of heart you know wearable heart rate measure uh device where you looking at your heart rate and you can feel it like when it starts to go up sometimes it infrared SAA there are studies out there that have compared regular hot onas to infrared in terms of cardiovascular benefits and if the same volume of time time is spend in there you to get as as Robes of an effect on blood pressure improvements as you would with a regular sauna so again you might have to spend more time in there as well hot baths have also been shown to increase some of these biomarkers like heat shock proteins that sauna has and I really think that the fact that it of the same biomarkers to me signals that maybe hot baths or any sort of modality that heart rate that something that well so I do think that people that don bath get one of those little uh pool devices that measure temperature put in your bath and keep it up to 104 degrees Fahrenheit and being in there for 20 minutes because that have shown 20 minutes at 104 shoulders submerged all the way down um and then the other question is well what about is more better um so here here I you my take then I study um I think that when it comes to the we kind of goes back to this this lady question as well I mean heat stress is a stress right I mean hypothermia is a real thing like you can get damage from too much heat so um it keep in mind that there window of you in this this kind of stressful activity like physical activity or Del deliberate heat exposure to have this you know response um it some people call it a hormetic response um to you know have the anti-inflammatory benefits the antioxidant benefits all the adaptations that happen but when you make that stress too high then it counter that stress with our adaptations right so um when you degree Fahrenheit on or to5 or whatever it is very hot and there are studies animal studies and stuff like when you get too hot you can actually permeabilize the the bloodb brain barrier um and so I know it there like and if you you there out of Dr Yari Lenin another study I can Poland uh might have still been Finland it was Finland or Poland but um they were looking at a variety of temperatures and dementia risk and alhe disase risk um and people that use the sauna and it was it repeated what Dr Lin had found so people that used the sauna frequently uh had a much lower risk of Dementia in Alzheimer if they weren that was over 200 deges fhe if they were getting in a sauna that was over 200 Dees fhe they were actually having the opposite effect and I don that a lot because it understood why and I don people to get scared but I do think it kind of highlights the role of like why do you need to go in a 215 degree like have you it and your brain is in there like so I I don Fahrenheit Ona is the way you have to do it I think you can get in 180 185 if you really want to go 190 yeah like but maybe stop before it gets to 200 de fhe so to say well yeah so the question is was is 174 degree F The Sweet Spot that is the average temperature that people in those studies were using and um I I typically do around 175 180 and I do I do put water on the rocks to make Steam which makes it hotter and iuse usually do it after workout so I already I already have my my heart rate elevated so um yeah I mean doing doing 30 minutes at 175 degrees Fahrenheit is nice I think it think I mean you benefits Studies have shown that 30 minutes at 163 degrees Fahrenheit increases heat chock proteins by 50% over Baseline so I don have to go to 200 degrees and I don know that you should um to be honest	Success
How Many Eggs Can You Safely Eat in a Day? - Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT-gUsKzhm0	FoundMyFitness Clips 	okay so the next question that was also um there was a big interest in this in this question that was submitted by David David says I keep hearing in more studies associating egg consumption with overall mortality despite the valuable nutrients they contain can you give a summary of Where the research currently stands on egg consumption and health outcomes is there any safe number of eggs per week or type of egg that is deemed safe and not controversial things okay so um I did Cover egg consumption and cardiovascular mortality which is sort of the big concern with egg consumption I covered that in crowdcast number 25 um I will I will go into it a little bit again I the number of of eggs that are safe you know per week per day that controversial that has that has been sort of spelled out by the American Heart Association and so um they think that two eggs per day are are safe and not only safe but reduce stroke risk so um I would say that two eggs per day is pretty pretty non-controversial if the American Heart Association is currently saying that that is safe um there was a study that came out of Australia that found eating up to 12 eggs per week for a year did not increase cardiovascular risk factors in people with pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes uh in general like so there was a a huge study that came out this was again from the American Heart Association it was a science advisory anal metaanalysis and they found in general Egg intake was not significantly associated with cardiovascular disease risk with the stroke meta analysis data they analyzed in fact the the high egg consumption so more than seven eggs a week was significantly associated with a significantly lower risk of stroke risk compared to a low intake of egg so one or less than one one egg per week and with with coronary heart disease there was no significant Association of zerb between egg intake and and coronary heart disease however um among individuals with type 2 diabetes there were two out of three studies that reported an association so it seemed as though there was something going on between people that had type 2 diab potentially had um type 2 diabetes and um were eating eating eggs a meta analysis of 17 different intervention trials reported an increase in total cholesterol it was very minor so so um there was an increase in by 11.2 migs per deciliter and increase in LDL cholesterol 6.7 migs per deciliter and an increase in HDL cholesterol of 3.2 Megs per deciliter compared to the control group and um the the intervention group included studies that basically I mean it it was basically equivalent to consuming between three to seven eggs per week or about two 0 to two eggs per day um I would say that like generally again two eggs per day is is what seems to be pretty safe and non-controversial the ones this one kind of study that made headlines I think it was 2019 study and um you know it had found an increased risk in cardiovascular mortality with egg consumption but then when they started to do all this co-variate and adjustment for different types of other lifestyle factors again um a lot of those associations were no longer significant you know so when you started to look at oh people eating processed meat and also then eating eggs then the association with car with um cardiovascular related mortality went away or you know when you started to take in other cholesterol components the cardiovascular mortality went away so I think that there you know again some of the conflicting data does does really come from the fact that like okay does this person have type 2 diabetes what else are they eating are they eating a stack of pancakes with syrup along with their eggs you know I think there there there are important things to consider um when you of these these studies and then looking at meta analyses and that really important because like when you they different studies compared to just one study that comes out even if it study uh you have to look at the totality of evidence and so um you know I I do think that the totality of evidence is is is really important generally speaking dietary cholesterol it amount of dietary cholesterol that actually converted into cholesterol like it even important and and that just an outdated sort of view of of um you know dietary cholesterol intake like that was like back in like the 80s you know 80s and 90s and we that our body in fact saturated fat is a much more um larger component to regulating our cholesterol levels than than actual eating dietary cholesterol which is is relatively high in egg yolk it you know up to like 300 milligrams or something like that it can be found in eggs I I will say this if you to be on the safe side again two eggs per day is pretty non-controversial and so I think that kind of answers uh an important part of David which is like what amount of eggs per day is considered safe and I would say two for sure two um when you start to go beyond that then okay then we maybe start having to consider all these other fact factors um what well what else are you eating are you sedentary are you overweight do you have type 2 diabetes there might be other things to consider that may a big emphasis on May influence cardiovascular disease risk and and I still think that it that so eggs are really great uh because it with your your breakfast which is I think a really important thing to get with each meal after the Stuart Phillips podcast particularly I convinced and um there ludine and choline and other things that are really beneficial in the egg yolk specifically um so I do I just I do think that that you know eating eating two eggs is definitely um safe I honestly you know most of the time I actually eat three I personally am eating three eggs a day so um you know obviously I concerned over over eating three eggs a day and again I think there factors when it comes to nutrition studies and when you look at the actual intervention trials where they actually controlling for things it just a dietary recall they okay eat these many eggs and they and they time you actually start to see a reduction in like stroke disease R stroke risk and stuff like that so uh I I find intervention trials a lot more compelling and intervention trials seem to by and large be very positive for um with respect to the egg consumption uh data I also try to eat pasture raised eggs because they these like carotenoids like ludine and um it just they better I mean you can tell the difference in the egg yolk when you my favorite brand is Happy eggs this happy eggs they have really really just orange and Brilliant colored egg yolks compared to you know if you just get your your standard like white egg that pasturized so um I do think that uh if you can I mean food is so expensive these days too though unfortunately it it have to choose your battles I don think that eating a non-organic egg is going to like be terrible for you so um you know I think that	Success

This Type of Exercise Kills Cancer Cells & Improves Your Mental Health	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw7UP167SYQ	FoundMyFitness Clips 	in addition to lactate exercise intensity also affects the muscle ability to produce other compounds known as myokines so these are molecules released from muscle cells that signal to nonmuscle tissues that the body is physically active you know so again it similar to what we with lactate myokines have anti-inflammatory they have anti-cancer effects they also participate in metabolic pathway is involved in fat oxidation glucose uptake um they play a role in you know in in again cancer biology as well so generally speaking the greater the intensity of exercise the greater the mocine release again it on the muscles and the the muscles are then forced to adapt and one of the adaptations is releasing myokines again um duration also matters so the harder and the longer the muscles work the greater the myokine release um some myokines are a little more sensitive to exercise intensity so is 6 was uh is one probably one of the most uh wellknown myokines it was initially thought to be a pro-inflammatory cyto kind so a cyto kind that plays a role in instigate instigating inflammation um when it is produced from muscle it acts as a mocine so it it it does play a role in inflammation but um when it produced from muscle during exercise it tissues to have an anti-inflammatory response and so um you even larger production of anti-inflammatory cyto such as I 10 in response to is six produced during exercise irisin is another myokine it involved in cancer protection it involved in bone health metabolism um and and more and then there well-known myokine known as oncostatin M and um that myokine sort of plays a little more prominent role um in you know anti-cancer effects the key here is I think that exerc um exercise intensity and or duration are really what increase myokine levels so you or three mile run probably crank it up a little more intense right you want to be at you know at least 85% your max heart rate um so you talking during that run are you going on an eight mile run maybe duration is on your side right and intensity can go down a notch since we were just talking about cancer it keep in mind that any level of physical activity is better than none so a study investigating physical activity in breast cancer and col rectal cancer found women who were more physically active before being diagnosed with breast cancer had about a 23% reduced risk of dying from any Cause And A 23% reduced risk of dying from breast cancer compared to those who were less active those who were more active before being diagnosed with colar rectal cancer had a 26% reduced risk of dying from any cause and about a 25% reduced risk of dying from colar rectal cancer so being active after diagnosis had had even stronger benefits for both cancer types so these women had a 48% reduced risk of dying from any cause and a 28% reduced risk of dying from breast cancer compared to those that were less active after diagnosis and the individuals with colorectal cancer had a 42% reduced risk of dying from any cause and a 39% reduced risk of dying from colar rectal cancer again after being diagnosed with with the cancer so I do want to talk a a little bit about you know there of mechanisms by which exercise can you know dampen cancer metastasis can um improve cancer outcomes um but there one specific mechanism that involves tumor cells escaping from the original tumor site and then traveling into circulation to other locations other organs and you know other tissues they sort of take Camp there they grow and divide and they form a secondary tumor those cancer cells cells are called circulating tumor cells and that process I just described is often called cancer metastasis right um those circulating tumor cells are in circulation for a period of time and these circulating tumor cells are very sensitive to the shearing forces of blood flow so when you exercise and blood flow increases those circulating tumor cells they actually they actually die and um this happens in a dose dependent manner so the more intense the exercise um the more sensitive they are to to cell death duration is also a key right so I mean you increasing the sheer forces both intensity and duration are key here um and and so it getting that blood flow up um intensity uh duration and um that has been shown to kill circul tumor cells um and again this is associated with more positive outcomes with respect to cancer uh survival not only um we talked a lot about you know muscles being little chemical producing factories they producing chemicals like lactate they producing myocin but they also act like sponges to soak up compounds that can be harmful to the brain so skeletal muscle has the ability to take up a compound known as k urine and convert it into chric acid which is a non-toxic metabolite um and it does this by increasing an enzyme on the muscle called curine aminot transferase so this essentially reduces the amount of curine available to then be transformed into other harmful metabolites such as quintic acid in the brain so quinolinic acid is a neurotoxin that plays a role in depression it plays a role in schizophrenia and neurodegenerative disease um and so this is just one other mechanism by which you know exercise also seems to improve mental health um it another way that again exercise intensity is important here that is what is increasing that you know that enzyme that curine aminotransferase on the muscle cells to then transport curine into the muscle so that is not um converted into the quinolinic acid um so just another another mechanism that I kind of wanted to point point out um because again intensity plays a role here with those aminotransferase Transporters soaking up more of that kerning	Success
This Micronutrient Improves Blood Pressure, Bone Health, & Vitamin D Levels	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCY6hd78Eoo	FoundMyFitness Clips 	I do want to shift gears and talk a little bit about osteoporosis so magnesium also plays a role in bone health we already discussed how roughly 60% of the body is stored in the bones it serves as a reservoir during times um when you need magnesium your body will pull it from your bones to to to get that source of magnesium as a person ages magnesium losses from the bones increase and this is partly because the body strives to maintain a very narrow stable range of magnesium in the plasma when our dietary intake is insufficient the body compensates again by pulling magnesium from the bones which is a reservoir I know I important to understand that just like the muscle is a reservoir for amino acids our body pulls amino acids out of muscle when we need to get when we need amino acids and when we protein which is not a good thing because then you end up losing muscle mass well the same concept here your body is pulling magnesium from your bones that but pulling from the bones especially when you Lifetime right you older adults this can contribute to a decrease in a very large decrease in bone magnesium content in fact over a lifetime nearly half of the Magnesium content of bone is lost in people and and there that this magnesium loss in the bones over decades can contributes to osteoporosis so ad adequate magnesium intake early in life really honestly is like an investment in your long-term bone health right because if you are getting enough magnesium from your diet and supplemental sources your body is not going to have to pull on the Magnesium from your bones to get it what it needs so Studies have shown that magnesium Rich diets in pre-adolescence uh positively positively um affect bone density in Young adulthood um particularly in the heel bone there supplementation study that found that magnesium supplementation for one year can enhance bone mass in the hips of Perry Pub puberal girls and I think this highlights again um magnesium role Beyond just calcium in building strong bones and preventing osteoporosis a lot of people think about the role of calcium also very important for bone health but getting enough magnesium early in life is I think really important so I supplementing with magnesium later in life when you already have osteoporosis I preventing your body from pulling that magnesium out of your bones so that you don you you lower your risk of osteoporosis later in life um so you know magnesium is important for ensuring stronger bones as you age and I think again think of it as an investment strategy earlier in life you sure that your body is not going to pull that magnesium from your bones year after year after year after decade after decade eventually depleting you know 40% of your your body reservoir of magnesium I think on a very similar note let and vitamin D metabolism vitamin D also plays a role in bone health but I think even more important here is the role magnesium plays in vitamin D metabolism so it another layer of you know connection that magnesium has to our bone health because we know vitamin D plays a role in bone health as well so vitamin D is important for calcium absorption and bone health magnesium by acting as a co-factor for several enzymes that metabolize vitamin D then helps make sure that we using it effectively magnesium directly contributes to bone density because it it makes up the bone right so it but it also plays an important role in bone health indirectly by contributing to vitamin D met metabolism which is a key player in bone health so the Synergy between magnesium and vitamin D metabolism I think is a perfect example of how interconnected our nutrient intake is with you know overall bodily functions and how some of these micronutrients are sort of working together and synergizing and why some trials where you micronutrient may not be enough because another one is needed because they work in concert so let little bit high intake of magnesium whether from the diet or supplements or both is link to a lower risk of having low levels of vitamin D there notable interaction between magnesium and vitamin D intakes that influence the risk of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency so what do I mean for example if a person is adequate this can enhance the body ability to maintain healthy levels of vitamin D on the other hand if magnesium intake is low like 45% or half the population roughly of the US that may hinder the body vitamin D effectively even if vitamin D intake is sufficient so this study found that the benefit of having higher vitamin D levels in reducing the risk of death um especially from cardiovascular disease and colar rectal cancer were more significant in individuals that had above average intake of magnesium building on the insights of those observational studies I just mentioned a randomized control trial helps shed further light on how magnesium supplementation influences vitamin D status so magnesium is key for enzymes that convert vitamin D3 into 25 hydroxy vitamin D which is the main circulating form of vitamin D in our bodies it a vitamin D blood test so this Tri trial showed that for people with low 25 hydroxy vitamin D levels which usually can indicate vitamin D deficiency magnesium supplementation effectively increase these levels it appears that magnesium is aiding in the conversion of vitamin D3 into this more stable form of vitamin D which is 25 hydroxy vitamin D so what this tells us is that magnesium status is not a one- siiz fits all it really varies based on your existing vitamin D levels it role in either helping stabilize vitamin D in the body converting that vitamin D3 into that active that that stable circulating form or it that c that circulating stabilized form 25 hydroxy vitamin D into the active steroid hormone depending on your individual needs I think this study really I like this study it offers a deeper understanding of like the intricate relationship between magnesium and vitamin D they micronutrients although vitamin D actually functions as a steroid hormone in the body but it also adds layers of complication to randomized controlled trials using vitamin D and perhaps there getting no effect after giving a vitamin D supplement well if half the US population is not getting enough magnesium and magnesium is required to make vitamin D function as an active steroid hormone then you have a problem those trials are they going to be flawed at the get-go and again it it just it it highlights the important role of thinking about nutrition differently than pharmaceutical drug trials we have to think about not only the the varying levels and and and different levels people have of these nutrients at the start of the trial but how these nutrients are interacting with each other and if a deficiency in one is going to affect the function of another then giving that supplement of the other isn deficient in the important micronutrient that is needed to make that other one properly function so again um I I just I just want you guys to understand why nutritional trials are so complicated and why they out there it hard to design the trial properly and to think of all these things um and to get enough funding to do them as well so um lots of things to keep in mind when it comes to interpreting the results of a trial okay let now about blood pressure hypertension the role of magnesium in lowering blood pressure so hypertension or high blood pressure it prevalent issue so it affects nearly half of us adults including 20% of young adults age 18 to 39 which wow that kind of important 20% of young adults age 18 to 39 have hypertension it for people those young adults people in their 20s and 30s to be aware of their blood pressure elevated blood pressure is not only going to increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases but it also sign ific anly raises the risk of dementia later in life and what most important factor for that is the cumulative exposure to high blood pressure so the earlier in life you get high blood pressure the more the the risk you have of dementia later in life and this is because sustained high blood pressure can lead to damage in the small vessels of the brain and that impairs cognitive functions and potentially leads to conditions like dementia as a person ages so monitoring and managing blood pressure from a young age I I think is really important and can be crucial for mitigating these dementia risk these cardiovascular disease risk so where does magnesium come into this well magnesium helps control blood pressure by boosting the production of substances like prostacyclin and nitric oxide which relax blood vessels and improve overall cardiovascular health it also AIDS in the widening of blood vessels which reduces blood pressure so vasodilation it makes it easier for the heart to pump blood also magnesium ability to fight inflammation and protect against damage to blood vessels also is another way that it can support cardiovascular health and I think this shows you know there different ways that magnesium plays a vital role in helping maintain and keep the cardiovascular system healthy so there was a comprehensive metaanalysis involving 34 different randomized controlled trials there was over 2,000 participants and researchers discovered that magnesium supplementation at an average dose of 368 millgram per day notably lowers both systolic and diastolic blood pressures this effect which is slightly influenced by the dose and duration of magnesium I think does underscore the potential for magnesium to play a role in blood pressure management perhaps in some people there are laboratory studies that also back this up that have found magnesium ability magnesium vascular smooth muscle function it it can reduce vascular resistance it can combat hypertension prevent Vaso constriction also it it have antioxidant properties in the vascular system I think all these things um help mitigate vascular damage caused by oxidative stress and and other factors as well and I think this latest research including um a comprehensive meta analysis really does a meta analysis of randomized control trials really does does highlight that magnesium may could play a role in help managing blood pressure effectively in some people also integrating you know magnesium rich foods into the diet also is an important way as well and there been a lot of studies out there showing things like a dash diet which are which include a lot of foods that are rich in magnesium is another great way to manage hypertension or high blood pressure as well	Success
This 1-Minute \"Snack\" Could Add Years to Your Life | Dr. Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xoseOw3r7g	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so let about exercise snacks which is a type of high-intensity aable training workout it involves doing something at vigorous intensity you know a vigorous intensity um heart rate for one to two minutes and they because you can just do them whenever throughout the day and it I think this is very relevant because I just came across a study a couple of weeks ago that showed 10 10 body weight squats okay 10 for every 45 minutes was more powerful at improving gluc glucose homeostasis than a 30 minute walk so I feel like that is it of puts it in context because how easy is it to get up and do 10 body weight squats right every 45 minutes I mean it doesn that and there strategically t time these exercise snacks either 30 minutes to an hour before a meal or 30 minutes to an hour after after a meal so the E so the so the timing of these exercise snacks has been shown in several studies people with type 2 diabetes or insulin resistance to really improve their glucose regulation after a meal so their post prandial gluc glucose regulation and their glucose disposal was improved again because getting that high-intensity exercise where you generating some lactate it glute for Transporters at the muscle and that is then you know causing glucose to come into the muscle it burden of your pancreas to have to produce insulin and it glucose homeostasis so exercise snacks around meals uh is an easy way to improve post post pral glucose regulation and glucose homostasis it obviously very relevant for people with type 2 diabetes but also I think for everyone exercise snacks has also been associated with a decrease in all cause mortality so there have been very large studies um out of the UK bio Bank data where people are wearing accelerometers and um they the vigorous intensity sorry vigorous intermittent lifestyle activity um studies that have been done vpa they called and what those Studies have identified is that people that do 1 to two minutes of vigorous intensity exercise and these are things like just sprinting up the stairs rather than taking the escalator or walking up the stairs and they do this this like a 1 to two minute high-intensity burst and they do this three times a day that associated with a 50% reduction in cardiovascular related mortality 50% reduction it 40% reduction in cancer related mortality and all cause mortality so cancer cardiovascular disease these are all diseases that are associated with metabolic disregulation so implementing exercise snacks I think is one of the easiest ways to get you know get a little bit of exercise get your heart rate up get that lactate generated increase your glucose Transporters but also just improve your mood to break up your sedentary time you know so being sitting at your desk for a couple of hours is sedentary being sedentary is an independent risk factor for certain diseases like cancer so I mean we what an hour at least I say we get up and we do a minute of body weight squats body weight squats all right ready okay I going we I knees all right here we go so we going to do body weight squats we going to try to get the heart rate up and we minute try to go low if you can you want to feel the burn in your quads go sideways there keep going we yet okay we halfway are you guys getting your heart rate up are you feeling it wo 15 seconds left 5 4 3 two woo all right so a little out of breath feeling good increase the blood flow to the brain but more importantly glute for transporters	Success

The ULTIMATE Guide to Limiting Microplastic Exposure | Dr. Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA6ZDzhbWxY	FoundMyFitness Clips 	okay so we about microplastics I I released a big episode on that a couple of weeks ago I make a lot of changes in my family household products and um everything from clothing to to food packaging just being extremely aware of of the plastic in our lives and so there questions that were related to plastic Steve asked one about microplastics and BPA and what the relative risks are on clothing so so remember polyester clothing is made of microplastics and what with shirts versus things like boxers versus canned foods so cans have aluminum in them cans have um aluminum cans have plastic lining that has BPA and even if it doesn still plastic and has other chemicals like PPS which are just as harmful in terms of their health effects I think from a very high level the things that I I have decided to focus on I think that it the risk of using polyester box or shorts versus shirts my take on the clothing part okay the clothing part my take is really if you working out and sweating and your clothing is going to be moving there lot of friction against your skin unfortunately workout clothes are is the time that you likely to wear the type this rayon and polyester and anything that anything that probably has pasas in it uh unfortunately so I toward more cotton like shirts and and as much as possible I I would say that you know I my fashion but I certainly have decided that I active wear clothing um particularly for my son like it he can sweat in a cotton shirt and be fine like so what right so I think you kind of just have to choose like I think okay well during development very sensitive time so maybe we should be a little more cautious with our children clothing okay um when it comes to our yeah I do think again you know if something be sweating I would I would avoid the really the the moisture wicking wicking clothing because those have p in it and pasas are the are the worst because they are really hard to excrete they our in our bodies for two to five years there accumulates the more we accumulating so so I I think avoiding the the moisture wicking kind of clothing as much as possible is is probably the way to go and also you know switch it out with some some Cotton shirts like you know like it if you shirt you know so that will say that the biggest offender in terms of microplastics and their Associated chemicals whether we talking about BPA BPS pasas phalates is consumption and breathing it in so consumption some of the big things to focus on are one would be water and water filters and we another question on this as well like some people were asking about water filters you want to have a filter on your on your on your sink whether it tabletop whether it under the sink one faucet filter or it a whole house system reverse osmosis is the way to go uh it it will filter out microplastics and nanoplastics and many of the chemicals in fact all these chemicals pasas the BPA BPS and phalates so that will talk about some brands in a little bit number two really try to avoid and again this is this is kind of my strategy that I adopt try to avoid drinking water out of plastic bottles as much as possible obviously there it you there like you see these bottles that are made of aluminum and but it they lined with plastic you have to call the company and ask I don wouldn there so much you can do right the other the other thing that heating any type of plastic whether that is a to-go coffee cup which is made of paper which has a plastic lining I just recently traveled the last two weeks and I brought this my travel mug so whether it favorite brand is I brought it with me everywhere and when I went to a coffee shop when I was at an event I gave them my mug and I said can you fill this up with tea can you fill this up with coffee I am I am not I that that of the things that I really think should be avoided is those Togo coffee monks because the heat really does make the microplastics and their chemicals break down at a much much higher rate like up to 55 times it important and that and that goes with microwaving anything that so obviously getting rid of plastic Tupperware easy easy to do right like replace it with Pyrex you know glass things that that you have any plastic in it like just make sure that you that um like I said microwave popcorn bags unfortunately are lined with the worst chemical of all past the forever chemical I don popcorn I have microwave for my family it there Change and moving forward there will be no microwave popcorn in my house so that comes to things like food packaging okay I think I think the the the strategy that I is things that are acidic things that are have like spices and and and certainly like vinegar or like fruit juice like the the fruit that and has a fruit juice it like malic acid it has citric acid that stuff breaks down plastic and so it all leeching into your food it leeching into the juice do not try to avoid doing anything that balam balsamic vinegar you know you go you get a to-go salad and there balsamic vinegar in a plastic little container I I would you know obviously there always avoid it but like that that microplastics and chemicals into the into the salad dressing same goes for um condiments right so you want to look for more glass containers your your olive oil your balsamic vinegar you want them all to be in a glass container th those sorts of acidic foods are kind of like heat they do the same thing that heat does they break down the plastic and accelerate them leeching into your um Beverages and food so that thing to consider I tried to to really avoid a lot of the packaging obviously like you know I vegetables it not getting the plastic bag to put on top of it if something comes in a plastic bag I rinse it off wash it off um wipe it off and um so I really try to avoid the food packaging as much as possible when it comes to Frozen things I mean I blueberries at a certain point like you can you at home in which case that you you single thing right so like the Frozen stuff in the in the bags is it what it is and I use frozen blueberries a related question was from Alvin about okay well how is there anything that we can do to measure our microplastic BPA past phet levels and there is I just I have a couple of tests sitting on my counter from vibrant health and they they do measure these chemicals so um and I and I think they by and large in fact I their cardiovascular panel done um I went and and gave a talk for them to weeks ago in San Jose they have a wonderful facility there I met the founders very good scientists have a lot of scientific Integrity very interested in science um they have a very evidence-based approach to testing to their Innovation and so I happy with with their testing kits I do think that there is a potential for sulfurane to help excrete some of these chemicals unfortunately not the P I don crazy that we don only way to know is to really get it get the test done before and after you taking Su sulfurane which is kind of what I is is one way to really excrete BPA and BPS and phalates because it it hasn to do that but it does dramatically activate the very enzymes that do make BPA from being turn it from being more fat soluble to water soluble so that you excrete it through the urine we know for a fact that people taking sulfurane excrete other toxic compounds that go through that same pathway such as acryline and Benzene so with that said I am I sulfurane game again and um I do think it is a good detoxification type of supplement that is broadly applicable to a variety of air pollution pollutants and plastic pollutants as well another related question regarding microplastics and their Associated chemicals had to do with the sauna so you do do excrete some compounds from sweat including BPA it a not it is predominantly detoxified from the body through urine a little bit comes out through sweat now there are other chemicals like heavy metals that are predominantly excreted through sweat so for example Mercury um cadmium so there sweat and some BPA is also excreted but if you of the body it urine that the question was if you get in the sauna and you lot of perhaps heavy metals a little bit of these chemicals that are coming out and now on your skin and then you take a hot shower does it get reabsorbed into your skin um I don that there it possible it things trans dermally I you really have to like get in a sauna almost and open up the pores and just really really really open those pores to really get even anything transdermally absorbed so I would say if it is it with that said it does make sense to kind of wash your skin with some soap after a a big sweat session I mean I mean there and then I mentioned that we talk about some Brands Deborah asked about um what what I exposure this is all the stuff I talking about that I getting a so I filter as you know berky does filter out these chemicals like like BPA and and um pasas and phades and um also some some microplastics as well I don if it goes as far as the nanoplastics but it am now getting a whole house system reverse osmosis filtration system after a bunch of research I to the conclusion that I Crystal Quest reverse osmosis whole house system they have um they have these stainless steel tanks um which I like and also um so instead of plastic tanks and and they have a Remer me remineralization filter as well so it remineralizes the the water so that you actually can have the minerals put back into the water and then I think avmacol is my other biggest tool that I in in addition to sweat sauna um I doing hot yoga occasionally as well but also just trying to get you know avoid using as much plastic as I possibly can certainly when I doing things like drinking coffee on the go I bring my I bring my mug I not I coffee mugs oh and the other thing that I think there this is my cookware so I don silicone is okay Gary silicone needs to I think that needs to be shifted shifted out unfortunately um so if you do any baking with muffins don silicone muffin container trays so um I I have gone through and I I use I using um all clad uh they do a lot of titanium stainless steel cookware so that favorite brand but I moving away from even the ones that are like oh this is a nonstick but it doesn even want anything nonstick like I don even care I don or Greener or whatever I I just want the basic I want the basic cooking because the heat is just so much of a catalyst for breaking down any of those potential plastic chemicals or um you know whatever whatever it is it lined with that I don	Success
Scientists Discovered How to Reverse Heart Aging By 20 Years (Here's How)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTp9P821noA	FoundMyFitness Clips 	And there you know, you can take you can take a 50-year-old person who is sedentary. So they but they don disease. So they don cardiovascular disease or hypertension. And put them under a pretty intense exercise protocol for two years. And basically you can reverse the aging of their heart by almost 20 years. So this study was done by Dr. Ben Lavine out of UT um Southwestern in Dallas. And um what he showed was you know so as we age our heart structure gets it changes with time. So it gets our heart gets stiffer and shrinks and that plays a role in increasing our cardiovascular disease risk. It plays a role in you know affecting our aerobic capacity. So what he wanted to know, he asked the question of can I can I take these people that are essentially have been sedentary their life their whole life but they don can I can I make their hearts look better and so um his group put them on a pretty intense exercise protocol for two years and it was a progressive loading so you know it wasn gate they were doing 5 hours of exercise a week you know which is essentially what they were doing at the end of the two years they were doing about 5 to six hours of um a lot of vigorous intensity exercise, moderate as well, but they were doing highintensity interval training. They were doing something called the Norwegian 4x4 protocol. This is, you know, you of, you know, as as hard as you can maintain for that four minutes. So, you know, most people are probably doing 80% their max heart rate or something like that or they obviously. And then you recover for 3 minutes and that going down to let your heart rate go down. And then you do that four times. They did that once a week on top of just doing a lot of aerobic, you know, training. And they were able to reverse the aging, the structural changes to their aging heart by 20 years, which is incredible, you know, absolutely incredible. You take a 50-year-old and make their hearts look like a 30-year-old. I mean, who wouldn wouldn You hydroxybutyrate or lactate. And what what do we know? Again, another like what do we know or not know about um the the impact of of vigorous exercise versus endurance exercise on moving the needle on cardiovascular health. I mean, they health, right? You know, like I what I was mentioning was the cardiorespiratory fitness aspect. And the reason I was mentioning that is because almost half the population isn if they moderate intensity exercise where they for 2 and 1 half hours a week. I like to mention that because it seems as a sizable part of the population really does need a little bit more stress for their body to adapt for whatever reason. Um I don understood but what is understood that it is does occur. And so, you know, I do think again, you don apples to oranges. So, like a lot of times we endurance athletes are doing and they doing a lot of zone 2 exercise, right? But they don who mean, yeah, nobody should really look at that as a as a benchmark to decide what they people their zone 2 is very unlike the average person because they many years and they base like the they that they be you know beyond the threshold of an average person. So they putting a a even though they cardiovascularly they can handle it, they strain on their ligaments and their muscles and things like that that different from the average person. But in that conversation, I think it needs to be said that um what endurance athletes or or any like you know elite athlete understands is is the idea of training on these polarities. And I think the average person spends most of their time somewhere kind of in the middle. They hard for zone 2 if they only have a couple hours a week like zone 2 because they not getting anything out of it and they enough to get into that threshold vigorous state required to catalyze all of these kind of benefits that that you like slowing down and then knowing when to speed up and how you create that mix and the construct of how many hours a week you these things, right? And then don forget we have to add in some strength training and resistance training, right? So, I mean there have to work and take care of your family and so, you know, it it there lot of factors here and I think that where I I personally do like the, you know, the I guess option to to go a little bit harder and not have to spend as much time um and and at least be able to make improvements to my cardiovascular system, to, you know, cardiorespiratory fitness and get things like the the lactate and not to mention you benefits like you number of mitochondria in your muscle, you know, it biogenesis and that doing moderate intensity and high intensity, you know, exercise does that. But over time, isn effective way to build mitochondrial density? So, it depends. If you you comparing someone that is doing a 30 minute zone 2 run versus a 30 minute more vigorous run, then you you mitochondrial density more by doing the vigorous intensity. And that is because lactate itself actually signals to your mitochondria to make more mitochondria. And the reason for that is because your your it freaking out. Your body use my mito I quick enough to make energy with my mitochondria. Therefore, I need to make more mitochondria to try to adapt so that I can use the mitochondria to make the energy. Do you see what I So, so the high intensity, so the vigorous intensity exercise stresses the mitochondria in a way through lactate that number. Um, but you know, zone 2 training can affect mitochondrial size. So it can make mitochondrial it can increase the mitochondrial size and so there are differences there but um generally speaking if you were doing the same volume of training then a more vigorous exercise would actually improve mitochondrial density more. Now if you were to then take and do like let you were going to do an hour long zone 2 versus you know the 30 minute then maybe you start to get more differences right. So again it what we oranges like are the same durations the same or because most of the time if you a longer duration anyways right then that intensity interval training is it efficient right so you can get more bang for your buck um in some regards now there are differences as well and certainly for people that are endurance athletes they have to spend more time doing doing more um zone 2 but in no way would I ever say or think it to say that doing vigorous intensity exercise is not improving your mitochondrial function or improving mitochondrial number or density because it absolutely is um it strongly improving mitochondrial function and mitochondrial density. So um I wouldn you engaging more in highintensity interval training and not doing enough zone 2 either. Um so I think there confusion out there with with that. So just want to clarify that. Yeah.

Rhonda Patrick on the Crazy Brain Benefits of Saunas	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5LzvgD8tzc	FoundMyFitness Clips 	well shifting gears to you mentioned the the mental and um potential benefits that protect against neuro degenerative diseases like Dementia or Alzheimer that research on that that keeps me using the sauna regularly even if I don have time is that potential significant reduction in dementia risk so could you talk a little bit more about that research and yeah what protection from neurod degenerative diseases well the research looking at sauna use and specifically it at Alzheimer really limited to just observational data in which case son use is associated with a much lower RIS so like I said around 60% 60 to 66% lower if people are using the sauna four to seven times a week now why that is is um a probably you know again very interesting question probably something coming down to cardiovascular health right so if you if you cardiovascular health you have increased blood flow to the brain and that protect against dementia um but there also some evidence and this kind of gets into some into some of the molecular details with um son use and something I shock proteins and heat shock proteins as their name implies are activated by heat stress um and so sauna robustly activates them there looking at people that have sat in a about 163 degree Fahrenheit sauna for 30 minutes they their heat chock proteins about 50% over their Baseline levels so what are heat shock proteins and why do we even care about them well heat shock proteins are a stress stress response protein and we can talk a little bit more about what that means later but um essentially what they do is they help proteins inside of your cells they help keep their three-dimensional structure so every protein in your body has a threedimensional structure and that these proteins in our body that are doing everything all the work inside of our cells they they don forever they eventually you know they get chewed up and degraded like in a in a in a garbage can basically can think about it and so um sometimes you know that doesn age it definitely starts to go arai and so heat proteins kind of help prevent that from happening so they help prevent proteins from um becoming disorganized and destructured because when they become that way they tend to Aggregate and they can form Aggregates and these Aggregates can then form plaques and these plaques can form in places like the vascular system or they can form in places like the the brain so probably the classical example of plaques in the brain are amalo beta 42 plaques that are associated with Alzheimer there animal studies that have found that elevated levels of heat Tru proteins can protect against the formation of amalo beta plaques and they can help prevent Al an Alzheimer disease in in animals so um there been a lot of evidence of that and that I think is one interesting angle because saunas are well known to activate heat shock proteins and once they stay activated for about 48 hours I mean they um you know so constant when you talking about someone that four to seven times a week you know we don a person and measuring their heat shock proteins like each day but you know one could imagine that you would you would see that heat shock proteins are way act way elevated over what their normal Baseline levels are and so what you having is almost this constitutive activation of this of this family of proteins that essentially help prevent plaques from forming um among other things so so I think that interesting angle as well uh with respect to to neurogenerative disease and in fact one of my first experiments um when I was an early researcher at the Suk Institute for biological studies in La Hoya I was doing some research on nematode worms celegans where we were injecting them with amalo beta 42 the peptide fragment that associated with Alzheimer causing these plaques in the brain we injecting them into these worms and um into their muscle tissue and it it causes the worms to become paralyzed because they have all these protein aggregates in their muscle and they can distinct phenotype you look at them under microscope and they they their nose around and feed but they can experiments where I would boost up their heat chock proteins and like it totally corrected that like these worms even though they had even though we were giving them amalo beta 42 it it totally corrected them from um the paralysis because the amalo beta 42 wasn I original study that I you know had done with my own hands and it kind of made this this aha moment I heog proteins are doing something cool is that how you actually got interested in sauna use in the first place from that re um it the molecular some of the molecular aspects of sauna use I would say that uh the real way I became interested in in the sauna um and this will take us into other brain function aspects if you okay with that um so when I was in graduate school I lived across the street from a YMCA and I used to go use the sauna almost every day before I would go into the lab and do my experiments and um as any graduate student or buddy young scientist or even senior scientist will tell you um experiments fail they they fail all the time and it hard uh so so graduate school can be very hard because you being just bombarded down it you work well that didn goes six months of work you know and it what I started to notice was that using the sauna before going into the lab my my ability to handle stress was is noticeable like I was much more capable of handling stress my anxiety was much lower I mean it was very very noticeable for me where to the point where I was like like something don and so I started diving into the literature you know way back then in in like 2009 you know so um that kind of got into the sauna um and the effects on the brain and actually in the publication that that um we published last year I kind of uh Rift a little bit on some I would say it more of a hypothesis than anything um in terms of the reason for that you know when you you endorphins much like exercise so um it sort of the same same effect so endorphins are those feel-good opioids that your brain is producing the counter to that Feelgood endorphin is the it called dorphin the endogenous counter to it dorphin is is that chemical in your brain that is responsible for making you feel dysphoria not so good um so the kind of feeling you get when you really hot you you is hot or you know or when you for your long-distance run and it feeling of of you just don but you have to push past it right you push past it so um dorphin is something that that period and dorphin is actually involved in cooling the body so I think that brain is making it when you you temperature um and the interesting thing about dorphin is that although it responsible for the dysphoric feeling it binds to a receptor in our brain called the Capa opioid receptor um when it binds to that receptor it ends up doing this whole feedback loop and this is like the beauty of biology and the feedback loop is that those feel-good endorphins that we make bind to another type of receptor called the MU opioid receptor and this is the same type of receptor that morphine and opioids also bind to that help make people feel good um they help with pain and stuff well Kappa opioids when you when you buy into that receptor that dysphoric feeling it changes the MU opioid receptor it basically um makes them more sensitive to endorphins for a longer period of time and so uh you know I sort of have this hypothesis that like well you get in the sauna and you you you know you you push past that like this feels terrible it you push past it a little bit um you get done with it and and and then the endorphins that you make a day later or two days later or five days later from laughing at a joke or forgiving giving your loved one a hug or whatever it is that you they bit of a tangent but that got me interested in in using the sauna and um as as you mentioned and alluded to earlier there is there lot of empirical evidence that has now come out since that time looking looking at the effects of sauna use on mental health and specifically depression so um Dr Ashley Mason right now uh who I looking at sauna use and um people people with depression um that have not able been able to manage it with um different types of standard of care treatments and so um she a work from her former Mentor Dr Charles Rison who found that basically elevating a person to 2° was able to give people an anti-depressant effect that lasted like up to six weeks with a single use and this was compared to a sham control um they use this device that basically um made people feel like they were getting a little bit hot but it wasn hot enough so it was a really great Placebo control because people thought they were actually getting the treatment um Placebo controls are very important particularly with depression studies because a placebo response is a very real response so um so that was that was a really a seminal study looking at you know just a single session of son use and how it had a very robust anti-depressant effect up that lasted six weeks in these depress depressed patients compared to blissa control now Ashley Mason is now she on this and she sauna and she the core body temperature you know one to two degrees and um and she one session she sessions and and uh we variety of biomarkers to understand why that is like is there are there changes in the immune system um and and there some preliminary evidence to suggest there are you know there there have been quite a few observational studies looking at SAA use and how SAA use is associated with lower biomarkers of like SE reactive protein so these are markers of inflammation inflammation plays a major Ro in depression as well son use also can increase il10 which is an anti-inflammatory so that shown in a um intervention study so people that have used the sauna had their blood drawn um before and after there was some evidence that that I 10 was elevated after using the sauna so there you know the immune changes may be going on and changing it in a positive way much like exercise so exercise also um it it increases is six which is another cyto kind that mocine it and it can cause inflammation but it also this type of cyto kind that can cause a uh very powerful anti-inflammatory response so there we can talk about what this means hormesis there aspect to it um so so that interesting as well yeah and and with those depression studies and the hypothesis for why um SAA use wow I mean it potentially a six- week benefit for patients that are um uh having depression could part of the hypothesis be that they because you mentioned are endorphins and our internal opiate system and how son use can sensitize those receptors so the opiates our own opiates inside of our body work better is that one of the hypothesis too of why this can help patients who are depressed it is it is and we out how to measure that like there there we collaborators and actually we do have some some collaborators that are um potentially going to help us kind of figure out how we can test whether or not that that is playing a role it it playing a role for sure I think there multiple things that play here and I think that one of them is is the the change in the opioid system in the brain for sure but you can receptors and and sensitivity and UPR regulation like you can in an animal right like in people like that know we yet um with with our technology so that would that would be something that would be really cool but um but there are some other things that can be measured in plasma	Success

Rhonda Patrick's Smoothie Recipe (and why she stopped adding bananas)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpOTf7pWq70	FoundMyFitness Clips 	want to like start using this in a in a practical way right like so if I um were to make a smoothie in the morning what is the best thing to put in my body at the start of the day after having slept which means I fasting um what is like the the the most incredible smoothie you can think of that would just be full of health benefits for the day so it would have like omega-3 it would have protein powder it would have like leafy like walk me through this what do you do you do this I do smoothie it does it doesn have omega-3 but I my my my smoothie that I do I I probably about four to five days a week have have this smoothie and um typically this smoothie is about I don leaves and that source that I use and so I Magnesium I getting the folate but I something and they zanthin which is these are carotenoids much like beta carotene or aanin like we were talking about it accumulates in the eye rods and cones of the eye so it helps prevent macular degeneration but it accumulates in the brain as well and it because there shown that that like giving older adults like supplementing with something like like 20 something like 20 migs which is what like three k leaves has of lutein I mean it getting it from the greens um it improves neural efficiency so so basically like your brain works better with less energy um there studies in older adults where giving them Lutine and zanthin will improve crystallized intelligence so that basically as you get older it ability to still kind of use all the information that you throughout your life and like still use it I don um so anyways I know I tangent here but it people don compounds in these in these greens that are not micronutrients they essential vitamins and minerals and amino acids and fatty acids but they like these phytochemicals and they interesting because they beneficial for us and lutein and zanthin is another one another one of those they essential but they things and they brain it there showing that it improves again those those markers of cognition that I mentioned um so so that also has fiber right fiber is great for your gut and then um I also add an avocado and avocado also increases the bioavailability of those carotenoids the lutein and zanthin by like up to sixfold anywhere between like three to six fold so you zanthin you more bioavailable by adding the avocado also it unsaturated fat avocados are high in potassium something like 96% of the US population doesn and so that getting from avocados I I personally like it because it makes the the Smoothie creamy and then I add a ton of frozen blueberries um and blueberries are yes you and you Fiber for the gut but they are also high in those phytochemicals so they have polyphenols in them and they have um anthocyanins and these things are they so there have been done randomized control trials either with freeze dried blueberry extract or actually just blueberries showing it improves cognition um yeah it improves mood so when I was a postdoc I studied um I did some studies in people we were looking at freeze-dried blueberry powder I was looking at DNA damage in their blood cells so markers of those double stranded breaks I talked about like if you don double stranded brakes if you stand in an ionizing radiation machine it causes double stranded brakes blueberries um people that are people that are eating terrible diets and that are you know overweight and obese have more double stranded breaks in their their blood cells so that measured you know like I was doing some studies on that during my postdoc work and um we were getting a population of people that were overweight and obese and then giving them this free dried BL blueberry extract and over the course of four eight weeks it lowered their DNA damage so again so it anti-inflammatory antioxidant um you know aspects to it personally it is like the mood and ancer it get that blueberry and it but here used to add bananas to my my my my smoothie years and years ago like 10 years ago or something and I liked the banana because it also it was like uh made it more creamy this is before I like started doing the avocado and you know there are bad for you but they have this enzyme in them called polyphenol oxidase po well as the name implies it breaks down polyphenols which is what you want from the blueberries to get the benefits in the brain and the benefits yeah exactly what your mouth a jaw drop yeah it recent study in 2023 that came out and this was a controlled trial where people were given a smoothie with blueberries either with and without the banana and then metabolites of polyphenols were measured in their in their urine and blood and if they had the banana their polyphenol level were just plummeted like they weren blueberries and this is I what go you like if you want to buy a smoothie when you everything has a has a banana in it and you know like I you know I kid with me and it him a smoothie and it has blueberries in it and I and I studies on children as well and giving children blue blueberries improves their their cognition so they they perform better on like tests cognitive tests and stuff and so you know it for adults it lifespan and so now I have to like tell them okay don everywhere you go there this so that my smoothie recipe after and you can grate it but I the banana starting tomorrow but okay so we have kale leaves avocado frozen blueberries and protein powder so um prot pow especially if I you said first thing in the morning when I smoothie in the afternoon in which case like if I didn gotten my protein like I won protein powder but these days I always putting them to be honest I like doing something every day and so and I just it requirement for me so I usually do um some whey protein and then I also add a little bit of hydrolyzed collagen powder as well so uh there studies showing I mean if you the protein you probably don hydrolized collagen powder but there I personally there um randomized control trials showing that it improves like skin elasticity and you know things that I also interested in addition uh with respect to skin I mean there of studies also showing it helps with joint health and this and that I mean so um you know I don that as well and then the other thing I add is I do a little bit of Moringa powder so Moringa is it in some micronutrients like it has things like zinc and iron and magnesium but it also has something in it that is called um moringen and it is a phytochemical that is very similar to sulfurane which is found in like broccoli broccoli Sprouts it high in broccoli sprouts and it activates genetic Pathways in our body the same ones that sulfurane activates that have been shown to increase antioxid in the brain like glutathione that have been shown to lower DNA damage in our cells all sorts of benefits but the other thing that it does and I noticed this so I used to wear a continuous glucose monitor like for years and um it lowers it blunts the postprandial glucose rise from a smoothie when I put Moringa powder in it and I reached out to an expert Dr Jed fahe who know these compound compounds and I was like have you seen anything and he like oh yeah this is being explored he like totally knew about it and um as you look into the literature you can start to find some studies on Moringa actually improving blood glucose levels and so I put that in my smoothie as well now that say if you where you don so great tasting smoothie you know you can skip the MinGa or go go for a smaller amount but I do like a big heaping tablespoon of it and then I add some water yeah water to kind of mix it up that you my smoothie you can give me a grade on this and keep in mind I a parent uh of two boys who devour food so we came up with this and I the the exact recipe before but here here it the Tom Brady because they they wanted to call it the goat smoothie so we ended up calling it The Tom Brady so we this is what we call it at him it powder in it it it yogurt almond milk but like real almond milk no other additives or anything banana chia seeds and hemp seeds yeah so you Omega-3 that like walnuts and chia seeds um is ala and um we were talking a lot about the EPA and DHA which are from the Marine sources ala I I now walnuts are great there if you eat a handful of walnuts a day you risk and cardiovascular disease risk they they and DHA so don you you can so your body does convert ala from plant sources of Omega-3 into EPA and DHA which is essentially what your the final products that you need are but everybody does it differently and the conversion efficiency is about 5% now women when they they really that can go up much higher and um I think that pregnancy and child development in utero the the DHA is so important that your body makes sure you all that ala into that that DHA because when you go go it like super high but um so if there are people that are relying on just plant sources of Omega-3 that is a mistake and if you do an omega-3 index test and there know Omega Quant is probably one of the best places to do that um then you figure you quick that you great right so like what would we supplement here we we take out the bananas and because they counteracting the blueberries we avocado that what else would we like take out or add or or switch what would you say so you your source of green uh I as sort of like the base vitamin because they have a daily multivitamin and I just count that as their daily multivitamin okay but what did you add any greens in there I didn would be that would be something that I would like add some sneak some kale leaves in oh my God if they saw that they wouldn do they do they have to make it to be part of it so I put K leaves in my son um or even romae lettuce you know that would be don here not a lot of foods that can go into a smoothie that would degrade the polyphenols because they enzyme polyphenol oxidase but the ones that are are bananas and and beets and anything in that family so like chard I used to put chard in my smoothie like like Swiss chard you know like they so it foods to eat like just don your smoothie blue with blueberries exactly um so I I mean I used to put chart in my smoothie and and it was just like like this this like changed my world I was like this is unbelievable I can doing the banana and my smoothie quite in fact I kind of just got lazy and it was like okay kale I just need like a base of like greens you know what I mean thankfully like years ago so even though this study just kind of came out last year I that I wish I I knew that they to blame me for their poor test results now they know you sent us to school with blueberries and bananas dad like what were you thinking are they are they Physically Active cardiorespiratory Fitness is another thing that correlates with academic performance so like the better fit the child is like that they score better on a lot of academic tests as well	Success
The Norwegian 4x4 workout for improving VO2 max	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgwWjLpssJ0	FoundMyFitness Clips 	or there of the best ways to improve your V2 Max and that is where you go four minutes at at an intensity um that that you can maintain and sustain for that entire four minutes usually it about 85% max heart rate so you pretty hard um for the entire four minutes as hard as you can maintain for the entire four minutes and then you rest for three minutes rest as in low intensity very low you want your heart rate to come down and then you do it repeat four so you do it four times	Success
This is why you shouldn't eat before bed	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5La_xaeitYs	FoundMyFitness Clips 	part of the effects on insulin sensitivity and also just on blood glucose levels has to do with melatonin melatonin most people think about as being a hormone that regulates sleep and it does it it plays a role in making you sleepy it seems to also play a role in making other organs not just the brain sleepy there evidence that melatonin inhibits so there are melatonin receptors on the pancreas and the pancreas beta eyelid cells are what produce insulin and um when melatonin is secreted it signals to your pain pancreas it down it making insulin it it it shuts down insulin production in the pancreas so you start to naturally make melatonin about 3 two 3 hours before your natural bedtime and so if you before you melatonin production is already started because that right and so you make yourself produce less insulin and therefore your blood glucose levels will be more elevated after a meal and they will stay elevated in the morning as well	Success

This Is Why You Need More Protein | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2SlIQFsp1s	FoundMyFitness Clips 	let for approaching this and so we about micronutrients a little bit let talk about macro so I mean so I sitting here talking about all these micronutrients and it it was like vegetables was a big thing we were talking about right but we also hit on Omega-3s and that was fish protein right so fish is a source of protein protein is you know amino acids are something that we need to get from our diet every day and you know we much like we store glucose as glycogen in our liver and our muscles we store fat like triglycerides right adapost tissue we don store amino acids Although our muscle skeletal muscle is kind of a reservoir for them and during periods of fasting or low protein intake we pull from our muscle to get amino acids because they does that mean that means you important protein from your muscle and that does cause muscle atrophy so you want to avoid that right and so in order to help avoid that all these you know regulatory committees had come up with let people need to take in every single day to avoid those losses right you don want to be pulling it from your muscle you want to replenish everything that that you and and so studies were done many many years ago and that number came up to be 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight is what was the recommended daily allowance for protein intake um fast forward decades you know you all this new science and new technology that measuring things and you know any scientist will tell you that your data is only as sensitive as you know the the tools that you data from experts like Dr Stuart Phillips and others they started to you know look into how you measure protein losses and amino acid losses and and and turns out that the studies that were done decades ago were using tools that were o they were basically underestimating the losses of amino acids so it turns out using new techniques that are more sensitive that in order to just prevent your body from like pulling from you know your your your skeletal muscle to get amino acids the minimum amount of protein you need to take in is actually 1.2 grams per kilogram body weight Which is higher than the 0.8 grams per kilogram body weight right so um and that like the minimum amount you need to prevent Lo like you again to prevent your your body from pulling from muscle and um and they also did some studies looking at well what if if you physically active right you causing damage to your muscle you using a lot of energy I mean lots of things going on um that number goes up to 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram body weight and um this was a big eye opener for me a couple of years ago when I talked to to Dr Phillips and started looking and reading his research because I always thought people were getting enough protein I thought oh well people are getting enough and turns out a lot lot of people are not getting enough protein because they are not getting that at least that 1.2 grams per kilogram you know body weight bare minimum and and so um that I think is you have to think about okay well where do I get my protein meat is all animal Meats probably one of the best sources because essential amino acids are very highly concentrated in poultry and Meat and Fish um if you vegan you just have to really work really hard and supplement with protein powders and stuff to kind of get that amino acid composition up is is all sort of like uh animal protein the same like is I I would imagine you need a a complete set of sort of amino acids for it to be the most bioavailable in your body I don here obviously uh but is there like a big difference between steak and chicken and sort of other sources of protein that we typically think of there are differences with respect to their their micronutrient profiles in in general like you know like steak has a lot more iron for example you know there of zinc in like shellfish like oysters so you know but with respect to just the essential amino acids you know like getting them from those any of those sources like like fleshy sources you know meat poultry um fish is pretty good with respect to like protein you will find that they know food that you there denser in meat than fish or something like that but um yeah there there are there are subtle differences between them but also just in the whole micronutrient profile itself right so like some of them have more zinc some of them have more you know Iron some of them have more B12 so things like that also and then fish have the omega-3 much more than steak so there speaking there their like micronutrient composition generally speaking but with respect to the essential amino acids like if you really trying to hit that 1.2 to 1.6 grams a day per per I mean 1.6 grams per kilogram body weight that important that of protein it is it actually it a lot of protein especially for people that are physically active and you might be going well why why is that so important well like you know so if you are if you are constantly pulling amino acids from your muscle it from your retirement fun early right like because when when you so our our muscle ma Mass Peak is probably I would say anywhere between 20 to 30 years old is when we after 30 as you get into 40 you start going down and and then you know you get to 50 even more so you start to it gets harder that important as you age so important to maintain your your yeah I mean there lots of reasons we can talk about aerobic exercise versus you know resistance training but resistance training is the other way to stimulate like skeletal muscle protein synthesis and increase muscle mass but also muscle strength both of those decline with age and you want to try to build up that muscle mass Reservoir earlier in life kind of like you do what your retirement fund right like you want to build it up because you it no matter what even if you out later in life you be pulling from it because you just lose more muscle mass and strength as you age it so the more the more you can kind of counter that with resistance training with making sure you protein then the better off you to be but you know it again it if you didn never too late like that also to like keep in mind like don give up like oh I late for me um no because like you can you can get gains in muscle mass and really actually great gains in strength particularly with resistance training uh protein intake is one easy thing like a lot of people like like Elder like our parents like so you know not everyone exercising right they resistance training and so get that protein intake becomes even more important at that that point and something also that you might find interesting Shane is that we about Omega-3s so there Chris mcclory um he he he he at now I forgot like slipped my mind but um he did training at McMaster and uh with Stu Phillips and he had basically done some research that have found Omega high do Omega-3s could prevent disuse atrophy so like when people are older they muscles a lot and when you your muscles a lot and you not getting enough protein you start to atrophy even more right but if there was like if he gave them a high dose omega-3 so this was like four grams a day four to five grams a day it totally prevented dis edce atrophy and this was in younger they did the study in younger adults and younger females but it was like 50% less and um Chris Dr mccl has looked into a lot of other you know he some other studies and mechanism and looking into it and he thinks that what sensitizing your skeletal muscle to amino acids in other words it you into the M you your buck so more amino acids uh are getting in when you have the Omega-3s there because yeah Omega-3s are really important for the the skeletal muscle like membrane and stuff and so it might be easier just to get the nutrients in	Success
This Type of Exercise Offsets Poor Sleep & Prevents Heart Stiffness	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmp7N83a14M	FoundMyFitness Clips 	but the other metabolic effects that are I I think are also important and again not black and white um is that if you are doing more of a vigorous type of exercise going going again to lactate being a signaling molecule lactate signals to your muscle to get more glucose in it right because your muscles are using so much glucose that your body is going I got to get more of this in here so that I can keep making energy and so what it does is it increases the production it increases the translocation of what are called gluc glucose for Transporters glute for Transporters which are just below the surface of the muscle and lactate causes them to go up to the cell surface and kind of it opens up the floodgates for glucose to come in right and um this is really really beneficial because it is a way of getting glucose out of your circulation bringing it to your muscle where you want it right so um the elevations in your glute for Transporters last for like 48 hours and it that have come out recently showing that you can do 10 body weight squats um 10 body weight squats every 45 minutes throughout an eight about eight hour workday and that glucose regulation better than a 30 minute walk wow and I myself is that why you you were just doing those before we started the podcast I doing it for the brain but um but but again so the the the more vigorous the intensity of the exercise the more improved glucose regulation you are going to have and that is absolutely time and time again proven so you will improve your glucose regulation by doing more vigorous types of exercise again through lactate which is that signaling molecule and it really important to realize we talked about the heart the Aging heart how it gets stiffer and smaller with age well the stiffness of the heart is actually partly caused by glucose in the vascular system so the longer you have glucose sitting around in your vascular system it reacts with proteins um it reacts with DNA lipids but specifically it reacts with proteins including collagen and through What reaction it forms something called Advanced glycation end products or ages for short and these things they basically cause your proteins become stiff and they and they and they last like if you collagen in your vascular system or in your myocardium for example your pericardium has collagen um it gets stiffer as you know as the advanced glycation end products form and it a con a byproduct of glucose being around for too long so people with type two diabetes for example um have you know problems stiffness of the blood vessels they you know get cardiovascular disease sooner all all sorts of problems and so I think one of the reasons that exercise plays an important role in destiffening the heart or preventing the stiffness of the heart is um because of the just enormous Improvement in glucose regulation that you exercise and um it getting getting glucose improvements from doing like zone two you absolutely are for sure especially like now if you minutes you to get better glucose regulation with more vigorous intensity exercise but you know generally speaking any type of cardiovascular exercise is going to improve glucose regulation however the more vigorous the intensity the better the Improvement and that is because lactate increases is the S is the signal that Transporters to come up to your muscle and bring in more glucose I between taking that glucose that sitting sitting around and putting it to work and the impact that that has on you know not stiffening up uh the heart as you described because you it you but your ability to regulate glucose is a different thing right like those are two different things so what what is glucose regulation you know that gets modulated or improved as a result of the high intensity exercise that doesn happen with endurance or string training I don that doesn training I just think it more robust effect if that makes more sense um and there things that are happening but I one of the one of the main things is the disposal of glucose getting rid of it right and that rather than adapost tissue where when it that you want it to go to your muscle and so really the regul role I here is like like disposal like getting rid of it through muscle right so it not sitting around in your vascular system for a longer period of time um but you know the there different aspects of glucose regulation right I I guess what I more like okay so you you you receptors on on the cells that are able to kind of take the glucose in um but on some level like metabolic health or glucose regulation is a function of pancreatic Health right like how how sensitive are you to insulin and how how functional is that aspect of metabolic Health kind of like working so does exercise have an impact like impact on the insulin sensitivity aspect of it as well yes yes yes it different areas of you know insulin sensitivity glucose regulation um with respect to Transporters bringing into muscle um you know there different things that are going on with exercise again it one thing only it the transport getting that glucose into muscle is a big it like a big it exercise does improve you know your your your blood glucose levels in general right it lowers the long-term marker of glucose hba1c but the thing about hba1c is you know it gluc blood glucose it 120 days or so I think is what it is it over um but you have to realize you know the collagen that vascular system that myocardium and your pericardium like that when you have glucose reacting with that collagen we effect that contributing to The Chronic Insidious type of stiffening of of the collagen surrounding your your heart and also in your vascular system so it role in hypertension but also in the the stiffening of the heart you know through the myocard and paroc cardium right right interesting yeah it is it it really is I think one of the the big reasons why exercise is so important for cardiovascular health also comes down to basically just glucose disposal getting getting that glucose out of your vascular system you know there thing I wanted to mention that that comes down to to sleep and you know not getting enough sleep also changes a lot of the the glucose regulatory System including insulin sensitivity including um glucose you disposal so going you know all all those things we just talked about and um what doing high-intensity interval training can really ameliorate most of those negative effects from from not getting enough sleep in terms of like glucose and and how it being regulated and that that I I learned firsthand by wearing a continuous glucose monitor while I was a new mom and not getting sleep you know the the first year I was a new mom I mean it was like I I was appalled by what was happening to my glucose like the first month I would say when I wasn you know and my blood glucose levels were looking pre-diabetic I mean it was like really crazy because I was eating healthy you know I wasn of processed foods I wasn of Highly refined sugars or anything like that and that instigated me to sort look into the literature and go what is going on if you like if you fragmented sleep how is it causing diabetes and sure enough there after study after study I mean just endless data out there showing that it does and then I came across some studies what I what I started to do was spin class and noticed that it was totally better like my it lasted about 48 hours so i every 48 Hours the the poor sleep remaining constant um the poor sleep was constant I mean you have to feed your you have to feed your baby mom with a baby yeah yeah but but the the high-intensity interval training I mean buffered it it really buffered it really did buffer it and then you know sure enough you look in the literature and there showing the same thing and I I do think it comes down to that again it increasing those glucose Transporters which are just when you have a really high density of those on your muscle it the blood glucose goes into your you know vascular system and the sink there and it just goes into it you know and it said about 48 Hours the first 24 hours are the most sensitive but it important it exercise is important

Rhonda Patrick's Top 5 Supplements	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZaL0iwFyy0	FoundMyFitness Clips 	I see that Mary is asking about my latest list of top daily supplements you know I just went um I was a guest on Mark Dr Mark heyman talked about this I think I think I sort of have a a top five so to speak where if you you really are looking for that 20% effort that the benefit I really think omega-3 fatty acids so you want to have at least you know 1 5 to 2 grams a day to get you to a high omega-3 index which has been shown in studies if you supplement with that dose vitamin D supplement anywhere between 2 to 4,000 iuse a day you want to make sure your levels are around 40 nanograms per milliliter between 40 and 60 two very important ones a multivitamin really I think is important because it covers all the bases a lot it you the right am ounts of micronutrients that are important for not only short-term function but also just important for a lot of physiological functions that are important to delay age related decline whether we talking about cognitive decline you know age related cancer cardiovascular disease there Pathways that micronutrients play a role in so I think a really good multivitamin sort of cover those covers those bases and then I on the sulfurane train and I take so sulfurane is a very very instable molecule so glucoraphanin is the precursor to sulfurane and um it packaged often with the enzyme myosin which is also unstable and oftentimes then when you when you take the tablet in you know as you it as um it makes its way to the microbiome um the myosin enzyme gets activated when you chew it when it broken down soor you usually aren chewing the tablet but it so you I take apol which has really been published in many many different studies It two of those a day because I think sulfurane is very beneficial for a lot of reasons one it increases glutathione the the body and brain antioxidant system it also it it it detoxes a lot of compounds that we exposed to I think BPA is one of them it hasn of indirect evidence and there of reasons why I believe that BPA and other plastic chemicals are being detoxified with sulfurane including the fact that sulfurane has been shown to activate the very enzymes that do detoxify and make BPA be become excreted through urine so um that reason why I take it as well as other air pollutants and stuff that were exposed to so I think that really important top supplement and then magnesium would be would be the last one so magnesium you know is an essential mineral that important for over 300 different entic reactions including repairing damage to our DNA which is essential for not only cancer prevention but just normal function of our cells when we start to accumulate too much DNA damage our cells start to not function properly um so and when this happens in a stem cell stem cells start to die then you start to lose your your stem cells which are really critical for replenishing cellular you know populations um within a certain organ or tissue so I think those are my top five supplements that I think that just if you had to kind of go down to the Bare Essentials those would be it	Success

How to Choose a Fish Oil Supplement | Dr. Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqSfoNJb24I	FoundMyFitness Clips 	I I think our audience will not forgive me if I don piece for just a minute I saw a debate raging on a functional medicine group yesterday about um whether or not omega supplements are contaminated with things like pcbs to the same degree that the whole fish would be and if we need to be concerned about environmental toxicity in supplements I would just love to hear your perspective um yeah my perspective again is um it is there are it quality supplement and I think there few things that are important one I think triglyceride form uh yeah lavaza and laesa and um vipa are in ethylester form ethylester is not incorporated into cell membranes quite as readily it as bioavailable it absolutely has to be taken with food preferably with a higher fat meal but um you know some people if their doctor prescribes it they to take it and that compliance is an issue so triglyceride form um is more bioavailable it does incorporate into cell membranes much better and I think that I think um oxidation status so it so fish oil is a polyunsaturated fatty acid um so it is prone to oxidation there are isolation protocols that can be done that can minimize that that oxidation such as doing it under liquid nitrogen for example and um there third party testing sites that will test omega-3 oxidation status and they also test pcbs Mercury and everything I think the best one that I use is called the international fish oil standards we website it ifos and there brands on there if you go to their products sheet you can click on the product and then they have batch numbers for all the different types of Omega-3 supplements that are out there um and then you can then look at the raw data you can look at their oxy o a status you can look at how high the Mercury and pcbs are all those things I would say the most important thing is concentration of EPA and DHA triglyceride form and then you know perhaps the oxidation status I I don think because most of these fish oil supplements are purified they they are run through a column you are they are purifying away a lot of these uh you know toxins and stuff um that it as big of an issue the most important thing though is the omega-3 fatty acids protect against the the potential negative effects like I said in the developing fetus where they more sensitive so much more sensitive to the Mercury the pcbs and everything the omega-3 fatty acids are protecting and that I get that question about but what about but what about the toxins but what about the toxins it thing focus on what we need to be getting like what are we you know if you focus on the toxins the toxins like you you it you know and so um and I think that is way more detrimental than any little amount of to you know Mercury or pcbs that are going to hitchhike in because the Omega-3s are so good at lowering inflammation and that the major things that you about with those things I mean it it to me it right where it getting so much more of that other thing that potential negative effects of the pcbs and Mercury so ifos good good source um lab door another one they don they they kind of have a different um they like rank things and so most of the time they top ranked supplement but you can go on ifos and find tons of other supplement Brands you know and and regionally so like Canada if you live in Canada you find some that are Canadian found in Canada or Europe or us and so I think that um go out there and and find a supplement that makes you feel good it got a high level of and DHA it know low oxidation perhaps lower Mercury and um you know and don the small stuff	Success

This Is Rhonda Patrick's Number One Nutrition Framework	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOUpCgM6KJc	FoundMyFitness Clips 	why don framework for approaching nutrition and decisions about the food that we consume I you know I kind of have my own framework for approaching nutrition in and it it has a lot to do with you know I I did my postto training in nutrition and um in specifically looking at micronutrients so these are about 40 or so essential vitamins and minerals that fatty acids also and amino acids that we have to get from our diet and those are in a variety of foods and different foods have different levels and quantities of them and these micronutrients are running our metabolism they our neurotransmitters that we producing so our cognition just absolutely everything that is going on in our bodies so it them because if we don have deficiencies or insufficiencies which is quite worse because um insufficiencies are kind of something that you don there Just Happening each and every day and it accumulates over time and plays a role in age related diseases like cancer and neurod degenerative disease so these um micronutrients are things like you know calcium magnesium vitamin K Vitamin D which I actually something you can mostly get from the Sun uh omega-3 and and and so when you think about the this the the micronutrients that you need in your diet it makes it a little bit easier to think about what you should be eating okay so well let of the most common deficiencies in micronutrients we have uh magnesium so almost half of the US population is deficient in or I I would say they they get insufficient magnesium intake and magnesium is it center of a chlorophyll molecule so chlorophyll makes plant gives plants their green color so it think about foods you should eat to get magnesium you should be eating greens particularly dark leafy greens so um that where it my greens because they magnesium well greens are also very high in vitamin K and um vitamin K1 there two forms vitamin K1 you need it it essential when you when you take in vitamin K1 and and something like 35% of the US population is not getting enough of that and I America and Canada are are very similar I mean we have very similar for diets so um vitamin K1 is essential for all your blood clotting processes so you like in order to like you know have your blood clotting which is important you know if you have a cut or something you know an injury you want that clotting to happen so that you don right so um so Vitamin K is also you know High in leafy greens you can also get um mag um sorry calcium as well from Green so that kind of think about greens uh the other the other way the other thing is Omega-3s right so Omega-3s are very high in fatty fish so this would be things like wild Alaskan salmon or Cod or mackerel sardines like these are good forms of fish that have the Marine types of Omega-3 so that would be DHA and EP PA and um those are very important for a lot of functions including brain health and cardiovascular health and there of evidence if you actually look at the evidence um a lot of work has been done by Bill Harris in his group at the fatty acid Research Institute and um they have they look at Omega the omega-3 index which is a way you can actually quantify your omega-3 levels and that good to be able to quantify something because if you don don enough of it right so the omega-3 index is high in red blood cells and um or sorry it characterizing it from red blood cells which is different than a lot of other ways of measuring omega-3 um like for example plasma omega-3 which is basically kind of reflective of your dietary intake the last week or so the red blood cell or the omega-3 index is more of a long-term status so it red blood cell to turnover so um the omega-3 index is a good marker of your omega-3 status and um people that have a high omega-3 index and that would be 8% or more have a fiveyear increase life expectancy compared to people with a lower omega-3 index which is more like 4% now people in the United States on average have about an omega-3 IND index of about 5% um and you compare that to for example countries like Japan where they eat a lot of seafood their omega-3 index is around 10% so and they also have a five-year increased life expectancy compared to people in the United States but um there of studies looking at omega-3 index and life expectancy and there like data where they Strat statisfy like looking at you know for example and this I like talking about this because I think it really puts in perspective you the framework of nutrition and thinking about instead of focusing on what to avoid focusing on what you need because if you focus on what you need then it obvious what you don there processed foods you micronutrients you you getting things that you need so um smoking is something that everyone knows is bad you should avoid smoking right it you expectancy empyema all kinds of problems right well um what bill Harris had done has they looked at life expectancy of smokers and non-smokers and then they categorized their omega-3 index and if you look at this data it it non-smokers that have a high omega-3 index of 8% or more have the highest life expectancy and um the lowest life expectancy is smokers with a low omega-3 index so there of the worst first but when you look at smokers with a high omega-3 index they have they have the same life expectancy as nonsmokers with a low omega-3 index in other words smoking was like having low omega-3 or having a low omega-3 index was like smoking and when I say you look the life expectancy if you look at the graph in the publication the curves like overlay perfectly it kind of freakish where you like the people that are smoking but they Omega-3 have the same like life expectancy of these people that don smoke but have very low omega-3 and that about that because I feel like it puts it in perspective for people because like I said no one about I not supplementing with an omega-3 supplement to get that those Omega-3s you know but people are thinking about oh I shouldn right so again it goes back to that framework of thinking about what you need and and starting there um as opposed to like just like okay what should I avoid because when you think about what should I avoid then you people aren they vitamin K they omega-3 and by the way magnesium you know I said about half the half the population in the United States doesn get enough um they greens and unfortunately there great test for magnesium because um our body stores magnesium in our bones and so anytime we our diet our body pulls it out of our bones to like because we need it it important you needed to make energy like without magnesium you can so nothing you also it it like every time you have you know like right now you and I we conversation you know we neurotransmitters are firing we thinking about things like that causing damage metabolism all that stuff causes damage on daily basis but our body repairs that damage but magnesium is a co-actor for these enzymes these are proteins that are doing everything for that to function properly and so if you don to do that what happens is you don repair that damage properly and that can increase the risk of getting a mutation that can lead to cancer and so there all sorts of studies that have looked at magnesium intake and cancer and you know it every 100 you know milligram increase in magnesium intake there a 20% decrease in pancreatic cancer risk and there this looking at magnesium intake in cancer risk and so the higher the Magnesium intake the lower the cancer risk so again it where you can go as you don like nothing it and I mentioned you pull it out of your bone like it and that osteoporosis over time so you know investing in magnesium so in other words remembering to eat your leafy greens is getting your magnesium so so women need about I adult women need about 320 milligrams a day of magnesium men need around 420 milligrams a day and um you know this can change based on your your physical activity level as well so like if you physically active if you sweat out magnesium you also use it up for energy so you might actually require anywhere between 10 10% to 20% more than that level so what recommended daily allowance in the United States um so you know again and people aren investing in magnesium is like a way uh you can think about like also for bone health because you know if you are getting enough magnesium on a daily basis you out of your bones and therefore you not magnesium is important for for your bones and so as you keep doing that year after year after year it dramatically increases osteoporosis risk right so there know these micronutrients and to think about the foods that you need to eat	Success
Do this before bed to boost muscle gains	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeJFGBuBxJI	FoundMyFitness Clips 	it Van lunin colleagues that protein consumed before bed is digested and absorbed overnight it also increases overnight muscle protein synthesis rates and improves net protein balance in people who had performed resistance training earlier in the day to enhance Muscle Recovery the benefits of pre-sleep protein have also been shown during chronic resistance exercise training consuming about 30 gram of protein before bed every night while resistance training appears to increase muscle mass and muscle strength another thing about pre-sleep protein is that it does not seem to reduce appetite or diminish the muscle protein synthesis response at breakfast the next morning which may have been a concern for some people overall I think pre-sleep protein is just one way to increase total daily protein intake if you don to bed hungry having a low calorie protein shake on training days may have the benefit of potentially enhancing your muscle gain on those training days	Success

This 10-Minute Exercise Reverses the Effects of Poor Sleep	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUu6BesDoE8	FoundMyFitness Clips 	Even just getting one to three hours less sleep per night for three nights in a row. I mean, think how common is it to not to get one hour less of sleep a night for three nights in a row? So common. So common. It happens to me all the time. All the time. And there studies that have looked at, well, what does happen to normal quote unquote healthy people that haven diagnosed with any sort of metabolic disease? What happens is after three nights of getting one to three hours less less sleep per night is that their body um isn properly. So their blood glucose levels stay elevated. On top of that insulin they lower the blood glucose levels and so you get this double whammy almost looking like insulin resistant or pre-diabetic if you were to just look at the hard numbers. Yes. And again, this is just from not getting enough sleep for three nights in a row. And it even like full-on sleep restriction where you you know, four, five hours of their sleep. It less. And so, I mean, it profound effects on metabolism. And this sort of accumulates. So, there a cumulative effect. It it sleep debt, right? So, when you getting less and less sleep each night, it Can you pay off the sleep debt ever? So the the the the good news is is that believe it or not at least with respect to the you know metabolic effects and also the cognitive effects is that exercise can help negate a lot of that and that own personal experience. Yeah. And your quote you have a quote on this that I saw online that said even one hour of sleep less per night for three nights can disrupt how your body processes sugar and lead to mild insulin resistance. But some good news here, HIT can almost reverse it. So, can you go with less sleep but then train hard and reverse the negative effects? So, according to research, yes. And according to my own anecdotal data, yes. And and there reasons why. So, when you highintensity interval training, so this is where you doing intervals that are hard. So you going above what you normally would do if you going like 80 85% of your max heart rate and you time. That kind of have a recovery period where you doing a lot of, you know, vigorous intensity exercise where it during that interval you can because you hard. So that here. Um, what happens when you working out really hard like that is that you to utilize glucose only. And what happens is you utilize glucose only and you make a metabolite called lactate. And everyone thought lactate, this metabolite you going hard is this, you know, waste product, byproduct. It Turns out very, very wrong. um lactate itself is not only used by other tissues. So when you your muscles are making lactate because they they body can quick enough to use oxygen um as energy basically and make it through something using the mitochondria. So basically you instead, right? The lactate then gets shuttled into the brain. It gets shuttled into the heart and liver. And it energetically favorable source of energy, it signaling molecule. It muscle communicates with other parts of the body, including going back into the muscle. And so what lactate does is it signals to the cells, hey, make more of this or make less of this. And what it does to the muscle is the muscle is going, I here because that can use. I need to make a way to get more of it. And so lactate actually signals to your muscle to make transporters for glucose. More of them come up. So, so transporters for glucose are kind of sitting below the surface of the muscle. They glucose in all the time. But when lactate comes around, they wake up. They go to the surface of the muscle and they just allow a lot more glucose to come in. Where are they getting that glucose from? Well, the glucose is from your food or from gluconneogenesis, the process of making glucose from other um materials like glycerol for example or amino acids. But is it pulling it from like visceral fat or more from the food that you just intake? Um usually it from from the food or glycogen stored as glycogen. Okay. But um the point is that those those glucose transporters that come up to the muscle stay there for like 48 hours. And so your body becomes very all the glucose that you for the next two days is getting taken up into your muscle very effectively and efficiently. And so the net effect is, you know, this high-intensity interval training is getting that glucose out of your your bloodstream and bringing it to your muscle where you want it. And so if you go back to the sleep story, you know, and there showing this that people that even do high-intensity interval training before they after they doesn 48 hour window or so of being getting less sleep, what glucose regulation resets, right? Because you that stress on your muscle to make more of those transporters and so glucose glucose gets taken in better and then it also affects um insulin signaling as well. So there that it if I get less sleep tonight, is it useful to say, a hard highintensity interval training workout 6 hours before or in the morning and really push myself kind of hard for these 30 to 45 minutes. uh knowing I gonna get less sleep and I to be on the next day like I lot of meetings and I or I know jetlagged. What will that do for your mind or your body the next day? So those studies have been done and with respect with respect to the metabolism, yes, doing it before for sure it affect. Now, if you cognition and brain function, I would say unfortunately you do it the next day after you sleep deprived for your meeting. So, you wake up sleepd deprived. You should go do it then. Right then. Really? Yeah. Right then. So, but you exhausted. You going? I forgot my keys. I got to go back. I like I now. But do you have 10 minutes? Because that high-intensity interval training can improve blood flow to the brain. It improves memory. It improves cognition and it only took 10 minutes to do it. So maybe not the 30 minutes, but 10 minutes. Not like a CrossFit style, not like a full-on like the hardest thing that you usually do when you your game, but like 10 minutes, right? Go on 10 minutes, get on a Pelaton or a bike or whatever, and you do a 10-minute whatever your program is, and it will I I do it all the time. I do it all the time because you the Well, like if I Florida, I live in California and I have to give a talk at like 8 in the morning, which is like 5 in the morning my time, and I travel, right? I will absolutely get up and do a hit first thing in the morning before the talk, even though it already pretty darn early for me. And you the last thing I want to do, but like I sit and drink coffee for 10 minutes. What coffee sounds better. I get the coffee before the exercise. That coffee sounds pretty good when you how long will that positive effect last for? If you do a you the night before, you wake up, you got a lot going on, but you to wake up and get started. You do a 10, 15 minute hit style workout. How long will that make you feel awake uh or feel sharp and clear? Like how long will that last for? I it probably depends on a lot of factors. Other factors too. I will say this. Um you mentioned doing the hit like like the day be like before you going to go you know you sleep deprived, right? And then you you exhausted. Yeah. But you know what you like I talked about doing it right before whatever whatever your meeting or your podcast or whatever it is. You have to be on on point, right? Um mostly because like that you do it say this, yes, if you do it before, you still get brain benefits because again, um, coming back to lactate. So lactate, it all comes down to in order to make lactate, you have to you have to work hard. You have to be going 85% of your max heart rate, you know, and doing that 10, 20, 30 minutes, right? The the more you do it, it That lactate goes into the brain. In fact, the brain is one of the biggest consumers of it. And it increases something in the brain called brain drive neurotrphic factor BDNF. And this is something that will help you. It it it of new neurons in the hippocampus. It increases the connections between neurons, right? So you memory, long-term memory, short-term memory as well. Wow. And it also improves something called neuroplasticity. So that is the ability of your brain to adapt to a changing environment, right? And that important. As we age, our brain becomes quote unquote less plastic, less adaptable. We can right? You like that. Like your brain is less adaptable. Well, neuroplasticity um is something that you want to you want to maintain it with age and brain derived neurotropic factor regulates that. So, um, because you getting that brain derived neurotrphic factor and there have been a variety of, you know, studies that have really shown that you you do increase it from particularly vigorous exercise. Again, the lactate is key. So, um, going back to your question, I do want to I I do want to sort of caveat what I originally said with yes, it is going to improve brain function doing it before as well. But if you immediate blood flow effect where you just you feel it like really um, doing it right before is is Yeah. kind of better. And how long do you think that would last? Like if you from LA to Florida one day, you sleep four or five hours a night, you got to wake up early, you work out, you got your speech, like how could you go till dinner pretty sharp or is it really going to last for like 3 hours? That sharpness before it starts to fade, right? Yeah. You see what I Like, all right, I did this hit workout now and I can go another 24 hours sleep deprived and still be on. No, I don Not for the brain. For the glucose stuff, it lasts. It lasts. The body, but not the brain. Not the brain. No. Yeah, it it does. You do need at least like you Yeah. Right. And you might actually need like a little nap or something. A little nap.	Success

The Dangers of Magnesium Deficiency (and Rhonda Patrick's preferred dietary & supplement sources)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JkUeSotSvc	FoundMyFitness Clips 	another one that in in the United States at least for example um is magnesium and magnesium is an essential essential mineral about 50% of the US population does not basically get adequate intake of of magnesium and um the RDA for adequate intake was set at around I would say on average it little different for for males and females but on average about 400 milligrams per day for an adult and um if you are a physically active adult so let are you know maybe using the sauna you can excrete magnesium through sweat and so physically active adults actually require anywhere between 10 to 20% more than the RDA so you can imagine if people are already not even getting the RDA um the Physically Active people are even you know in worse shape in in some some respects and magnesium is an essential co-actor it is important for the function of over 300 different enzymes in our body everything from enzymes that are important for repairing damage to our DNA so DNA damage is something that happening every day it now as we it in the mirror and see but it is Insidious in in in respect um with respect to basically it causes this low-level type of damage that accumulates over time and as we age it can lead to dysfunctional cells it can uh lead to potentially what are called oncogenic mutations that can lead to cancer so repair enzymes do not work properly without magnesium um also DNA synthesis so we we making new immune cells we skin cells every time we make a new cell we have to replicate all the DNA inside of those cells and that requires enzymes called DNA polymerases those are you basically need magnesium for those to work fun properly you know so again it process for our DNA and repairing the DNA and making sure it doesn mutations from the get-go with DNA replication and it there studies that have found these are observational studies of course all the caveats that come with off observational studies like there potentially other confounding factors but um with that in mind people with the highest magnesium levels have a 40% lower all cause mortality and a 50% lower cancer mortality compared to people with the lowest magnesium levels um there was specific to pancreatic cancer so for every 100 milligram decrease in magnesium intake there was a 24% increase in pancreatic cancer incidents so again you know sort of highlighting the important role magnesium plays particularly with our DNA and you know with respect to making sure the Integrity of our DNA the genomic stability stability of our DNA is is good um and that preventing cancer which is an age related disease it want to try to do everything you can to prevent of course there are things outside of our control however there are things that are in our control and I think um you know an easy thing would be magnesium so why is widespread deficiency common magnesium is found at the center of a chlorophyll molecule chlorophyll is the molecule that gives plants their green color so magnesium is high in dark leafy greens most people are not eating multiple servings of dark leafy greens daily it in legumes almonds are another great source of magnesium oats are great source of magnesium um so the bottom line is people aren their leafy grain supplemental magnesium uh is another possibility but you know the the dose of that is needs to be considered because magnesium at higher doses can cause adverse effects like GI problem so um what I like to do is try to get my magnesium from dietary sources like this morning I had a smoothie with some cooked kale I had some chard in it I had Frozen a couple of Frozen strawberries and blueberries and avocado so I was getting a magnesium dose with my breakfast right which was scrambled eggs so um you know having trying to find any way you can to get multiple servings of greens or almonds you know oats are another great great uh dietary source but I also do a supplement of about 125 milligrams of magnesium and I do magnesium glycinate um most of the Magnesium supplements are with respect um I would say the one that bioavailable is magnesium dioxide but you could you know magnesium glycinates a really good bioavailability has very good bio bioavailability so does magnesium malate or magnesium citrate so in with respect to supplementation with magnesium it can be a way to kind of at least get you um up to more of an RDA adequate level um also when I sauna when I electrolytes after that and that another so you can have an electrolyte drink that replaces some of the LW sodium and magnesium potassium for example so that when you	Success

Rhonda Patrick's Sauna Routine (temperature, duration, & hydration protocols)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TXdgFbABQY	FoundMyFitness Clips 	well if you would love to get into details about your specific sauna protocol that you adapted in your life how often do you use the sauna uh what temperature what humidity um you know how long do you stay in there so let those details and I I saying this is not medical advice anyone that is considering using the sauna good idea to check it out with your medical professional first in case you have a health condition that may make SAA use dangerous but um with that said yeah let incorporated into your life sure well let data that I referred to and and what the temperature duration Etc I talked a lot about frequency four to seven times a week but I didn temperature or how long people were in the sauna so in almost all of those studies the temperature of the sauna um these were these were saunas in Finland and and they were 174 Dees fhe around um and the humidity was between between uh 10 to 20% humidity I think something like that and so um what was very interesting to me when I was looking at the data coming out of Dr Yari lacan the sauna seemed to matter with respect to robustness of um of the results so I mentioned for example you know people that use the sauna four to seven times a week were 50% less likely to to die from like you know cardiovascular disease related death well that number was referring to people that stayed in the sauna greater than 19 minutes so this was about 20 minutes so 20 minutes is this is is The Sweet Spot at about 174 degree Fahrenheit you know humidity 10 to 20% um people that sat in the sauna for like 11 minutes on average their their reduction in cardiovascular disease related um death from cardiovascular disease was like 8% 8% versus 50% big difference there so um duration definitely matters uh with respect to the sauna so that where I started out with my my sort of okay what am I what am I going to do and then I also mentioned earlier about heat chock proteins I in activating my heat shock proteins um and so the the 163 degree Fahrenheit for 30 minutes activated them by 50% over Baseline levels and so um typically what I do my protocol is I do um typically when I go for my long runs I don don do do a Jacuzzi at night so um when I doing my pelaton bike I do a lot of high-intensity interval training you know uh pelaton and I crank the the sauna up you know about an hour an hour and a half before I get on the pellaton and then I go into the sauna immediately after and I in the sauna for the sauna is typically around 186 degrees Fahrenheit for me when I get in there and I stay in there anywhere between 20 and 30 minutes depending on um Pro mostly depending on how intense my workout was because I already elevated my core body temperature from my my high-intensity workout um and then there are times when I don end up staying there longer for sure I in there for 30 minutes about 186 Fahrenheit but I can doing this I certainly um did not start out doing that uh so so um definitely uh keep that in mind I also like to to put hot water so I have um I have my little bucket and um I do I do put some hot water on the rocks my hygrometer like broke um when I when I was measuring it uh I was getting about 20 to 30% humidity and then once I got 30% I was like I couldn down to 10 to 20% humidity because it just feels so hot so uh that those are my settings that I do and um I like it frequency how how often I do it it really depends on what I have going on so there are times when I know I but then there like twice a week you know so um I I do try to my my my you know my Baseline I try to keep is four I try to do about four times a week but I have been um doing a lot of jacuzzi so I doing jacuzzi at nighttime um it like the only time my husband and I have to ourselves um you know once once our son goes to bed and and so we like to go out in the jacuzzi look at the stars and it together but um our jacuzzi is about4 degrees Fahrenheit and there have been a lot of people have asked me you know can you get the same benefits from the sauna as you do from a hot path and we don have all the empirical evidence to say that yes for sure but we have quite a bit that seems to be accumulating so a lot of the you know heat Shack proteins have been shown to be elevated with hot bath brain Drive neurotrophic factors increased with hot baths um there some effects on um depression as well and cardiovascular health and so you know I I I might be going out on a limb here but I would say I really think that hot baths and jacuzzi um can have a similar effect now staying in there staying in the jacuzzi for 20 minutes with your shoulders submerged down is kind of key and some of the hot bath studies were the same the hot bath studies used 104 degree Fahrenheit water and they were people were submerged from from their shoulders down as well but that follow so you extend your workout you heart rate up on the bike or or going for a run and then your heart rate remains elevated once you get into the sauna I do yeah that is that kind of my jam I do but there are times when I I I get in there without without working out but like yeah that you know sometimes it going to get in the sauna for 20 to 30 minutes like I can I can hop on my pelaton and just push it for 10 minutes do a 10-minute high-intensity workout um and and just and take you know so basically what I my workout to the next level you know that is doing where it my workout and boom I next level so um and I always go back to that cardiio respiratory Fitness study where it better than exercise alone yep and you mentioned the hot bath could potentially be a replacement for the sauna how about just a long long extended hot shower for people that don bath yeah that you do I mean you get a lot of steam from showers as well so um you know I do think steam showers um can have some beneficial effects I don nearly anywhere near like the the data that I mentioned you know just because you you like when you can get really hot um just not getting quite as hot with with a hot shower but I do think there can be some some some benefits perhaps um I I would I would tend to go for the hot bath though if you have most people do have a bathtub I know not everyone does uh but if you do have a bathtub I would go for the hot bath over the hot shower got it and how about hydration how do you what kind of hydration protocol before and after the sauna yeah that um you know you do lose a lot of sweat in the sauna and um with sweat you also can lose a lot of sodium uh and sodium is the main one but you can also lose you know some other electrolytes like magnesium potassium so um I definitely try I definitely stay hydrated and I I switch between um sometimes I juice that I make um with like some kale a little bit of lemon um some cucumber um or so you know I the magnesium and pottassium and stuff or I supplement noon they have like a a sugar-free version of it or sometimes I do um some keto it salt and it it has a lot of it has like magnesium it has potassium it has a lot of electrolytes in it and so I I use that in fact I now um but so that what I do cool after after the sauna not before got it and speaking of after the sauna I know this is a whole another discussion but um cold therapy you know do you ever get in the cold shower or do a cold plunge jump in a frozen lake after the sauna definitely don lake um unless I country like Finland um but uh yeah I do so um I I do have a cold plunge and I also do like cold showers as well I don you know there the cold as well and and in fact a lot of these cultures that we talked about earlier like Finland and Russia like they they a large percentage of them go from hot and then into cold um I don go immediately into it um I because when you this in the heat in this like a sauna or a hot bath vasod dilation is occurring um you you know you Vaso dilation and then the complete opposite happen happens when you go into a cold plunge or cold water cold water immersion to in some shape or form you is happening and so um I some scary incidents where going from one extreme directly into the other without waiting like five minutes or a few minutes you know where my blood pressure or something just goes really low and I just like I get super dizzy and it think that EX in caution when going from extremes like that uh is important uh so but I do especially in the summertime I like to to run run out into the the cold plunge like you know a couple minutes after I do the sauna after I like rest for a few minutes two to five minutes you mentioned that you heat adapted to the sauna because of all your regular use um for someone that kind of building their heat tolerance up is there a way that they can kind of tell how long is too long in the sauna are there any kind of signs they should be looking for Like O I should probably take a break and not push it yeah I think you know your heart starts to really your heart rate starts to get elevated and you know you you definitely want to to push past that point um once you you know and you start to feel uncomfortable but you reach a point where your heart you just feel you just feel really really uncomfortable and I think that that get out I think people people should definitely listen to their bodies I mean getting out when you just experienc most slight bit of uncomfortableness maybe not the way to go but like you know when you feeling like this is I getting really hot and again like once you hit the 20 minute Mark that all that 174 degree Fahrenheit um that these Studies have shown have been beneficial for reducing cardiovascular disease mortality and all cause mortality and Alzheimer at risk so so that good rule of thumb as well you know 20 minutes and you can also have a timer outside of your sauna I used to do that I used to have a timer clock and it like okay I reached my time um so so that	Success
Cold stress & eating broccoli sprouts BOTH activate HEAT SHOCK PROTEINS	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vB2GegezFw	FoundMyFitness Clips 	pathway is called heat shock proteins and as their name would apply one would go oh they correct they are activated very robustly by heat and we can talk about that but you know you can eat a a plant like broccoli Sprouts which is high in something called sulfurane This is a a compound that um is is sort of like a hormetic compound or as David Sinclair likes to say it compound I love that I love that term um and it activates heat chog proteins among other things it also activates a very powerful detoxification pathway called Nrf2 which helps you detoxify things like carcinogens that you exposed to well guess what heat activates that so what I there is overlap like cold also activates heat chock proteins you like really cold yes it activates these are stress response Pathways and they are activated by various types of stressors now you know you more robustly activate heat shock proteins from Heat versus cold but there is some overlap	Success

How to Reduce Your Exposure to Harmful Microplastics | Dr. Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IM3Ks7JEFG8	FoundMyFitness Clips 	now I want to talk about practical strategies for reducing our exposure to microplastics and their Associated chemicals and let most straightforward action is to minimize drinking water from plastic bottles and cans plastic bottles can leech microplastic and chemicals like BPA and BPS into water and cans are often lined with plastic Coatings containing these substances but even if you there that is the quality of the water itself especially when it comes to carbonated water this is where the forever chemicals enter these are the per and poly floral alkalol substances p as we discussed earlier they are referred to Forever chemicals they are particularly troubling because they have half lives that are several years long meaning they persist in the body and accumulate over time so pasts have been linked to a range of health issues including hormonal disruptions immune system effects even certain cancers in 2020 Consumer Reports conducted thirdparty testing and they published data on several popular brands of sparkling water to measure past levels the findings were eye-opening Topo Chico topped the list with past levels at 9.76 parts per trillion to put that into perspective perer registered at about 1.1 part per trillion and San pelino which was even lower at 0.31 part per trillion both perer and San pelino are often available in glass bottles which is an added Advantage for reducing plastic exposure and I do think it encouraging that multiple Brands did achieve pfast levels below one part per trillion which demonstrates that it entirely feasible to provide safer options but this raises a critical question why do some Brands like Topo Chico have such high levels of p in 2023 Coca-Cola which is the parent company of Topo Chico claimed they had reduced their past Levels by about half however without any actual transparent empirical data to confirm this and even if it was accurate that would still leave their P levels at around 4.88 parts per trillion which is significantly higher than many other brands that have less than one part per trillion of past levels in their Sparkling Waters so I think this situation does underscore a very important point which is that we can always rely on bottled or canned water even from Brands R trust to be free of contaminants so how do we ensure that the water we think the answer lies in taking control of our water quality at home and one of the most effective ways to do this is by installing a reverse osmosis filtration system so reverse osmosis filters can remove up to 99.9% of microplastic particles from water it the best solutions for obtaining clean drinking water Beyond microplastics these systems also filter out a wide range of contaminants everything from heavy metals to bacteria and even chemicals like BPA and the past forever chemicals now it is important to note that reverse osmosis filters don remove the bad they also strip away beneficial minerals and Trace elements so this is everything from calcium magnesium potassium sodium phosphorus a variety of others zinc iron copper and selenium iodine maganese and on and on there essential for various functions in the body obviously everything from bone health to nerve zling but there are practical solutions to this issue many reverse osmosis systems now come with a remineralization filter option that can add back these essential minerals and Trace elements back to the water after they high quality mineral drops that can be added back to the filtered water or people can just supplement with mineral supplements I do think that an added benefit of having a reverse osmosis home filtration system is its versatility because not only can you use this water for drink but you can use the purified water to wash fruits and vegetables and a variety of produce which can be contaminated with microplastics on their surface from soil from contaminated water from Air exposure where these particles settle on the surface of the produce so washing produce with filtered water can help remove some of these microplastic particles that cling to surfaces particularly waxy surfaces on certain produce when it comes to food opting for fresh over packaged food is another obvious impactful choice so packaged Foods often come wrapped in plastic those can shed microplastic and leech chemicals like BPA into our food so by choosing fresh produce fresh meats bulk items we can minimize exposure which is good for our own health but also promotes environmental health as well similarly we should consider reducing our consumption of canned foods and canned beverages so many aluminum cans are lined with plastic Coatings these Coatings contain BPA or they have Alternatives like PS which carry similar health risks so whenever possible it better to select products that are packaged in glass versus cans we can also re-evaluate our food storage habits so opting for glass or stainless steel or ceramic containers instead of plastic ones avoid heating food in plastic containers remember heat can accelerate the leeching of chemicals like BPA into our food into our beverages it also accelerates the oxidation process which then causes more microplastics to be Shed from the larg your plastic itself and remember microwave safe simply means the plastic won guarantee that it leeching also try to avoid cooking with non-stick pans which are coated with some of these chemicals like the forever chemicals so try to opt for options like titanium ceramic um cast iron these are all other options that we should be using for cooking our Foods because again heat is causing these chemicals to be leeched into our Foods at an even higher and accelerated rate um which brings me to another crucial point and I want to talk about this myth of BPA free products there these BPA free products which sound like they not um manufacturers frequently replace BPA with chemicals like BPS which also can disrupt hormonal activity in much the same way and Studies have shown that BPS may not be a safer option than BPA and potentially causing adverse health effects on fetal development brain health cardiovascular function some BPA free Plastics even contain phalates or other harmful plasticizers so the term BPA free merely means the product lacks BPA and not that it other toxic chemicals I also want to again highlight and bring your attention to a common daily exposure to microplastics and their Associated chemicals and that is disposable paper coffee and teacups these convenient paper cups are typically lined with PL plastic to prevent leaks here pour that hot beverage into them the heat causes the plastic lining to break down you the beverage you like BPA into your beverage at a much higher level I already talked about a study where heat can cause the leeching of vpa up to 55 times higher compared to cold liquids so a simple solution really is just to bring your own reusable to go mug to a coffee shop if you a drink at the cafe ask for a ceramic cup if you own mug and most Bas are actually happy to fill your own travel mug some shops actually even offer a discount for doing so when it comes to oral consumption of microplastics and their Associated chemicals I want to address another hidden source of microplastics and that is salt um it may or may not surprise you but salt can significantly contribute to our microplastic intake estimates suggest that consuming salt can add around 7,000 microplastic particles to our diet each year and that generally has the highest levels of microplastic contamination due to the ocean pollution one study found that sea salts contained anywhere from 550 to 681 microplastic particles per kilogram making them some of the most contaminated sources of Salt Lake salts come next followed by rock salts which have the least amount of microplastic contamination so rock salts include commonly used varieties like Morton iodize salt or pink Himalayan salt so these salts do still contain some microplastics but the levels are significantly lower than what sea salts so whenever possible opting for rock or mined salts can reduce microplastic intake okay now let our attention to the air we breathe this is another significant yet often overlooked source of microplastic exposure reducing the amount of microplastics we inhale is crucial and fortunately there are a few practical steps that we can take to minimize this risk first and foremost let our indoor environments this is where we spend the majority of our time one effective strategy is to use a HEPA filter this is a high efficiency particulate air filter using these in our homes can be highly efficient at trapping Airborne microplastic particles they can capture particles as small as 0.3 microns making them pretty suitable for removing the vast majority of microplastics found in indoor air many of which range from 10 to 100 microns in size a significant portion of Airborne microplastics originates from synthetic textiles from carpets and other household materials every time we walk across a synthetic carbic or we sit on a polyester couch tiny plastic fibers can become airborne by using a HEPA filter especially in areas where synthetic materials are prevalent we can significantly reduce the number of microplast ICS floating around in our indoor air moreover many modern vacuum cleaners actually now come equipped with a HEPA filter so this feature allows them to trap microplastics effectively when they and it prevents these particles from being redistributed back into the air so regular vacuuming with HEPA filters can also make a substantial difference in indoor air quality as well now let address the source of many of these Airborne microplastics are clothing synthetic fibers like polyester nylon and acrylic are ubiquitous in today fashion um these materials offer benefits like durability and affordability but they also shed microplastics into the environment both into the air and also through washing one impactful change is to opt for clothing made from 100% natural fibers so this is cotton bamboo linen hemp wool or silk these materials do not shed microplastics but it is important to knowe that even Blends containing synthetic fibers can still release microplastics so aiming for Pure natural fibers is really key here I understand this might be challenging especially for people that have specific fashion preferences or budget considerations but even gradual shifts in our wardrobe can make a significant difference over time for those of us not ready to 100% part with our synthetic garments there are ways we can also still mitigate the impact installing a microfiber filter on our washing machine is an effective method so washing Sy it Clos is a major major source of microplastic pollution in the ocean in our Waters and so installing a microplastic filter can actually trap microplastic fibers released during washing of our laundry and prevent them from entering our waterways there friend that offer these laundry bags that are designed to catch microfibers during washing so these bags really offer a straightforward and coste effective solution for people that are not really ready to install a microfiber filter on their their washing machine just yet I also want to highlight another pathway through which microplastics and their Associated chemicals like BPA can enter our bodies and that is through the skin so dermal absorption isn ingesting contaminated food or water or inhaling polluted air but it is still a root worth paying attention to especially because it involves everyday items we might not suspect so consider thermal paper receipts these are things that we gas stations ATMs these receipts often contain BPA which is used as a color developer in the thermal printing process so when we handle Reeds BPA can transfer into our skin and potentially enter our bloodstream now here it gets more interesting and concerning is that the use of lotions or sunscreens or hand sanitizers can dramatically increase the absorption of BPA through the skin these products can enhance our Skin pass through the skin more so than it normally would in fact Studies have shown that using hand sanitizer before handling receipts can significantly boost BPA absorption into our bloodstream so what can we do about this when possible opt to decline paper receipts or request a digital version have it sent to your email or phone many retailers offer this option and it reduces BPA exposure to ourselves but it also reduces paper was so it um if your job requires you handling receipts frequently such as if you a retail or Food Service consider wearing nit trial gloves so nit trial gloves are effective barriers against chemicals like BPA unlike some latex glove which may not offer the same level of protection	Success
Omega-3 phospholipid DHA and supplementation | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV_5B38s2Ak	FoundMyFitness Clips 	one of the things I want to cover that has changed since we last talked is you had really gone deep and and published a paper around the phospholipid form of omega threes and its benefits I was wondering if you could bring us up to speed on that and what your current thinking is on omega-3 supplementation so when it comes to if we about phospholipid DHA when it comes to DHA in general DHA is one of the Omega threes it marine sources really what I care about is you know getting it to the brain that the only type of DHA that crosses the blood-brain barrier is DHA that is bound to albumin which is a protein found in your bloodstream transports a variety of you know goodies in addition to DHA to other tissues including the brain but there are two forms of DHA that are bound to albumin and these two different forms are transported by different mechanisms so the first is DHA that is not as terrified it anything other than albumin so it free fatty acid form and I often refer to that as DHA free it not bound to anything mm-hmm aside from albumin it gets transported across the blood-brain barrier via this mechanism that just means it crossing the blood-brain barrier and the blood-brain barrier there things that you know make it up but one of the things that discussion is that endothelial cells align the blood-brain barrier and there the endothelial cells are attached to each other by tight junctions so this passive diffusion mechanism where free DHA gets across the brain depends on the integrity of the blood-brain barrier so unfortunately as we age the blood-brain barrier becomes compromised and this is even more of an issue in people that have an AoE four allele apoe4 is just a gene and allele just means you know one copy of the gene you have two copies of every gene one from your mom one from your dad so we have two alleles of every gene and just to bring people up to speed if you have one copy of this gene you are how much more likely to get Alzheimer disease people that have one copy of the apoe4 allele are about to two fold more likely to get Alzheimer that have no copies of it people that have two copies of it it common so about 25% of the population has at least one copy of it to copy is much much less common I don percentage off the top of my head but you can figure the math out if you know 25% hasn copies would be but that increases the risk for Alzheimer anywhere between ten to fifteen fold and what percentage of the population that is diagnosed with Alzheimer has at least one copy anywhere between 65 to 85 percent Wow yeah so this is a pretty big indicator then it is and we could spend like hours talking about the reasons why that is and I do talk a lot about that in my paper that he published last October in Fast of journal but basically to get back to the whole DHA part of the story I mentioned that there the brain this one form that know not bound to anything other than albumin it goes through passive diffusion however apoe4 actually disrupts that because it does compromise the blood-brain barrier and that even gets worse with age things like traumatic brain injury also compromised the blood-brain barrier the good news is there is another form of DHA that is bound to albumin it specific type of phospholipid form called lyso phosphatidylcholine DHA or DHA lie so PC as I like to call it for short and that the blood-brain barrier through an entirely different mechanism it uses a transporter called M FSD to a and basically when this phospholipid form of DHA binds to the transporter the transporter flips it across the outer membrane into the inner membrane of the blood-brain barrier and it potentially bypasses any defects for example in tight junctions and affiliate cells that I was just mentioning which by the way April before does disrupt tight junctions in lining the blood-brain barrier so I sort of argue in my latest publication that the specific DHA lie so PC form of DHA may be a nice way to bypass that you know defect that April before causes or even just normal brain aging causes where you can get DHA into the brain is your hypothesis here that lack of this DHA is a cause potential cause of dementia yes specifically making a people with apoe4 more susceptible to it so DHA plays a lot of important roles in the brain it plays a role in preventing and ameliorating a couple of the hallmarks associated with Alzheimer tau tangles and amyloid beta plaques and that it can lower the amyloid burden and also tell tangle pathology in people that have them so specifically people with Alzheimer improve cognitive function the other thing that DHA does it important for transporting glucose across the blood-brain barrier and this is a really major hallmark of Alzheimer into the brain basically hmm that is actually something that can be observed before any other clinical features of Alzheimer specifically found early in people with apoe4 so DHA is important for increasing levels of the transporters that transport glucose across the blood-brain barrier the glucose transporters so I always thought that you know people for a while we Alzheimer type 3 diabetes I called that before I always thought an increase or too much glucose in the body would be a bad thing but here you saying the brain getting a lack of glucose is a bad thing what I here yeah is that getting not having glucose in the brain can be a bad thing but that obviously from like dysregulated blood blood glucose levels and insulin insensitivity like those things are all hallmarks of aging and cause multiple multiple problems for sure it a different thing that I here so like bran glucose levels are important for preventing a lot of the the hallmarks associated with with Alzheimer and this has to do with a lot of like very specific molecular mechanisms having to do with like forming tau tangles and stuff like that so not being able to get glucose into the brain can play a causal role in Alzheimer disease and perhaps that is also linked to this type 3 you know diabetes that you know completely separate but sort of parallel mechanism has DHA I think it could play a role in in addition right so DHA is important for getting blue close in the brain but also some newer research does indicate that you know insulin insensitivity can reduce you know glucose getting into the brain as well so those two things could even possibly synergize who knows I mean it would be nice to see data on that yeah but in terms of getting the DHA in the brain and like the question you kind of asked at the beginning and I people are wondering is well like what are the dietary sources of these you know different types of DHA the free DHA versus this lie so PC DHA the one that a phospholipid form that across the blood-brain barrier and the simple answer actually is that all dietary forms can form either of those forms of DHA that there complicated answer that you know involves even getting down to the chemical level so DHA looking at dietary sources like fish fish roe krill oil those are all sources that have DHA in phospholipid form predominantly you find phospholipid form being phosphatidylcholine as the phospholipid triglyceride form is found in fish also in fish roe and also in higher quality fish oil supplements or DHA supplements there find in supplements a majority of supplements that are molecularly distilled which is the process used to purify fish oil to purify away contaminants like mercury PCBs etc a lot of fish oil supplements are found in ethyl ester form some are even in free fatty acid form those forms are a little less bioavailable than triglyceride form oil supplements mm-hmm but the main thing here is actually the difference between ingesting it in phospholipid form versus any of those other forms because those other forms to some degree are metabolized in a very similar manner compared to phospholipid form and the reason for that is because phospholipid form again found in fish fish roe a variety of different you know eggs fish eggs caviar as people call it and also krill oil have DHA in this phospholipid form predominately fostered all choline and the phospholipid form has this backbone it the thing that differentiates it from the other forms is that there two DHA s attached there could be a DHA attached at two positions on it positions meaning different carbon atoms one on the sn1 position as its called the one on the sn2 position and so the triglyceride ethyl ester all those those those forms have DHA on the sn2 position and there DHA is metabolized on the sn2 versus sn1 position on the sn1 position where it found in this you know in phospholipid form you can actually metabolize it and it retains its phospholipid form throughout metabolism it gets cleaved by an enzyme and it forms DHA lye so PC that form that you know bound to albumin across as a blood-brain barrier through a transporter the DHA on the sn2 position which is found in all forms is cleaved by an enzyme it forms a free DHA molecule which then is bound up in LDL instead of HDL and enzyme Cleaves it out of the LDL and it can form either free DHA bound to albumin or it can form the DHA lie so PIPC so it can form either but the bottom line here is that for the the the phospholipid form the dietary phospholipid form you consuming you your buck in terms of forming that DHA lie so PC form that you want to cross the blood-brain barrier mm-hmm that the bottom line so the majority of supplements that you see out there mostly as a triglyceride form is that right the high quality ones are triglyceride most of Uncle are actually ethyl ester oh really yeah yeah because there come more costly you know when you molecularly distilling these fish oil supplements they triglyceride form which is what they originate in and and they ethyl ester backbone and and that they like run it through this column where they this chemical stuff and then at the end of the day a lot of people just leave it in that form because the enzymes your pancreas and small intestine things like that they can recognize that ethanol backbone and cleave the DHA off of that hmm the higher quality fish oil supplements after that whole molecular distillation process then rias terrifi it to a triglyceride form so it extra step so extra step means more money right right and so that say higher quality higher quality usually also means you have to pay more for them you know as well what are your thoughts on say eating salmon roe versus getting a krill supplement versus finding a form of omega-3 that is phospholipid I know Nordic Naturals came out with one not too long ago what do you recommend there so I should probably start with this fish contain around 1 to 1.5 percent of their DHA in phospholipid form the remaining is triglyceride form fish roe and this includes salmon roe herring roe Roe flying fish roe they contain between 38 to 75 percent of their DHA in phospholipid form I didn know this is a flying fish roe as well that yes it is down because it doesn know yeah there yeah right yeah I know I know you have a harder time than I do eating salmon roe for example you like my husband he it take yeah I take it like pills I like it scooped in my mouth and then just like drink water real quick or pop them real quick to make sure they get all out and then it mine I put mine on a little bit of seaweed with a slice of avocado and some lemon sometimes a little ginger and really - I really like how that tastes I gave it to my son now he he likes it with this type of cheese called borscht borscht conversion Bo you are si an it like this like cream cheesy garlic or you know stuff this is great and it masks the salmon roe taste and so he gets that almost every morning and Dan is getting that he he get he like sit on this like paleo waffle with some sour cream and that cheese and the salmon roe and that totally masked it like you know so for me like I can just you know I can just eat that stuff but I probably should mention that this form this DHA lie so PC form in addition to B what I argue and my most recent publication to be really important for brain aging and preventing Alzheimer particularly for people with apoe4 alleles also it animal studies to be a preferred source of DHA to be taken up into the developing brain in fact it in some cases ten times better than DHA and free fatty acid form hmm so that kind of why I mentioned my son you know he mental stage and so that trying to get him the salmon room but back to the whole important question that you asked because it really is it is an important question I mentioned you know 38 mm 5% of DHA in these you know in these different rows from fish are found in in phospholipid form krill oil is another phospholipid form you mentioned and about 35% of the DHA in krill oil is phospholipids krill oil supplements are not very high in terms of their concentration so if you look at a majority of krill oil supplements out there consumer available supplements you milligrams you know / - soft gels or something like that is what you compared to like what I take in my fish oil supplement which is each pill has 500 milligrams of highly purified DHA so two pills have a gram so one gram compared to 60 to 80 milligrams I mean even regardless of the fact that they you know more of that DHA is bioavailable to be to form the phospholipid DHA form the DHA lie so PC you gram of fish oil yeah what I choose to do is I actually take fish oil and I take I eat salmon roe and I eat fish so I do all of those things do you have any preferred sources of where you get your supplementation oil so I take a fish oil it so it it it in Norway and he is basically convinced me that it purest forms of fish oil he doesn any lemon or strawberry anything to mask the fish one little trick in the industry is unfortunately it can mask the smell of rinse you know when something you can smell it if you pop open a fish oil pill you can definitely you don even have to pop it open sometimes you can smell it you definitely taste it that strawberry flavors and stuff like right he doesn there and it first when I first met him I I popped open one of his pills and tried it and it was like the best tasting I couldn believe I could just eat it like it was oh you actually chewed it up I just yeah I did yeah that does that that wondered because I handled I give him mega threes to toast her time watch him chew him up I like my little tester yeah totally I actually pop open those pills and I put it in my son with lots of butter so so he the DHA pills in his oatmeal as well where and again at is that it tastes good so it I should mention that I don ties to this fish oil company I don get any kickbacks I with him but he is a friend of mine and you do a gram of that a day I actually take three grams a day Wow yeah so that upper limit of this like have you read about any downsides any potential downsides of doing high dose the only potential thing I high dose EPA and it is and it is really possibly because it can inhibit with like leukotrienes and stuff things that are involved in like blood clotting that maybe it can send the blood a little bit so it could you know contraindicate people that are taking blood thinning medications but there large randomized control trials coming out now showing that highly purified epa in high doses up to three grams a day are like dramatically reducing triglycerides and lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease and so it that right yeah he P is more linked to heart health right well it potent anti-inflammatory which is linked to brain health inflammation in the brain so there showing that it may help with depression specifically EPA as well hmm so how do you balance that if you doing three grams of DHA do you do a gram of EPA or so the high DHA that I get so he so he makes two different versions a high DHA a high EPA and the high DHA does still have EPA in it just to a much you know smaller degree and I don recently you know I was really you know while I was breastfeeding you know it was like super hardcore about getting tons and tons of DHA I you know through the salmon roe and also you know like taking the 3 grams which is turns out to be six pills of these high DHA and and there because there that like women that take in in a dose-dependent manner DHA and breast milk increases and like and there it really like it reaches a limit but it a super high doses like 10 grams or something like that Wow now I to do high DHA and high EPA but I take I take one in the morning like one I sort of like taking my different times the day but DHA is is basically been my you know my number one thing for a while just because of pregnancy and breastfeeding and all that but but I trying to take notes actually you	Success
Sulforaphane supplements vs. broccoli sprouting | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgYzgQVqyA	FoundMyFitness Clips 	I sulforaphane I know that you know here gosh wet it when you first started doing videos and posts about the benefits of sprouting broccoli seeds and this miracle compound call sulforaphane and where are you now with all that I about it sulfur fame is it formed from a precursor called glucoraphanin and glucoraphanin is found in a variety of what are called cruciferous vegetables things like broccoli brussel sprouts cabbage daikon you know watercress all these things cauliflower these things are all from a cruciferous family of vegetables so gluco rafen is the precursor to it when the plant tissue is you know crushed to torn apart it activates an enzyme called myrosinase which turns glucoraphanin into sulfur fame so fer fame has about 70% bioavailability if you orally ingest it the precursor glucoraphanin only has about 10% bioavailability to be converted into sulfur f---ing so there been tons and tons of intervention trials where people are given either a broccoli sprout broccoli sprouts by the way have about up to hundred hundred times more of the precursor to sulforaphane called glucagon then the mature broccoli plant which is kind of why I sprouts because that can eating so many of them I was eating like tops of those a day and they don good and I them I just I had to go to the supplements yeah well so here thing the supplements so there there have been you know scientifically validated to really have what they say they have so for free and not is not a very stable molecule it and it know in a supplement form there two supplements that are really I would say have been clinically validated and but have been used in randomized controlled trials that have been pure you know peer-reviewed and published one is I way I have no affiliation with any of these supplements or sample but companies at all you don have any yeah it have any affiliation with any something I don that because people don no I don neither do I yeah good to mention I been taking you know there supplements one I think AB McCall has around three point five milligrams of sulfur refrain in each tablet and the recommended dose on their bottle is two tablet so that would be about seven milligrams of silver Fang the other supplement is called prostate Pross the fame is unfortunately not available in the US I shouldn say that yeah it because sulfur vein is so unstable like the company just didn with like the whole shipping it to another country and all that and dealing with all that right but you can buy like I buy pasta fain there pharmacies you can have it shipped shipped to you oh really yeah like I arriving arriving tomorrow also even you stopped with the broccoli so each processor vein tablet has around 10 milligrams of silver in it there are trade offs you know verse you know for doing broccoli sprouts or vs. supplements I would say first and foremost the supplements are expensive prostitution is really expensive they like fifty fifty dollars a Packer something like ninety something dollars for a pack of sixty for reprocessing it has how are you taking a day one 60 day supply we each one has ten milligrams in Episode four a fan and I get to that dose babe maybe I should talk about some of the clinical I mean there have been really exciting in the past couple years cool yeah please do let me just finish with the sprouts they cheaper and you get a ton of sulfur so like 400 grams of fresh sprouts use something around like 40 milligrams of sulfur refrain you know can be bio you know basically you can get something around 40 milligrams of sulfur that lot right for a lot cheaper now the trade-off is its pain you have to like work right have to make them I mean they there very they can easily be contaminated and I and it kind of gives you some you know it there you should bleach the seeds first and then and I don comfortable bleaching the season do it I just don that been doing the processing for one simple reason I running found my fitness and trying to do all this research and stuff and and also trying to like exercise and there just I just this too much you know this is too much for me so I found it easier for me to take the prostitutes implement I would like to get back to the sprouts and I will probably mix that up again but for now I way that seriously am i keeping my fridge looked like a little mini farm like it was like Farmville up my fridge it was like there was sprouts everywhere and yeah some of them are going bad like me and I was freezing some of them and yeah you	Success

Should You Supplement With Berberine? - Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP5NElZI-n8	FoundMyFitness Clips 	okay so the next question was submitted by Richard and uh Richard asks have your thoughts on berberine changed now that we know it can actually reduce cholesterol plaque and I chose this question because it piqued my interest considering we have a topic page on berberine I I believe the topic page went live in maybe 2020 so um it we will be updating it now based on all the Deep diving that we did um to look into this question and also I was interested in myself because uh you know I looking for alternative ways to improve cholesterol LDL to improve you know you know plaque plaque formation disintegration all of the above all right before we dive in I do want to mention that berberine can interact with a number of prescription drugs so taking berberine along with medications that lower blood pressure um might cause blood pressure to go too low um taking berberine along with medications that slow blood clotting might increase the risk of bruising and bleeding so um if someone decides to supplement with B it it is something to discuss with with your physician um and and certainly if you are taking any prescription drugs and it you absolutely need to to talk about it with your physician because of the fact that burine can interact with uh a number of drugs and um what I about here obviously is not uh medical advice I scientific literature on on berberine in terms of things that are updated since the last time I episode and also on our topic page our buring topic page which you can find at foundit find at foundy fitness.com toopics and then just scroll to the be and you there going to I animal studies we will update the animal studies on the topic page but there lot of animal studies that have shown berberine can significantly decrease plaque area and plaque macras content which is um which is definitely interesting but I do want to focus on the human studies and the review of clinical data so there randomized controll trial so this was this is a 2023 publication this is new um it analysis of 44 different randomized control trials the trials basically the age the age rate age range of people in the trial were between 18 to 83 years so really everything from a young adult to an older adult the dosage range of berberine was about 0.3 G to 1.8 G per day so uh quite High um although the three gram would be on the low end and these clinical trials um there was a variety of ways they were done in some instances they were giving berberine in combination with other drugs like statins and so the dosage range of statins were 10 milligrams to 80 milligrams per day the treatment duration range was between 7 days to 2 years Okay so um when berberine was given alone this was eight randomized control trials and there was a sample size of about 804 people berberine alone significantly reduced a variety of things compared to routine routine therapy so what it did what did it reduce it reduced What called the ni Stroke Scale so this is a quantitative measure of stroke related neurologic deficit so berberine was able to reduce the tests that are given to quantify stroke related neurologic deficit berberine decreased High sensitivity C reactive protein it decreased Incan 6 il6 this could be a pro-inflammatory cyto uh it is a pro pro-inflammatory cyto um it also decreased tumor crosis Factor alpha tnf alpha um you know which plays a role in inflammation these play a role in atherosclerosis as well both you know all of the all three of these inflammatory molecules so it seems as though berberine is reducing inflammation inflammatory um biomarkers and it reduced the the quantitative measure of you know stroke related you know deficit now when berberine so berberine compared to um a routine or routine routine care or um statins it reduced What intima media thickness so this is it basically a quantitative index of atherosclerosis and it value that is used to monitor disease progression and also the effects of treatment so it a lot in clinical studies because if you can decrease the intim the the intima U media thickness the IMT then it treatment is beneficial for atherosclerosis either in preventing or in uh reducing perhaps atherosclerotic plaque as well so berberin seem to also um significantly reduce that um the intima immediate thickness which again is is really a marker of atherosclerosis atheros scoic plaque um their statins also did the same and also um standard treatment did it so it that berberine also did it now there was no differences in berberine alone versus either statins or um you know the routine of care in improving total cholesterol triglycerides low density lipoprotein highdensity leper protein so this so basically this is um you know Bine was still having a positive effect on them but it wasn or the routine care I to me that interesting because um if you can still have an effect on a positive effect on all the things that Statin is then why not try berberine um I mean that of what I would go to that naturally go first berberine plus statins or versus statins Alone um so there was you know either giving statins with berberine or not just giving statins alone there were a it seems as that there were a number of um of benefits so berberine combined with Statin significantly reduced again that that um that stroke score so looking at the you know potential damage from from stroke the NIH stroke stroke score was reduced from when adding berberine to statins compared to statins only uh there was no significant difference in the inflammatory biomarkers like is6 when doing statins versus berberine plus statins but remember berberine alone did reduce il6 so it just wasn someone was already taking stattin it wasn the statins was already reducing it so statins are also reduc using is six the the intima media thickness level was also decreased significantly in the berberine um plus statins group so again it seems as though that berberine could be a promising alternative therapy for atherosclerosis um perhaps esemicolonr heart disease considering the benefits it has on you know anti-hyperlipidemia so you know the triglycerides cholesterol um the effect it score its effects on anti-inflammatory it lowering all those inflammatory cyto kindes and its effects on the IMT score so that was the progression of aerosis so it decrease the progression of it and without really any serious adverse reactions but also it seems as though berberine could be an adjunctive um potential adjunctive have an adjunctive role to uh basically people with Statin intolerance because it might improve the efficacy of statins by lowering the dosage and perhaps even reducing the side effects because the Statin dosage may be lowered um obviously this is this is early I mean more studies are going to you need to be done on this before it be is adopted I think into routine uh clinical practice but I do think it is something to you know bring up to a physician for people that are um taking statins in fact um you know I that I know I studies and then tell them to talk to their uh physician as well I also was convinced um that I would like to start testing berberine on myself so I did already place an order for berberine um from Thorn and I also got some from my mother who um had has a higher risk for coronary heart disease and she higher triglycerides although the omega-3 she that with omega-3 she laesa and also she cholesterol total cholesterol and so I curious to see how berberine will affect her um lipid levels as well so I went ahead and ordered um a few bottles of that for for the family there was some safety evalu ation as well um in in the meta analysis of these trials and people so patients that were receiving B berberine alone appeared to have um significantly lower risk of lens liver enzyme abnormalities and um myalgia compared to those receiving Statin so that to be investigated further again you know whether or not people on statins could they could be combining berberine to lower their Statin dose and perhaps lower the the the negative and adverse side effects um is very interesting also um there was no GI effects with people taking berberine compared to patients receiving statins those receiving berberine plus stabit statins seem to have a lower risk of abnormal liver enzymes again um and and the myalgia so all in all I think you know the there this is in the big greater context of things this is still limited evidence even though we looking at 44 different randomized controlled trials there needs to be more before this is adopted into clinical routine clinical practice but I do think um for for people like you know myself I also experimenting with my mother who has higher cholesterol as well and she is not on a Staten so um and then you know people that are on stattin could ask their physician and and and and try it out if if they get the okay and see if um what berberine does and whether or not they could even lower their dose of stat and I think um all very interesting there interesting stuff I into I on berberine um potential potentially um lowering the tmao production in the gut and um a lot of this is animal work and so again uh needs to be taken with a grain of salt and that really going to get into it there study that was in about 50 people one clinical study it was not a randomized control trial um of course so it you talk in one study not even not even a randomized control trial so again not very high quality evidence nothing to you know to to really make draw any conclusions on but again seems to be um indicating that berberine May really um improve the progression of aerosis in people um with atherosclerosis that were not undergoing any drug treatment and um so take a look at the topic page if you want to kind of Dive Dive even further into this because I talk about all that stuff but there some there updates that we will be making to that topic page and I am going to be supplementing with berberine and I going to be checking um all my lipids and cholesterol and um I mean my inflammatory biomarkers are just Rock Bottom low so I don difference there but I will be curious to see how it affects my LDL um Ed and twill are asking if you need to skip berberine on workout days um I so it you know we cover a lot stuff in the topic page so the the way I plan on supplementing with berberine is I will take it uh in the evening so I do I do my exercise in early morning I mean we and most of my supplements I take with dinner um and so I you know when you talking many hours after the exercise the the biggest the biggest I would say um you know risk of taking supplements you know is is within the one you know immediately after you know to maybe 3 hours after exercise once you start to get four or five hours after you know you inflammatory response the oxidative response has been generated without blunting it that has activated genetic pathway ways and um and so you going to be dampening that you know if you several hours after that	Success
The 10 Habits That DRAMATICALLY Reduce Cancer Risk (by up to 90%)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXjHGFRD6U8	FoundMyFitness Clips 	Number one strategy for preventing cancer, avoiding tobacco. Probably the single most impactful step anyone can take to lower their cancer risk. I won spend a lot of time on that. I think the the evidence I saw someone in the chat asking about negating the effects of previous smoking. You know, I think the best thing that you do is quit, right? I mean, cigarette smoking is linked to 80 to 90% of all lung cancer deaths in the United States. But even if you have smoked, quitting in early adulthood eliminates about 90% of the excess mortality from smoking. And it too late. Quitting later cuts lung cancer risk by about 50% within just 10 to 15 years. So quitting smoking is the best thing that you can do for your health. If you you know if you healthiest best life on top of that even better right so number two I would say the next best thing that you can do for cancer prevention honestly is to maintain a healthy body weight um I hate to use BMI because you know a lot of muscle mass can kind of skew that BMI towards the high range which isn necessarily bad but let presume that we people without a lot of excess muscle. You want to keep your BMI in around a healthy range between about 18.5 to 24.9. Obesity strongly increases risk for many cancers like 13 different types of cancer. Endometrial um breast cancer, colon cancer, kidney cancer, so many different types of cancer that is linked to obesity. It actually estimated that about 11% of cancers in women and 5% of cancers in men are linked to excess body weight. Being overweight or obese is is you know it about it in terms of their type 2 diabetes risk and their metabolic syndrome. But cancer needs to be on your mind because 50 to 60% of all endometrial cancer in the United States are linked to being overweight or obese. And about 20 to 60% of post-menopausal women that are overweight or obese have a much higher risk of breast breast cancer. Um so and even colurectal cancer again that people have a much higher risk if they So even modest weight loss can be very meaningful. And you know one of the best ways to lose weight, you want to eat healthier and you want to eat less, move more. And that that takes us to the regular physical activity. I mean exercise is one of the best things you can do for absolutely every aspect of health. I have taken exercise so seriously to the point where sometimes I run myself down a little bit too much because because I I prioritize it just extremely important. It is the most important thing I do each day is getting my exercise. You want to you do if following the guidelines if you getting about 150 minutes a week of vigorous intensity exercise you least doing good. If you can get more of that, even better. For moderate intensity, if you you know, if you minutes of moderate intensity exercise a week, you can get if you can mix in some vigorous intensity exercise in there, even better. So, I would say number four thing that is eating a healthy diet. Now, what does that mean? I mean, it depends on who you would say it going to find a study that people where people who eat vegetables and fruits, they eat nuts and whole grains and legumes and they limit their processed meat, they eat healthy, you know, poultry and and and fish and lean red meat. Um, I think that those people are you showing that that kind of diet, more of a Mediterranean type of diet, is associated with greater cancer reduction than than other diets are. And in some cases like colon cancer, having a lot of fiber reduces the case of the the cancer incidence by up to 60%. Very important. And colon cancer is a top one that people get and die from. It up there in the top three or four. So, it to. Um, there no argument. I know carnivore diet popular, but there that can be made that fiber isn for your colon and that it doesn decrease colurectal cancer risk because it really for each 10 gram serving per day, it may decrease colorectal cancer risk by 10% for each 10 gram serving. So you go up 10, 10% reduction. You go up 10 more, 10 more% reduction in colon cancer risk. It just keeps going. And that number of about 50 to 60% reduction in colon colon cancer incidents for people that are eating a at least five servings of fruits and ve vegetables each day. So I do think that a healthy diet means fruits and vegetables. And I don that you should be as scared of the modest post post um prenial glycemic response from some fruits. It down especially if you exercising and it really be concerned about. I just there eating fruit makes you unhealthy. In fact, all the contrary. Um I would say the biggest thing that you want to avoid is is processed meat. You know there no at this point I processed meat is linked to col colorectal cancer. In fact it alarming over the last if you look if you look at the colctal cancer incidents dating back to like the 1930s. It keeps rising exponentially each decade. Each decade. And what happening what diets over the the course of these decades is we intake of ultrarocessed foods. We taking in these foods that are high in refined sugar. They They calories, high in sodium, and we taking a lot of these processed meats that have all these preservatives and additives. And we whole food. And it truly is reflected in the increased incidence of colorectal cancer. So I think that limiting ultrarocessed foods, limiting processed meat will clearly reduce cancer risk. So um that is something that I think is really important to consider as well. Number five, limiting alcohol intake. Less really is better here. Heavy drinkers do face a five-fold greater risk for mouth and throat cancers and even moderate drinking. Just one drink per day raises breast cancer risk by about 10%. While those who consume two to three drinks a day have about a 20% higher risk. I covered this in my alcohol podcast. You know, it clear. I think the evidence is clear now that alcohol increases cancer risk. So, doesn You just have to realize that, you know, if you you probably going to be a problem because it affect your your cancer risk. Um, if it once in a while, a couple times a month, I mean, I don something so much to be concerned about. not a lot of evidence showing that really raises cancer risk. But it it alcohol that would say something that you can get rid of and it will be tremendous for lowering cancer risk. And then there things like, you know, if you that just really in the sun for long periods of time, you have to really consider, especially if you that radiation. You know, UV radiation main cause of skin cancers. No denying that. And the good news is you can protect your skin from UV exposure by a lot of different ways. is there was a randomized control trial in Australia that showed regular sunscreen use reduced melanoma incidence by 50% over 10 years. That is amazing. Um, no argument there. Sunscreen does reduce the risk of melanoma. Melanoma is one of those those skin cancers that problematic because it metastasizes uh quite quickly actually and people end up dying from from cancers in other areas. And then there environmental exposures, right? So, there you know, having an air filter, I think, is something to be to uh to consider as well because it some of those particulate matter and things like that. Radon, something you may not be aware of. Radon is an invisible gas. It enters our home through soil beneath it. It the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States. So, you can test your house for radon and make sure that you don where the soil has high radon levels and it every day, particularly in the winter time when you have a lot of the doors and windows shut. Um, and so that that well. Stress management, mental health. I mean, stress is linked to cancer. There into how it inflammation, you know, it down the exact mechanisms, but there just observational evidence that stress, chronic stress, you know, increases cancer incidents essentially through some immune and inflammatory pathways, right? Then there rhythm. I mean, this is a very important area. We know that people who have poor sleep, they have a disrupted circadian rhythm, they have a higher cancer risk. In fact, the World Health Organization classifies circadian disruption shift work as a probable carcinogen. So, prioritizing consistent quality sleep, you want to make sure you eight hours nightly to support your immune immune regulation, to support hormonal regulation. These are very this is very important. So focusing on sleep is very important for cancer prevention. And then there lot of people are interested in supplements as well. And there of supplements that can have, I would say, plausible mechanisms to help with cancer prevention. Like we about magnesium, vitamin D, even sulfurophane. There supplements that have had, you know, promising clinical evidence for reducing cancer risk over the past couple of decades. I would say one of those is actually vitamin D. So vitamin D, there Again, these are studies where researchers use genetics to kind of get at a causal role for something in the environment controlling a certain outcome. So in this case, people have snips in genes that are related to vitamin D metabolism that make them have genetically low vitamin D levels. those individuals. So, this is completely independent of any of other lifestyle activities, right? You could say someone with low vitamin D levels might just be unhealthy. They never go outside. They don they There problems when you look at observational data just directly measuring vitamin D levels and associating it with an outcome. Well, with mandelian randomization, you measuring their levels. You at their snips. And people with these snips have low vitamin D levels. And so what happens is um people with those SNIPS have a much higher cancer related mortality, much higher than people without those SNIPS. And so it it strengthens the observational data that has also shown people with low vitamin D levels have a higher cancer related death and incidence. And so that you go, okay, well, the genetically low vitamin D levels really strengthen that. And so it seems as though vitamin D may be playing a role in preventing cancer death. There was a very large clinical trial. This was the vital study. A secondary analysis of that trial, found that vitamin D supplementation, this was 2,000 IUs a day, did lower cancer related death compared to placebo. So vitamin D is a big one. Magnesium is another one. And it because you know half the country of at least in the United States half the people in the United States have low magnesium. They magnesium. Same with vitamin D. Even more than half the the country has low vitamin D. So those are those are two obvious obviously I would say lowhanging fruits there because people are already sort of deficient or insufficient in them and so it helps to take a supplement to get you to that sufficient level. There studies showing vitamin C is linked to a lower cancer risk. And again, with the observational studies, it often packaged with fruits and vegetables. And so, it also that people that are eating a low fruit and vegetable diet have low vitamin C. And therefore, we don really know if it just the whole food itself with all the different micronutrients, not just vitamin C, but other ones like magnesium and vitamin K and calcium, for example. They all may be having an effect. There that making sure you dietary calcium. We about calcium in these Q&As know, essentially it thousand milligrams a day, as much from your diet as you can. Remember, vegetables are a great source. Dark leaf leafy greens are a great source of calcium. Nuts are a great source of calcium as well. Um, some dairy, of course, also is is a great source of calcium. There evidence that it seems as though calcium is really good for for the colon as well and for preventing colon cancer and particularly these edemas that are that form um and that are predictive of cancer. So so that consider as well. And then there supplements that may cause harm. And this is kind of going back to the question about an acetylcysteine. You know the anetylcysteine it potent antioxidant. It concern in smokers that are already sort of at a high risk for lung cancer and that So actually taking a really high dose of beta carotene 30 milligrams a day and retinyl palmitate 25,000 I use a day significantly increased lung cancer risk in people with a history of smoking. Um the risk went up to about 28% higher and this was a big trial that was done. And it was a in 2004 it was a beta carotene and retinol efficacy trial. Now keep in mind this is people that are already previously smoked and there about the niche in the lungs and the reactive oxygen species in the lungs that the beta carotene sort of has an effect on. And so it you were a former smoker, certainly a current smoker is something that you do not want to be	Success
These Are the Best Foods & Supplements for Gut Health	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8gLHQIh86c	FoundMyFitness Clips 	the next question was submitted by Matthew and Matthew asked if I can summarize the foods and supplements that have been proven to be beneficial for the gut and I kind or the gut microbiome but I sort of extended that to just the gut itself because um the gut is more than just the microbiome I mean the there and the health of those cell types are also very important so um Matthew had listed off some some uh foods and supplements but I know so cfir uh that been um human studies showing that cafir is beneficial for the gut microbiome and can increase uh beate producing bacteria can increase or sorry can and it shown to lower biomarkers of inflammation as well um Kucha another one has been shown to benefit the gut microbiome sauerkraut is another one sauerkraut kimchi so the the fermented foods that the theme Here cfir kombucha s these are all fermented foods so fermented foods have probiotics in them um but some of these fermented foods like the sauerkraut and kimchi uh also have pre uh prebiotics in them right so they have fermentable types of fiber so they kind of like a a a double dose right you getting some of the fermentable fibers as well that microbiome to then generate beneficial compound for the gut um there in in in the prebiotics and I would say the major one of the major um compounds that for the gut that microbiome by you know several different bacterial types of species in the gut is berate and and and the reason for that is because butyrate is a it chain fatty acid and I into organic acid in a minute and it very similar to berate actually but um the the short the the butyrate is a short chain fatty acid and it source of energy um it source of energy by many different colon cells and so um it bacteria in your gut making butter rate for your gut like that is going to help your gut out tremendously foods that have prebiotics that can form and have been shown to form berate or increase berate producing bacteria in the gut include beta glucans so beta glucans are found in oats and they mushrooms pectin so pectin are so what I called a this is a Prebiotic it of fermentable fiber found in oats found in mushrooms pectins another type of fermentable fiber found in fruits like berries it raspberries strawberri berries um it also found in citrus fruit and and um specifically really really highly concentrated in like the peel which no one really eats but just F FYI um so there fermentable fiber they of seeds um so different types of seeds pumpkin seeds for example um gums are found in that inulin is another type of Prebiotic that is found in onions garlic artichokes they inulin and then there another type of Prebiotic or fermentable Fiber and that is found in a variety of legumes so um you resistant starch in some beans but uh green bananas are a great source of it or cooked and then cooled potatoes are probably a lot of people Source um because a lot of people like potatoes so basically you just cook and then the the potatoes have to be cooled so all of those food types uh increase Bey berate producing bacteria in the gut which means more berate for your gut cells which means drastically improved gut health and all those different types of prebiotics I mentioned are affecting different species of bacteria and it really good to have that diversity and so it right is that uh a lot of people aren thinking about like the prebiotics like I you know like I sort of know this so I I my I want to get some beta glucan so I going to eat some oatmeal today or mushroom I mushrooms right but just having a more diverse type of diet you automatically just going to be getting all those different types of prebiotics and you gut microbiome and your gut for that reason so uh that those are those are all foods that are beneficial for the gut now going back to the organic acids so I mentioned butyrate butyrate is a short chain fatty acid uh it and it of energy for your gut um but organic acids are also short chain fatty acids and they act like butyrate they are a source of energy for the gut so organic acids that you may be familiar with that you can also find in Foods would be for example malic acid malic acid and then there then you know there a home static reaction that inside your body where you have um you know acids is basically just donating a proton you know to the substrate and so malate which you may have seen in like supplements you may a lot of times you lator so you magnesium for example you magnesium supplements are you know often bound with with because Mal magnesium has a positive charge um so the malet kind of buffers it it magnesium and so you malate well malate also kind of when you eat it it gets interconverted into malic acid okay so malic acid is very I would say the fruits that it would be green apples so malic acid is kind of like that tart flavor that you a tart blueberry like blueberries have malic acid in them particularly when they any tart apple so anyone that has their own apple tree at home like you probably notice that a lot of apples are a lot more tart than you buy at the grocery store but green apples of course are are also tart tart so green apples are high in malic acid and you again a different berries will be high in it um as well malic acid is good for the gut um for that same reason it gets into mitochondria inside your gut cells and is a very you know energetically favorable source of energy um another one would be lactic acid so lactate lactic acid right so that be in fermented foods as well so like yogurt yogurt has lactic acid um you know kombucha Sauer all those things have lactic acid because the probiotics themselves make lactic acid um so so eating yogurt um eating the fermented foods is another way to get lactic acid and and I mechanism here lactic acid is a short chain fat acid it can be used as a source of energy but also lactic acid can change change the pH you know in in the residential area of your gut so where where like the distal part where the colon is right that microbiome bacteria reside um when when lactic acid is there and it bacteria in the gut as well right um it basically it the pH is such that there uh quite a few pathogenic type of bacteria that just can atmosphere with lactic acid the the pH change that lactic acid makes and so it well um citric acid or citrate is another one again they again you take in the citrate like that that magnesium and other um minerals you find like zinc so citric acid obviously found in a lot of citrus fruits pretty much all the citrus fruits have citric acid lemons limes oranges grapefruit um so those are all the organic acids those are also really beneficial for the gut um whether it the gut themselves but also like in the case of lactic acid it the pH of of the um the environment as well leysa is saying srat often causes me discomfort from bloating does this go away if I continue to eat it regularly um I think that dose also plays a role so like eating a very small portion of sourkraut can be beneficial but when you start to like you know like you you will part of the bloating is the microbiome responding right they are fermenting the the the prebiotics and stuff and so um that of a lot a big bolus of that can cause can cause the bloating and stuff so I would try cutting cutting the dose down dramatically and just really just a tiny little portion of it is is is beneficial like you don a ton of it um and also eating the sauerkraut with other foods to kind of like dilute it out a little bit so it not like this just huge Bowl just hitting your microbiome and that only thing hitting it um I think also may help a little bit apple cider vinegar does also have um some of these organic acids I talking about so Jody chat so I think that also um is another one that would be beneficial and there been some evidence that people with I don so irritable bowel disorder irritable irritable bow syndrome um were taking apple cider vinegar and it they did improve um symptoms of their of their gut disorder then let last items here okay the last ones would be so probiotics and and there question about probiotics that we into a little in a minute but um I think that yes that there that are beneficial like visbiome sachets which have 450 billion probiotics in them and um you know those can be beneficial particularly with for people that have a gut problem um you know whether or not someone with a healthy microbiome so I kind of stopped supplementing with it like I just don like my gut had any antibiotics in a really long time I do a lot of all the foods all the Prebiotic Foods I was talking about I drink kombucha like almost every day um I do cafir almost every day like I getting I just like there need for me to take the viz biome so um but a lot of people do need to take they do have gut issues and visbiome really does help them uh glutamine is another one that glutamine but um I did when I was having a lot of stress related gut issues when I was in grad school um glutamine is also a very energetic it an organic acid but I drawing a parallel parallel here because like butay like Mal you know malic acid and lactic acid it gets into mitochondria it easily used source of energy um and so it it just makes it easier on your gut it doesn energy and that for someone that having like IBS or IBD or Crohn know or F in the blank gut disorder uh makes a difference it makes makes a difference in symptoms as well um the caveat here is glutamine because it energy source um when I say good energy source it bypass a lot of the things that glucose has to go through to like make it used by the mitochondria um which all require energy to get there so glutamine is like big time favored by cancer cells and so I think anyone that has a gut po you know a colon pup you know any type of precancerous pup in their gut certainly if they have colon cancer uh or even liver cancer um as well it be a dangerous thing because glutamine is like fuel for the fire for cancer it is definitely fuel for the fire that doesn shortterm people with so I would say that uh you know people like myself that are don glutamine for that reason um but people that do have gut issues and they the the they right you know they fighting the battle uh they put out fires they healthier point you know that glutamine can can help and so it things that it of thing as you steps to get you know improved gut health glutamine could be one of those um things to to to try but again the caution knowing that glutamine um it not something you know while it it is beneficial for the gut again it those well how do I know that I got cancer I mean most of us don you know what I mean so you could do um a Grail test and in fact I looking into maybe someone can submit a question about Grail g r a i l um it it detect if you have any type of cancer uh blood cancer solid tumor and it really kind of um accurate so I the process of actually getting I going to invite the guy who actually discovered it um he used to run the C naal National National National Cancer Institute um but I don looked into it but I like doing it yearly so if it affordable I don crazy so I don know that that would be options like okay well I know that I don cancer I did my Grail test or I know that I can take the glutamine like that that would be like the safest thing to do um I didn I was younger you know I was having the gut issues and the glutamine did help me um when I was taking it	Success

Rhonda Patrick & Peter Attia's Supplement Routines	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALlzakecx8o	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so Ken asks about comparing um petera supplements to to my daily supplements so so Ken says hi thank you for S such great great research-based information can you do a compare and contrast between your daily supplements and Peter aa athletic greens ag1 I think that multivitamin Source um he takes the probiotic pendulum which is supposed to to control glucose levels um I personally tried that out when I was wearing my my continuous glucose monitor and it had the opposite effect on me so I I stopped taking that the pendulum he takes Carlson capsules so 2 gram of EPA and 1.5 gr of DHA 5,000 I used day of vitamin D and he takes magnesium and calcium 1 gr of Elemental magnesium 2 to three capsules of slow mag two capsules of 143 milligram of magnesium 460 it has 416 milligram of chloride and 238 Mig of calcium and then he takes magnesium L3 and8 in the evening he takes methyl folate and methyl B12 from jaro providing 400 micrograms of methyl folate 1,000 micrograms of B12 and this is to keep his homocysteine below 9 micro moles per liter and then he takes takes vitamin B6 50 migs of B6 three times a week he used to take it 50 migs a day but he has seen some people developed some sort of vitamin B6 uh neuropathy when they take too much so he three times a week uh he takes ashwagandha from solgar 600 milligrams and he takes glycine two grams of glycine from Thorn and then magnesium L3 and he takes one capsule of Mag mag mag magine which is the brand name of the magnesium l38 and then when he of fosil serene from jaro that team came up with looking at a variety of his Q&A so I might be missing something so kind of comparing to what I take i instead of the athletic greens I take the one multivitamin although right now I taking a prenatal from Thorn which just has um a little bit less vitamin D um which I make up with a a separate vitamin D supplement but it has some iron and I effect on my hair so um I know the next thing to test is is it during during menstration women lose a lot of iron so perhaps just supplementing with iron during that period of time is the way to go or um you know so I don but usually I take the one multivitamin from Thorn and that has has methyl folate it has methyl B12 it has B6 it not as high of a level it know so so it is a daily dose I getting but it Peter takes three times a week so it has a lot of that methyl stuff that he taking methyl folate and the methyl B vitamins as well um and I take vitamin D so I get a usually I get a total of close to a Peter is about 5,000 I use a day four to 5,000 um total including what know my one my one multi has 2,000 I a day in it and so then I 2,000 I use a day of vitamin D usually about 2,000 or maybe 3,000 sometimes depending on the win if it to get a total four to 5,000 I use a day then my omega-3 um I take a higher EPA dose in the morning um I try to get around close to two grams of of a higher EPA concent ated fish oil supplement and then I get a higher dhaa one in the evening I don know that that just think I try to get a total of around four anywhere between four to six milligram sorry grams of EPA and DHA combined throughout the day so I do take probably twice to 2.5 times as much omega-3 as um Peter takes I take magnesium glycinate um so I take about 125 milligrams it from my magnesium Source then I also take vitamin K2 from life extension and then I take alpha lipoic acid from Pure encapsulations I take cocoa so I either do three capsules a day or and that is something that I do do daily um both for just beneficial uh you know it it it important it has a Ben beneficial effect on just vascular health and also um my brain as well so I either take three capsules a day of the cardiovascular one or I take the powder I take one scoop with hot water and then I also do pqq and that Extension I do berberine again um I been doing that like it depends sometimes I do it every other day sometimes I times a week and that is I time it with meals and I usually do it twice a day so it the my breakfast or dinner meal So within an hour or so of the meal I take ubiquinol from Pure encapsulations and I milligrams a day I also do lutein and zanthin from p encapsulations and then I do hydrolized collagen powder about two scoops a day and then I do um I of anoc inositol at night so just mix it with my water and taking it at night and then I melatonin at night I that higher dose of Melatonin where I at 10 Megs a day um again I use it for it controls like really controls having any sort of night terror disruption um where I wake up like screaming something it control but also I increasingly convinced that um I don I think melatonin is just sort of a a beneficial thing an antioxidant in the brain I haven a really bad bad for you but the the jury lmnt when I workouts um my high-intensity workouts sauna and then I do an occasional probiotic um I use Flora stored orbis biome you know this is like once twice a week I do an occasional Mara I ually I use mariva mostly these days for muscle soreness like if I like delayed on muscle soreness or any sort of pain menstrual related or like if I have a headache like I didn sleep or something and then I also sort of occasionally have been using Boron and autophagy renew from life life extension when I say occasional it those like oh twice a week kind of thing um as well and then um I occasionally using Biotin for hair and nails as well so I do a significantly more supp than Peter does and that is really I would say I do a lot of what I cover a lot of what he gets and then some I haven mimies I think I experimenting with taring and as well uh Liz is asking what brand melatonin so the brands I use most of it most of the brands I use are pure encapsulations and Thorn and then some life extension like life extension makes my vitamin K2 and they make the pqq like there things I just can two main Brands um Lisa asked if I noticed any benefits with the nasl and really I I I it which which one is um you know but but the anoco is like important for Reproductive Health as well so uh you know I I just I do I I do think I like I said I but I don because I melatonin and Don is asking the brand of electrolytes I Amanda put in the chat here I personally just like that brand now it high sodium concentration higher than like noon which I think I used to use noon and noon is also good as well I just personally like the flavors of element te like they have like a wide variety of like I just like their their flavors I really just like it and um I do end up sweating a lot and so the little bit of extra sodium for me is beneficial personally I also don salt to like I don when I make eggs I don salad when I make my salad so I like a salty person getting a ton in like of salt every day uh from like unless I stuff like like is very obvious I getting a lot of salt so um you know it it really comes down to like are you already getting a lot of salt if you already getting tons of salt from your diet then you probably don really much electrolyte supplementation honestly if you could be getting enough sodium from from your diet but uh per personally I I not one of those people that salt diet so I do like to add the element te as well and then Matthew asking about the AC acetal lcarnitine and yeah I think I you know so I lipoic acid and it I think it would be nice if I could add the as AC acetal lcarnitine to the alphalipoic acid you know my mentor Bruce AMS has shown there was lots of mitochondrial benefits with doing the combination of of alphalipoic acid and acetyl carnitine and I just you know I do eat a lot of meat and the carnitine is very high in meat and the same goes with the tarine as well which is why haven have to go out and buy that supplement you know so but but it it back of my mind you know the the adding the acet acety carnitine with my alphalipoic acid is sort of there and the the alphalipoic acid the the the main reason that I started supplementing with it is actually not even from what Bruce making old mitochondria look young again and this is of course in animal studies it showing that it dramatically reduces Advanced gation end products so it it type 2 diabetes that have high high levels of advanced glycation end products which cause neuropathy retinopathy all kinds of you know secondary complications that go along with type to diabetes I interested in reducing the advanced cation end products and so that personally that when I and I often even forget about the mitochondrial potential mitochondrial benefits as well and so that don you know on my high up list to get the AC acetal L carnitine with it but it is something I you know I do think about oh I should add that you know to get the combination of acet acety carnitine with of course which is the beneficial for mitochondria but again you you meat you as well LP is asking if I stopped taking Brock and if so why um yeah I I I just kind of started using the the MinGa powder in my smoothies and you know after just having so many conversations with Dr Jed fahe I me that there sort of uh the sulfurane and the moringin are like doing they activating the Nrf2 pathway and having a lot of the same beneficial effects MinGa powder is so much cheaper and um it also just like I feel like it to know that I more stable so with the with the Brock there was always the concern of oh is this like how much is degraded how much is you know is there how much sulur is even left by the time it makes it to my hands so I the I smoothies and I do try to do them daily I don definitely am you know you know I would say like four times a week getting getting my smoothie and I the Maringa powder to them and I think I think that stopped doing the the Brock I taking creatine Robin um but I do supplement with protein powder maybe I should have added that that added that in as well um I will add it to my smoothie or I Standalone depending on if I had my smoothie or not because I do find that it 1.6 gr um grams of protein per kilogram of body weight for me um just it not like someone that just eats a lot so it I do find it easier if I can just like get that protein powder and Cindy asking what my smoothie looks like these days so um these days what my smoothie is is I do get my kale so I most of the time that only green that I sometimes I it avocado and then I do frozen blueberries um sometimes I are organic frozen organic blueberries along with Organic raspberries and organic strawberries so I do a little bit of a organic mixed berries but a lot of times I the blueberries because that what with respect to polyphenols and um anth thein as well I do quite a bit of blueberries to be honest uh I I was doing the whole like you know keto experimentation thing I would do like just a handful but I now so I actually I really go heavy on the organic blueberries in the Smoothie cuz it I think there a blueberri so beneficial and it makes me feel really good it that I get and then I add in collagen powder so I collagen powder um Two Scoops and then I like a big heaping tablespoon of that it depending on whether or not again uh I I do a workout without if I separate protein shake these these days I unflavored whey protein powder into to my to my smoothies because I trying to get a little extra protein in so I some water and that what my smoothie is	Success

more than any of those things if you could pel up what you can do with vigorous exercise then I think that is like right now what the best longevity drug we have for delaying the aging process and improving Health span and improving lifespan so when I say vigorous exercise what do I mean um generally speaking of course there there here because you can take some someone who really done any aerobic exercise vigorous exercise for them is going to be probably more what light to moderate exercise is for people that are Physically Active but generally speaking once you kind of adapt and get you know used to phys being Physically Active vigorous exercise is about getting to 80% your max heart rate or estimated max heart rate um that I ma your maximum heart rate so cardiorespiratory Fitness this is one of the best biomarkers for longevity in my opinion um so cardiorespiratory Fitness is measured empirically by V2 Max so that oxygen that you can take up during maximal exercise so when I use V2 Max all you know sometimes these are like interchangeable cardiorespiratory Fitness BO2 Max I kind of use them interchangeably in this in this talk um but B2 Max is just directly measuring cardiorespiratory Fitness so cardiorespiratory Fitness is associated with improved longevity it does improve longevity um and and the biggest improvements you you age group for your for your gender if you above that is is where you get the biggest bang for your buck so people that have a low normal V2 max if they just go up to a um if they sorry if they and they go up to just low normal they get about a 2.1 increased life expectancy if they they go up to high normal they get almost a three-year increased life expectancy and then if they go from below normal to the upper amount of normal so this is the top 5% of the population this is more like you getting into the elite athlete level that increase in life expectancy um so just to give you some perspective here about half of the US population is they have a low normal cardiorespiratory Fitness and the other half has about a high normal uh cardiorespiratory Fitness so again just mostly having to do with being physically active or not being physically active and on average um for every unit increase in V2 Max it associated with a 45 day increase in life expectancy and there was a really important study published in Jama back in 2018 um that I just like to mention because it it kind of established that there was no upper limit to the mortality reduction of having a high cardiorespiratory Fitness I mean obviously within human normal human life expectancy ranges right so um people that were in the the bottom 25% of cardiorespiratory Fitness or their V2 Max and also I like these studies because they something empirically I V2 Max right this is a fitness test that versus a lot of studies and conflicting data out there where you have these questionnaires how Physically Active are you you know and you so you think about your last week or or month and then that they go okay well based on this last week this is how Physically Active we think this person is over the you know their their lifetime or whatever and I just it all we have in some respects but um if you can if you can measure something empirically it clear up a lot of the confounding and a lot of the um you know conflicting data that you see out there so I really like studies that measure V2 Max because it something that empirical rather than going off a questionnaire right with that have all sorts of problems so going from the low um bottom 25% of V2 Max up to the elite level so you the top 2.3% I mean these are the Elite athletes that reduction in all cause all cause mortality so comparing those two groups people in the low 25% group versus the like the elite level um but even going from the high cardiorespiratory Fitness so this uh this is the top 25% of the population they These are people that are they committed exercisers they they go up to the elite level um they they get a you know even 20% more reduction all cause mortality so if you compare the to the high cardiorespiratory Fitness um you you cause mortality by just moving up to that Elite level um and what was really interesting about this study was that being in that low 25% group that the you know they 25% for v2 Max that was comparable to a either same risk or greater risk than for mortality early mortality as type 2 diabetes as smoking and as um having heart disease so again putting that into perspective you know we all think about these diseases and how they they mortality risk but like just not having a good cardiorespiratory Fitness can do the same thing so how do you improve your V2 Max how do you improve your cardiorespiratory Fitness well any exercise any aerobic exercise is is obviously going to be good for um small changes in cardiorespiratory Fitness but in particular there have been meta analysis that have found that vigorous intensity exercise as I mentioned in particularly high-intensity interval training which we so this is where you short bursts of you know very vigorous exercise you heart rate sometimes going even above that and then and then having rest periods and you um and why that there have been some studies that have found that even people that are meeting the guidelines for moderate aerobic exercise so they hours of moderate intensity aerobic exercise per week do not about 40% of those people do not respond in other words they do not get V2 Max improvements they are not improving their cardiorespiratory Fitness by doing two and a half hours of moderate intensity exercise every week um and it there that however when those people do more of a high-intensity interval training workout they they do more vigorous exercise and they start to respond and improve their v2x and it Max cardiorespiratory Fitness to get those changes to get those improvements you really have to increase cardiac output um so the stronger the signal the strong the more intense the signal the adaptations are greater so your body responds by improving the delivery of oxygen to your tissues right so that essentially what um you improve your cardiio RIS Fitness and so that intensity and particularly high intensity training is so important for improving cardiorespiratory Fitness um and the and one of the I there several studies looking at this and U for example Dr Martin gabal gabala out of McMaster University over in Ontario Canada has done a lot of studies looking at different high-intensity interval training protocols and it really seems if you cardiorespiratory Fitness that you have to do longer intervals so 3 to 5 minute intervals of just the maximum intensity that you can maintain for that 3 to five minutes and so a really good um and well studied a lot of evidence on the Norwegian 4x4 protocol so this is four minutes of the highest intensity that you can do and then it recovery so you like light light exercise you want your heart rate to go down you want to sort of of really give yourself some rest so that you can do it again so you repeat this four times that 4x4 and this is one of the best protocols for improving V2 Max um if you don V2 Max measured or you don to it for whatever reason um one of the the best evidence-based ways of measuring BO2 Max um at home so to speak not necessarily home is what 12 minute run test or walk test depending on your Fitness level um essentially you need uh some sort of you know wearable device that can track your your distance so Apple watch your Fitbit whatever and you need to you need to have like a flat surface that you can run on so like a track field and you want to run for 12 minutes or walk depending on your Fitness level the maximum am intensity that you can maintain for that 12 minutes and you that basically your distance is going to be covered and then you look up this equation and it converts you know your V2 Max based on that distance and the reason you don because that the distance will be less so you want to make sure you surface so that you actually are more accurate in terming what your distance is during that 12-minute run test	Success
Eat These Foods to \"Bulk Up\" & Build Muscle | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ACIzD3DTIo	FoundMyFitness Clips 	another rapid fire fire question it says if you are a man and looking for the healthiest way possible to gain weight bulk up so putting on muscle mass what would your diet look like how would you add extra calories so that I mean you know gaining weight and bulking up in a healthy way involves you have to consume the right amount of foods you have to do the right exercises to you know to be able to to gain the muscle mass and minimize fat gain so obviously resistance training is very important and also doing your your aerobic exercise vigorous intensity exercise as well with respect to protein focusing on really high quality protein sources so that would be lean meat turkey chicken lean beef that would be fish things like salmon tuna well I wouldn salmon and mackarel um eggs as well as some dairy products maybe some Greek yogurt or cotage cheese um there plant-based sources of protein like legumes and quinoa aiming for I mean depending on what you going for and how much you work out you know you could go anywhere from 1.2 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram body weight right depending on what your your training schedule looks like so the more um rigorous your training schedule the more protein you can add right so also incorporating some carbohydrates could be beneficial as well so the quinoa the sprouted um whole grain bread might help as well um as oats so um some carbohydr some carbohydrates fruits and vegetables or another one getting the vitamins and minerals timing some of the protein and carbohydrates around your workout might help as well healthy fats would be another source of calories so that would be avocados nuts seeds olive oil again the fatty fish as well and then extra calories if you the extra calories adding in some like nut Butters so you could do like some almond butters macadamia nut Butters you know some of the nut Butters there some dried fruits with no added sugar for extra calories there you can do like the the full fat Greek yogurt with some Pro you know protein powder maybe some nut butter in there that calories that are more nutritionally I mean healthy and then adding having larger portion of meals and then more frequent meals so like maybe eating so you could do the larg larger portion meals or the more frequent meals and I think you know the the the small portion meals doing like five or six instead of the three large ones might help you increase your calorie intake because it with um more frequent smaller meals than like three larger meals cuz like you can only eat so much within one meal and I think that best way to uh bulk up in a healthy way obviously I didn training stuff but but that Owen asks what my brand of unflavored whey protein powder is um so there criteria I look at when looking for whey protein powders and so there concentrate versus isolate and we talked about this in the past protein content so isolate has a higher protein content than Pro um whe concentrate so the way Protein Isolate is is is the one that you want with higher protein content lactose content so isolate has lower lactose levels which does it makes makes it a little more suitable for people with lactose intolerance and then there less fat than the concentrate and then there calories obviously it has less fat so it the concentrate does so I more interested in more protein less fat fewer calories and which is why I like the whe whey protein isolate and there a few other factors to consider when looking at whey protein isolate powder so there sourced from grass-fed cows that can have a higher nutritional value including a better omega-3 to Omega six acid ratio and then there of the processing method so cold processed or microfiltered way protein retains more of the natural nutrients found in way and then there organic which is nice so you can always look at thirdparty testing which is what I do that will help you look for the quality the Purity it give it adds that layer of trust there you know that that just really helps so with all that said neutri cost neutri cost grass-fed whey protein isolate un flavored which I have no affiliation with um is a good source it has a high amount of the concentration of protein Purity um without contaminants it a grass-fed Source it doesn metal contaminants it it also look through thirdparty testing like consumer lab and find another one but that like	Success
Rhonda Patrick takes this type of magnesium	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwFf9Nn5yuo	FoundMyFitness Clips 	also do a supplement of about 125 milligrams of magnesium and I do magnesium glycinate um most of the Magnesium supplements are with respect um I would say the one that bioavailable is magnesium dioxide but you could you know magnesium glycinate is a really good bioavailability has very good bioavailability	Success
This type of exercise helps you repair damaged mitochondria	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70MzNCOqwOo	FoundMyFitness Clips 	[Music] vigorous exercise high-intensity exercise has been shown to increase this repair process in mitochondri known as mitophagy so when exercise is intense enough it increases the nutrient sensing protein a kyes k it activates it and this causes the mitochondria to send the signal that they need to repair themselves and then you what you have is a long-term effect of after doing you know routine high-intensity exercise you then have more healthy functional mitochondria because you damaged part of the mitochondria if the mitochondria is dysfunctional enough you mitochondria	Success

Should You Supplement With Alpha-Lipoic Acid? - Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtVNt7IgN_o	FoundMyFitness Clips 	okay so the next question that was a deep dive was submitted by Olga and Olga says hi Rhonda you mentioned that you taking alphalipoic acid because you please explain the benefits and risk of supplementation so alphalipoic acid or ala for short it compound that is made in our mitochondria it sources including leafy greens it found in liver and in red meat um it best known for its role as a mitochondrial co-actor supporting energy production through the kreb cycle where it helps convert nutrients into ATP Beyond energy production alphalipoic acid also has several other potentially benefits on mitochondrial and cellular health so my mentor the late Bruce Ames um was involved in showing a lot of the beneficial effects of alphalipoic acid on mitochondrial health so from an antioxidant perspective alphal lipoic acid is unique in its ability to neutralize free radicals and regenerate other antioxidants such as vitamin C vitamin E CoQ10 and glutathione which sort of amplifies its overall impact on reducing oxidative stress because it antioxidant that can neutralize free radicals it also regenerates other antioxidants in the body this this this is critical for protecting mitochondrial Integrity particularly in conditions where there it alipo acid is so beneficial for mitochondria it also has anti-inflammatory properties which can indirectly support mitochondrial Health by mitigating lowgrade inflammation that contributes to Cellular dysfunction over time and it also interestingly has metal Keating capabilities it can bind to some heavy metals like iron and copper thereby preventing these from participating in oxidative reactions that can further damage cells iron is a big one because too much free Iron can cause massive oxidative stress and be very very damaging to mitochondria and so um it alphalipoic acid really has many different ways in which it is improving mitochondrial Health through reducing oxidative stress including binding up and Keating free Iron that within the cells as well another really sort of intriguing aspect of alphal lipoic acid is its role in reducing Advanced glycation end products so ages we in a a number of q&as they aging and metabolic disease so advanc glycation end products form when there is a reaction between glucose and proteins um and lipids so it can happen endogenously in the body particularly if someone for example when that when that when you have blood glucose levels elevated in circulation they the glucose there reacts with collagen lining your blood vessels or collagen lining your your myocardium or pericardium surrounding your heart or interacts with LDL cholesterol lipids and what happens is it it stiffens things it stiffens the proteins the collagen this plays a role in hypertension it plays a role in reducing cardiac compliance right plays a role in the stiffening of our heart with age or LDL it plays the role in making it stiffer more ox I um if it interacts with other proteins in our body uh it can affect the structure of it and the function of the protein also um it can interact with this the lipid bilayer on cells and affect transport of nutrients and transport of proteins into the cell because the cell the cell membrane becomes stiffer so Advanced cation end products essentially the the point I trying to D drive home here is they very damaging they also can be formed within exogenously so you can consume them in food that you the same reaction it you equation so something that has a lot of advanced cation end products for example is bacon if you fry bacon on a frying pan um or in a skillet I mean it astronomical levels of advanced glycation end products versus for example microwaving it so you can eat foods that also have advanced cation end products if you see that anything that caramelized like a caramelized thing that products I mean it tastes great but it it sugars and proteins and so um and also fats and so it you get Advanced cation end products into your system so back to alphalipoic acid um we alphalipoic acid in negating advanced cation end products so for example there was a study in diabetic nephropathy patients so these are patients that have um kidney problems and typically those are linked to a lot of advanced cation end products that have damaged the kid kidney so what what was shown is that daily supplementation with 800 milligrams of alphalipoic acid was able to reduce serum levels Advanced ccasian end products over 12 weeks the there not a lot of evidence on this so I mean these findings are sort of interesting and promising I do think it to approach alpha lipoic acid supplementation with in the broader context of overall mitoch health strategies such as you want to you want to basically do what you can to improve your mitochondria by eating healthy and regular physical activity high intensity endal training for example you know these are things that are really good for the mitochondria and this is just a supplement on top of that right all right so peripheral neuropathy is also something that cation end products typically found in patients with type 2 diabetes it condition where the nerves the peripheral nerves are damaged and diabetes is really the major contributing factor factor for this there acid being beneficial but the evidence is mixed so a meta analysis of randomized control trials showed that alphal lipoic acid improved sensory symptoms and demonstrated a dose dependent response for total symptom scores and overall patient satisfaction however it had no significant effect on measures like muscle power or vibration perception threshold or nerve conduction in contrast a a cockran review showed that ala had no effect on nerve damage symptoms or impairment so that said given the roles of mitochondrial dysfunction Advanced cation end products in diabetic neuropathy um I do think alphal lipoic acid mitochondrial function and reduce ages is pretty plausible and um it might be more of a preventative measure rather than a treatment for someone that already got a stablished so much damage and neuropathy right it you know if the ship is already sinking it patch it up but if you can prevent the ship from sinking it that so that alphalipoic aciid unfortunately a lot of studies that are done are not preventative they alphalipoic acid before they have neuropathy and then following them to see if they ever develop it because that would really be the study that needs to be done diabetes blood sugar regulations studies investigating alal po imp the alphalipoic acids impact on insulin sensitivity and glycemic control do have variable results also for instance patients that have typee 2 diabetes there there both acutely after alpha lipoic acid infusion and also one month after oral treatment however metaanalysis of randomized control trials using standard blood tests for glycemic markers did have Mi mixed results so one meta analysis showed no changes while another metaanalysis had reduction showed reductions in fasting blood glucose reductions in hba1c reduction in insulin concentrations um and also other markers of insulin resistance so again mixed results when you to a lot of factors dose of Al alphal lipoic acid disease progression how how healthy are these individuals right so there here and I do think it probably suggests that alphalipoic acids efficacy depends on the stage of metabolic dysfunction I currently you know metabolically healthy and so it Alpha poic acid in hopes that it to improve my mitochondrial efficiency it improve mitochondrial Health it to improve um the the formation of advanced gation end products will be lowered all of those things right um there that aoic acid also affects blood lipids so ala appears to have a modest but significant effect on lowering cholesterol so there an analysis of multiple randomized control trials that found doses between 300 mg and 1200 Mig a day led to reductions in total cholesterol so about almost 11 milligrams per deciliter reduction in total cholesterol almost 11 milligram per deciliter reduction in LDL cholesterol and about a 31 milligram per deiler reduction in triglycerides and this is across a range of different populations of people across a range of different Health statuses so I did find that that data very interesting ala has also been shown to reduce inflammatory markers like tnf Alpha il6 C reactive protein another meta analysis of multiple randomized controled trials found reductions in those inflamatory biomarkers again there enough data to at least get a meta analysis which is good but it this neutral is as well studied as something like metformin for example in ter of safety there review and meta analysis that pulled data from 71 different randomized control trials and found there increased risk of Adverse Events with alphal lipoic acid supplementation um this is consistent across I diverse subgroups including people with diabetes people with cardiovascular disease people with neurological disorders kidney impairment even pregnancy although I didn pregnancy it with no adverse effects across a broad range of people and so I really think that this sort of Broad Safety profile suggests that alphalipoic acid is is safe and um you know what its efficacy is in these certain conditions is yet to be determined like I said I do think that it improving neuropathy or improving hba1c might have to do with your disease status right as well as the dose that you think your metabolic Health um is an important factor in this equation as well Daisy is asking what dose I take and what time of day so I take 600 milligrams of alphalipoic acid and I usually take it before bed and another um it read this data so maybe things have changed since then I with the grain of salt but quite a while ago over a decade ago I remember I was doing a lot of research on alph pooke acid and I came across some data suggesting that unlike other supplements when you typically alphalipoic acid I mentioned it it Foods we also make it in our body it usually complex to protein when it foods but when you take alphalipoic acid right after a meal it does lower its bioavailability for some reason it complexes with the proteins and isn well or something along those lines I don big of a difference but if you trying to eek out every last kind of benefit you can you might want to take it a little bit after you maybe 3 hours or so after you actually don it with all of my supplements and typically I take those within an hour or two after I eat Mike is asking in the chat how ala would compare to um benot benine um in terms of combating advanced glycation end products I I think there might be more data if you had to choose between the two to go for alpha lipoic acid there and it also has other benefits too that are very I would say very enticing right I mean the mitochondrial improvements the Keating iron in addition to the advanced glycation end products and in fact there going to get to I it now um but someone asked me why I stopped taking berberine and the reason is because I decided that alphal poic acid does everything berberine does without without the risk of adverse problems with mitochondria and in fact improves mitochondria so I gotten some of my data back and alphalite poic acid my hba1c um it it did seem to lower my hb1c so right now my hb1c was the last I measured it was about a month ago or month and a half ago actually and it was 4.7 which is pretty good and the last time I had done it before the alal lioke acid I think I was like five about five so so I do I do like the alphal lipoic acid	Success
Quercetin is a zinc ionophore with antiviral activity | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK6OLRKjXQ0	FoundMyFitness Clips 	the question is can you talk about quercetin so quercetin is a flavonoid it in onions green tea apples berries it plants like ginkgo poloba saint john wort buckwheat tea quercetin has been reported to block the entry of sarge cove one the original the virus that caused the original sarge outbreak in host cells and so this was in in cells in a petri dish the cytotoxicity of quercetin is very low it drug ingredient people can take it as a supplement it has not been clinically tested in sarge cove ii clinical trials or at least one clinical trial is beginning in a collaborative effort between canada and china with outcomes expected in around four months so um there was a publication that involved the screening of old drugs to sort of repurpose them against covid19 and based on that publication there was a genome similarity sars is the closest virus to the sarge cove ii and followed by mares and other human coronavirus diseases data mining identified 34 covid 2019 related genes and 24 disease-related pathways using drug prioritization algorithms researchers identified 78 drugs to repurpose there was manual filtering based on clinical knowledge and a variety of other screening methods but quercetin was included in this group in another virtual screening of chinese herbal medicines quercetin was also predicted as a potentially useful drug to repurpose against the sarge cove2 virus the literature is pretty supportive of quercetin having antiviral capacities when it with targeted cells and a broad spectrum of pathogens including rhinoviruses adenoviruses and coronaviruses another in vitro study with cultured cells found that quercetin does seem to have zinc ionophore activity so polyphenols such as quercetin as well as egcg can transport zinc cations across the plasma membrane independently of plasma membrane zinc transporters zinc inhibits the action of rna-dependent rna polymerase as mentioned earlier a key enzyme in the reproduction of rna viruses so that what the current literature says on quercetin as a zinc ionophore and the limited amount of literature showing it does have antiviral activity um particularly has been shown to have antiviral activity against the code one virus	Success
This is why you don't want to be deficient in vitamin D	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTdYTRi3EcI	FoundMyFitness Clips 	keeping in mind that vitamin D really is probably the most important here because we do derive calcium primarily from our diet and that vitamin D status is essential in in maximizing the bioavailability of calcium from our diet	Success
Is running a more effective treatment for depression than SSRIs?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCM_ExyGms0	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so there have been studies that have compared like running to people taking ssris and it was as good if not better at improving a variety of depressive symptoms in people with depression running was yeah compared to ssris	Success
Listen to this if you skip breakfast	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8WC7PNcqec	FoundMyFitness Clips 	um so that first meal breakfast is so important because you the point where you you need protein and so you get into this sort of catabolic um you know state if you protein at that point now somewhat if you can that can sort of help offset that a bit because you are getting that other signal right to help uh you know get the muscle protein synthesis going uh but I think that then again also just if you meal you are you going to make up for that protein and your other couple of meals that you doing that I was not and	Success
This is guaranteed to make you start lifting weights	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwZBtDLrgIQ	FoundMyFitness Clips 	if you are constantly pulling amino acids from your muscle it from your retirement fun early right our our muscle ma Mass Peak is probably I would say anywhere between 20 to 30 years old is when we mass after 30 as you get into 40 you start going down you want to try to build up that muscle mass Reservoir earlier in life kind of like you do what your retirement fund right like you want to build it up because you be pulling from it no matter what even if you you because you just lose more muscle mass and strength as you age it of the aging process and so the more the more you can kind of counter that with resistance training with making sure you better off you	Success
This Habit Is Better Than Pills for Depression, Diabetes, & High Blood Pressure	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdCywLYfn_I	FoundMyFitness Clips 	but I move on to the next topic um or aspect of Fitness if somebody is extremely metabolically disregulated they have type 2 diabetes or they what do we know about the impact of exercise in particular vigorous exercise on not just managing that condition but but reversing it like if somebody full-blown type to you know can they move that backwards and if so like how much yeah um great question so I start with pre-diabetes um because I love talking about this study there was like probably one of the largest studies done looking at the effect of exercise versus metformin on the progression of pre-diabetes into diabetes and the reason I like this study is because there mean it know you you talk to someone with with type two diabetes and they you know some generic now it longevity drug like people that are perfectly healthy are taking it yeah yeah and I I disagree with that but um yes so so then this is why I like talking about this study because exercise outperformed and this was you know people were doing like moderate intensity exercise but it outperformed metformin by almost like 30 to 40% 40 maybe was like closer to 40% um so you know it outperformed it in other words it stopped the progression of pre-diabetes to type 2 diabetes much much better than metformin did exercise right so I like that study because it really shows the power of exercise and how no you you not it course a lot of other studies that have shown that people that have type 2 diabetes can reverse their type two diabetes with exercise I don the magnitude cuz you know it many years since I those studies it looked at recently but I do think it is a powerful tool that we all have at our disposal that we should be using and I saying we I mean I personally don type 2 diabetes but like we as people right I mean people with type two diabetes that think that they you know cursed with this disease that they can never Escape it necessarily true you know there are lifestyle modifications including exercise probably being the most important I don important than exercise in in terms of health but also in Reverse reversing type two diabetes I think that the biggest the biggest factors and again um the more vigorous the intensity it is better like so for example there been studies that have shown you know if you take people that walk at a you know a brisk walk and then you take those brisk Walkers and then make them do intervals where they fast and then you know then brisk walking again and then really going like like almost jogging and then brisk walking they again are have improved markers of insulin sensitivity of glucose regulation all those things if they vigorous exercise is really important with respect to I would say preventing the progression of diabetes um protecting you against getting diabetes and also in terms of helping reverse type 2 diabetes all of the above very very important yeah yeah yeah um when you think about what people suffer from the most it metabolically disregulated pre-diabetic diabetic it it you know condition disease right um and hypertension like high blood pressure so high blood pressure I mean obviously exercise is going to lower your blood pressure um are there things about that aspect of this that are worth uh kind of highlighting with respect to comparing sary person uh and their risk you know who who who is sort of teetering on hypertension and what exercise can do to move the needle on that yes yeah there been a quite a few studies um there one in particular I think it was a meta analysis of multiple different randomized control trials showing that it was like 30 minutes a day or something don 30 minutes three times a week I think and it was you moderate to vigorous intensity exercise again I think it was about three times a week over the course of I don people had improvements in their in their blood pressure that were comparable to anti-hypertensive treatments anti-hypertensive drugs so yeah it can have druggable size effects you know if you are committed to improving your health improving your blood pressure you know without taking medication you have to be committed to it like you it unless you put in the effort but if you do 30 minutes of you know 80% max heart rate let Studies have shown that can have a an effect on your blood pressure that comparable to taking an anti-hypertensive drug and I think that talking about druggable size effects here and it that that well it different ssris so there have been studies that have compared like running to people taking ssris and it was as good if not better at improving a variety of depressive symptoms in people with depression running was yeah compared to ssris so again now it it is it have like depression where they just can that run I mean that other you know category but there are people that that are have depressive symptoms maybe they don full-blown like major depressive disorder but you know they have anxiety or bouts of depression or you know and and they can move like they they can get enough willpower to and so I mean it really important it amazing tool that we have to improve so many aspects of our health I did a lot of research in nutrition and so it know it thought as the most important thing and I is important but I think exercise is the most I think it thing it seems to be the ensus yeah I I think I mean you can get across the board and in particular with respect to health span extension right yeah and and just even all cause mortality I mean I think you can you can you can get away with some other bad behaviors like like I said like the the sleep you know if you sleep there people that are you know getting fewer than seven hours of sleep at night they have a higher all cause mortality than people that are getting greater than seven like 7 to nine hours a night but if they fewer than 7even hours guess what they have the same all cause mortality again so exercise I I think really does forgive some of the sins and um that where you know if you you know make sure you active but they do say you can exercise your way out of a bad diet which makes me think about uh elevated cholesterol so if somebody has a high apop or their LDL is out of whack maybe they told them they should be what is the impact of exercise versus making changes in your diet to deal with that specific thing yeah you mean dietary changes for apob LDL I mean that sure I mean because we know saturated fat especially in combination with refined sugars um make make a disaster for apob and also for small dense LDL particles which kind of are more prone to lodging into the arterial wall and so yes diet is important and you you can exercise your way out of a bad diet in that regard so you do you do need to care for both for sure but um I do think like if someone held a gun to my head and say choose one what important thing I would I would say exercise yeah	Success

Can exercise increase the size of your brain?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXiZ2JstPxg	FoundMyFitness Clips 	there have been a variety of studies that have shown even older adults that are engaging in moderate intensity activity for about a year can increase the size of their hippocampus by like 2% which is amazing because typically older adults lose in their their hippocamp hippocampus atrophies with time so not only were they fighting and staving off the atrophying but they were also increasing it	Success

The Biggest Benefit of Exercise No One Is Talking About	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYOZ-d95iFI	FoundMyFitness Clips 	the last topic that I want to discuss is exercise alcohol and exercise don like they many Family Fitness members had questions about how they could enjoy alcohol while also making progress with their Fitness we will cover how exercise could be used to counter alcohol cravings how alcohol affects exercise performance and recovery and if exercise actually lessens the damaging effects of moderate alcohol drinking all of you know that I am a huge fan of exercise and there interesting research on the effects of alcohol on exercise performance and Recovery alcohol is commonly used to socialize after exercise to celebrate a big achievement like running a marathon often along with some good food and at this time most people aren about optimizing their adaptations or recovery it time first let performance it would not want to have even one or two drinks right before a workout there are zero aspects of alcohol that would help improve endurance strength or speed from the evidence that is available on this topic it seems that alcohol acutely reduces endurance performance but may not have major impact on strength even at high doses what seems to be more relevant is how alcohol impacts recovery from exercise and adaptations to training again there evidence here but there is some so in order to recover properly from exercise and get the most out of training hydration refueling acceler ating muscle tissue damage are really important consuming alcohol after exercise appears to have a negative effect on hydration status but only at a dose of nearly 1 gram per kilogram of body weight which would be around five or more standard drinks for most people at a dose less than 0.5 gram of alcohol per kilogram of body weight alcohol may not impair impair rehydration whether you should be concerned about alcohol hydration after exercise probably depends on how soon you engaging in exercise again it may not be that consequential alcohol also doesn appear to impair the ability to restore muscle glycogen after exercise as long as it meal that contains carbohydrates of course if an alcoholic drink or two displaces some food you might be eating then this might compromise muscle glycogen replenishment alcohol may also be detrimental for recovery from injury for one alcohol impacts our immune system system in a way that suppresses some pro-inflammatory cyto kindes such as tnf Alpha and il1 beta and il6 and increases levels of some anti-inflammatory cyto kindes this might seem like a good thing but when we injury we actually want an inflammatory response at the site of injury to initiate the healing process there is also some research though very limited that suggests alcohol may have effects on skeletal muscle blood flow and anabolic hormones like testosterone that are crucial to the healing in process when consumed after a session of exercise alcohol blunts muscle protein synthesis for as much as 24 hours after type 2 muscle fibers the so-called fast twitch fibers seem to be more susceptible to the effects of alcohol at least when looking at studies in rats and when using an extremely heavy dose of alcohol and lastly consuming alcohol after exercise has been shown to worsen the declines in muscle performance after muscle damaging EX exercise meaning that greater muscle damage may have been introduced or induced or that recovery ability is impaired several of these Studies have used a very high dose of alcohol that really isn any person to consume in a safe single setting so I do think that is worth noting in addition to negatively affecting recovery this also means that alcohol consumption could blunt your gains a study involving Physically Active males demonstrated that consuming 12 standard drinks after resistance anerobic training despite also ingesting 25 gr of whey protein reduced muscle protein synthesis by 24% this reduction was even greater at 37% when alcohol was consumed without additional protein this shows that alcohol even when paired with optimal amounts of protein can blunt the anabolic response crucial for muscle repair and growth essentially alcohol can counteract the benefits of your work work out efforts by impairing the body ability to repair and build muscle tissue now this study was a bit extreme because most people are not going to consume 12 standard alcoholic beverages however it is still likely that even small amounts of alcohol can potentially influence recovery processes and protein synthesis but the extent and significance of these effects would be considerably less than with high levels of alcohol intake but even a 5 to 10% reduction in protein synthesis after exercise isn to optimize their training response higher doses of alcohol after exercise can hinder recovery by promoting a catabolic state which is not conducive to muscle growth and repair moderate alcohol consumption something equivalent to about three and a half drinks raises cortisol levels a stress hormone that breaks down muscle but it doesn significantly alter testosterone moreover alcohol consumption disrupts the activation of mtor a key protein in the pathway that stimulates muscle protein synthesis when the alcohol dose is high like 7 and a half standard drinks for a 70 kilogram male then it does decrease testosterone production which is particularly important for males I acute effects of alcohol but chronic heavy alcohol consumption is associated with a range of muscle abnormalities including inflammation mitochondrial dysfunction ox oida of stress reduce muscle mass enhance protein degradation and increase autophagy however this may only apply to adults who are heavy chronic drinkers overall it seems that you can still consume Light alcohol and reap the benefits of exercise but it is clear that drinking alcohol will probably reduce exercise recovery and adaptation somewhat when compared to the same exercise regimen without alcohol there about that looked at the longer term effects of consuming a moderate dose of alcohol on the improvements in V2 Max after high-intensity interval training or hit this was known as the beer hit study for 10 weeks all of the participants performed high-intensity interval training twice per week some of the participants consumed beer some consumed sparkling water with vodka and some consumed water or non-alcoholic beer men in the alcohol group consumed one standard drink with lunch and dinner on Monday through Friday and the women consumed one standard drink at dinner all of the groups increased their V2 Max at the end of the study and there were no differences between the groups indicating that low to moderate alcohol consumption may not get in the way of cardiorespiratory Fitness improvements during high-intensity interval training a final point I the lines of exercise and alcohol is the potential of exercise to treat alcohol use disorder and perhaps reverse some of the damage to the brain caused by long-term alcohol use we discussed some of the damaging effects of chronic heavy alcohol use on the brain they regular listener of my podcast then you benefits of exercise on brain health and cognitive function in fact many of the ways that exercise benefits the brain are the same Pathways by which alcohol damages it but unfortunately there hasn interaction between alcohol and exercise but I do want to bring up a study from 2013 that provided some evidence that regular exercise may protect the brain from some damage related to heavy alcohol consumption in a group of 60 adults heavy alcohol consumption was associated with less white matter Integrity in two specific brain regions however in the participants who reported the average or above average levels of exercise alcohol consumption was not related to less white matter Integrity there was one other interesting finding that deserves some attention in the participants who didn regularly there was a strong positive association between alcohol consumption and a loss of control over drinking and this relationship was not as strong for the participants who engageed in exercise regularly this would suggest that exercise seems to play an important role in modulating alcohol intake or Cravings of alcohol which is actually well supported based on some literature as a reason for exercise being Incorporated into alcohol treatment programs for over 40 years similar to alcohol exercise activates brain reward circuitry and may reduce cravings for alcohol meta analyses show that exercise interventions reduce drinking volume among people with alcohol use disorders and even improve their V2 Max there are many proposed mechanisms as to why exercise might reduce drinking behaviors some of these are psychological and include enhancing self-efficacy reducing stress promoting social interaction improving mood and mitigating symptoms of comorbid depression and anxiety which are common among adults with alcohol use disorder regarding physiological mechanisms exercise triggers the release of beta endorphins and modulates the Endorphin opioid system both of which are involved in pain Pathways and reward processing it seems that high levels of beta endorphins released during exercise can substitute for alcohol consumption and reduce one also dopamine which is inre during acute exercise and sustained during chronic exercise training the rewarding effects of alcohol consumption are associated with the dopamine pathway and therefore exercise might be one way to reduce the susceptibility to alcohol use there one final and super interesting pathway that I want to discuss related to exercise and alcohol and it that involves the exercise hormone or exor kind called fiberblast growth factor 21 or fgf21 during exercise FG G F21 is released by our liver and muscles and it can cross the bloodb brain barrier and bind to receptors in the hypothalamus it plays a role in many of the beneficial responses to exercise like improved glucose uptake insulin sensitivity lower blood cholesterol levels and reductions and body weight fgf21 also Alters dopamine signaling while exercising increases fgf21 one of the most potent triggers for fgf21 release is alcohol intoxication fgf 21 actually acts as a negative feedback mechanism to decrease subsequent alcohol intake through a liver brain signaling axis even more fascinating in my opinion is the fact that fgf21 also protects against alcohol intoxication if we could find a way to translate the potent anti-alcohol effects of fgf21 to humans this could have in my opinion some major implications there is some evidence that fgf21 may have a therapeutic potential for alcohol use disorders studies in humans have found that single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes involved in fgf21 signaling lead to Greater alcohol consumption in animals fgf21 tells the brain whether to drink more alcohol mice who can alcohol and increasing fgf21 decreases alcohol consumption even when gives given as a drug when an analog of fgf21 was administered ministered to mice and monkeys who were addicted to alcohol their alcohol consumption decreased by 50% increasing fgf21 levels thus appears to be a strategy to decrease the preference for alcohol across species how does this relate to exercise well exercise is one of the most potent ways to naturally increase fgf21 because it released during physical activity endurance exercise specifically cycling at 70% of V2 Max increas ined fgf21 Levels by almost fourfold over Baseline levels one hour after exercise fgf21 levels don training however endurance exercise is better for increasing fgf21 levels because it results in a higher metabolic demand compared to resistance training this leads me to believe that high-intensity interval training or hit may also offer an especially potent benefit for alcohol use disorder due to its benefits on fgf21 but also because of the well-known effects of vigorous exercise on brain Drive neurotrophic factor or bdnf which you have all heard me talk about in several previous podcast episodes bdnf is thought to be one of the main transducers of the anti-depressant effects of exercise and could likely complement the effects of fgf21 and other exercise induced hormones and neurotransmitters to influence alcohol consumption but until this is all been studied to randomized control trials I can summarize the influences of alcohol alcohol on exercise and exercise on alcohol consumption alcohol at a dose of 1 gram per kilogram of body weight impairs exercise recovery because this would equate to five or more drinks in one sitting for most people you may not need to be concerned if you having one or two drinks after exercise but I would certainly avoid high volume alcohol consumption after exercise but of course really at any time if your goal is to optimize recovery and adaptations to exercise if if you are going to consume alcohol after exercise make sure you are consuming adequate protein at least 25 to 30 gram in carbohydrates along with it replacing food calories with alcohol is the worst thing to do if optimal recovery is your goal because remember alcohol is empty calories it seems advisable based on my view of the literature to abstain from alcohol while you are trying to heal from an injury related to exercise as there are certainly no benefits to consuming it at this time just like you would to drink when you recover from an illness or infection there is also some compelling mechanistic evidence that exercise may affect the brain in such a way that it reduces cravings for alcohol and leads to less alcohol consumption exercise has been used in treatments for alcohol use disorder for almost half a century and seems based on some studies in humans to be effective for reducing alcohol consumption among heavy drinkers in many ways engaging in exercise activates the same reward Pathways that alcohol does finally engaging in regular exercise may offer some protection against some of the negative effects of chronic alcohol use on the brain but this is not to say that you should use exercise as an excuse to consume more alcohol	Success
Do you actually need to lift heavy to grow muscle?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLfc9K4pa7k	FoundMyFitness Clips 	Do people need to lift heavy? Well, that question that first St. Phillips, he showed that years ago um that people he he did in untrained people first. So he he showed that untrained men um could gain just as much muscle mass and strength uh lifting lighter weights as people as the men gain uh lifting heavy weights as long as they put in the effort. So the volume and effort has to be high. So, you have to like you probably do a longer duration. It more you you more effort, but you can gain as much muscle mass and strength if you lighter weights as long as you putting in that effort. Um, and then Brad Shfeld came in after because he was like, untrained men. Come on. it in trained men and lo and behold, guess what? Same data, same results. So uh the trained men also could gain as much muscle mass and strength by lifting lower doing lower weights as long as the effort is that you have to put in enough you have to be fatigued	Success

Does Fish Oil Increase Risk of Atrial Fibrillation (AFib)? - Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbW7IOB3ktU	FoundMyFitness Clips 	I the I I think most important questions that was submitted this round and also something that I questions about in the last couple of weeks because of Sensational headlines that were made and so Nikki submitted a question and the question is about what my thoughts are regarding this new study claiming and increased atrial fibrillation and stroke risk in people taking fishwell now I should say um we are going to talk about this new study but we talk about in general is there a concern for people taking fish oil supplements and atrial fibrillation what is the concern is it dose dependent is it dependent on other cardiovascular risk factors is it dependent on the form of Omega-3 that you it only in people that have a high risk for apib okay so there questions and I don answers but I do want to at least address a lot of important points so most of you already know what atrial fibrillation is I call it apib for short um it lead to a stroke heart failure or other cardiovascular complications so the biggest concern with apib is increased stroke risk the apib is characterized by rapid and erratic heart well it erratic electrical impulses in the Atria which is the heart upper chamber and so you get get this sort of irregular heartbeat now omega-3 fatty acids primarily the Marine derived ones so EPA and DHA are known for their cardioprotective properties so that we properties improvements in blood pressure triglycerides lipids but also they cardiovascular related mortality specific cardiovascular events in randomized control trials so they are cardioprotective and and I and I think that this is a pretty true statement there is some research out there that has suggested that omega-3 fatty acids supplementation may increase the relative risk of developing apib so it important to to distinguish the you know relative risk from absolute risk so relative risk considers the increase in a risk in an outcome in this case atrial fibrillation or stroke in comparison to either a baseline so before taking a treatment or having a treatment done or a supplement in this case or in comparison to a control group so relative risk would be in this case people that are taking omega-3 fatty acid supplements versus people taking nothing if it or people taking EP Placebo if it randomized controll trial in this case a higher relative risk with omega-3 use would be you know that the the prob basically people are more likely to develop apib if they versus not um an absolute risk reflects the actual probability of an individual developing apib over a certain time period so whatever that time period is in this in this case you know in randomized control trials it might be a year greater than a year or two years or something like that so that the the absolute risk is what people are actually concerned about because that involves the individual and when you look at the absolute risk of developing apib with omega-3 fatty acid use it let this this new study there was a big I think it was a Time magazine article that came out and claimed healthy young people you know shouldn because they risk they they risk of getting apib and stroke and that was sort of the sensationalistic headline let headline was generated from like the actual data so this data was from a biobank the biobank data this is a huge cohort of of individuals out of the UK they studies so it and it looked at middle and middle-aged population so these are people aged 40 to 69 without any known cardiovascular disease Co so and they also specifically looked at individuals who reported using fish oil supplements what the study found was people that had reported no known disease and reported that they were using fish oil supplements had a 133% higher relative risk of developing apib and a 5% relative risk or increase in developing uh a stroke compared to people that did not identify as using fish oil now all these numbers are based on self-reported and electronic health record so in other words it doesn really capture whether or not someone is healthy doesn disease it was just a self-reported I don have been diagnosed with any with anything so uh it doesn didn or cardiovascular risk factors so you have to keep that in mind as well uh we also don these people were taking what kind of fish oil none of that it just a report a self-report yeah I I I take fish oil I mentioned the relative risk increase that was a 133% relative risk increase in their apib and a 5% relative risk increase in their stroke when we actually look at the absolute stroke risk so when you translate a lot of these relative risks you have to think about the age of the participants what their um Baseline annual risk of apib and stroke are and then you can kind of estimate what the absolute risk is so essentially people in this age group have about a baseline annual risk of apib that is about conservatively 0.5% and a stroke risk of about 1% so when you translate the numbers the absolute increase in apib Risk in this group in people that actually identified as using fish oil was 0.065% so people using fish oil had a 0.0 65% increase in their absolute stroke um in their absolute apib risk and they had a 0 05% increase in their absolute stroke risk um so as you can see those numbers are quite low and really not that meaningful in my opinion unless someone already has a very very high risk of apib and maybe other you know cardiovascular disease risk factors but even then actually what we that this in the very same study that fish oil actually protect people with apib from from actually getting having negative cardiovascular outcomes so the same study when they say there significant increase in stroke risk from taking fish fo oil it note that really this increased risk is just on the edge of white what might be considered an increase at all it was hardly statistically significant and and also um I want to just say that we we really need to be cautious because of the uh statistical methods that were used there was not a lot of confounding factors and some other important ways that are that that statistical analysis is done that wasn here so really take that with the grain of salt even considering the very very low increased absolute risk that happened but even more importantly in that same study the people that actually went on to get apib had a reduction in severe cardiovascular out outcomes so they had a higher risk of developing aphid but a lower risk of developing or progressing from apib to heart failure to death to heart attack so in other words Fishel actually protected the people with the apib from adverse Advance right okay that that something that was not stated in the headline and I think even more importantly and very upsetting to me is that four years ago like four years about I think it was about four years 2020 or so another study was published earlier and with the same exact cohort of people this was the biobank data looking at fish oil people that identified as fish oil users same exact cohort okay and it was published in the same Journal nonetheless and what what was found was that those fish oil users had a 9% lower risk of coronary heart disease they had a 133% lower overall risk of coronary heart disease okay this is relative risk they had a 16% % lower risk of kidney stones they had a 10% lower risk of a apib overall they had a 44% lower risk of liver cancer 177% lower risk of total mortality 19% lower risk of cardiovascular related mortality they had a 10% lower risk of dementia a 15% lower risk of vascular dementia no significant change in Alzheimer disease they had a 133% lower risk in total dementia 12% lower risk of inflammatory bowel disease 17 lower % risk of hip fractures 15% lower risk of vertebrate fractures 133% lower risk all cause mortality 16% lower risk cardiovascular related mortality 20% lower risk heart attack Mortal Mortal mortality related to heart attacks there was no significant difference in stroke mortality they had a 17 17% lower risk of having a heart attack and 8% lower risk of having any cardiovascular event and a 10% lower risk of stroke so as you can see there are many many many many lower risk in a variety of cardiovascular related outcomes other outcomes including inflammatory uh dementia and fractures so out of 14 different npoints that were measured 12 of them had positive benefits one had no change that was the stroke risk and then there was one negative and that was the slight increase in the apib so I would say that overall and also looking at other studies that have actually found a lower stroke risk with omega-3 supplementation there really it it supplements have protective properties against serious cardiovascular conditions and certainly in people with any sort of cardiovascular vulnerability so I would say collectively The increased absolute apib you know the increased risk in in in in apib either relative and even absolute really is is low and in fact people that did have the apib they were protected from adverse cardiovascular outcomes so I think that this suggests that omega-3 is beneficial even even this study even the study that came out with a negative headlines I mean it like it authors of this study which were not the same authors of the previous study that looked at the same exact cohort it that they didn positive benefit that were found in that same exact cohort it wanted an a sensational headline because it gets a lot of traction it gets a lot of eyeballs on your paper and it gets a lot of press so um I think that study that was published a couple of weeks ago is just the way it was communicated and it it was just complete UT other utter just terrible uh it was a terrible I mean first of all I think the publication was not good second of all I think the press release on it it was not good so I I just don there is a little concern about this increased stroke risk but it not known exactly what really does seem the absolute increase in stroke risk is quite small and fish oil is protecting or omega-3 is protecting against stro um I said stroke RIS but I meant apib apib brisk is quite quite small and it stroke and it these other cardiovascular related outcomes and if we look at the clinical trials that have been done which are much more convincing than that observational study I might say um there has been 42 clinical trials W looking at omega-3 versus placebo and have been over a year long out of those 42 only seven have identified a signal for apib risk increased apib so um and really out of those seven there that I would say was like statistically significant so let bit about that we have uh the strength trial the reduce it trial and then what strength trial this is where people with um very high cardiovascular risk factors experienced they were given a a pretty high dose of free fatty acid form of Omega-3 which most I I don that supplements with a free fatty acid form is usually either ethylester form or triglyceride form but this was a free fatty acid form and I talked a little bit about this with Dr Bill Harris in our podcast together a few years ago it it acid form is a good way to administer omega-3 because free fatty acid form is very harsh on the gut free fatty acid can act sort of like a detergent in some ways and so it to me I personally would not take free fatty acid form uh Omega-3 supplements because of the the effects on the gut but nonetheless that trial did do high dose free fatty acid form and they they were people with high cardiovascular RIS risk factors they they had a 0.9% increase in their absolute apib risk without any increase in stroke risk okay in that study the reduce it trial this is the trial where there was like a 25% reduction in cardiovascular related um events mortality these were people that were given four grams a day of ethylester form EPA only purified EPA and they were adults over the age of 45 they had exist existing cardiovascular disease they had a 1.4% increase in their absolute API risk and yet they still benefited because they had a 26% reduction in their non-fatal stroke risk so even though there was a very small increase in apib there was a large decrease in non-fatal stroke risk so they were protected from the very thing that apib that were worried about with apib which is stroke and then the last trial that really had any statistical significance with aibrisk was the Omi trial these were this trial was in my opinion was a really terrible trial they took people that had just had a heart attack they were still in the hospital just had a heart attack but they were well enough to sign a form if they could sign the form that they wanted to get into the trial they could so these are people that again like they were elderly adults I think they were over the age of 75 and they had just had a heart attack and they were in the hospital when they were recruited um these people had a little bit of a higher increased risk for apib they had a 3.2% increase in their absolute apib risk but they had no increase in stroke risk so yet again the increased apib risk with high dose omega3 and people with already these people already have an increased risk for apib because of all their cardiov ular risk factors and yet it still robust evidence that even when they have that very low increased apib risk that they stroke or there in other words it advance from apib to stroke more and it other cardiovascular factors like heart attack so I really think that the the the totality of evidence suggests that omega-3 supplementation is cardioprotective and while there is something going on with the aibrisk is it because it four grams is it ethylester form is it only in people with you know this this higher cardiovascular risk profile like we don definitely more studies need to be done but at the end of the day we need to report this accurately and what really is going on is that even though there a very very small apib risk it is still protecting against stroke and it is still protecting against other cardiovascular factors that apib can advance to so at the end of the day I I I am not concerned about Supple supplementing with omega-3 I certainly think that for people that are concerned a conservative dose of two grams a day has been shown to raise the omega-3 index from 4% which is low to 8% range which is a good omega-3 index and so I think that that a conservative dose when you start to get to the four grams per day which is what you know is prescribed to many individuals with high triglycerides that are taking either laesa or vipa maybe there risk that you would possibly get aib even I would still say it low if you look at the numbers it still again the absolute risk is still quite low but um for those wanting to be on the conservative side two grams per day really seems to be a conservative dose that is going to to at least get you to that healthy omega-3 index range of 8%	Success
This Drops Testosterone By 25% in Just 2 Hours (and hijacks dopamine)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9zLBarWDCI	FoundMyFitness Clips 	when it comes to the ultr processed foods what outside of the palatability and the calorie density what else is going on that seems to be evidence-based that something that we should be concerned about yeah well I think that part of part of it is that people are consuming more of the of it because they satiated right the it hormones which I mentioned so that is the one thing to consider is that the biggest mover in all of this um for weight gain I would say is because like weight gain really is comes down to like eating eating more calories and right calories in calories out makes makes a big difference um but there factors at play here that I think really come down to the added sugar right so added sugar affects so many different things in the body um everything from you know hormone production to cognition so hormones testosterone I know you interested in testosterone there was a pretty classic study that was done that showed that um men and it this was a huge age range and you know we talking young men that were like 17 all the way up to like older adults so young adults middle-aged adults older adults if they consumed 75 grams of added sugar so that would be like a mediumsized doughnut and the coke okay not out of the like people do that all the time 75 gram sounds like so much but when you put it in terms of a donut and a coke it there standard American diet and eating donuts with Coke or donuts with coffee and a bunch of added sugar in their coffee right so it actually is something that I would say is pretty practical in terms of what people are consuming and we can actually talk about what people are consuming in terms of added sugar but 75 grams of added sugar and um this caused a 25% decrease in their circulating testosterone within a 2hour range so it 25% less that chipping away at that grazing throughout the day exactly and imagine if people are eating I mean if that if their whole diet is nothing but Ultra processed foods right so you in that study with Kevin Hall they actually calculated how much it costs to have the Whole Foods diet versus the ultr processed food diet and it was $45 more um a week for the ultra sorry the Whole Foods diet m so that that significant it adds up over like a month right so we it of people that makes a difference and so it economically incentivized to eat Ultra processed foods because they there thing and vany Harry whatever the food stamp system is called oh right um snap yes snap the uh the so SS of foods that tend to be available on Snap trying to eat in a more healthy manner on that is very difficult right more difficult so what you mentioned there about what are Americans eating typically what what are they putting in their bodies I mean it processed foods so so the the refined sugar or I it interchangeably but you know ultimately people are eating 133% % of their daily caloric intake is coming from added sugar that a day if you just consider that like on average that sugar in fact um guidelines so the the guidelines for like the strictest guidelines suggest no more than 5% of your total um daily caloric intake coming from added sugar so that would be like no more than 25 grams a day 5% people are eating 133% of their total calorie intake from added sugar so added sugar is also affecting probably what happening also is there there palatable it tastes good you know people want things that taste good but there an addictive aspect there as well and that lot of animal studies but also some human data as well so there studies showing that if if people eat added sugar it activates dopamine reward Pathways in the brain in the striatum more than like eating fat for example so there was a study that compared fat versus added sugar and so it activating these dopamine reward Pathways animal Studies have found that it um much like addictive drugs do but to a much milder degree of course so what I what I addictive drugs like cocaine methamphetamine nicotine will will activate these dopamine reward Pathways and parts of the brain sugar activates them too to a much milder degree of course but you know in animal studies they sugar like this addictive thing right now again you got to take the animal studies with the grain of salt cuz we are not rodents but there is human evidence that these pathways are being activated in our brain with um added sugar and there you look at people that are obese you know the obesogenic diet is largely consists of a lot of added sugar well um people that are obese have a lower density of dopamine 2 receptors D2 receptors um really indicative some called tolerance so what happens if you keep activating the dopamine reward pathway is that your body as a adaptive response a feedback to it goes ohes I don because I got a lot of that signal coming in right um but what ends up happening is when you have fewer of those receptors then the little bit of dopamine that you have you feeling it as much it and more right and so you know you kind of Connect the Dots here and I would say certainly we need more evidence in the human Arena on the you know potential addictive properties of added sugar um however what we do have is a lot of animal evidence and you know some human evidence and I think that it really indicates that there is it reward Pathways it dopamine system and that unhealthy	Success
This is what Rhonda Patrick thinks of Athletic Greens	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcA05BC3JAo	FoundMyFitness Clips 	I think that calling for example athletic greens one or ag1 a highquality greens powder is a little misleading I think it fact I anything more than a multivitamin if that is how you prefer to take your multivitamin I think go for it it does look like it is a pretty good quality multivitamin but if you think you getting additional benefits like like you not likely the case at all um there very minuscule amounts of the quote unquote superfood complex and the quote unquote nutrient extract and the probiotics that are in in that blend so I mean the the amounts are so minuscule that there that you should be considering this a greens supplement it should be a multivitamin and that is the way to think about it it is a multi vitamin it is not a superfoods type of supplement	Success

Should You Supplement With Lion's Mane? - Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mn7WFtL5qqA	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so the next question was submitted from Christian and Christian says what are your thoughts about Lion supplements and Corps I that they are good for brain health but I am unclear on the evidence so um today we about the evidence so for those of you that um are unfamiliar with what Lion you know they sort of common names for like types of mushroom um you know there we we have talked about Lion so uh in our in our q&as I think the last time we talked about it was in 2020 Q&A session number 16 but um we sort of background information Lion Mame Lion on living or dead broad leaf trees it eaten as a food in Japan in China and it medicine the the chemicals of interest in Lion are um Heron and arises I think it don there are two important classes of isol they they isolated from the fruiting body of the melium and um they both have been shown to have neuroprotective of effects in Animals by stimulating nerve growth factor and synthesis so nerve growth factor is a um a growth factor in the brain um it also upregulates brain Drive neurotropic Factor so both of these are neurotropic factors they play a role in cognitive function they important for brain health I to get into all those details because they but that buzz was generated like this is where the interest came from the other beneficial compounds in Lion man and actually in a lot of variety of mushrooms are the alpha and beta glucans so these are complex polysaccharides that ultimately are beneficial for the gut microbiome and I do think that there obviously there and so you potential there for a beneficial effect you know in the brain when you something beneficial happen in the gut as well so that there that have been raised about particularly Lion they know like consumer lab put out you know this is they do a lot of third party testing and they test a lot of um products out there and they they published uh you know one of their product sheets and um you know third party testing sheets about lons in 2023 finding that products were adulterated um because they were prepared packed or held under conditions that do not meet good manufacturing practices whatever all those conditions are so the manufacturers that were warned were absonutrix LLC our garden LLC and mushroom wisdom Incorporated those were the three um main manufacturers of lion supplements that did not meet you know good manufacturing practices generally speaking I would say unfortunately um you know the liance main supplements found in the US are not standardized to the actual content of those components the Heron and AOS eroses so um you know you may you be you may be taking a a liance main supplement that um even is not adulterated maybe it you know it still it the active constituents that we looking for that it basically doesn matter um so that keep in mind when you alliance main supplement consumer lab has found that many products on the market are misleadingly labeled as mushroom although they with mycelium so fungus includes a fruiting body and melium the fruiting body is the portion of fungus that is seen um above ground right so that mushroom mycelium is what people think of being as the roots so um the beta glucan levels are much higher in the fruiting body than in the mycelium so you want again um those beta glucans are what are really beneficial they regulate the immune system and they do it um you know through a variety of mechanisms one being through the gut microbiome so if you again it comes down to oh this is it labeled as mushroom right so you thinking it actually made with the mycelium right so um I don manufacturing of this stuff to know why they would do use my melium instead of the mushroom part maybe it I don is also important to keep in mind and um the the hones are more concentrated in the Fring body the arises are are um in the fruiting body and the melium so uran are are so if you are getting isolated melium then you probably are getting at least more ersan ursan than um or in sorry I can name of it is like I just fumble it all the time um anyways you get the point and the point is that there nuance here and at the end of the day just buying a supplement and you wondering um what you know is this doing anything I don strong to suggest that even if you were getting everything you thought you were getting if it was even um going to be super super beneficial so um the good news is that there doesn heavy metal contaminants so consumer lab did also test a lot of supplements out there for lead and Arsenic and cadmium Mercury contamination and really none of the products they tested exceeded you know strict limits with for those heavy metals so that that cognition component and this is what a lot of people are interested in again the animal studies are kind of what were really did you know generated a lot of interest and um there were just insanely high doses that are completely comparable to humans that is important to keep in mind um there have been two clinical studies looking at the effects of lions M on Co cognition and their mixed results so the first study there was an improvement in cognition compared to Placebo which did not show an improvement but in the second study both the Lion group showed cognitive Improvement making it difficult to determine efficacy of lion have it at the end of the day one study that one clinical study that we off of here and um you know that with like them actually getting the right components you know giving giving the the participants the actual Active Components there in depression so that again animal Studies have shown a lot of great stuff with Lion depressive symptoms increasing neopine phrine dopamine serotonin anti-inflammatory compounds like all this stuff and again the doses here are the key they comparable to to human you know doses at all now there has been one human study it was Placebo controlled and it found that Lion measures of anxiety and depression in menopausal women after about four weeks of supplementation again the measurements were subjective which always sort of makes it a little unclear um but it is you know at the end of the day the placebo group had less of an effect with those subjective measurements so that does at least you know give some confidence now gut health the the disappointing thing here is honestly if you glucans and Alpha glucans mostly beta I would say the best way the best um you know path to take there would actually just be eating the mushroom because then you body right which is what beta glucans versus the concentrated mycelium powder um so for gut health there was one study in humans it was a clinical study looking um looking at GI ulcers and it found that Lion could improve symptoms of uler ulcer of colitis better than the placebo um but it had no effect on Crohn disease metabolic health and lots of animal studies again suggesting it can improve everything from lipid lipid you know files to glucose regulation but there studies to back that up and the immune system again is a very interesting one um one that I interested in there studies looking at Lion and immune system effects um but again the beta glucans which are known to be fermented by the gut microbiome they are fermented into short chain fatty acids like butyrate propionate acetate and this then directly affects the immune system so um that again could be something that you know a person could just eat the Fring body of mushrooms and get effects and by the way oats are really high in beta glucans as well so it source of beta glucans so in my summary of just the Lion say you know it it it out one there multiple layers of problems here right the the first problem is there enough evidence we haven the right dose um of the particularly active constituents in Lion for brain health um that can do anything so there study showed no no effect compared to Placebo and then there studies where the dose is just astronomical so I think identifying maybe we just need to identify the right dose that possibility and that just hasn done um the other problem is the actual products on the market uh not having the the Active Components that we need right so instead of having a mixture mixture of the mycelium and the fruiting body it getting you know one of the really important components to increase nerve growth factor so lot of lot of sort of combining problems there um I don at the end of the day that you know like out of all the supplements that you trying to take if Lion be the one that is going to have much better effects on the brain than Lions M that based on the evidence that I far um that doesn the right product and the right dose and identifying all those important um you know components won just means we haven data and so you going what do I do right um so Dustin says Paul stamet has spent a lot of time in the mushroom world for anyone who wants to look at that more I think he has some products too and he seems more legitimate to talk on this yeah I agree um I would I would listen to what Paul you know Paul stamet obviously has done a lot I mean that like his whole world is is studying these mushrooms and so um if he also has some products I a lot more thoughtful time into thinking about the fruiting body and the mycelium and the components and what you know what what and uh how to how to isolate them	Success
THIS Food Makes You Eat 500 More Calories Without Realizing It	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxb596qmUGg	FoundMyFitness Clips 	What about the concerns with added sugar? Exactly. Yeah. So, we talked about there foods and you know there chemicals. So, you can figure out how many of those may be detrimental to health. I would say one of the biggest problem with ultrarocessed foods is the added sugar. And when we say added sugar, we mean not sugar like if you if you like natural sugar in in that that bound to a fiber matrix. We about adding table sugar like sucrossse, glucose, and fructose 50% mixture of each into it. Um, foods have tons and tons of added sugar. Processed ultrarocessed foods have tons and tons of added sugar. And that hyper palatability of them, right? It it what what good. Lot there problems with the added sugar, right? On the brain, on overeating. So there was actually a really good study that was published a couple years ago out of the NIH from Kevin Hall the same group of people and gave them either an ultrarocessed foods diet or a whole foods diet and these diet he gave the same same group the same diet. So like the same people had each diet with a wash out period and then they measured a bunch of things, right? So you looking at a lot of individual variability here, right? It crossover trial design. So he gave these um so what so what happened is these these two two groups so the whole foods versus the ultrarocessed right same number of calories in the food same number of um uh same amount of sodium same amount of energy density there were not similar amounts of added sugar so the ultrarocessed foods had like 50% more added sugar fiber was the same but only because they gave the ultrarocessed food group drinks with like Metamucil or something, right? Like they had to give them fiber because essentially processed foods have no fiber, right? And then um protein was mostly similar. There was a little bit more in the whole foods group than the ultrarocessed foods group, but the study basically gave these people like again equivalent amounts of like calories and stuff. And so so the total sugars were the same. So the fruits and stuff had sugar, but it was the added sugar that was different, right? Um he gave these people the these meals that they came into like a a a metabolic ward to eat, you know, and they and they and they were basically given 60 minutes to eat their meal. So they could eat as much as they wanted or as little as they wanted. So they didn eat a certain amount. The point was to see if they were going to over consume overeat, right? Well, turns out when they were eating the ultrarocessed foods, people on average ate 500 calories more um than eating the whole foods diet. So this was 500 calories more um per per um per week. And so they ended up gaining 2 lb more on well that they actually gained 2 pounds if they were eating ultrarocessed foods and they lost two pounds if they were eating whole foods. And this was zero from their baseline. From their baseline. Yeah. And this was for for the two week that the trial happened. So if you think about it, that were gaining. That month. So 4* 12 is 48. That It couldn week if they gained a pound. Sorry. It was It was 500 calories per two weeks. Yes. No, that right. 500 calories per meal. Sorry. Yes. They were eating 500 calories more per meal. Yes. But they were gaining two pounds more per two weeks or one pound per week. So it was a 3,500 surplus per week. Yes. It was 500 days. Because it was 500 per meal, right? So So they were eating, you know, overeating. And the question is why were they overeating, right? And there reasons for that, you know. One is they weren satiated. So refined added sugar basically disrupts hormones. It disrupts the hormones that are involved in satiation like leptin. Um ghreins a hunger hormone. So like those things were being disrupted in those individuals. Um, and it, you know, the the question is is like if you a refined sugar diet, if you lot of ultrarocessed foods, you probably eating more of the foods, right? Why is that? Well, you being satiated for one. Two, um, even though there was less protein in the ultrarocessed foods, it seemed as though people were eating more almost to get their protein needs. Oh, that interesting. Yeah. Have you heard of the protein leverage hypothesis? No. It was Steven Simpson Simpson I think was the one of the main scientists involved in in this hypothesis. And essentially um what it is is that your body like needs a certain amount of protein per day to like maintain physiological functions. And um so so he hypothesized that no matter what if you were eating foods that were low in protein, you were going to overeat because you had to like maintain this amount of protein that your body really needs, right? And so him and some his colleagues have done some randomized control trials sort of proving this hypothesis where it people lower protein same you know everything else but they will over consume if they have the lower protein just to kind of like get up to that protein need. So that possibility. Again if you lot of ultrarocessed foods they in protein. Protein is satiating for one, right? That consider. But it does seem as though like there might be this protein leverage hypothesis that might be partly explaining some of this as well because it the protein needs um for just maintaining a lot of different physiological functions that require protein. How legitimate are the links to cancer when it comes to ultrarocessed foods and sugar? I you know there lot of ways to get there. So, I you, you know, obviously when you when you talk to a scientist, like the the most robust evidence is, well, we need a randomized control trial. We need to prove causation, right? Well, you never going to get that because it takes decades for cancer to, you know, rear its ugly head and that expensive of trial. But the evidence that we do have, um, you know, for one, people that are, uh, obese tend to eat more added sugar. I mean that eating added sugar as a proportion. Yes. Yeah. Exactly. Because they of everything. They eating more processed ultrarocessed foods which are higher in added sugar don way sugar is metabolized when you when it different than uh added sugar in ultrarocessed foods which has no fiber matrix. And um so what happens when it has a fiber matrix is it slows the metabolism of it. It really slows it down. It your gut isn which causes, you know, it actually causes intestinal permeability and that causes inflam inflammatory um molecules to leech into your bloodstream. Inflammation is a major driver of aging, cancer. Um it causes damage to DNA. So all those things happen, right? And there have been studies that have shown that men, young men that consume, it like 20 ounces of um a sugar sweetened beverage a day for 3 weeks. Okay, these are healthy young men. They like like a big like Coke, right? Something like that. After 3 weeks, their inflammatory biomarkers go up like a 100%. Like a 100%. So that inflammation in healthy just healthy young men. Again, inflammation is something that is involved in driving cancer. Um, we know that obesity is very intimately linked to cancers. There like 13 different cancers that obesity is known to play a role in. There a lot of evidence that lifestyle factors like um eating ultrarocessed foods, like being overweight, obese, like these are factors that can dramatically reduce cancer incidents if they are, you know, reduced. If you reduce your ultrarocessed foods, if you re reduce your added sugar and lose weight, like these are things that are that are known.	Success
This Is Everything Rhonda Patrick Supplements With	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhQ8JOaVOyQ	FoundMyFitness Clips 	I see here that people are interested Ben submitted a question about my supplement stack and I like to every so often sort of give you guys an update on what I constantly taking away things or putting bringing things back Etc so I ahead and sort of rapid fire that what I supplements are since people are really interested in that so I am obviously taking the basics that I that I talk about a lot so omega-3 I metagenics the EPA DHA 2400 I the vitamin D K2 um I multivitamin by pure encapsulations I take magnesium glycinate by pure encapsulations I taking avmacol so I sulfurane that I take I take two of those alphal lipoic acid P encapsulations um Ben Flamin I that by life extension Cova I the cardio the the heart one and I I take the do the recommended dose I taking at night magnesi om so that combination of a variety of different magnesiums I take that in addition to the Magnesium glycinate that I take and I take just a little scoop of it in my water I also take creatine I Take 5 grams a day I collagen powder um right now I basa B ha it has been thirdparty tested and is uses the patented form of collagen peptides that are smaller in molecular weight they and those are the types that have been shown to help um be absorb better particularly into into the skin so I taking that collagen powder and then I also take pqq by life extension during times of exposure to viral illness I also supplement in addition with those I supplement with liposomal vitamin C by pure encapsulations and I do the zinc lozenges by life extension so I suck on those and I milligrams to to one 1,00 sorry 80 milligrams to 100 milligrams a day possibly sometimes more than that and that very very um subtle onset of viral illness and the reason I do lozes instead of the supplements for zinc is that there is a local effect so in other words sucking on the zinc lenes has an effect in the Airways in addition to helping with the immune system so I do um sink lenes and then I also um have been supplementing I also ordered the glutamine supplement from Thorn and I am doing the glutamine on days that I I and I hard has had me a little more susceptible to respiratory illness particularly because I being being exposed having a young child at home who was bringing it home from from from school so um I I supplementing with with glutamine as well on training days and particularly when I know that um if like my son is sick and I know there me being exposed I supplement with it and then also uh way protein is another thing that I will supplement with on days where I am maybe I eat a turkey burger or something high in protein and I need to get that extra protein and then lastly um I take some iron during U men ation um I see in the chat here so the brand of the brands that I typically might let me just start by saying the the the go-to brands that I use generally when I supplementing with something or if there trying I have a handful of brands that I use Thorn Pure encapsulations Life Extension metagenics for fish oil but but those are those those other three are pretty pretty much my top three in terms of Brands I Look to so creatine I mentioned the other brands for the stuff I was using pure encapsulations is vitamin D the vitamin D is p encapsulation the vitamin D K2 is pure encapsulations magnesium glycinates pure encapsulations alphal poic acid is pure encapsulations benine is life extension pqq is life extension and I think that you guys now have all the brands so um that I I use and if I then I definitely go to third party testing sit so I time again that a lot of green powder supplements are contaminated with heavy metals it you are going to supplement with a green powder supplement I highly highly suggest looking at consumer lab and going with one of theirs because it is is definitely um high probability that it is contaminated with heavy metals and the other thing I wanted to mention is um I typically don for that reason I do smoothies I recently bought a Vitamix stainless steel container so um I was concerned about the plastic containers because when you high-speed spin the friction itself can release microplastics into the beverage and so um Vitamix makes a great tight um makes a great stainless steel container and it the Vitamix blender so you have to have one of those as well but if you are looking for an alternative for your for your plastic blender that is a good option I think there old school blenders that don high speed that have glass containers and that would be another option as well Adriana is asking what brand of collagen I use so I should mention for my skin I patent and form and the brand is um basa be s h that the other the other collagen powder that I also supplement with is from Sparkle and um they have the the the the sort of joint form of it which is called forone and fora gel and um they have like different flavors if you want to have flavors and sometimes I put that in my water as well	Success

The other the other made offenders would be to go coffee mugs. Those are most to-go coffee mugs are lined with plastic and that plastic breaks down with heat and BPA and those are you hot. Yeah.

Do These Sleep Supplements Actually Work? (magnesium, apigenin, and theanine) - Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S4x_13Wado	FoundMyFitness Clips 	okay so we deepish dive question that has to do with sleep Cathleen says hi Rhonda thank you for your recent aliquat where you updated us on your nutrition diet blueprint and your updated supplement regimen you didn nighttime supplements for sleep do you have a supplement stack you take for sleep and what do you think about Andrew huberman thank you so much okay so the first part of this question um do you have a supplement stack you take for sleep I do not um I I used to take melatonin for my night tears but I have stopped taking it and my night terrs have really um not come back any more than they were with melatonin so I didn my sleep stack is essentially a sauna or a hot tub 2 to three hours before I go to bed and that there or you know there that has convinced me that will that going to be more effective than actual heat stress um and I did put out a video you guys saw probably how how heat stress um from the sauna or hot tub affects particularly slow wave sleep but even sleep in general so if you guys haven really short 10-minute video so let talk a little bit about um sleep stack from um Dr huberman which by the way I have no problem with so it milligrams of magnesium threonate or 200 milligram of magnesium bisglycinate 500 milligrams of appenine 100 to 400 milligrams of theanine and then three to four nights a week there um I did talk about some of this in a previous Q&A Q&A number 29 but I the Magnesium 3 andate for Sleep um there at sleep with magnesium 3 and8 the daily dose was about, 1500 to 2,000 milligrams so quite High um it was a 12-week sleep Focus trial they were both of these were um industry IND industry Le so um the company that made magnesium 38 was sponsoring the study which you know there there right and there study again that was also industry-led as well um so there limited evidence that magnesium 38 reaches the brain and affects you know affects the brain really improves has any effect on cognitive tests we talked about this in the past you know the one study that pull all the tests together to get statistical significance maybe it they the the study was underpowered I think that they did kind of manipulate the data a little bit to kind of make it um seem like it affect cognitive test which again it it just may be that there lack of evidence that studies are underpowered I think you know there there effect as well um I I don evidence to support that magnesium 38 is effective at improving sleep uh I do think that magnesium 38 is a good source of magnesium 40% of the population has in adequate magnesium intake I so therefore it could be the source that you use I take magnesium G glycinate but if you threonate I think that know making sure you don negative gut effects of course when you get like up to those, 1500 2,000 milligram doses is one potential um concern but um I don problem with taking it but again just strictly looking at the evidence in a very scientific you know way I would say it by evidence yet it need more evidence to really uh make a statement that magnesium th will improve sleep that doesn it just means we don evidence to suggest it does so apogen appenine um so that found in um chamil te there scarce data on apogen and improving sleep uh there clinical studies directly evaluating appenine um it uh there was a cross-sectional study that was done in Italian adults looking at a diet rich in appenine and they did have um you know better sleep quality but it this is like there of confounding factors there so take that with the grain of salt um there what there have been some small clinical trials looking at chamomile which again contains appenine um and it was shown to be moderately effective in improving subjective sleep uh compared to Placebo so in other words the people taking it felt like their sleep was improved um there lack of evidence on actual appenine supplements so um potential you know I you know could the chamomile tea is it the hot liquid that plays a role in improving sleep because it was the tea study that showed him we don right like there chamal tea and uh you know so I would say there supporting a supplement for Apen and improving sleep but I do think there could be some indication that chamomile tea could have a beneficial effect whether or not you can streamline everything down and narrow it and say AA it up for debate because there things going on there right it and hot things also can have a a sort of effect on helping with sleep and relaxation uh and again there compounds in chamomile as well so um again just I don and I certainly uh you know it it seems pretty benign but there strong science to support it yet uh alanine I say is is probably the one with the strongest evidence so there was one phase to randomized control trial that showed improved sleep efficiency in boys with autism there uh to randomized control trials showing um Improvement in subjective Sleep Quality in middle-aged adults with a daily intake of 200 to 900 milligrams of alanine there was a small open label study which doesn take it with the grain Sal but also improved Sleep Quality in patients with depression and schizophrenia further large fa um larger phase 3 studies that are needed I think um they haven done yet but they these studies um I think the evidence for alanine uh its Effectiveness in improving sleep is stronger than magnesium 38 and appenine as I mentioned so um yeah I don problem with taking that sleep stack uh that breakdown of the science behind those particular supplements um again I think I think nothing is going to compare to heat stress when it comes to uh improving sleep I think the evidence is stronger but um you know we just may not have enough high quality evidence out there to show that these compounds are doing much yet Robson is asking can magnesium 3 and8 be taken on a long-term basis without adverse effects um I don there really long-term High dose magnesium I think that you know at a at a relatively normal dose probably should be F but um I think most of the Magnesium threonate is staying in circulation um you know it it it really gets into the brain in humans so so that those things where we just we just don have the evidence and I do think that magnesium 3 and8 is a fine source of magnesium um I I supplement with about 130 milligram of magnesium glycinate but um I think you know if you want to take magnesium 3 and8 I think that fine mostly you just want to avoid magnesium oxide um Matt is saying that Dr hubman also recommends myoinositol Gaba and glycine for Sleep um I haven sleep I bloodb brain barrier so um you know it like maybe there the gut microbiome um through the vagal nerve because Gaba can can um have an effect on enteric neurons in the gut um and this could then stimulate the bagal nerve and communicate to the brain for like a sort of relaxed um you know sort of effect but um yeah I I didn sleep so that could be something for next time if someone wants to submit that question um bill says why should we avoid magnesium oxide or dioxide it just not very bioavailable it it form of magnesium that bioavailable magnesium citrate magnesium malate magnesium glycate magnesium bis glycate magnesium magnesium threonate um they think those are all um pretty reasonable choices for magnesium supplementation	Success
Why you need more omega-3s (THIS is how much you should take)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDwY8veNlZs	FoundMyFitness Clips 	the way I like to think about omega-3 it drug but the but the risk profile of a nutrient right so um and it it doesn take much like you said two two grams a day to go from 4% to 8% that I would say uh you know conservative way to get your omega-3 index high is like okay 2 grams a day you	Success
Rhonda Patrick Reveals Her Top 3 Supplements (One Adds 5 Years to Your Life)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJq8CaM4RYk	FoundMyFitness Clips 	So, I do about 2 grams of omega-3. Usually, it Then I do, let I do vitamin D. So, I take around I total around 4,000 IUs of vitamin D a day. So, I get like 2,000 in a vitamin D supplement plus 2,000 in my in my multivitamin. So, I take a multivitamin as well. And then I take um magnesium glycine. And then I take another product called magnesium which is like a powder I put in my water that I take all my vitamins with and it like a mixture of some other magnesium organic magnesium salts as well. And then I take alpha liopoic acid. Are you wanting all all the all all the perfect alpha lipoic acid which has been shown to blunt the advanced glycation end products. So it those in clinical studies. In fact people with um type two diabetes it been shown to improve their ages. So I take that and then I take um benotamine another another um vitamin that shown to help with advantage casein end products pretty that aspect that I just a fat soluble v vitamin B1 take that and then I take ludin zeizanthin for my eyes I take CoQ10 and then I take um I going to miss something I take sulfurophane sulurophane helps detoxify a lot of terrible things that we exposed to like plastic chemicals like BPA but also air pollute pollution factors as well. It activates a very powerful detoxification system in our body. So I take that and then um where do you think you supplements? You think you healthy and optimal as you are or is it just more of a psychological boost for you? No. I mean so look I the omega-3 one studies that have now shown that having a low omega-3 index is like smoking. Come on. Really? Wow. It So, omega-3 levels as me measured by the omega-3 index. So, this is like measuring it in your red blood cells. It omega-3. It study that was done by Dr. Bill Harris. It was it was a Framingham cohort published a few years ago and he he looked at people high or low. High would be 8%, low would be 4%. He index. And basically, people that were non-smokers but had a low omega-3 index had the same life expectancy as smokers with a high omega-3 index. Wow. I mean, if you look at their life life expectancy curve, they mean, it the figure. It only way you can get omega-3 is that from fish. So, no. Yes. Seafood is seafood is the the major that what index. It needs to be EPA, DHA. That from the marine sources. Um ALA, the plant source of omega-3, can be converted into those two other omega-3 fatty acids, but very, very inefficiently. And so um really you need to get the marine source for people that are vegetarians or vegans. Microalgae is the source of microalgae oil. You have to take a lot of it. Wow. But studies have found that so people with 4% omega-3 index that actually people in the US the average omega-3 index is like 5%. Um, if you take two grams of omega-3, so supplemental omega-3 per day for was it like 3 months or so, then or three or four months, then you can go from a 4% low omega-3 index to a 8% high omega-3 index. And people that have an 8% omega-3 index have a 5year increased life expectancy compared to the people with low. Come on. If you think about Japan, Japan, they have a 5year increased life expectancy compared to the US on average. They live a lot of fish in their diet. Their omega-3 index is 10%. Ours is 5%. So, their average omega-3 index is 10%. Our average here in the US is 5%. And that connected to fish. It fish intake, right? Wow. So, but you can mercury, right? Or Yeah. I mean, it depends on the type of fish you eating, too, right? So, like if you the best types of fish to eat would be salmon, mackerel, sardines, like these these are high omega-3 but low mercury fish. Wow. And there studies showing that the omega-3 fatty acids protect against the mercury to some degree. You don swordfish every day. Swordfish is very high. Okay. Like that. That real thing. If you can get like really high mercury levels and it can be bad. Okay. But if you salmon like three times a week, you know, maybe four sometimes. Wow. I eat I eat salmon a lot. Um, but I also take my omega-3 supplements. So, it came back to that question is do you think you could get away from all the supplements? I I mean I do think that there are really important. Omega-3 and vitamin D, you know, you you you can make it from the sun. It is a it gets converted into a steroid hormone. Very very important. Very important. It steroid hormone regulating, you know, 5% of the human genome. So, without it, lots of stuff know, there regulate whether or not you can make vitamin D, right? Where you live. Um, your how how much melanin you have in your skin. That If you wear sunscreen or if you have a lot of protective clothing, as you get older, you at making it. So, lots of things, right? So, that help. So, I don know, I would say no. I would I would want I would want those couple of supplements. Do you have a list on your site anywhere of all the supplements you take? I don do have um I do talk about it on my on my membership. I have a lot of Q&A I do once a month. Gotcha. I I I about something like, you know, having some kind of maybe list because other people have lists of the supplementation. Everyone list. They really. I want your list then. That what I want. Yeah. But my list changes a lot. And that what you took two years ago is different than this year. It is. It changes a lot. Like sometimes I You need a rolling list, you know, you need an updatable list. What do I like? Is this really like I used to take NAD like you know precursors. If you could only take three supplements a day and this would you only allowed three right now. What would you take consistently? I would take omega-3, vitamin D, and sulfurophane. Okay. To simplify it for people if they supplements and I don know, yeah, which brands are good, which ones are not good. But I would definitely make sure I magnesium for my food because I left that one out. So magnesium. I left that one. Well, if I only had three, right? Right. But then you magnesium. I would be getting my leafy greens and my nuts. Like almonds are very high in magnesium. Right. Because because I want to make sure I you know, meeting the art. Okay. Top five supplements. What if you could only get five supplements a day? What would those top five be? Okay. Omega-3. Yep. Vitamin D. Yep. Sulfurophane. Magnesium. and the multivitamin. Okay, that seems more reasonable. That top five. What is sulforophane? Yeah, sulfurophane is it made from a precursor that is found in certain types of cruciferous vegetables. So these are broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, those types of vegetables. Um it really the the precursor is called glucaraphanin. And when you break the plant like by chewing it or you break the plant wall, the glucaraphin become comes in contact with an enzyme called myroinesise that breaks it down into a compound called sulurophane. Okay. So sulforophane um is really high in broccoli sprouts. In fact, it times higher than mature broccoli. Wow. Sprouting broccoli is another option. Sprouts. Yeah. Yeah. Broccoli sprouts is another option. Um I prefer to just take a a a supplement that you have to find a good one. So there ones. Avacol um and prostaphane. Okay. And brock. They like the high the high quality um sulurophane supplements. But sulforophane activates a pathway in your body called NRF2. That a lot of different genes in our body that get rid of toxic compounds like carcinogens. So like if you let be exposed to something called heteroscyclic amines which can cause cancer. while activating NRF2 through sulfurophane can stop your body from getting those terrible heterosyclic amines. Right. Wow. So, it at detoxifying carcinogens, but also other factors like air pollution, benzene that you breathe in. I I concerned with plastic chemicals like BPA, BPS. I think it detoxifying that because of it does the same. Um, it activates pathways that are able to take BPA and make it water soluble because you excrete a lot of BPA through your urine. So that think sulforopine is super important.	Success
How Magnesium Reduces Your Risk of Cancer | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKh_lqegIok	FoundMyFitness Clips 	let depletion is a slow process so marginally low intake would likely take years to manifest but it would still take a toll it aging and the development of chronic disease so I want to take a moment to discuss a concept that has been a significant focus in the field of nutrition particularly a theory put forth by my mentor Dr Bruce Ames who has introduced what is known as the triage Theory and published several studies on it it understand how our bodies deal with micronutrient scarcity like with magnesium so Dr Ames has published several papers on this topic highlighting how Nature has possibly evolved a mechanism to prioritize certain biological processes over others when micronutrient resources are limited so magnesium for example is a key player in numerous biological functions some of these are critical for immediate survival and preventing diseases that could lead to acute life-threatening conditions however magnesium is also pivotal for long-term Health processes like DNA repair so deficiencies in DNA repair might not cause immediate harm but they can lead to a gradual accumulation of DNA damage mutations that over time can then become oncogenic or cancer-causing so the triage Theory posits that in the face of limited magnesium the body will prioritize its use for enzymes involved in essential short-term survival such as enzymes like energy production this means that other processes that are vital for long-term Health like DNA repair might get less of this magnesium what well we might not be getting enough magnesium we might be getting enough to avoid acute deficiency even pulling it from our bones to maintain levels in our muscles and other tissues we could be you know setting the stage for chronic health issues like osteoporosis down the line so I think this inadequate intake of magnesium and micronutrients in general can accumulate it Insidious damage over time in the context of magnesium when DNA repair and replication which both do require magnesium to properly function they aren those inadequate levels the accumulation of this damage can lead to these mutations cell dysfunction and potentially cancer development and it a clear example of how you know subtle long-term effects of micronutrient inadequacy or magnesium inadequacy in this case can contribute to the aging process and the development of chronic disease so we let that topic magnesium does play a crucial role in DNA repair and this has implications for cancer prevention so every day our our DNA is facing damage from both internal sources like metabolism and external forces things like UV radiation pollution things like that as we age our DNA repair mechanisms naturally slow down like everything else but when we it fire the risk of DNA damage escalates magnesium is essential for the proper functioning of DNA repair enzymes so consider the sheer frequency of cell division in our bodies millions of cells divide daily with some tissues like our skin and and intestinal lining they have exceptionally High turnover rates so DNA replication which is necessary to make a new cell is really vital for that you know process of making a new cell and magnesium plays a role in DNA replication as well it for the proper functioning of those enzymes called DNA polymerases these are essentially the workhorses of cell division without adequate magnesium these processes can be compromised and this could lead to potential errors and mutations when you are making new DNA now let role of magnesium in what Matrix metalloproteinases or mmps so these are enzymes they like agents of extracellular Matrix breakdown they processes like tissue remodeling wound healing and magnesium deficiency can upset the de delicate balance here with the activity of these MMP enzymes that also could potentially Aid in cancer cell Invasion and progression so it plays a a little Downstream role role um in cancer progression and um cell Invasion but again I think it really highlights the sort of broader impact of magnesium on cellular health cancer prevention and it micronutrient that is just it fundamentally you know intertwined with our body called genetic integrity and to prevent the formation of you know oncogenic cells which are cancer cells so let talk about a study that followed about over 66,000 men and women aged 50 to 76 years old so this was part of the vitamins and lifestyle study or the vital study it was from 2ou the year 2000 to 2008 um among the 151 participants who ended up developing pancreatic cancer those with magnesium intake below the RDA had a significantly higher risk of pancreatic cancer specifically those getting 75 to 99% of the RDA the risk was increased by 42% and for those with less than 75% of the RDA that risk jumped to 76% but what was even more striking about that study was that for every 100 millgram per day decrease in magnesium intake there was an increase in a 24% increase in pancreatic cancer incidents so this was in a dose dependent manner every 100 mgram decrease was associated with a 24% increase increase in pancreatic cancer incidents and what interesting here is also the role of magnesium supplementation so the inverse association between magnesium intake and pancreatic cancer risk seemed to be more pronounced among those who took magnesium supplements either from a multivitamin or even as an individual supplement so uh in other words what I saying is that within that cohort it wasn supplemental intake and people that were also supplementing with magnesium that was associated with a stronger decreased risk in pancreatic cancer obviously um it a very nuanced understanding right this is still observational data still means correlation can causation um there could be a variety of other factors that could influence this as well so that keep in mind when we observational data there was another study um this was this was the Paris perspective study 2 which followed about 4,000 men aged 30 to 60 over 18 years old and and that study found that men with the highest magnesium levels that that was associated with a 40% lower all cause mortality and a 50% lower decrease in cancer death compared to those with the lowest magnesium levels yet again all the caveats I just mentioned this was also an observational study so um you know the I I think the beauty of observational studies H honestly is is in their ability to reveal these patterns these associations in large populations over extended periods so that is that is really the beauty of observational data and then you know once you get that observational data you kind of need to approach it with a little bit more of a critical eye and and sort of also try to turn to some Interventional studies as well um with respect to cancer incidents that to be very challenging because cancer takes decades to develop so um having a randomized control trial with a supplement like magnesium is is going to be challenging if not impossible to do so um that mind but let a meta analysis that examined both dietary and supplemental magnesium intake and their effects on mortality risks so diet dietary magnesium intake was linked to a significantly lower risk of both all cause mortality and cancer mortality so specifically for every additional 100 milligram per day of dietary magnesium there was a 6% reduction in all cause mortality and a 5% reduction in cancer mortality and again this was in a dose dependent manner so for each 100 milligram increase per day that was you you got those reductions um so I do want to point out that this was from dietary sources and not from supplemental sources so it really could could be that there going on um because you getting magnesium from you know sources of healthy foods so what I say is because foods that are high in magnesium like leafy greens they come with a they of other vital micronutrients and phytonutrients you know so these components collectively contribute to overall health they food Matrix that enhances their benefits the analysis also looked at supplemental magnesium intake and here get intriguing the supplemental magnesium intake showed a nonsignificant positive association with cancer mortality risk based on three studies it non-significant doesn was no effect um in fact the P value that can actually be quite arbitrary but that think it highlights the complexity of interpreting data similarly there was a total magnesium intake which looked at both dietary and supplemental sources and um that really didn significant association with cancer mortality or all CA mortality but there was a lot of what between studies in other words some studies did see an effect other studies saw no effect and so again it comes down to that mixed mixed data um really those sorts of things those sorts of differences come down to you know differences in study design population other factors that can just add all these layers of complexity to our understanding I think these findings reinforce the idea that getting magnesium from dietary sources might be the most beneficial approach they also underscore the Nuance nature of nutritional research right the variation in these studies the arbitrary nature of statistical significance the heterogenea between studies they all really point to this careful interpretation a deeper understanding of how nutrients like magnesium are impacting our health and again to how trials and nutrition and just how how complex Trials of nutrition are and um you know the need to sort of standardize some of these trials as well so that we can get better data	Success

How to Reverse Graying Hair | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ZwP8UjQFE	FoundMyFitness Clips 	Chris says hi Rhonda I would love to hear your thoughts or research on graying hair and more specifically is there anything that can be done lifestyle nutrition supplements that can slow this process down first and foremost unfortunately gray hair is largely largely largely genetic determined so um keep that in mind like you could be extremely healthy have a great lifestyle getting all your micronutrients low stress that is all going to help but if you got those early grain genes if your your parents you know grade really early in life it you that on that so keep that in mind um so the loss of hair pigmentation is a Hallmark of Aging it is it typically begins actually during a person 20s uh the timing and extent of grin very again according to genetics and the interaction between biological factors psychological factors is a really big one and uh graying hair is generally considered irreversible but there have been some recent data that have come out that demonstrate that might not be so true that gr is not necessarily a linear process and that some graying hair may be reversible depending again on what driving the graay so if we about genetic factors it largely irreversible but if we talking about external factors like stress it may actually be revers reversible so one of the primary drivers of graying hair is is oxidative stress in the hair follicle which damages the pigment producing region the melanocyte uh of the hair shaft so oxidative stress we a million times it occurs when our mitochondria inside of our cells are making energy you know it it happen there that psychological factors biological factors that can affect it as well so there evidence that that um depigmented hair has mitochondrial energy metabolic dysfunction so um it interesting because uh there case reports and anecdotal reports that suggest that repigmentation can occur and it can cause kind of like a by color hair in other words like the repigmentation sometimes is a different color than what the person hair color was which is fascinating so there don that we we actually um put out in our science digest where where the authors of the study collected dark depigmented and also buy color hairs from about 14 young adults their average age was about 35 they didn didn chemically treated hair or nothing they were just natural and um there there you know some of these participant participants also completed a lot of stress assessment questionnaires on a life event calendar and um the the the authors of this the researchers were able to Overlay the hair pigmentation patterns with life events in these these part participants so they found that a depigmentation and repigmentation event corresponded with moments in their in the participants lives linked to a stressful event so there was like marital Discord for example so um that that was linked to when hair pigment was de hair depigmented so it became gray and then the repigmentation was linked again this is um the repigmentation was again uh they were able to to identify it because it was a different color of um there was a different color of of hair versus what their natural color was uh and that was linked to a nonstressful event typically it was when the person had gone on a vacation so the authors concluded that there was these depigmented hairs um there was a depigmentation and repigmentation that was really linked to psychological stress and um they also measured and looked at the depigmented hairs and they found mitochondrial dysfunction in this you know the the melanocytes these cells that are producing pigmentation suggesting that mitochondrial metabolism is involved in the graying process as well and um you know I I would say so you might go here and think well then maybe we need to you know do everything to improve our mitochondrial health and that you know that for preventing gray hair and I would say like that best things you can do is exercise exercise is one of the best things for your mitochondria it it doesn the zone 2 training high-intensity interval training is very good for mitochondria it grows new healthy young mitochondria so um both you know you know whether you more low to moderate intensity exercise or you training or vigorous exercise all of it is really good for for mitochondria and improving um your mitochondrial health with respect to supplements um alphal lipoic acid um ubiquinol these are both antioxidants um there mitop pure which is thought to be the um it pomegranate that can clear away damage mitochondria um ratol has been shown to improve mitoch there different uh supplements that have been shown to improve mitochondrial function um all of of them I would say they what exercise can do so that to focus on but it is you know interesting to think that maybe some of these supplements could affect mitochondrial Health um you know certainly ubiquinol um has been shown to um particularly in the in the context of statins so you know not a lot of research looking at graying hair but I think you know you could draw some parallels and say well maybe there know a possibility that anything that mitochondria will also you know help with slowing the graying of hair and certainly going on you know vacations and and trying to lower and buffer your stress meditation yoga things that can can buffer out the psychological stress are really important as well there also been some evidence that um certain vitamins particularly B vitamins can affect premature graying of hair so this is this is when you person has graying hair in their 20s it linked to like vitamin B12 deficiency folic acid B7 deficiency as well so um th those things have also been shown to reverse graying hair but again it really sort of I would say isolated to this population of people that have severe vitamin deficiency B12 B7 um folic acid deficiency and they have really really early prematurely grin gr hair um other than that it someone that has normal B vitam levels of their B vitamins is going to reverse their graying Hair by taking a a b complex like that Okay and something I did want to me mention um there photobiomodulation so this is red light laser therapy or red light therapy does necessarily have to be laser it could be led um on on hair graying there evidence on it there is evidence looking at first of all Vitiligo so Vitiligo is you know where you have depigmentation in in melanocytes and skin cells so there 30 people that had sort of segmental type figos so it or their neck and um photobiomodulation was able to repigment uh improve their repigmentation in about 60% of these people with successive treatments and so so the reason I thought it was interesting was because photobiomodulation has been shown to affect also regrowing of the hair and um on we have a photo biomodulation P topic page that we so that will have all this information uh but the the parameters are really important for regrowing the hair so the wavelength for regrowing hair was 655 nanometers and the radiance was a combination of either L LED or laser or and Laser and so it was about 22 m per cenim squared for the LED and 4.6 meter U Mills per C Square for the laser and there available devices that um that U May at least have some of those parameters so the hair Max laser comb and the Lexington International and I think I going to go ahead and um I get one of of these devices I if I to do out of the two of those yet but I am going to get one uh for my husband to try out	Success

Is Ozempic a Miracle Drug for Weight Loss? - Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTIKFxLYgCk	FoundMyFitness Clips 	okay so the next question is something we so this will be fun it was submitted by Matthew Tanner who says how strong is the scientific evidence for or against the relatively new weight loss drugs like OIC that are in the headlines a lot okay so let about the background of these so so these so what these are okay we to start with it basics so it hormones um there our body that come from our gut or our digestive system when we eat um they do help control blood sugar they signal to the body to release insulin after we eat foods containing sugar or fats or even to a lesser degree proteins there are two main types of these hormones one is known as Gip and the other one is known as glp1 so Gip is made in the upper part of our gut while glp1 is produced in the lower part so when we consume food foods like glucose or sucrose or starch um fats certain amino acids that are found in proteins our body will release both of these incretin hormones and this helps us manage our our blood sugar levels after we eat a meal right our postprandial blood sugar levels so that connects to enrtin hormones by mimicking the action of glp1 and it key incretin hormones involved in regulating insulin secretion and blood glucose levels post nutrient intake so it it affecting the gp1 receptor so it basically um causes a natural like glp1 response to improve diabetes management right and it also has additional benefits related to weight loss control and reduced appetite okay so let a little bit about gastric empty so both the Gip and gp1 are both types they both types of hormones in our body that help control blood sugar levels after we eat right so we talked about that but they do have different effects on how quickly our stomach empties its contents into our intestines so giip doesn rate like how fast your stomach empties when Gip is working it doesn the speed at which food moves in your stomach um to your intestines but glp1 on the other hand does so you know it basically slowing down how quickly your stomach is emptying food into your intestines why does that matter so when your stomach empties more slowly because let you Agonist food takes longer to reach your intestines and so this means that the breakdown and absorption of nutrients into your bloodstream are going to be delayed as a result the increase in your blood sugar levels after eating a meal is going to be more gradual you going to get that really quick Spike you rise and this is beneficial for keeping your blood sh your blood um glucose levels stable it also impacts things like mental Clarity or commonly called brain fog um so having a really quick spike in your post print Ral blood glucose levels after a meal can cause problems with mental Clarity so having a more stable blood sugar levels makes it you know also affects your brain as well is what I also an impact on triglycerides so triglycerides obviously this is a type of fat circulating your blood it also spikes after a meal so the triglycerides will be more gradual and so this is also it super high spike in triglycerides after a meal as well okay so the type 2 diabetes happens when your body doesn use insulin properly so this could be insulin resistance and also the pancreas can body diabetes is too much glucagon so this is a hormone that raises blood sugar which so it makes blood sugar control even harder right so the incretins are are lower helping lower the blood sugar and it type 2 diabetes and these glp1 receptor agonists are a group of medications that do act like these natural hormones and they manage people with diabetes so they stimulating the re of in Rel insulin and they glucagon so those are two two separate ways that glp1 receptor agonists like OIC are working it first line of treatment for type two diabetes especially those who have heart disease and are at a high risk for um type diabetes as well and it commonly used in people that don respond well to metform it and there are several different glp1 receptor agonists that are approved so there of them I of them um but probably the most well known one is uh the the semaglutide which is known as OIC and I think that is probably the one that welln but there are a variety of others and they all seem to end in glutide or Tide in general and I don into every single one of them but they they also affect appetite and food intake so gp1 I mentioned this it hormone it does play a role in controlling how much food we eat so um when when our bodies are making glp1 whether you know it being administered to us uh through a medication or it eat a meal um it it helps us F Fuller faster and eat l so what it it it signaling and working on specific areas in our brain specifically the hypothalamus which is a a crucial part of the brain that is involved in appetite regulation so the ability of glp1 to make us F full and eat less and why medications that mimic it its action are able to do so um do help people lose weight because they are feeling satiated so separate from GP one there were talking about this you know at the at start of this this section um it also it it wasn help people with weight loss but um there medications that are hybrid peptides so they they a hybrid between these two different types of medications so these new treatments are aiming to boost both weight loss more effectively than glp1 Alone um but also involved with blood glucose regulation as well so they further decreasing appetite they increasing weight loss as well and so let um there comparing just glp1 alone so semaglutide or OIC web Genny as well and um there been a a lot of different studies done so there was a large study that combined the results from six different trials so there was a almost 4,000 different overweight or obese people in this trial that did not have diabetes and they were taking semaglutide sold as OIC it significantly reduced their body weight on average people taking the semaglutide lost about 11.8% of their body weight and about 12.2 kg or 20 26.9 lbs okay so that was compared to Placebo in one of these studies this was a popular trial it was called a step five trial it lasted for two years included about 300 different participants it showed that people taking semaglutide lost an average of 15.2% of their initial body weight compared to just 2.6% um in the placebo group and over 70% of the participants in the the treatment group um lost at least 5% of their body weight the study also found that the weight was the weight loss was um maintained um it levels off well it levels off at about 60 to 68 weeks but the weight the reduced weight was maintained for several months as long as the medication was continued um so the medication need to be continued uh there wasn loss in weight after about 60 to 68 weeks it was just sort of maintained after that level after that time so there really significantly shown reductions in body weight with semaglutide um it reductions in body weight are largely contributed to a loss in fat Mass but not all studies were you know directly measuring changes in muscle mass so you know there are some studies use dexas scans which do um dexas scans are s sort of a widely used method for assessing body composition they include bone mineral density fat Mass lean body mass muscle which includes muscle mass um it valuable tool clinical research but it does not directly it know an accurately measuring muscle mass so it is an indirect measurement and so for that reason you know de doing lean body MKS you know it and saying yes this this means muscle mass but it doesn not necessarily the same thing so lean body mass includes muscle but it also has other non fat tissues like organs it has connective tissues and it can be influenced by the hydration status of the individual so lean mass measurements are affected by water content in the body and so dexa assumes a constant hydration level of lean tissue um but you know there a lot of you could you could point out a lot of flaws with dexa measurements as a actual measurement of muscle mass I don about dexa the point I make is that the gp1 receptor antagonists sorry agonists um the semaglutide drugs do reduce appetite and if you are reducing appetite you are going to decrease your overall food intake which is what happens and that includes protein so there could be some implications for reductions in muscle mass as part of that weight loss particularly in people that are not taking in enough protein and are not engaging in resistance training and resistance exercise and that is a consideration you know for people that are taking these drugs um the semaglutide drugs because they likely are reducing their overall protein intake and I don of people are not engaged in resistance training but there of the population in general that does not engage in resistance training so these are important considerations um particularly when people are are taking any kind of drug that is in some ways sort of increasing a fasting state right by by reducing appetite and reducing food intake now there on these dual Gip and gp1 receptor agonists and um these are called uh tyep zppa zepeti and so monjaro or zppa pound I guess is what is what they called sorry if I I butchered their names but um there was one large study that looked to see how well people um lost weight and manag that weight loss and this included over 4,000 people some people did have type 2 diabetes some people did not that were part of the trial and these these combination drugs were really good at helping people lose weight compared to a placebo um depending on the dose people lost between 7.7 kg to almost 12 kg more than people who did not take the medication so this is anywhere between 8.1% to 12.4% of their their total body weight in another part of the study called the surmount 3 trial people who are already lost 5% of their their weight through diet and exercise were also given the the the tire Zep zepeti or Placebo and those in the treatment group lost an additional 18.4% of their body weight while those on the placebo actually gained back 2.5% so it really um shows that these these drugs are effective at weight loss and um the weight loss did level off a little bit later than the semaglutide so they it leveled off about 68 to 72 weeks um and the study didn to see if the weight loss would stay off in the long term there wasn head-to-head comparison of the semaglutide to the tyep zepeti but when those trials were sort of just looked at separately um it was found that the combination the tyros uptide was actually more effective than the semaglutide with respect to weight loss so um what about after discontinuing treatment there was one there was a um one year after withdrawal of once weekly subcutaneous semaglutide treatment that found um people did regain 2third of their weight after they had had prior weight loss after discontinuing discontinuing the this the semaglutide and um and I think I think it it studies that in order to maintain the weight loss those drugs need to be continued and so that obviously a major drawback with um with some of these drugs now the combination drug the tyr zepeti it seems as though those uh weight was also gained back but um to a lesser degree I think both those medic medications are effective for weight loss um when they however stopping the medication leads to weight regain so there are some adverse effects um as well in addition to obviously stopping the medication and regaining back the weight um there some stomach related side effects like nausea diarrhea constipation vomiting all those sorts of things burning in the stomach and um generally speaking the side effects seem to be um more common obviously in people that are taking the the the actual drug versus the placebo for the semi glutide the chances of experiencing these were 2.6 times higher than those taking a placebo for the combination drug the tyr eptide it was up to 4.6 Times Higher so it seems as if some of the side effects were even higher with the combination drugs um some some of the studies suggest that these negative side effects the stomach related ones actually don long and they generally improve in l than two months so it couple of months are the hardest with respect to some of those side effects and then some people have um more serious side effects like a really RIS a risk of very low blood sugar um acute pancreatitis which is inflammation of the pancreas is another another one and then some people can experience some psych psychiatric disorders um but those are more rare than the more common stomach related issues so generally speaking I think that you know these medications can be very helpful for um people that are overweight and obese um to you know to get to lose a healthy amount of of weight and and control their blood sugar levels um particularly if they training and trying to take in enough protein as well to make sure they losing a lot of muscle um the problem then becomes okay is this going to be a lifelong medication or can you keep that weight off by um dietary and lifestyle changes probably you will regain some of that weight back because just simply you you will calories in calories out will calories will be be coming in more readily when you when you stop the drug and so um that is something to consider we don effects of these drugs are um over the case of like you know two three four decades right so um that question	Success
If you do OMAD (one meal a day), you need to hear this	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcgsEvrEHXU	FoundMyFitness Clips 	if you do not resistance train up to 30% of the weight you lose comes from muscle like that is really bad that is really bad and so people doing this one meal a day and not exercising not doing resistance training are are are really creating a big big problem that um that they mean it is great to lose the fat too I mean like really important but you do not want to lose all that muscle um particularly when you particularly when you that so um I think that that doing one meal a day if you resistance training and you lose weight is a good strategy to to lose weight caloric restriction will will do it however I don one meal a day is a good strategy for just normal people um trying to improve aging I I think that thing to do	Success
Why you should stop eating 3 hours before bed (and wait 1 hour before having breakfast)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoH0Uu5CA_0	FoundMyFitness Clips 	you want to stop eating 3 hours before bed and that has to do with some of the Melatonin it has to do with uh some of the digestion it takes 5 hours to digest right like you can you can repairing either if you you need to you need to give some time to like finish all that right so then you switch to repair mode when you are in a fasted state so I think a good rule of thumb is three hours before bed you you stop the last bite of food going into your mouth but also when you wake up in the morning so it takes about an hour or two depending on how much bright light exposure you get first thing in the morning for your melatonin levels to clear your melatonin levels you don want to just wake up and then start eating breakfast right away because your melatonin levels are still elevated and remember melatonin does inhibit insulin production in the in the beta eyelid cells in the pancreas SO waiting an hour and getting that early bradl exposure to really help clear out that melatonin first thing in the morning is important	Success

How sugar stiffens your heart (if you don't exercise)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqTm3cQq7Bw	FoundMyFitness Clips 	When you have a constant intake of glucose and that glucose, let you that glucose get get disposed into your muscle, which is really where you want it, right? You want it to go get taken up into your muscle. If that doesn happen, if you the glucose will stay around in your bloodstream. And what happens is, yes, there metabolic stuff, but there something that happens that that called the Mailor reaction. And it where glucose reacts with lipids, it reacts with um DNA in your body. It reacts with proteins and damages them. And when it reacts with proteins like for example collagen lining your your paricardium surrounding your heart, your moardium surrounding your heart, lining your blood vessels, it causes the collagen to become stiff. It changes the properties of the protein. It makes them stiff kind of like trans fats. And that plays a major role in the stiffening of the heart with age which affects you know it affects cardiovascular disease risk	Success
This Type of Exercise Grows Your Brain By 2% (and improves focus)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF-X7b2VbpU	FoundMyFitness Clips 	let go a little bit deeper on what you were talking about with respect to like brain derived neurotropic factor and like what this is doing so like when we building up lactate as a result of vigorous exercise it the brain blood the bloodb brain barrier it doing all sorts of beneficial things like something called uh neurogenesis right like so talk a little bit more in depth about the import of lactate or the relationship between it and and the healthy brain that we all are trying to you know kind of foster yeah um I would love to it I I really try to engage in uh a lot of vigorous intensity exercise that I got neurod degenerative disease on both sides of my family so for me I brain focused when it comes to exercise it do exercise I feel better but I also know that I brain and helping prevent neurogenic disorders so lack um you know it depends on how there lot of factors at play in terms of how much lactate you so how how intense you of your exercise um your mitochondrial function a lot of individual variability here at play but generally speaking you know when you start to go into that vigorous intensity Zone you know you can start typically our steady state lactate levels are like less than one millimolar and when you get when you start to go into you know 80 85% 90% max heart rate you can get anywh where between 7 to 14 millimar of of lactate in your blood stream and this is can be measured you know you can go out and get tests I measured it before um for myself uh the the the lactate levels don in your in your blood system and that is because it is being transported and going and taken up by other tissues so really uh as far as I repeatedly it 20 25 minutes and then it goes back to your Baseline so there have been a variety of studies that have shown by the way Dr George Brooks from UC Berkeley was the first to really propose at the time this lactate shuttle Theory as he called it and it theory anymore it time again but he was really the first to to propose that lactate was being transported inter circulation it was being taken up by a variety of other tissues notably the brain and that it was you know having beneficial effects in these other organs so um in the brain so there is a transporter lactate goes through this it transporter and it gets into the brain and there studies showing that actually during physical activity lactate is fueling the brain because you know your brain is working hard your heart is working hard during exercise your lungs are working hard your brain is also working hard right I mean you know this as your as an endurance athlete your brain is also working hard during exercise and lactates fueling that um fueling the brain activity that some of that also has to do with the fact that lactate I it brain derve neurotropic factors so you mentioned that bdnf for short and um that is doing a lot of things it is helping grow new neurons um particularly in part of the brain called the hippocampus which is involved in learning and memory it the brain that atrophies with Alzheimer been a variety of studies that have shown even older adults that are engaging in moderate intensity activity for about a year can increase the size of their hippocampus by like 2% which is amazing because typically older adults lose in their their hippocamp hippocampus atrophies with time so not only were they fighting and staving off the atrophying but they were also increasing it so so that was pretty um I think one of the one of the big eye opening studies and this was this was over 10 years ago this was like a 2012 study that was published um showing this so um the brain Drive neurotropic factor is growing new neurons can increase the size of the hippocampus but also it really important for something called neuroplastic and that is it it think about keeping our brains more pliable and and malleable and um adaptable so really neuroplasticity allows our brains to adapt to a changing environment and this is important for aging but it health so so people with major depressive disorder for example they have dysfunction and neuroplasticity so and then that kind of makes sense right if you can to a changing environment it stressful and can cause anxiety can be depressing so um there have been a variety of different you know researchers that are trying to Target neuroplasticity as a treatment for depression so neuroplasticity not only plays a role in brain aging but it also plays a role in mental health and I I think that important to to point out because I mean I think I think almost everyone by now knows that exercise is one of the best things you can do for mental health right I mean it can even just even doing like a 10-minute high intensity workout you feel better you know you feel better sure but that that things that are happening right the hormonal regulation aspect of it I mean that you know how how important is the plasticity piece in the mental health conversation and you know what is the significance of of that plasticity increase as a result of vigorous exercise yeah it point out I think there are a lot of things that are changing with exercise I mean endorphins that make you feel good you know endoc canabo that make you feel good I mean there increased right so there different I would say um short-term effects for for that are potentially responsible for the beneficial like elevation and mood that you experience after exercise with neur plasticity um I would argue there effect right it brain is now able to um adapt better to a changing environment and that to have a more of a long-term consequence so neuroplasticity is another really important thing that brain Drive neurotropic Factor regulates and again coming back to the lactate which is what we were talking about um you know lactate is also it when I say it communicating and activating a lot of different things in the brain so norepinephrine is another one that been shown to increase and norepinephrine is a neurotransmitter that is responsible for Focus attention but also mood you know so people are often treated with nor norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors for um anxiety and also depression so lactate plays a role in increasing that as well um but again we getting down into the nitty-gritty of one aspect of exercise and as you pointed out there changes that occur with exercise that are beneficial not limited to lactate I just I I think the lactate story is so important because it it really is um a proven mechanism both human animal studies it um you know and it again it also that we links the more high-intensity exercise the more vigorous exercise with you know a lot of these benef beneficial effects on the brain	Success

Is Alcohol the Secret to Longevity in Blue Zones?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnPBiM_Fun4	FoundMyFitness Clips 	now I want to Pivot our conversation into talking about alcohol health and disease beginning with alcohol let use of alcohol is responsible for more than 200 different disease and injury conditions in 2016 there were 3 million deaths attributed to alcohol or around 5.3% of all deaths worldwide alcohol is also estimated to be responsible for 131 million years of life loss due to premature mortality or years of healthy life loss due to disability and disease alcohol greater than that for tuberculosis HIV and AIDS diabetes hypertension digestive diseases Road injuries and violence men seem to have a higher alcohol attributable burden of disease than women furthermore the risk of alcohol aren adults age 20 to 39 approximately 13.5% of all deaths are attributable to alcohol and over 50% of all alcohol related deaths occur in adults younger than 60 like all drugs when misused alcohol can cause harm what relevant to most people is how a low-risk drinking habit impacts Health span and lifespan that to cover now one extensively adjusted metaanalysis of over 4.8 million participants did not find any significant association between consuming less than one to up to three drinks per day with all cause mortality when compared to Lifetime non-drinkers people consuming three to five and more than five drinks per day who the study characterized as high volume and highest volume drinkers had a 19 to 35% greater mortality risk than lifetime non-drinkers however the risk was different for men and women mortality risk was higher in women than in men and increased even among women having two or more drinks per day in men mortality risk increased at three or more drinks per day metabolic differences body composition and hormonal factors can cause alcohol to have different impacts on men and women women generally have lower gastric levels of the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase which helps metabolize alcohol making them more susceptible to alcohol lower doses compared to men this could explain the increased mortality risk in women compared to men an important advancement from this study was the finding that while low to moderate volume drinking didn mortality risk compared to abstaining it didn been suggested by previous large scale studies so some Studies have found a lower life expectancy in so-called low and moderate drinkers a study involving nearly 600,000 current drinkers has shown that even what many consider low to moderate levels of drinking ing can significantly decrease life expectancy for example individuals consuming about eight drinks per week might see a reduction in life expectancy by around 6 months by the age of 40 compared to those who drink four or fewer drinks per week as the number of drink increases to 15 and then to 26 drinks per week the reduction in life expectancy becomes more pronounced potentially decreasing by 1 to 2 years and 4 to 5 years resp L similar results are observed for health span the lowest risk is observed at zero alcoholic drinks per day but is still non-significant up to 10 standard drinks per week or less than one drink per day but above one standard drink per day there risk I think it is safe to say here that there is no amount of alcohol that increases life expectancy and it appears at least consistent across several studies that up to four drinks per week is not associated with a decrease in life expectancy compared to abstaining from alcohol a few found my Fitness members had questions about the blue zones and why in these countries where people tend to have exceptional longevity moderate alcohol consumption is typically a large part of the culture so-called blue zones are areas of the world that have an unusually high number of people who are the oldest of the old which typically refers to centenarians or people who were 100 years or older Oka Japan Sardinia the Greek island of accaria Lolinda California are four blue zones that have been identified and well characterized it does appear that people in these regions other than the seventh day Adventists of Loma Linda drink alcohol regularly but moderately about one glass of wine per day this is important because in addition to the amount of alcohol consumed the pattern of consumption likely matters drinking one glass of wine per day is probably different than drinking seven glasses of wine on Saturday even if patterns lead to an average of seven drinks per week a low to moderate daily dose characterizes the drinking patterns of the blue zones people in these areas also tend to consume wine with meals which may also be an important factor for example men and women in accaria drink more alcohol than people living in other parts of Greece and 75% of aarian reported drinking one to two glasses of red wine daily the fact that most of the alcohol consumed in the blue zones is red wine and is probably important to knowe given that red wine has been speculated to promote Health span and Longevity due to its high content of polyphenols and other bioactive compounds even though this is somewhat disputed and we talked about the low levels of polyphenol such as resveratol and red wine among residents of okanawa more men and women report moderate daily drinking compared to the general Japanese population it also interesting interesting that many longlived people from the blue zones are former smokers even though few of them are active smokers this is one explanation for the exceptional longevity of people in the blue zones they might be particularly good at dealing with toxins such as those present in alcohol and cigarettes this would indicate that people in the blue zones don moderate daily alcohol intake but in spite of it adopting the drinking habits of people in the blue zones probably won at least not if you don genes one gene known as forkhead box o3a or foxo3a has consistently been associated with human longevity foxo3a has a protective role against oxidative stress and is involved in apoptosis DNA repair immune cell regulation carcinogenesis and stem cell maintenance having a protective Al of this gene or the TT genotype could explain why people in the blue zones live longer despite their moderate alcohol consumption but some studies fail to find differences in the prevalence of the protective Al of foxo3a genes among Blue Zone populations like those in Sardinia compared to other Italians and Greeks I find it hard to believe that longevity in the blue zones is because of Direct effects of moderate red wine consumption on health the social aspects that are associated with moderate alcohol consumption with meals May provide an indirect benefit to Health and Longevity by improving well-being by reducing stress that is probably really just the extent of it so to summarize there that any amount of alcohol has any positive effect on life expectancy or health span even levels of alcohol consumed regularly by large portion of the population appear to increase the risk of death and disease and the risk isn optimally reduce your health risk abstaining from alcohol is recommended but if you choose to drink a safe amount for most healthy individuals it appears to be one to two drinks per week on average without exceeding five drinks per week as this level of alcohol consumption does not appear to increase mortality risk compared to abstainers finally while the moderate drinking habits characterized of the blue zones are associated with longevity it probably not due to a direct benefit of alcohol or red wine but rather the social aspects that are related to this pattern of alcohol consumption Examining The

4 Ways to Detox Your Body From Toxic Microplastics (backed by science)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM9hyEuIfM4	FoundMyFitness Clips 	How can I get rid of them? I many microplastics in my body. How do I get rid of them? Yeah. So microplastics, we kind of talked about a little bit getting rid of them and that really the main source is excretion through feces and that happens with dietary fiber. So if you are eating a lot of fruits and vegetables, that does increase the chances that microplastics are going to move their way out through feces. Is that only microplastics that you consuming along with it or is it able to pull microplastics de sort of detoxify them from your body? I think it think it because if you think about like fiber, what does it do? It moves stuff through your body. It doesn to be something that you just ate, right? Like it could be something that you had hours before. So if you getting like fiber, daily fiber, right? like thinking about getting your total daily fiber. I think that that is important because it the it you can like the the ways of just moving it through but also in you know with the type of fiber that like you know berries and apples. So these are pectins like inulin all this all this type of fermentable fiber green bananas resistant starch like that stuff makes viscous gel-like substance in your gut which encapsulates microplastics so that you really I think it important to focus on the daily fiber intake versus like with a meal. So is that the the biggest mover daily fiber intake do you think? I do and this is all animal data like there new. There on that area in terms of like excreting it through feces and absorption, intestinal absorption. Um, but I do think like it wouldn that important. Oh, the other thing this just came out. This is interesting. Also, animal data. So, forever chemicals, I mentioned forever chemicals. Those take 2 to 5 years to excrete, to get rid of. I say excrete, to detoxify, get out of your body. They stay in your body forever. That forever chemicals. Um unlike bisphenol A which is it has it body for like up to four or five hours, you know, any from 2 to 5 hours. This is really kind of daily excretion and it excreted through urine. But there studies showing that the they um beta glucans and they they oats. The beta glucans which is by the way a fermentable type of uh fiber they were they actually caused excretion of the forever chemicals pas in animals which is something that doesn So they increase the um excretion through it affects like your your your liver or your your bile acid and liver and cholesterol and all this like fancy stuff that you know might be confusing to explain but essentially that shown to um increase the excretion of fiber chemicals. So I adding a lot of um oats. In fact I had some oatmeal this morning because I like oh my gosh this isn egg. The reason why I also think it happening in humans is because there was a human study, not with oats, um, but it was it cholesterol and it does the exact same thing that oats the beta the beta glucans and oats do. It was shown to clear forever chemicals in people. Wow. So, I\\ here. sauna um, so I things um, through through urine or feces, right? So, so bisphenol A and a lot of these plastic chemicals, the primary route of excretion is through urine. And there is a way I think that we can excrete them. Sauna you excreting mostly is through sweat. And there are a lot of toxins that we exposed to that we do excrete through sweat. A lot of those are heavy metals. So, for example, um cadmium and aluminum. So, aluminum is associated with Alzheimer readily excreted through sweat than through urine. And so when you get in the sauna, you really you can you can excrete a little bit of BPA. It does it does come out through sweat as well. However, the majority of excretion um chemicals that are being excreted through sweat are things like some heavy metals and things like that. So that um is important for excretion of a lot of you know compounds that are detrimental to health. But when it comes to BPA for example or phalates, so the way so the the these compounds are they soluble and in order for us to get rid of them, we have to make them water soluble and there that and that enzyme is activated by a system in our body called the NRF2 system. It transcription factor that basically turns on a lot of genes, turns off a lot of genes. So what it does is it activates something called the phase 2 detoxification enzymes. These detox a lot of harmful compounds in our body. The major dietary activator of this system is a compound called sulfurophane which is something that you can produce when you eat cruciferous vegetables like broccoli. Broccoli um is a good source. Actually, the younger plant broccoli sprouts have a 100 times more of the precursor to make sulfur called glucaraphin. Um so you basically the sulurophane compound is made when the plant is like broken. So when you bite it, chew it, right? That sulfurophane. So broccoli sprouts have a really really high concentration of that precursor. There have been a variety of studies that um have looked at sulfurophane and giving it to humans and it it activating this system and causing the excretion of harmful compounds that we breathe in. So there have been studies in China where air pollution is terrible and people are breathing in for example benzene. Okay, benzene is a known carcinogen. It to air pollution, it cigarette smoke, any plant burning material, fires, right? So this is very relevant to people like in Southern California and Los Angeles where there a lot of wildfires and the air quality is very bad. There Okay, benzene is a carcinogen. So there have been studies in China, more than one study showing that consuming sulfurophane about it 40 about 40 micro moles of sulfurophane causes the excretion of benzene to increase within 24 hours by 60%. So this is really big. You can supplement sulurophane. you can and I do supplement with it. So, um I take a supplement called Avacol and that supplement has been used in a lot of different clinical studies because it very it reliable source of glucaraphin and the and the enzyme is very unstable. It sensitive to heat. So, if you heat broccoli up really hot, you like degrading a lot of the sulurophane that you eating broccoli raw would be optimal. optimal or just lightly lightly cooked like like lightly cooked. So this company has been very delicate with how they they their advanced advanced AMAL which has about gosh it something per per tablet and so it only so actually taking one tablet of that was equivalent to the study on benzene excretion. So I take two tablets a day and the reason I do that is because I also want to increase glutathione which is a antioxidant a very powerful antioxidant in our body. There have been clinical studies showing that people taking sulfurophane increase their glutathione levels in their plasma and also in their brain. So in the brain I mean it for cognitive function for brain aging everything like that. So I take anywhere between two to four AMA calls a day because that affiliation with them. Their um their stabilization process is really great. It capsule. So capsules are cheaper to make but they retain water and water degrades the myroinase enzyme. So lot dancing through this minefield is basically impossible isn consider. Um, but when it comes back to the sulfurophane and BPA, there direct evidence, human evidence that it doing it because one, there study showing that if you give animals sulfurophane and then give them a toxic level of BPA, it doesn toxicity. Two, sulfurophane activates these very enzymes that cause BPA to become water soluble and excreted. That this, you know, data, human clinical data showing that sulfurane causes the excretion of other harmful compounds that also have to be converted to be waters soluble like benzene and acryine, for example. So, I think there of evidence suggesting that sulforophane would help with excretion of BPA. You touched on something there. I don whether you you people will have been directly impacted by the fires in LA or indirectly just by it more stressed and they in this air which presumably is still probably going to be in the local ecology. Is there anything how worried do you think that people should be about what if you were someone that is there a particular protocol or some things that you would consider over the next few weeks and months to try and just help yourself get back to a good place of health? I do and you know I have um several friends that have been you know impacted by the the LA fires and I some of this stuff. So um first I I wearing a mask if you the thick of it right when it really really bad air quality. But um having a hepailter inside one um and two the sulfurophane. So I several friends that they should be taking um a call. Again I don affiliation with them. They just there multiple clinical studies using their formulation very reliable and um so you know taking anywhere between two to four a day to increase the excretion of a lot of these harmful compounds that are in the air. Now, that you like the microplastics that you breathing in. You sulforophane isn that. It chemical aspects of it. The microplastics themselves, like because plastics are burning and lots of stuff, particulate matter is in the air, that where you get the hepailters. That important um to help with the breathing in that air, right? Sound.	Success

More People Would Supplement With Vitamin D If They Knew THIS	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrPvQp3hHNs	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so vitamin D um we didn people might be wondering you about all these important micronutrients why aren well food is not a great source of it like you can find like it fortified in some fatty foods unfortunately it wrong form it than D3 which is what we make in our our skin from the Sun um so vitamin D is the primary source of it is as you mentioned it UVB radi ration from the Sun and why do I point that out because that is really important because UVB radiation only occurs during certain times of the year so you know winter early spring no UVB radiation happening especially in regions I mean I wouldn saying in regions where you Northern and latitude something like above like the 37th parallel or something like that if you like a map so for example in Canada like you know you good you know four or five months out of the year it to make a lot of vitamin D from being out in the sun summertime you know different lots of UB UVB radiation right same thing is like well you laying out in the sun to get a tan in December because tanning is like if you vitamin D at this like that the same process right the the UVB radiation is causing the same thing so um so you need to be in the Sun and you need to be at a certain time of year depending on where you live it all there and um you mentioned sunscreen as well there are involved in you know the ability to produce vitamin D3 in the skin from the UVB radiation and that has to do with sunscreen so anything that blocks out UVB radiation is going to block out the ability to make vitamin D um melanin the the pigmentation that like a sunscreen it some people have like in some regions of the world that are certainly more equatorial um that is also a natural sunscreen it blocks out UVB radiation which is why your body responds when you it need to protect myself it adaptation right so um the other thing that regulates the production of vitamin D3 from the Sun is age so um the older you get the worse the the less I would say efficient your body is at making vitamin D3 from the Sun so for example a 70-year-old makes like four times less than their 20-y old former self and then um bioavailability of vitamin D3 is important as well and that by body mass and weight so so so you make vitamin D3 in your skin but it gets released into your bloodstream and um then it converted into another form that is actually not a vitamin it hormone so vitamin D is actually much more important it it needs and um body so B so basically the more body fat you have the less bioavailable vitamin D3 is and so you actually need more vitamin D3 the more body weight the more body fat that you have um so this hormone is is extremely important because it is regulating about 5% of the human genome the protein and coating Human Genome so it doing a lot of things and you can imagine so what it does there a little sequence inside of our our DNA in you know it sequence that vitamin D recognizes and it like this whole complex of vitamin D and a receptor goes down and binds that little sequence of DNA and it turns on a gene or it turns saging and it and it does it in a very coordinated Manner and when you don that stuff all goes wrong and and so lots of things can can happen and um because of sunscreen because of our modern-day Lifestyles we inside technology we less farming less agricultural work out in the sun we indoors majority of people are not getting enough vitamin D through and so um something around 70% of the US population is insufficient in vitamin D3 so that that is defined as having blood levels of vitamin D less than 30 nanograms per milliliter and then a another percentage of the population is deficient so there nanograms per milliliter but we told like not to go outside we told to you know layer up the sunscreen we getting in the way vitamin D are they helping us what how do we make sense of all this if you have you know fair skin and you then you can increase your risk for DNA damage and you know skin cancer is one like for example Australia so you know fair skinned PE Australia is like like the meel melanoma cancer is like through the roof and in Australia and melanoma is like the worst type of skin cancer to get so um you know there skin people living there and Australia is very close to the equator you know there out of the Year where you and lots of UVB radiation but um people that were sort of native to that region had darker um skin they had more melanin and so the solution to people that are more fair skinned living in Australia is actually sunscreen and a hat and um and a vitamin D3 supplement because you know like these people are that are fair skinned in Australia migrated from like a region like you know Britain right where it was not like that it further from the equator and so their fair skin was an adaptation to help them make more D3 from a little bit of sun right that they get during the the summer and um you know spring and stuff so um yeah the the the question is where do you find the balance right like how much sun exposure is enough and do I need to supplement and do I have to wear sunscreen and I think that all depends on a variety of factors it isn one-sized fits all it where do you live do you live you know in Southern California like where I do do you live in Australia uh do you live in Canada um where do you live like how much exposure to the sun are you getting um you know so those are those are all factors to keep in mind and then just measuring vitamin D levels where am I at then then you can go okay well clearly I don the sun a lot because I work inside a lot so you know even without the sunscreen I know getting enough vitamin D3 so you have to kind of measure something so is there a difference like if I go out and buy a vitamin D3 supplement uh is there a difference between that and the Sun and then do I want to take that with anything I noticed I think athletic greens includes vitamin K with that is that for um is that for the bioavailability no it bioavailability let address your question because they really great questions um differences between sun exposure and supplemental form again um vitamin D3 supplemental form which is which is key because the vitamin D there there are there is a plant form of vitamin D that like mushrooms for example it vitamin D2 and that vitamin D3 and in fact there preliminary work showing that it may even inhibit some of the vitamin D3 and conversion into the steroid hormone um which is important so so the differences between vitamin D3 from the Sun versus supplemental yes there like you know let you where you equator and you make vitamin D you know three from the Sun and you you there all the time um there studies that have measured the levels of you know people that are like Aboriginal to the equ equatorial regions like Bushman and subsaharan Africa and their natural vitamin D levels are something like anywhere between 80 to 100 nanograms per Mill but they don go above that and the reason is because your body senses like the vitamin D levels and when you exposed to the Sun instead of converting it into like vitamin D3 it like converts it into this other metabolite so it like it the brakes on this we anymore right if you supplement and you don anything like you can let taking like an insane number like so um there been sort of um identified as the safe amount to supplement with vitamin D3 every day so like The Institute of medicine in the United States has set that as 4,000 IUS a day that doesn mean you can the the safe you know upper limit where you effects like that let a day like way over 4,000 right I mean and you don mean you you going to kick in in the skin that like they do when the when you being exposed to a lot of UB radiation and your your body enough vitamin D3 so I stop so um you can over supplement with vitamin D3 it is fat soluble and it can be toxic however it is it is not it challenging to do like you would have to take something like 100,000 IUS you know or something a day for like a year you have to take so there done and like you can take 10,000 IUS a day 50 thou even 50,000 IUS a day and the biggest effect is um vitamin D3 can you can you can make your calcium more bioavailable so we bioavailability of other minerals um calcium is much more bioavailable in the presence of vitamin D so you absor absorb about 40% more calcium from your diet if you have adequate levels of vitamin D and the hormone steroid hormone right so um one concern is well if I have a lot of vitamin D and I taking calcium then maybe I get hyper calmia right too much calcium in the bloodstream and that concern there are studies that have shown it doses that you have to do for a long time to get that but um that is the concern with with taking too much vitamin D3 is that you too much calcium in your blood which can have acute toxicity effects but also long-term effects with calcification of you know your arteries and your vascular system because calcium can form a precipitate really easy and so um you know that mentioned um your your athletic greens so they put vitamin K2 in there which is so I mentioned vitamin K1 which is found in leafy greens and it blood coagulation so clotting um it was when you take in Your Greens you make you to the liver and it activates all those coagulation proteins blood for blood clotting when you get enough of that from the greens it it stays in circulation and it does exactly what vitamin K2 does which is activates proteins that are involved in shuttling calcium out of your vascular system and bringing it to your bones bringing it to your muscle where you want calcium to be and not in your vascular system where it can form a precipitate and then a plaque right so there in the I think in the in in not a push but like a awareness I guess is a better word awareness in um in the health sphere that you know if you going to be absorbing more calcium with having you know adequate vitamin D that you also want to make sure that you that calcium that you going where it where the K2 comes into hand but like I said K1 does the thing especially when you doesn so um but I want to mention one other thing because you did say bioavailability and it has to do with magnesium because magnesium is a we a co-actor for enzymes like DNA repair I didn it enzymes that convert vitamin D3 into the circulating form of vitamin D that we go and we measure it 25 hydroxy vitamin D and then eventually into the active steroid hormone which is 125 hydroxy vitamin D but we call it the the active steroid hormone and so there people that don even if they even if they they won hormone and So you you get the important effects that vitamin D3 the whole point of vitamin D3 is to get converted into the steroid hormone it need so if you magnesium that that also comes down to a lot of um conflicting studies in the the scientific literature because I as I mentioned half of the US population doesn you did you get a random sampling of the population and you say okay we to take this group and give them a vitamin D supplement and then we going to take this group and give them a placebo but you don their magnesium status you just know from the GetGo half of the people are not going to have enough and that will affect their ability to form the steroid hormone and so um it really plays a role in my opinion in this the conflicting data with with the vitamin D3 supplementation studies which is kind of all over the place um and that completely different episode but um I just thought because you mentioned bioavailability and again if you yeah if you like athletic greens does have magnesium in it I think but also if you greens right that source of magnesium as well so you want to make you have your magnesium um covered especially for the Vitamin D as well because they work together you need them both	Success

The Dangers of Vitamin D Deficiency (and why you should supplement) | Dr. Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4VvG0qD5Xw	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so let general will will you tell us some of your your favorite go-to lifestyle-based longevity tips well I think there it fruit so things that people can there not a lot of resistance and barriers for people to start applying in their in their daily lives and um I think when it comes to to some of the easiest things that people can do it it usually comes down to uh unfortunately taking a pill and so I know you might be going what is she talking about well um you know I the the micronutrient inadequacies is is a it the United States and and other developed countries as well where you know there vitamins minerals fatty acids amino acids that we have to get from our diet and if we don we are going to be inadequate in them and these essential Micron micronutrients are doing very important things in our body from running our metabolism to making sure our enzymes which are proteins inside of our cells that are basically doing all the work responsible for everything from pumping our blood to our immune function to neurotransmitter function so basically everything they require these you know micronutrients as co-actors and um it it that diet food first approach and getting getting all your micronutrients from Whole Foods eating diverse Foods is Paramount however um many people it will not do that um they busy or they have a habit or there know other sorts of uh disregulation perhaps in in um satiety mechanisms and you know so getting getting some micronutrients like some of the important ones from a supplement and these are these are easy ones vitamin D vitamin D is an easy one um you know that our skin from the Sun and about 70% of the US population has inadequate vitamin D and that than 30 nanograms per milliliter if you Europe that would you that by 2.5 but um 70% of the US population has levels below that and there have been many different meta analyses you know over the decades you know dating back all the way to the 1960s looking at vitamin D levels and all cause mortality and it know pretty clear that having levels above 30 is associated with a lower all cause mortality all cause mortality other words people are less likely to die from um nonaccidental causes of death whether that disease although I would say cardiovascular disease is probably the weakest with respect to vitamin D cancer mortality is down respiratory diseas is down those are two of the really big ones um the big drivers with respect to lowering all cause mortality but um so taking a a vitamin D supplement is one of the easiest things to do why is widespread deficiency you know so common well because we in our offices at our you know techn with our technological advances computers everything we don much time outside you know doing agriculture doing you know the sort of Outdoors kind of um jobs that you know that were common hundred years ago so so people are not making Vitamin D from their skin and on top of that there are very there are a variety of factors that actually actually regulate whether or not we can make enough vitamin D in our skin and that you know from everything from age so a 70-year-old person makes 20 like literally 25% of what they made as their 20year old self so it inefficient as you get older skin um color so melanin that pigment that basically acts as a natural sunscreen also is a you know filter for UVB radiation which is actually what needs to basically penetrate through the skin to start vitamin D3 synthesis in the skin so because melanin is a you know is a natural sunscreen sunscreen also does that people wear a lot of sunscreen nowadays so there different reasons why people are not getting as much vitamin D um in our modern day world and and vitamin D is one of the the cheapest and easiest supplements to take um there have been studies that have basically tried to to figure out like how can you take a person who is deficient so deficiency would be 20 nanograms per Mill or less and when you start to get less than 20 nanograms per milliliter you start to go you start to run the risk of you know bone problems and severe other types of severe problems immune dysfunction for example um people that are deficient and supplement with about 4,000 iuse per day can bring theirself up to a sufficient level closer you know above 30 nanograms per mil perhaps even closer to 40 and um 4,000 I use per day is actually the tolerable upper intake um set by The Institute of medicine for vitamin D3 and I just want to mention you know vitamin D is unique among the vitamins because it steroid hormone so vitamin D3 goes to the to the liver it another metabolite called 25 hydroxy vitamin D that metabolite of vitamin D that measured if you get a a blood test and then it goes to the kidneys where it then converted into the steroid hormone that mean by a steroid hormone most people think about estrogen testosterone those are steroid hormones like imagine if 70% of the you know of men in the United States were deficient in testosterone like it D is is is basically very different because it basically can enter What called the cell nucle the nucleus of a cell and that is where all your DNA is and it can basically recognize this little sequence of DNA and it um it basically you know binds to your receptor and you you know it binds to your DNA and turns genes on activates them and turns other genes off and deactivates them in this

Exercise stimulates mitophagy Â the selective removal of damaged mitochondria from cells	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0ndYaUV678	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so another way that exercise improves mitochondrial health is through a process known as mitophagy or mitophagy as some people call it so mitophagy is a type of autophagy which involves the selective removal of damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria from the cell or within the cell um this process really helps maintain mitochondrial qual quality control and overall cellular health so when you put stress on mitochondria through exercise the body triggers you know the elimination of damaged mitochondria and the replacement of those mitochondria with new healthy ones through mitochondrial biogenesis	Success
Watch this before supplementing with magnesium	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nD4VDUdr1g	FoundMyFitness Clips 	for optimal bioavailability of magnesium supplements it effective to take the total daily dose in divided smaller amounts rather than a single large dose so this approach allows for more efficient absorption by the body it can also minimize the potential GI discomfort so smaller spaced out doses they better by the digestive system and this also ensures maximum absorption utilization of the magnesium	Success
Do this for 1 minute before eating to limit the damage from high carb meals	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKH0UbSOGBg	FoundMyFitness Clips 	there doing a minute or two of of this exercise snack type of exercise and that again comes down to lactate lactate you know MUSC you work really hard lactate gets into circulation gets taken back up by the muscle and it causes glucose Transporters to come up to the muscle and sort of open the gates so that glucose can come in and um you know so this really improves blood glucose levels and there looking at this particularly in people with to diabetes doing exercise snacks around meal time so anywhere between 30 minutes to an hour before after a meal can really dramatically decrease the post- prandial glucose response	Success

How Rhonda Patrick Limits Microplastic Exposure	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqXv_e8nyJE	FoundMyFitness Clips 	okay we rapid fire questions so Anna asks microplastics question in the pregnancy Alo quat you say you tried to avoid Plastics is the only reason plastic line cans are worse than bags of frozen fruit vegetables is the time is that the often times the canned food is put into the canned hot do you buy frozen berries or frozen spinach for your smoothies that are in plastic bags or do you keep fresh fruit or greens in plastic bags and Ziploc bags okay so um here are here what I do and my thoughts on on the plastic I do try to avoid using plastic as much as possible it mean my toothpaste is in a plastic container my shampoo is in a plastic it is ubiquitous it lives and so the more places you can eliminate the plastic the better I use a brand of bags called composti c o m p o s t i c rather than Ziploc bag so composti bags are what I store my food in um fruits veggies anything I no longer use ziplock or generic Ziploc brand plastic bags grocery store fruits vegetables all that stuff I don them in those plastic bags they either not in a bag at all or they go into a composti bag which is a compostable bag I do buy frozen organic berries they are in plastic bags um and that is life so so that is a a part of plastic that is that is still in my life um with respect to plastic like lining cans um like like like soda water or canned you know Foods yes a lot of times the canned foods go into the can hot and so it is exponentially worse with respect to at least some of the chemicals like BPA that leech into the foods it of a problem with the the frozen berries in the plastic bags but now we have to worry about nanoplastics which are these just like microscopic plastic particles that that are shed they haven after this question was submitted I thought about maybe I berries and then just take my big composti bag and then transfer them the problem with the composti bags is they don so um they long-term storage now with something like berries which I frequently I go through so quick it doesn if you longer term it know it storing something in the freezer long term but the main thing to avoid is any any kind of liquids in in plastic bottles or cans or any foods in the cans I think that particular particularly during pregnancy when when the you know the developing fetus is very sensitive to BPA and all those sorts of chemicals wavm is asking for in the chat for Plastics um is there a water product um or water bottle product that the yeti is good the yeti is not lined with plastic now you do have to keep in mind if you are drinking the yeti with the plastic lid then you nanoplastics in with the water so you can unscrew the lid if you of this um unscrew the lid and just drink out of the actual just bottle which doesn kind of annoying but I mean at the end of the day if you the first place to avoid the plastic then you drink it with the little plastic lid thing what especially if it bar is asking I try to do you try to avoid cans alt together I do I do avoid cans bottles all alt together now I was recently traveling and I often look like in airports now they metal like not metal but um um what called the the titanium bottles that are like reusable I sometimes I can and then I just have to use a plastic bottle or can you know sparkling water when I there are times when you just you just can avoid cans altogether as much as possible	Success
How to Lower ApoB With Omega-3s	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWZM_0zv3Zc	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so this this question was submitted by JQ and I also saw this question um in one shape or form this Q&A submitted by this Q&A and it has to do with apob and lipoproteins so I I I covered this topic in in in detail in previous q&as I probably cover it once every year and a half or so or something like that so the has to do with apob and LDL cholesterol and those numbers being quite High eating a fairly healthy diet or you know being being relatively healthy eating mostly low carb exercising being at a healthy weight but still having high apob and LDL and to B basically is there anything to address and I think first of all understanding look apob is a protein that structural support for life proteins particularly vldl so that precursor to LDL April B is a marker of cardiovascular health for a couple of reasons first it measure LDL particle number which may be more relevant for cardiovascular health than total LDL cholesterol second apob is what is likely to insert into arterial walls which then basically allow the LDL lipoprotein to not be recycled they sort of start that Cascade of inflammation and foam cell formation so AP B is relevant and um there a lot of interest in the regulation of apob it degradation and not synthesis so it regulated mostly in getting rid of it and not the production of it uh your con your your liver is really constantly making apob to some degree and and we do know that there is one factor that regulates the synthesis or production of it and that is inflammation and particularly cyto kindes like tnf Alpha in interferon tnf Alpha can be dramatically increased again under like conditions of intestinal permeability and I talked a lot about this in a presentation I gave a couple of months ago and there there are a variety of factors that can regulate intestinal permeability stress alcohol diet particularly um a very very high fat carbohydrate diet but even a high fat low fiber diet in some some cases can can increase um intestinal permeability interestingly we know that omega-3 particularly the Marine Omega-3s DHA and EPA so fish oil supplementation has been shown to decrease April B levels in people with dyslipidemia and also in people with normal lipids so um the dose was about 1,500 milligrams of EPA and 1,000 m milligrams of DHA that was shown to decrease apob possibly through this inflammation you know related mechanism or maybe other mechanisms as well we know that that that omega-3 um has been shown to reduce T tnf Alpha for example and in fact omega-3 has been shown to reduce lipopolysaccharide uh induced from a meal and again lipopolysaccharide when lipopolysaccharide makes its way into circulation from the gut it increases tnf Alpha I think there potential um synergistic effects going on there with omega-3 where it stopping the LPS release and so that one way it markers like tnf Alpha and it just resolving the inflammation quicker and lowering the inflammation so I think that the omega-3 um is probably one sort of low hanging fruit Avenue to explore with respect to um aob B reduction fish has also been shown to lower apob synthesis so another study found that um even higher dose of of fish oil so 1.8 grams of EPA and 1.2 grams of DHA was able to lower a production by 29% in people with normal blood lipids so um that decrease in the vldl pool size by 43% so that uh of the of the story and again you guys already know um and you more about my supplementation routine in a minute but you already know I huge fan of Omega-3 supplementation and I seen a variety of questions in in submitted in this Q&A about fish intake and concerns about heavy metals from fish intake and uh you know if there trade-off or not so I will say this you know yes to some degree you to get some contamination from from fish and you know the best thing you could do is go for the fish that are known to be lower in heavy metals and contaminants right so those are the wild Alaskan and salmon sardines you got to find obviously um there there could be some uh contamination with arsenic with some of the sardines but finding the smaller fish that are not accumul ating these heavy metals as much but also keep in mind that there have been studies done um particularly in pregnant women where pregnant women eating fish in fact the biomarker for fish intake was Mercury so they knew the women were eating more fish because their mercury levels were much higher than women that were not and the omega-3 fatty acid content in the fish fish protected the developing fetus and not only protected the developing fetus there was benefits from it in other words not getting the fish even though there was lower Mercury was worse for the fetus that is which is more sensitive by the way to heavy metals than than an adult is so the so they were more sensitive so they sensitive to the heavy heavy metals and yet having the higher heavy metals was better because of the omega-3 so it like the omega-3 is negating some of these potential adverse effects from from these heavy metals not to mention again you know excreting some of these heavy metals through sweat and also through things like betam mercaptans from garlic um which helps excrete it through urine also helps so you know I personally choose to eat fish but if you super concerned about heavy metals and you get your heavy metals measured um you know that that that keep in mind is also having your Oma omega-3 index measured and how high is your omega-3 index because that should really tell you something not to mention the fact that you know you can also obviously supplement with a higher dose of Omega-3 and maybe cut down some of your fish intake if that really big concern for me I I I personally like to eat the fish in addition there other micronutrients that are also present in the fish that are beneficial as well so um I think that uh that take on that and that was a big tangent I mean to the apob story here because there respected diet and I know that a lot of people follow a low carb diet and uh JQ had mentioned it in in in his initial question and there interesting research a lot of it from my friend and former colleague Dr Ron Ron Krauss who um looking at how different types of diets low carb versus low fat and how they affect a be and how they affect other risk factors like small dense LDL for example and it it really the dietary effects on apob and small dens LDL really come down to where a person is at their Baseline in terms of their their phenotype so um there there predisposition to whether or not a person is a phenotype a versus a phenotype B in in other words whether or not they making more of the small dense LDL uh product products versus not and and so starting out on you know someone that predisposed to making a lot of small dense LDL um is something that consider when when making dietary changes so for example looking at a high fat versus a lowfat diet and then switching you know doing a doing a switch over so so men that did either a high fat or lowfat and then they switched the diet after doing the diet um after the high-fat diet the individual individuals were classified as either phenotype a or phenotype B and then if they were following a lowfat diet all the phenotype B individuals stayed phenotype B but about 36 of those people shifted from a phenotype a to a phenotype B whereas about half like 51 of this of the people remained phenotype a after the lowfat diet phenotype B subjects had a greater decrease in their their um total cholesterol and also they decreased their apob um whereas phenotype a um compared to phenotype a whereas phenotype a people had reductions in their their total cholesterol but they also had no change in their apob so it seems as though a lowfat diet may be more beneficial for people that already are phenotype B already are people that are genetically predisposed to making small dense LDL so phenotype B people are you know predisposed to to um higher small dense LDL higher apob than phenotype a so a lowfat diet may not necessarily benefit people that are phenotype a that already sort of are not genetically predisposed to that but it may benefit some of the people that are phenotype B um and that would be something to sort of explore through some self-experimentation there study that showed people again that are phenotype B that are put on a high saturated fat diet had a significant increase in aob and ALS a significant increase in small and small and also total LDL particles so uh again it might this might mean that people that have a phenotype B type of lipid profile might not do well on a very high low carb high fat diet and that is I I also think this is also something we looking at the conflicting data this is there there there in there and um I think that that usually considered but if a phenotype is measured at the Baseline is this person phenotype a or phenotype B then you can kind of maybe say well maybe I phenotype B maybe I should not be doing so much of a high-fat low carb diet maybe I should be eating more fiber and eating more mono and polyunsaturated fats and and less of the high saturated fat and this was also asked by Bernardo who who asked if if there was any recommendations for a low carb diet with the problem again again of elevating apob due to the consumption of high quantities of fat and and he was talking about doing keto for years and his LDL going just through the roof and his apob um also going really high so again I would say many low carb or keto eaters do eat a lot of saturated fat and some of these people that are already apob to start with might consider doing a low saturated diet sort of fat like a low saturated fat diet um and to see how that affects lipids so low Dairy low cheese low butter low red meat low coconut oil low palm oil like basically very low or if if any of those replace those things with avocado oil with olive oil with avocados and oils and nuts and uh fat from like salmon you know and if you really really really want to do the keto version of it again like you can do a keto diet but instead of doing all the saturated fat you do mono and polyunsaturated fat and that would be something to to really check because there are again people that are already phenotype B that can increase their apob and do worse with a low carb high-fat diet particularly particularly when it saturated fat	Success

Why just 10 bodyweight squats every 45 minutes improves blood glucose regulation	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmkgYTtK9Vc	FoundMyFitness Clips 	If you are doing more of a vigorous type of exercise, going going again to lactate being a signaling molecule, lactate signals to your muscle to get more glucose in it, right? Because your muscles are using so much glucose that your body this in here so that I can keep making energy. And so what it does is it increases the production. It what it does. It increases the transllocation of what are called glucose 4 transporters, glute 4 transporters, which are just below the surface of the muscle. And lactate causes them to go up to the cell surface and kind of it opens up the floodgates for glucose to come in, right? And um this is really really beneficial because it is a way of getting glucose out of your circulation, bringing it to your muscle where you want it, right? So, um, the elevations in your glute 4 transporters last for like 48 hours.

if they is a disease but they don other identified diseases like cardiovascular disease or hypertension for example but they had been sedentary and um he he he put them on a 2-year exercise protocol which maybe you can discuss in a minute that was pretty intense and they looked their at the structure of their heart um before starting this protocol and then two years after this exercise protocol they looked at their hearts again and found that in many aspects like the the cardiac compliance and a variety of different parameters that they looked at the um size of the heart and the stiffness right the stretchiness of the heart in in many aspects had reversed in terms of of their Aging in fact it was comparable their hearts were comparable to looking more like 30y olds so they had essentially started this program and they they had these 50-year-old looking hearts and with respect to the the size and the compliance and then after this 2-year exercise protocol had reversed 20 years of cardiac aging which is pretty astonishing and inspirational in many respects so the protocol wasn necessarily easy though it wasn it was I think it wasn simple and I think something that everybody can kind of work up to and use as kind of a framework for how to structure their training so yeah as you mentioned this was a two-year study which again like if anybody with exercise physiology research like doing a 2-year exercise intervention is pretty incredible to get those participants to adhere to that regimen um I can participants were in that stud that right now but um I think it was you know somewhere around 200 maybe but they had a pretty pretty decent number of participants um but it involved a two-year commitment and they didn start them out right away doing everything that they were doing at the end but they scaled up their exercise gradually throughout the two years by year one they were kind of you know reaching their Peak exercise and then they maintain them for the second year and so what this involved was eventually doing about 5 to 6 hours of aerobic exercise or I guess it was total training per week was kind of five to six hours and what that involved was one of one Norwegian 4x4 session they actually at one point in the study just before the one year mark were doing two Norwegian 4x4 interval training sessions per week after the year they dropped it down to just one for the maintenance phase so one Norwegian 4x4 interval training session per week they did one session per week that was an hour or longer of their base pace so we could refer to that as lower to moderate intensity exercise Zone 2 training but it was like a 1 hour longer base Pace session and that could be just a bike a run a walk a hike something like that and then they did another 30 minute base Pace session per week so another Zone 2 exercise training session per week they also did a very light recovery day after all of their interval training session so the day after their Norwegian 4x4 they did a light active recovery day and then they did two resistance training exercise sessions per week so they were doing four aerobic training sessions two resistance exercise training sessions for the protocol and again they scaled up to that so this wasn 4x4 all at once but they progressively you know added that for the first year by the end of the second year they were maintaining that so they you know for two years did about five to six hours of exercise and like you mentioned they reversed their certain aspects of their cardiovascular structure by you know an estimated 20 years which is pretty astounding so yeah not an not an easy protocol but certainly not something like a highle elite endurance athlete is doing so it think could do and these were people who were 50 60 years old right it doable and I I many of those people continue to maintain that after the city was over knowing they revers their their heart Aging in some in terms of the structural aging of their heart by almost you know about 20 years I I feel like that would be very motivating for any 50 or 6y old to go wow I should keep this up this is like I want to you know I want I want my heart to stay like a 30-year-old right I mean that for me it would for sure it would be cool to see a follow-up study it would also just be cool to see if they didn that training they just totally stopped how long those benefits kind of lasted I think that would be interesting too and if I know Dr line and them had follow-up studies on some of the exercise training but it would be interesting to see for that one because I some of those benefits for a few years but the bed rest training study or just some of the studies on dra trining you see like kind of once you stop it very steep slope down back to where you were right especially with respect to your cardiio respiratory Fitness cly yeah um well a lot of This research so the this this intervention study you know we athletes looking at um I identifying you know I called it the dose but it really is in terms of frequency how many days a week you have to work out to kind of help maintain that youthful cardiac structure has led Dr LaVine to have what he calls his prescription for life with respect to exercise he does add a little bit of resistance training into that prescription for Life maybe we can talk a little bit about that and then talk about our own sort of our prescription for life like what our Protocols are his prescription for life was honestly one of I think my favorite uh takeaways from that episode because it was something that I felt was reasonable for everybody it most people are doing but not something that everyone couldn some point and so his prescription for life was very similar to kind of that 2-year training study that he cited he cited a sweet spot of four to 5 days per week of aerobic exercise or 5 to six hours per week of training that seems to be kind of The Sweet Spot performing interval training once per week and you know while in that study they Ed the Norwegian 4x4 you you could do any type of intervals we just mentioned a few other protocols the 10x1 the Tabata but really it just just do high some type of high-intensity interval training uh once per week after every high-intensity interval training session take a light recovery day LaVine definitely stressed the importance of recovery not only just for from a muscular perspective and your you know your autonomic nervous system but the cardiac and cardiovascular system also needs to recover you know when you stress it with a high heart rate you do increase some Arc of light cardiac damage and those also need time to recover so if you workout the next day you know doing 30 or more maybe minutes of very light activity that prescription his b one hour or longer base pay session per week was definitely kind of a foundation of his prescription and then the two or more resistance training session exercises per week which you know this is a very very practical approach and I think most people could you know maybe you should just take this and paste it up on your wall and use that to guide your training every week I think if those people did that they would be certainly in a a good place not only to I think age better but the way I see it I mean I look at lavine mirrors a lot of like what I do for my weekly training I mean the way I structure kind of my training I do I have one long run for every single week I do probably two easy zone two exercise sessions I do one high-intensity interval session and then um I try to strength train twice per week so I really follow lavine life I just kind of scale it up to meet the volume that I and so I something similar to that um well you doing what I would say on the tip of a week I probably exercising like 14 to 16 hours most of it do 14 hours of endurance training and then you know getting in like 1 to two hours of of strength training could probably Veer more towards the the strength training but again you know it trying to optimize for at this point in my life	Success
Follow this advice if you exercise less than 10 hours a week	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqiK8d6XtMg	FoundMyFitness Clips 	if you week I would say at least half of your training time should be vigorous exercise which means at least 80% max heart rate and that benefits and robust metabolic benefits including mitochondrial glucose regulation um as well	Success
The Best Sleep Hack Few People Know About - Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpHMFYl4Trc	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so the effects of heat and exercise let effects that we that we discussed in the past growth hormone and prolactin are they that are important in the regulation of slow wave activity regular sauna use is probably one of the most powerful stimuli that increases both growth hormone and prolactin so uh growth hormone hormone the effects of sa use on growth hormone levels really depend on many factors including duration temperature and frequency so for instance two 20 minute sauna sessions at 80 Dees C with 30 minutes of cooling period in between can double growth hormone levels um basically from their Baseline on the other hand 25 minute sauna sessions at about 100° C dry heat separated by a 30 minute cooling per period can cause a fivefold increase in growth hormone levels so there really remarked effect um when you do sort of repeated SAA use so repeated Sona use for example you do one uh you do two one hour sauna sessions at 80 degrees Celsius this is very very high uh for seven days in a row that leads to a 16-fold increase in growth hormone levels in men that it of principle example of how there is a dose dependent effect of heat stress on growth hormone and um and that something again that is temperature and duration dependent uh I don necessarily think it much heat stress that but I just wanted to highlight the effect that Sona use does have on growth hormone levels the heightened growth hormone levels typically last a few I would say more like a couple hours after son use they released after about hours they start to go down close to to to Baseline levels um it that combining exercise with heat stress or sauna use may also increase growth hormone levels even further than when you just do for example sauna Alone um and mostly it it probably has to do with the again your your elevations in core body temperature are going even higher than one than one alone right so let prolactin in one study um men that used the sauna they were in the sauna for an 80° Celsius sauna until they felt exhausted they had a tenfold increase in prolactin levels in another study women who did a 20 minute dry sauna twice a week had a 510 per increase in prolactin levels after each sauna session and similar to growth hormone prolactin levels lasted for a couple of hours um there are some other lifestyle factors in addition to sauna use potentially even hot baths again something that is going to elevate core body temperature exercise is one so exercise can also increase both growth hormone and prolactin I don the exact quantitative numbers and how much but they also do increase it and then um sexual activity is another one that also increases uh both uh prolactin so you know the effect effects of a growth hormone and prolactin um also again affect slow wave um deep sleep and so the idea is that you know doing doing these these activities a a a couple of hours so you want to make sure you right before bed because you you want to allow your body time to cool down and if you like like right before bed you might still be really hot and you won down unless you then you know perhaps get into a cold plunge or um do a do a cold shower to cool down but um doing it like you know a couple of hours before bedtime seems Seems like a good time it I do a lot of hot tubs in the evening and I do them a couple of hours before I I go to bed so um that Super interesting stuff that we haven talked about before uh heating activates warm sensitive neurons in the hypothalamus that promote slow wave activity in response to increased core body temperature and skin temperature yet again another potential mechanism behind why SAA use why hot baths um and even exercise which elevates cor Bon temperature May promote slow wave deep sleep and then um exercise combined with body Cooling and warm baths combined um you know with body cooling also um you know may help again to promote slow wave activity in deep Sleep Adriana is asking if I be helpful um so I I do think doing sauna in the evening time is can improve improve uh sleep and including deep sleep and for the reasons I mentioned there were many reasons I mentioned but again um you want to make sure you give yourself enough time for your body temperature to cool down after doing that sauna right um for me that is my my typical I typically get in either a hot tub or a sauna around 7:30 in the evening so I put my my son to bed at 700 and then 7:30 is time for my husband and I and we typically then will either do a hot tub or a sauna around 7:30 and my my natural bedtime is is about 9:30 so I go to bed around 9:30 so I typically do mine two hours before I go to bed and my husband as well he takes a little bit longer to cool down which is why he like he typically um I don down pretty um my my cool down time is is is not as long as his so two hours for me is is quite nice uh so making sure you before bed is important because it can it can have the opposite effect where it disturbs your sleep particularly because you were not able to to cool down um right right before going to bed and that is also very important	Success

You Should Know This About Sunscreen...	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yffB0Vwb54	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so yavon says hi Rhonda in your August 2023 Q&A you mentioned that titanium dioxide was toxic and we should avoid oral consumption I recently purchased cream for my face that contains titanium dioxide for sunscreen is this harmful when applied to the skin okay so um there considered safe and effective based on current data with respect to preventing sunburns protecting against UVA UVB radiation and those are zinc oxide and titanium dioxide up to a 25% concentration they don skin significantly there are also chemical types of sunscreens that are that have inefficient or um sorry insufficient data to show Effectiveness and you know even safety so um those there 12 of them they include Avo benzone um octano OCT octanoate oxybenzone and then there but those are the real main ones that you a lack of data with those chemicals that shows them to be safe or effective um it doesn unsafe it just means they recognized by the FDA uh and they they on those components so there are absorption concerns with oxybenzone octinoxate and avobenzone because they are systemically absorbed into the body after one use they can remain on the skin and in the blood for weeks after the last application um I find that concerning there a growing body of evidence again a lot of it of those dose sort of problems right that th that some of these chemicals can be endocrine disruptors so uh this would be homo salate avobenzone octanoate and oxybenzone those are the ones that are again um they circulation weeks after anapol one application that is in and of itself concerning particularly if it investigated as a potential endocrine dis disruptor the European commission findings in 2021 propos limiting the concentration of oxybenzone to 2.2% and Homo salate to 1 1.4% after EV evaluating their safety um I would say probably the safest bet is to avoid those those compounds in any sunscreens or face creams or makeups um just trying to avoid them in general because they potentially again they lingering they can linger in systemic circulation is enough to go okay we don what these are doing or how you know like the fact that they lingering in the circulation is um is enough so let dioxide I wanted to get those other compounds out there because there are a lot of sunscreen and chemical and we talk about some products in know in a minute but um just knowing that those those chemical ones are the main ones that like they circulation is is the concern um Titanium Dioxide it really serves as like that white pigment that you find in the creams Cosmetics it ultraviolet filter mainly in sunscreens and it really does um filter out UVB radiation there particle sizes of titanium dioxide so nano siiz titanium dioxide is used because larger particles leave a white residue so the smaller particles can scatter and absorb light more effectively um versus the larger sort of more white stuff though the nano titanium dioxide can increase the the safety concerns with the nano titanium dioxide is that there might be a a little bit more production of reactive oxygen species when exposed to UV radiation um however this effect is reduced if those particles are also coated with substances like silica um alumina um those those will prevent the titanium dioxide nanop particle from forming reactive oxygen species when in in it despite the smaller size like the Nano size the titanium dioxide does not significantly penetrate the Skin outermost layer but there was at least one study that showed very very Trace Amounts in the plasma and urine after sunscreen application so um the the FDA proposed that titanium dioxide is gener generally electronization concentration in sunscreens it the European commission also found so that both the FDA and the European commission both sort of agree um with respect to the consumer safety part there international Agency for research on cancer which did classify bulk form titanium dioxide so this would be like a powder as a possible inhalation carcinogen but that you like people in the manufacturing facilities that are that are putting it making it into cream form like they they run the risk of of inhaling it right they small particulate matter sort of thing um so let because it in sunscreens it um type of sunscreen um zinc oxide even in its Nano form does not penetrate the skin significantly any minor penet penetration that occurs um is not really thought to to any adverse health effects because zinc is something the body does you know we have endogenous like zinc a important component of you know all of our enzymes and many of our enzymes and stuff most penetration of zinc oxide happens in the skin folds um hair follicles is another one but not in the deeper skin layers they data that a vast there database that that shows zinc oxide is safe in a lot of products even like diap barash for for infants so zinc oxid is really thought to be one of the safe forms of sunscreen now com combining titanium dioxide with zinc oxide in sunscreens does provide a a broader range of protection against both UVA and UVB range so titanium dioxide is most effective against UVB rays while zinc oxide is most effective against the UVA rays the interaction with Organic ingredients some studies suggest that zinc oxide can degrade other organic ingredients in sunscreens potentially reducing their efficacy but I think we organic like some of those other ingredients uh we don use so some general notes on sunscreen composition there of titanium dioxide so titanium dioxide exhibits what properties so it it might cause other sunscreen ingredients to break down um and that so you know that with titanium dioxide when we versus inorganic sub sunscreens I know our brains are always like organic is best organic like but this is not the case here so organic are actually chemical ingredients that absorb UV UV rays so those are the things that we were talking about oxybenzone like that we want to avoid so really what they should call it is chemical I think but it organic inorganic is like the mineral type zinc oxide titanium dioxide those are the safer ones they reflect and Scatter UV rays rather than absorbing them and um inorganic actually so the zinc and and the titanium those stay on longer i being exposed to water water so like after swimming for example and there have been studies looking at that okay so there working group has rated sunscreens for health concerns so and for UVA UVB protection so a balance between health concerns and also having good protection balance and they have this whole color system where dark green is there health concerns and there UVA UVB protection light green um yeah and and light green is sort of similar and then as you get into orange and red you get high health concerns and poor UVA UVB protection a a lot of the um sunscreens they listed here so for example you can just go look it up like they skin mineral sunscreen lotion a variety of babo Botanical sunscreens true Botanical on there or these are all the good ones the dark green um rejuva minerals sheer daily sunscreen altit attitude sorry attitude mineral sunscreen another one a variety of those Beauty counter sunscreen AO skin care Solara Sun sunare clean freak nutrient boosted daily sunscreen so there list that you guys can find um from the environmental working group some of the sunscreens that uh I like and and use um include so I I I think I talked about this before cave is one that I I use a lot um and another one I use is the drunk elephant now that one really it concentration of the zinc oxide um I also use the the Kola CA but um I in fact I didn last summer um what I did use this last summer was the Cave the drunk elephant and um color science is another one and I it put on after it powder that I put on um after I like cereb on or something like that so those are so those are the ones that I have been my that have been my go-to sunscreens this past summer okay so just to summarize for the sunscreens um Titanium Dioxide zinc oxide are generally pretty I think safe to use in sunscreens they things to to get a broad spectrum of both UVA and VB protection um protecting against both skin aging and also um aging skin so so you know skin aging and also um sunburns and then um the chemical or the quote unquote organic sunscreens are the ones that the organic ingredients are not actually organic they those are the ones to avoid um we don really have good evidence that they safe they they stay around in circulation for a very long time even after one application my son Joe is asking in the chat what I use my son I use cave for him I really I really like the servey brand um and so that like my go-to for for my family basically and then um I think at the end of the day that that that take-home is going for the titanium and zinc titanium dioxide zinc oxide and um avoiding the chemical sunscreens uh as well	Success
6 Minutes of THIS Reduces Risk of Early Death By 40%	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcvBVxUqqoc	FoundMyFitness Clips 	Like even just doing it in your hotel, like I have this go-to routine I in my hotel room. Um it version of what CrossFitters call the Cindy workout. So I and then I do um 10 V-ups, which are kind of like a version of a situp. And then I do like 15 body weight squats and I do it over and over and over for like rest or no. No rest. No rest. You just keep 10 minutes non-stop. Yeah. I go from one to the next to the next. I mean, I a minute, but like the recovery is very short. Maybe 20 seconds, you know, like it your heart rate up the whole time. I keep my heart rate up the whole time. And usually, like in many cases, I only do 10 minutes like if it hotel room workout where I just need to do something quick and like get it. But it really works really. A Cindy workout. Yeah. Will that generate lactate also? Yeah, absolutely. And where do you feel that? Um, you can measure it, but like heart rate is a good way. Like if you if you wear my Apple Watch, right? And if you know, 85% of your max heart rate, 80 85%, you making lactate. You is it? What does it feel like to have lactate in the body? Burns. It burns. Does it burn like in the muscle group or more in the lungs? I feel it in the muscle group when I doing things like body weightight squats or biking or push-ups. Yeah. I mean, you feel it. You It feels like it hurts. It mean, even Yeah. You know, doing bodyweight squats are great. There study that came out, I don was like 6 months ago or something that showed doing 10 body weight squats every 45 minutes throughout like an 8 hourish workday was better for glucose regulation. So this is your blood sugar regulation than a 30 minute walk. And I timed myself. It took me 27 seconds to do 10 body weight squats. And you know, so these are like exercise snacks, right? These are things that you do. It sedentary time. So, when you in your office for hours at a time, you because there that have come out over the past few years showing that being sedentary, I always used to think of being sedentary as like you And sometimes I still use that word, you sedentary, you And that study and you a group, right? But but you can be sedentary and still be physically active. So like I do a lot of sitting when I researching something, reading studies, you know, I doing a podcast, I multiple hours, right? That is sedentary time. And that has been shown to be an independent risk factor for certain cancers. Wow. meaning independent of your physical activity even which is interesting because it you think wow exercise not getting up and doing you know a twominut 3 minute like you know you do some high knees or you do some burpees or some squats or something where you physical activity and you just do it for a couple of minutes and you break up your workday. It interesting is there showing that you so people there exercise snacks in a structured way like I just said, right? Where you 45 minutes I body weightight squats. structured exercise snack. Well, some people have unstructured exercise snacks. So, let fourth floor of an office building. They walk the stairs. They sprint the stairs. Oo. They sprint the stairs. They get their heart rate up, right? Yeah. So, so there Sprinting. Yeah. Yeah. Large. Not just taking walking the stairs. No, it still good to walk the stairs, too. I should Okay, let me let me let me define sprint because if we coach sprint, no, they a coach sprint would be. What I mean is they They running, right? They going faster than just walking. They not they sense of the word. Thank you for pointing that out because people might might be like, you sprinting. No way. Um, and you They the stairs. They up the stairs and their heart rate getting pretty high. Um, and this is this has been measured because there been large studies that have put accelerometers on people where they measure their heart rate. And they found that people that do anywhere from between two to six minutes of this sort of unstructured type of vigorous exercise, they have a 40% lower cancer related mortality. 40% lower all cause mortality. So dying from all causes 50% lower cardiovascular related mortality mortality. This is incredible because this was even in people that identified themselves as non-ex exercisers. In other words, they don They don just do this. This is how they exercise. They incorporate this, you know, lifestyle. It intermittent lifestyle activity, um, physical activity, vila. And it it doing two to six minute. Now when I gave you those statistics that was the six minute that was the upper end. So the six minutes a day but six minutes a day who doesn mean why why does it seem like when sometimes I hear people say I I hours or set an alarm every hour at my desk and I going to do 10 push-ups, right? or or 20 sit-ups or whatever it might be. 10 air squats. And yeah, it seems so easy to do it for 60 seconds five times a day, right? Five minutes. 60 seconds five times a day. Why is it that so few people do it consistently? They might try it for a day or two, but then they just stop to do five minutes, 60 seconds, five times a day. Why does it seem so hard for people to be consistent with this style of movement? Yeah, I think it down to um you know like maybe maybe it disrupts their flow too much. They the middle of something working and so you bring up a good point and that is you really do you have to find something that you will do consistently. It very important and you know because exercise is it has to be part of your personal hygiene every day right like brushing your teeth like you it add-on you don and I know I lot on resistance training on doing a lot of high-intensity interval training also getting my aerobic exercise and it it become a priority for you. Well, I always been sort of a aerobic exercise like a runner, you know. So, I had that aerobic exercise part of my life, you know. I physically active, but never lifting. Huh. But lifting lifting has been I would say I started making it a priority about a year and a half maybe a year and a half ago but like maybe like a year ago and then really about nine months ago getting really serious about it and that happened when I started getting a coach.

The greater the exercise intensity, the greater the myokine release	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yMNCmTIm8I	FoundMyFitness Clips 	in addition to lactate exercise intensity also affects the muscle ability to produce other compounds known as myocin so these are molecules released from muscle cells that signal to nonmuscle tissues that the body is physically active you know so again it similar to what we with lactate myocin have anti-inflammatory they have anti-cancer effects they also participate in metabolic pathways involveed and fat oxidation glucose uptake um they play a role in you know in in again cancer biology as well so generally speaking the greater the intensity of exercise the greater the mocine release again it on the muscles and the the muscles are then forced to adapt and one of the adaptations is releasing myokines	Success
How can you improve deep sleep?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ffgunxpUd0	FoundMyFitness Clips 	put out a video on this that affects deep sleep that modifiable lifestyle factor is heat exposure pretty close to bedtime not like immediately before bed like you want to give your body a little bit of time to cool down but a couple of hours before bed I mean even even an hour before bed uh is I think one of the best ways to improve deep sleep avoiding alcohol around like like any time like like 4 hours four 4 hours before bedtime avoiding alcohol I think also definitely plays a role in um not disrupting your deep sleep and actually believe it or not having a consistent sleep schedule like when you you know just staying up later on weekends and stuff like that like you will miss deep sleep because it really is it that consistent sleep schedule and that that those early the early hours of your of your sleep is is when you getting a lot of your deep sleep	Success

Do this after drinking alcohol to maximize detoxification	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-4s3oBeHy0	FoundMyFitness Clips 	next question was from Anika who says hi Rhonda could you please share your personal strategies for minimizing alcohol rated harms on the body protective supplements gut liver brain sleep food exercise before and after a social evening as I mentioned you know I think a big one after would be liposomal glutathione and nfal cysteine um those have both been shown to um help the liver sort of you know function better with respect to to um detoxing you know alcohol then there is zinc which you you excreting about 50% more zinc and by vamin C so that um these are also important after and then um I think also very very important before during after hydration um probably electrolyte hydration after as well and uh exercise and you know exercise and sauna but particularly important to hydrate if you are going to be doing the sauna and exercise because you will be then losing a lot of the minerals and and water so you have to like it extra extra extra hydration that of like that typical protocol	Success
Rhonda Patrick's top 5 supplements	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDpF1X3hjtg	FoundMyFitness Clips 	I really think omega-3 fatty acids so you want to have at least you know 1.5 to two grams a day to get you to a high omega-3 index which has been shown in studies if you supplement with that dose vitamin D supplement anywhere between 2 to 4,000 I use a day you want to make sure your levels are around 40 nanograms per milliliter between 40 and 60 two very important ones a multivitamin really I think is important because it covers all the bases a lot it basically insurance and then I gotten back on the sulfurane train I take asacol which has really been published in many many different studies It two of those a day because I think sulfurane is very beneficial for a lot of reasons one it increases glutathione the the body and brain antioxidant system it also it it it detoxes a lot of compounds that we exposed to and then magnesium would be would be the last one so magnesium you know is a an essential mineral that important for over 300 different enzimatic reactions including repairing damage to our DNA which is essential for not only cancer prevention but just normal function of our cells	Success
Tired?

Is this the most powerful supplement no one's talking about?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYwXBVEFn50	FoundMyFitness Clips 	there have been studies in China more than one study showing that consuming sulfurane about it about 40 micro moles of sulfurane causes the excretion of benzene to increase within 24 hours by 60% Benzene is a known carcinogen it also in addition to air pollution it found in cigarette smoke any plant burning material fires right so this is very relevant people like in Southern California and Los Angeles where there a lot of wildfires and the air quality very bad there Benzene is a carcinogen so this is really big you can aine you can and I do supplement with it so um I take a supplement called avmacol so I take two tablets a day and the reason I do that is because I also want to increase glutathione which is a antioxidant a very powerful antioxidant in our body there have been clinical studies showing that people taking sulfurane increase their glutathione levels in their plasma and also in their brain so in the brain I mean it it function for brain aging everything like that so I take anywhere between two to four AMAC calls a day	Success
Do sauna blankets work as well as the sauna?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpe8fZ-0fvs	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so while direct comparison in the scientific literature between traditional saunas and sauna blankets are essentially non-existent um the principles behind the benefits of heat therapy suggest that you could potentially use sauna blankets and other heat modalities to offer some similar advantages I think a good way to gauge that would be to wear a wearable device that measures your heart rate so heat stress mimics moderate aerobic exercise your heart rate goes up to 120 130 beats per minute in the sauna when you start to get your heart rate up to about 110 from heat stress you should feel pretty uncomfortable and ready to stop so um I usually push past that and get up to 120 beats per minute but I think if you doing this on a blanket um wearing having that wearable device is a good way to kind of um figure out if you getting you know heat stress that Moder intensity aerobic exercise	Success

Should You Supplement With Melatonin? - Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEoowx6m0gk	FoundMyFitness Clips 	all right you guys ready for a really deep dive um I was this was a lot of fun and I really have to admit that there a big personal interest in me answering this question because I personally do supplement with melatonin so Michael asked Can you discuss the role of melatonin as an antioxidant and the possible benefits versus risks of it as an oral antioxidant supplement and this is an interesting I thought this was a really interesting question because most people when they ask about melatonin they talk about it in the context of sleep like how melatonin can improve sleep does it improve sleep and um not a lot of people are are aware that melatonin is actually a very it is a very powerful antioxidant but not in the same way as as Vitamin E or vitamin E is so we a minute um generally speaking just overall summary uh you know melatonin does have have a pretty strong antioxidant effect and there you know there showing that even can be protective against radiation at least some very small studies with cancer patients undergoing radiochemotherapy however we did discuss back in Q&A number 44 that this balance between oxidation and reduction is very important and so we about this um as we as we go into a little bit deeper of a dive but I just kind of want to give you guys an overview and then of course melatonin can affect some aspects of sleep so we well all right so um in studies where melatonin doses were up to 20 milligrams a day which is definitely on the very high end of the dose range for several months it very rare mild adverse effects and really the biggest adverse effects with people taking 20 milligrams of melatonin a day for several months is grogginess in the morning um sleepiness maybe a headache or feeling like cold so melatonin also plays a role in regulating body temperature so it does sort of lower core body temperature so that that could be quote unquote adverse to some people with you know very high doses of melatonin supplementation there evidence that my team and I could find that taking melatonin as a supplement can affect your endogenous production of melatonin so melatonin is a hormone produced in the penal gland when I say it affecting it and it activation and and deactivation of a variety of gen gen and so um it affecting a lot of biological processes not just sleep but um there evidence that taking melatonin at least you know in terms of the longer studies that have been done affects a person melatonin so um that hasn has not been observed yet um there been a few animal studies with extremely high doses I mean we supera physiological well over the 20 milligrams melatonin which is already a high dose um that has shown melatonin receptor what desensitization so in other words The receptors are less sensitive to the Melatonin hormone um but again human Studies have not shown that prolonged use of melatonin causes tolerance so people don tonin it doesn higher and higher higher dose which would be indicative of receptor desensi desensitization but that case um which I find very encouraging of course there there melatonin um and other drugs that are important to consider um which we we to talk a little bit about its antioxidant activity um it because melatonin is is also what lipophilic like vitamin E and so um it has antioxidant activity in the cell membranes and um it also is activating glutathione which is lipophilic as well so it has direct and indirect antioxidant activity um it activating a variety of important stress response antioxidant genes so um these are this is been shown actually in a variety of randomized control trials melatonin increases our endogenous production of glutathione superoxide dismutase a variety of different glutathione enzymes like glutathione peroxidase glutathione reductase like these are really important antioxidant enzymes it activates the Nrf2 pathway so this is the same pathway that sulfurane activates as well uh it human studies to reduce biomarkers of lipid peroxidation so that know that LDL and stuff that gets oxidized so lipid peroxid peroxidations reduce um protein carbony so that proteins being oxidized um which plays a role in just you know proteins not working as well it also plays a role in protein aggregation so there that even taking higher doses in fact um have a more pronounced antioxidant effect in human studies that really suggests melatonin definitely has a very strong antioxidant effect in in humans and um it action so um you know it so this is kind of the indirect where it it and melatonin 2 receptors um and that how it so that activity the direct action is actually melatonin itself being able to react with um reactive oxy species so the structure of melatonin itself it aromatic indle which just that structure itself sort of helps buffer um some of the reactive oxygen species so it can in in some ways act a little bit as a direct antioxidant like vitamin C can like vitamin E can um but but I I would say the major way that it antioxidant is its indirect action by actually just activating through um these you know the the Melatonin one and melatonin receptors activating all these different antioxidant genes that we have so you might think oh wow well it reducing all this oxidative stress that with anything you always want to balance right and um while a lot of people are familiar with oxidative stress and how it because you get oxidized lipids and proteins and you can get DNA damage and mitochondrial damage and all that um when you have too much of the other side you know the the the antioxidant effect you can have what stress and it go too overboard with that reductive stress unfortunately there easy way to measure this in humans and it Technical and I would say Pro protocol problems even just doing it in animal studies as well do you have to measure like the NAD to nadh ratio rather than just measuring like NAD levels right so a lot of people are interested in these precursors to NAD or NAD boosters like nicotinamide riboside nitin nicotinamide mononucleotide um and and you human studies where you know NAD is directly measured it just measure NAD but when you just like for that ratio of NAD to nadh it and um it that sort of balance and so until we have more sensitive assays I don that we measurement of reductive stress and everything I how how do you know if you you know too much or you know having this type of reductive stress we just it speculation at this point there evidence that it that are taking let of melatone in a day um because we don really know how much of this oxidative stress is even going on and there probably a very um an age dependent lifestyle dependent as well mechanism I mean the more oxidative stress you have the more you need to counter it as well so um it where you kind of want to be a little bit cautious where you you don go overboard on the antioxidants either now the question also um there was a bit a hint of radio protection so there been a lot of animal studies that show melatonin um can help protect against ionizing radiation so that causing DNA damage in all sorts of problems um a very there few randomized control trials that have found melatonin supplementation can actually mitigate some of the side effects associated with radiochemotherapy in cancer patients so um it reduced fatigue so there analysis that combined a variety of randomized control trials together and it reduced the relative risk of fatigue by about 63% it reduced neurotoxicity by 81% now that pretty um intriguing and then it reduced um a variety effects on blood cells as well so thrombocytopenia um and again um it seemed to have a little a little bit of a protective effect on um you know just just blood cells in general so uh that not a lot of people digging up in those those studies um those old studies but you know again there a ton of evidence out there this is just looking at what there actually is you know tons of there studying this that there effect uh on blood pressure so there been several different again meta analysis of randomized control trials and looking at melatonin supplement supplementation on blood pressure and there does seem to be a general blood pressure reduction so there different randomized control trials that found melatonin sulation anywhere between 3 to 10 milligrams a day um caused a significant decrease in blood pressure so systolic blood pressure on average was about 3.5 millim of Mercury lower and then diastolic blood pressure was about 3 or so millimeters of mercury lower uh there blood pressure so there studies looking at you know during nighttime your blood pressure changes it was found that taking a controlled release of melatonin about two to three milligrams a day lowered the systolic blood pressure by about six milligrams of mercury and diastolic by 3.5 so this was um a little bit even higher than just general blood pressure and then there like people with me metabolic syndrome and um it seemed as though there was really substantial redu um blood pressure reductions in people with met metabolic syndrome in um in a couple of studies with melatonin supplementation so um again very interesting that melatonin is affecting blood pressure as well and then there a variety of other just General Health you know aspects that have been looked at with randomized control trial so things like surgical outcomes interestingly anxiety is reduced um it was lower in people that were taking melatonin versus a placebo um pregnancy so it seems to there you know a few studies looking at the effect of melatonin on fertility and it seems that uh it ovicides it seems to improve embryo quality um and you know it probably linked to its antioxidant activity if I were to guess but it really known exactly why melatonin know improving some fertility aspects there say results with metabolic disease I talked about blood pressure um but you know melatonin does affect insulin release and so it why eating late at night is not such a great idea so you know you don taking taking a lot of melatonin then um eating a meal probably is not a good idea again we mentioned that we talked a little bit about cancer and it seems as though it seems to help with particularly with um radio chemotherapy there analysis looking at that remission of cancer has been shown to be improved and then um survival at one year is also improved and again you know this is we need more studies to really make a pretty I would say a conclusive statement but it nonetheless and then again with the adverse effects the most frequent is just you know grogginess sleep daytime sleepiness sometimes headaches uh and then hypothermia is another one there a few that serious you know side effects that can happen in some people but it really kind of not not very common looking at high dose so anywhere between 20 to 25 milligrams of melatonin in a day a metanalysis of several different randomized control trials found that um in adults over the age of 30 years old that took that high dose for six months really there wasn you know detectable adverse effects or withdrawals or you know anything like that so children and Adolescence is a little different I mean it it you know if melatonin is going to affect puberty or hormonal like you know systems and stuff and so obviously like that would be a different you know a much more cautious situation you know adults adults at the age of 40 is when they they start to make less melatonin just endogenously that starts to really sort of precipes start to go down and then as you get older 50s and 60s it really goes down um so you know most most children in adolescents if they don genetic problem shouldn much of a need to take melatonin and then I mentioned drug interactions I would say that be to obviously speak with your physician if if you supplementing because it can interact with a variety of different prescriptive drugs like for example blood thinners and others so that um to keep in mind as well um but other than that you know I mentioned the endogenous production it doesn really supplementation with melatonin doesn endogenous production of it at least in the clinical studies that have been done um you know couple of months later you making the same normal amount of melatonin after taking melatonin for several months and then stopping so um you know the receptor desensi desensitization while I think a lot of the fear of the Melatonin has come from a couple of inv vitro studies where you dump melatonin on cells in in a Petri dish and that affects it but that really not relevant and and then also like a couple of again animal studies that are like just not even the the dose is not even translatable to humans um that have shown a little bit of desensitization but like there hasn been any human studies that have shown evidence of that again like I said most people they actually have to increase their melatonin dose as they continue taking it which is what you would expect to happen if there was desens desens um desensitization occurring so that of the Roundup of melatonin um I continue to be really interested in it and I like I said I do I do actually supplement with melatonin as well um but my my biggest concern again would be the reductive stress I you I I take it at night like most people would so I mean you effect of exercise which is always a concern as well but you know it I so far I melatonin supplementation is really bad Matt Miller is asking in the chat how much Melatonin I supplement with and if I melatonin supplements contain up to 400% more than advertised I mean that always a a concern so my my go-to always is consumer lab because um they do a lot of that third- party testing and they do measure the amounts the concentrations of the active you know ingredient that supposed to be in there you know so there randomly buying a melatonin supplement off Amazon for example that you may be getting a melatonin dose dramatically higher or dramatically lower than what you think you be getting something else mixed with it so that I mean generally speaking yes I think that supplements and so um it to verify I I take pure encapsulations um I was taking quite a high dose of 20 milligrams and then um now I still high um but I go I I I going back and forth between that mostly because I think I just had a lot of the 20 and I was specifically taking it because it seemed to resolve any night tears that I can get sometimes um and that seems to be the case with like a higher dose but I do think I like the 10 milligram dose better than the 20 with respect to like not being groggy when I wake up so I think there of you know personal preference in there as well um but so that my my my dose James is asking in the in the chat yes my night terrors like the Melatonin really seems to like my N Night Terrors mostly happen when I really stressed and um but but even if I with that and so it wonder if there is a neuroprotective effect going on in my brain where the stress is causing like this oxidative stress um and that linked to somehow linked to my my my night tears that I get and melatonin kind of helps because it sleep I mean it does affect my sleep latency so I do fall sleep a little bit earlier than I otherwise would without it um but not much so it it it I you know it my um brain during sleep and um again I think that I think that it is a neuroprotective supplement and um you know I I don I I evidence that it you	Success

Low in THIS Nutrient? ItÂs Taking Years Off Your Life	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0lU3qVEUuU	FoundMyFitness Clips 	So you asked about deficiencies and what are some of the common ones? Well, omega-3. Okay. So about 80% of the world population does not meet the requirements for omega-3 fatty acids. Yeah, that what your body cell membranes, your brain, you know, nervous tissue. It inflammation. I mean, it critical to everything. Exactly. Um and there Bill Harris. So I professor at the fatty acid research institute with Harris and so I involved in a lot of research on omega-3 and um he studies that are quite convincing. So looking at the omega-3 index. So this is the omega-3 levels in red blood cells which is sort of like a long-term marker for omega-3 because they take about what what does the index actually measure? It ame it it measures the EPA and DHA levels along with a bunch of other fatty acids if if you but it the red blood cell membrane which gives you the index and you want a certain number. Exactly. So he studies using like the Framingham cohort. So these are large um cohort studies uh with a lot of people and he looked at the omega-3 index and correlated it with all cause mortality. So, dying from a a variety of different um causes. And what he people that have what is defined as a high omega-3 index, so this would be 8% or more, okay, have a 5-year increased life expectancy compared to people that have a 4% omega-3 index, which is low. And actually, the average omega-3 index of the US population is about 5%, pretty close to that 4%. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that function health labs. Yeah. That to see when we see that 5yearc increase life expectancy. If you think about Japan, Japan who eat they eat a lot of seafood in Japan. Yeah. Their omega-3 index on average is like 10%. So they above the high the 8%. Yeah. Yeah. But their mercury levels are probably also very high. What you say that, Mark. Um there studies like in pregnant women. Yeah. You probably remember this that decades ago, women were advised to stop eating fish because of the high mer mercury and um that actually had a detrimental sort of effect because omega-3 fatty acids, as you mentioned, they for the brain, very important for um neurode development. And there have now been a whole host of studies that have come out showing that omega-3 fatty acids actually protect from any potential mercury toxicity in the developing fetus. And in fact, um, there that were born to mothers that had a high level of omega-3 and high mercury. Those children had scored higher on intelligence tests. So, IQ scores even like even if so, so high mercury was actually biomarking intelligence. It wasn omega-3. That you get the point. Although other in in Japan, they eat a lot of seaweed, which uh and seaweed is a chelator for heavy metals. So, Oh, is it? So is green tea, by the way. I think garlic garlic the beta beta mar um mercaptain and garlic as well. Um, but back to the omega-3 and this study I was talking about from Bill Harris is so interesting because he also, this is a huge cohort of people, the Framingham, there all sorts of lifestyles including smoking. And so he did a subanalysis looking at smokers and non-smokers and their omega-3 index. And what Bill and his associates and colleagues found was that smokers with a high level of omega-3, so they had a high omega-3 index of 8%. They had the same mortality as non-smokers with a low omega-3 index. Okay, everybody, this does not mean you can smoke and take your own fish oil pills. So, don you like smoking, right? I mean, if you look, that right? If you look at the graph of this, I mean, it perfect. Yeah. Perfect. Fascinating. So, having a low omega-3 index had the same mortality risk as smoking. Okay. So, we population is in that category. Yes. Yes. And, you know, there whole host of randomized control trials looking at omega-3s being protect cardio, right? So, they important for cardiovascular health. Um, triglycerides. Yeah. There prescription omega-3s which you can pay much much more than you would if you go get a basic omega-3 for lowering triglycerides as a therapies, right? Yeah. And you mentioned inflammation, you know, so this is another thing they do, they play a major role in lowering inflammation. And so that of aging in in many ways, brain aging, um you know, cardiovascular aging. So, omega-3s are, I would say, one of the most profound lifestyle factors that can play a role in um in negating inflammation aside from Exercise.	Success

This Simple Practice Mimics Exercise, Improves Cardiovascular Health, and Fights Depression	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP3spwVz-O4	FoundMyFitness Clips 	deliberate heat exposure and when we say deliberate heat it know you environment right so you to do something like a hot sauna a steam room a hot bath something that is you know either either the ambient temperature of the room is elevated or the the water and your body is like you know submerged in the water right and um what is that doing well that is actually kicking on a physiological response that is in in many ways very similar to moderate intensity aerobic exercise because when you are when you to this deliberate heat exposure when you increases in temperature you elevating your core body temperature which is what activity your heart rate increases your plasma flow increases um your stroke volume increases all these things that are happening during physical exercise are happening during this deliberate heat exposure and so there there say mimicking effect of moderate intensity aerobic exercise and there actually been studies that have compared that head-to-head so they being on a stationary cycle doing you know not not anything crazy but like 120 watts and then comparing that to sitting in a sauna for 20 minutes doing each of those for 20 minutes and they were comparable in terms of uh heart rate elevation during the physical activity or during the heat exposure um the changes in blood pressure during the activity and then the improvements after so blood pressure improved after the stationary cycling blood pressure improved after the deliberate heat exposure heart rate resting heart rate improved after the stationary cycling and resting heart rate improved after the deliberate heat exposure so in other words um there effects with respect to uh you know cardiovascular adaptations that are occurring during deliberate heat exposure and um so that sort of I I think important framework to think about is there is a mimicking effect and why is that important well certainly it are disabled people that can run or a jog or even get on a bike right and and so um it that population of people but it important for the population I think of people that won for a run or they would rather just feel like they at the very least or maybe people that are just so ad adverse there are people are so adverse to cardiovascular exercise that if you can just get them into a sauna and we can talk about parameters in a minute but like if you can get them into something that of at least mimicking the moderate intensity cardiovascular EX exercise and they those cardiovascular adaptations that they would get with at least a little mild to moderate intensity exercise that long run as well and then it beneficial for people that are Physically Active you might go well why is that um and so there so being Physically Active like being aerobically active doing aerobic exercise one of the the best benefits is it improves what called cardiorespiratory Fitness and um and that say one of the best biomarkers of longevity like like concrete things that you can measure it measuring something called V2 Max it the maximum amount of oxygen you can take in during maximal exercise and cardiovascular exercise improves that particularly if you high-intensity um exercise training things that are like high-intensity interval training for example is one of the best ways to improve it especially if you at least a minute but what is that there people so there studies observational data looking at people that just routinely exercise or people that routinely exercise and do the sauna and then they they measured these you know there there was measurements of cardiorespiratory Fitness and it was pretty clear that people that routinely exercised and routinely did the sauna had a better cardio respiratory Fitness than people that only routinely exercise in other words there was a there was a benefit to do sauna on top of the exercise right and then there studies where it to take people give them an exercise workout uh I think it was a stationary bike and then right after that exercise workout they passive recovery or they into a sauna and recover for 15 minutes and um there was I forgot how many weeks it was something like on the order of four weeks or something like that um they measured cardiorespiratory Fitness and a variety of other biomarkers like lipids like LDL total cholesterol blood pressure things like that and while there was improvements obviously with exercise the ones that did exercise plus the sauna had an even greater Improvement in their cardiorespiratory Fitness so their V2 Max was improved even more than exercise alone they also had greater improvements in blood pressure and greater improvements in their lipid numbers and things like that so there was every reason to add uh deliberate heat exposure on top of exercise as well I want to pause here first second for two reasons one you the reason I have a sauna I think I first came across your work and you had this like 70 page website on the benefits of a sauna and I remember like skimming the first like three pages of it going I really need a sauna and so you have a sauna but when we say doing the sauna like what does that mean in terms of temperature in terms of duration is a hot tub the same as the sauna talk to me about that so a lot of the studies that have been done on sauna have come out of Finland where they saunas which are generally speaking it it would be what I would call like it it an electric heater with some rocks that are hot um in in Finland they often use water and they poured on the hot rocks and so there any anywhere between 10 to 20% hum humidity so a lot of the observational studies and intervention studies showing like I just mentioned one about BO2 Max improvements blood pressure improvements um they lot of those parameters used generally speaking are um you know regular saunas of about 175 degrees Fahrenheit and 10 to 20% humidity the average time spent in this sauna is about 20 minutes for the for the benefits to really be I would say that robust and and then that there often do you do it and so there have been a variety of studies that have looked at all cause mortality so D so so you know dying early from all causes that are non accidental and then looking at cardiovascular related mortality mortality like dying from a heart attack for example um and people that are more more frequently using the sauna it dose dependent effect so people that use the sauna for example two to four sorry two to three times a week have a 24% lower all cause mortality compared to people that only use it one time a week but people that use it four to seven times a week have a 40% lower all cause mortality compared to people that only use it one time a week so in other words it seems like the minimal effective dose to get the most robust effect would be four times a week and the same goes for other parameters so cardiovas dying from you know cardiovascular related mortality it 50% lower PE in people that use the sauna four to seven times a week compared to one time a week whereas if you a week it frequency matters as well and when I said duration in the sauna it important so those studies were also done looking at okay let are only staying in the sauna for 11 minutes versus like greater than 19 minutes so like 20 minutes right um they didn all sorry in cardiovascular related mortality if they only stayed in for 11 minutes it was much less it was a little bit like it was improved but it was not 50% so the the temperature and the duration and the frequency those are three parameters that are important with respect to to using you know a regular hot sauna and when I say I the reason I say regular hot sauna is because another type of sauna that infrared saunas and infrared saunas do not get as hot so they the ambient air around you they working through another mechanism and they inside your body around and and sort of heating you up in a different way and you do sweat a lot and you do get your you can get your core body temperature elevated particularly if you stay in quite a long time but um you do have to to keep in mind that you can those parameters and go I stay in 145 degree infrared sauna for only 20 minutes because that those finished Studies have shown because they respect to um uh you know the the the ways that they there have been studies that have compared for example like a head-to-head comparison of like a regular hot sauna versus infrared sauna and looking at things like blood pressure improvements and if if you minutes like the same amount of time in each you pressure improvements from an infrared sauna which makes sense it right you elevate that Cor to get your heart rate elevated and anyone that I I you know I know and also wearing a heart rate monitor right you can wear like your Fitbit or your whoop or whatever in into the sauna and you when your heart rate starts to get elevated and it 20 minutes in an infrared Zona now um so that that increase the duration in there for me I have to stay in like 45 like I Minutes is more like the duration that I would have to stay in to start to get more elevations in my heart rate um again that intensity exercise uh but there that have been measured so for example um we haven but heat Chuck proteins these are one of the adaptations that happen when your body is forced um to increase its core body temperature whether that physical activity which is making you hot making you sweat or deliberate heat exposure and Studies have been done looking at people that go into a relatively hot SAA so this would be 163 degree Fahrenheit sauna if they stay in for 30 minutes they can raise their heat truck proteins about 50% over their Baseline levels and heat shock proteins um have a lot of beneficial effects so they they proteins from aggregating and forming plaques uh in the brain in the vascular system they also are very important for preventing muscle atrophy and there have now been studies that have been done showing that um just even locally heating um a person they have been done have been like they called immobilization studies where they an event like let an older person goes into the hospital they have the flu whatever they they period of weeks and so they their muscles and their muscles were atrophying at a rapid rate right well um Studies have been done where if you if you apply even just local heat that you can cut that disuse atrophy by as much as 40% and and animal Studies have looked at um mechanistically they repeated this and they has largely it increase in heat shock proteins so heat shock proteins are a good biomarker for heat stress so is increased heart rate we talked about like you to 110 120 you can get up to 120 beads per minute um sitting in the hot sauna and that your core body temperature is being elevated your your body is doing that work so um you asked about hot baths and there have been studies looking at hot baths and heat chog proteins and you can elevate your heat trog proteins um by by being submerged from the shoulders down for about 20 minutes in about 104 degree Fahrenheit water which is a standard hot tub level so U hot tub heat level is what I would should say so um I do think there are comparable effects with respect to the modality of heat exposure whether we talking about a hot sauna or a hot bath perhaps an infrared sauna again the duration the parameters will change the parameters will change but I do think that you can find comparable effects there are personal preferences at play like I I like both hot tub and hot sauna I find that I cheat more with a hot tub like I out when I get really hot when I the sauna like there right like like if I if I then I have to get out and then I oh I no I in the hot tub I don giving up when I arms out because you know so there reasons this is my personal sort of anecdote but there to I I like to do both but I really like to do the sauna because I feel like I so much less likely to cheat with respect to like making sure I don any limbs out or anything like that um as well so um yeah I mean and then of course there benefits to using the heat exposure um we talked about the cardiovascular benefits there like your IMM system yeah so there was um there have been some observational data studies as well looking at like pneumonia risk it something like 40% lower in people that use the sauna four to seven times a week and there have been a lot of really early studies on um again these are coming out of Finland where there humidity so you know there involved as well and um you know you you cardiovascular system I mean the lungs are affected and I don the mechanisms and I don they some sort of benefit on the lugs and also just the immune system as well it seems like immune changes happen as well and it when I weather or even if I am sick it because I find it pelaton I I get in there and I Steam and I feel so much better it like uh there grandfather used to tell me like sweat it out and there true to that when you are feeling sick well absolutely so when you are sick you get a fever and the fever response your your core body temperature is elevated and heat shock proteins are activated and heat shock proteins do play a role in what is called the in in the innate immune response so that response that you have when you seen a virus or bacterial pathogen before it antibody response it let proteins do play a role in that and um when you are getting in the sauna when you heat exposure you are elevating your core body temperature and so the fever response is a very important part of um our our our immunes our immunes way our immune systems way of um dealing with the pathogen right it we get a fever for a reason and so um there there right between the deliberate heat exposure and the um the fever response and it reason I actually got into the sauna way back in like 2009 had nothing to do with cardiovascular effects or you know even the effects on on muscle mass but um it was the effects on my mood and that was you know I was very stressed out in graduate school and this was like 2009 and I was using the sauna every morning before I would go into the lab and do my experiments that would often fail it was very stressful and um I started to notice quite quickly that I was able to handle that stress a lot better I was just I was like I wasn depressed after and so like down and anxious and um and that like something is going on here like it was very noticeable for me and so then I started to look into the literature and come up with my own sort of theories which um I connecting the dots where I I actually did publish on this back in 2022 it the sauna it use can increase health span and I think it has to do with when you get into the sauna again you the same effects that cardiovascular exercise and so you a lot of endorphins as well those are the feel-good opioids that we release in our brain um but what interesting is that also um the opposite of endorf is called dorphin so it an an opioid that we release in our body and um it that feeling so like when you when you you is making dorphin and dorphin is um part of what it does is it cools down your body so it okay you elevating your core body temperature and so the Adaptive response is okay we need to cool down somewhat dorphin plays a role in that but it also is what responsible for that uncomfortable feeling when you want to get out um and what was super interesting um that I sort of dove into at the time was that when you release dorphin you um you have a response a feedback loop in your brain where dorphin causes your body to make more receptors to the Feelgood endorphin and it sensitizes those those receptors and it makes sense if you think about it right when your body is not feeling good and you feeling it wants to make sure that it going to counter that with feeling good and so um you you start to like the next time you make endorphins from a hug from your child or a joke you laugh at whatever you better because you sensitive to those to those endorphins from those it receptors and that you increase endorphin anyways that was a sort of you know I would say rabbit hole I went down many many years ago but now there out so work from CH Dr Charles Rison and now um his prote Dr Ashley Mason who I Foundation has funded a lot of her research um that using infrared saunas it it it the head out and so your whole body is in it and um those the the research that previously done in her Mentor Dr Charles rison core body temperature to about 101.3 degrees fhe so you they many people have to be into in this sauna and it it to about 145 is or something like that and they any 50 minutes to 60 minutes and they getting they response so it intense procedure um and the what the fir what Chuck Rison showed in the first study was that could just do this one treatment and it was actually a different type of infared SAA but I won induced this feverous response 101.3 Fahrenheit just one time in people with like major depressive disorder and um they or they did a sham control where they made them feel like they were getting hot but it like wasn enough it wasn response so they were it sham control or it getting the placebo effect because they think they the people that got the active treatment had anti-depressant effect that lasted like six weeks after and it was like enormous and crazy um placebo group didn Mason has has kind of carried the torch on and she um and she fingers crossed I know it think it peer review but she sessions in some cases some people did eight sessions of it and it amazing the effects that it people with respect to the anti-depressant effect it using what our body can do to heal itself when you know we always injecting it with stuff too there healing it it what it agree with I mean it exciting to potentially have a nonpharmacological treatment for depression because you know and I I Twitter and talked about like there now it exercise like they to classical anti-depressants like SS R so serotonin re um reuptake Inhibitors right um and it the anti-depressant effects it the same only the running has all the other benefits right uh but like some people point out that like there people that are really severely depressed that like just can they it get out of bed but will they get into a sauna I mean it so it really opens up doors that are just it promising as we age too for the Aging population a lot of people who don want to exercise when they get a lot older or they you know the aches and pains and maybe it to do that I can say for myself during Co was probably the you know one of the most stressful periods of my life and the sauna like you know I think it saved my life a lot you know what I mean like it I was using the sauna five six times a week and it was just sort of like a it was me mentally grounding it was something I look forward to it was a great ritual but it sort of kept me out of trouble for some reason and I could never explain it and I you know I all that but I was like this is working this is keeping me like happy and going and motivated and I gotta keep doing more of this because uh yeah it was really crazy totally I was the same I mean the same way for me during during that period I was doing this on like six I was doing it like every day I mean it was like you know and and again I but I had known I was like this does affect my mood and again it it comes down to like probably a lot of things we don know is it immune related the opioid system everything like all like all combined like there un I didn working I a placeo like this is great I it use the sauna uh all the time but people that don know it it it public saunas that are free and um you know we do have saunas and gyms here but like it is nice to know and I do think that if you can most people do at least have a bathtub and I think if you get one of those like little pool like temperature gauges like where you can measure the temperature and you get your your bath up to 104 and make sure you maintain it at that temperature you might have to keep turning on the faucet for 20 minutes and stay stay in the water like that is something that can also be done and it is a powerful form of deliberate heat exposure as well and it	Success
If more people knew this, they wouldn't drink alcohol	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrOE2wG21l8	FoundMyFitness Clips 	consuming just one to two units of alcohol daily equivalent to roughly half to one standard drink in the US is linked to reduced overall brain volume this reduction includes both gray matter which consists of neuronal cell bodies and is crucial for processing information and white matter which involves the connections between different brain regions in more severe cases like those seen in individuals with alcohol use disorder heavy consumption leads to the loss of neurons in several critical brain regions including the hypothalamus cerebellum hippocampus and amydala areas involved in regulating emotions memory and spatial navigation	Success

Alcohol is depleting your magnesium levels	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltQ4cIzLWls	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so alcohol can increase the rate at which the body excretes magnesium uh despite normal absorption rates in the gut because it acts like a diuretic so it leads to increased urine production and then losses of magnesium through urine so this diuretic effect contributes to a higher rate of magnesium being filtered out by the kidneys and expelled in urine rather than being absorbed and used in the body	Success

How to prevent your heart from getting stiffer with age	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVRfXVpOs4w	FoundMyFitness Clips 	well the stiffness of the heart is actually partly caused by glucose in the vascular system so the longer you have glucose sitting around in your vascular system it reacts with proteins um it reacts with DNA lipids but specifically it reacts with proteins including collagen and through What mailer reaction it forms something called Advanced glycation end products or ages for short and these things they basically cause your protein to become stiff and they and they and they last like if you collagen in your vascular system or in your myocardium for example your pericardium has collagen um it gets stiffer as you know as the Advan cation end products form and it byproduct of glucose being around for too long so people with type two diabetes for example um have you know problems stiffness of the blood vessels they you know get cardiovascular disease sooner all all sorts of problems and so I think one of the reasons that exercise plays an important role in destiffening the heart or preventing the stiffness of the heart is um because of the just enormous Improvement in glucose regulation that you exercise	Success

The Powerful Longevity Benefits of Omega-3 | Dr. Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78KWea7vx7M	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so omega-3 is the is sort of the last micronutrient that I want to cover before getting into the next part of my talk and um omega-3 there of it so there plant forms like black seed walnuts there sources so they and um there that was published gosh it was like 2009 and this study ident IFI the top six preventable causes of death so these are these are things that are you know lifestyle related so hypertension for example smoking of like not having you know avoiding hypertension avoiding smoking those were those were one of the you know some of the top six preventable causes of death well omega-3 not getting enough omega-3 from Seafood so this was the marine source of Omega-3 EPA and DHA was in that top six and um researchers from Harvard had identified that not getting enough omega-3 from Seafood was responsible for about 84,000 deaths a year and that was compared to trans fats so trans fats were also in consuming trans trans fats were uh one of the top avoidable um you know preventable causes of death well eating trans fats were responsible for 82,000 deaths per year pretty much the same as not getting enough omega-3 from seafood and you know what about trans fats you walk into any supermarket and your grocery store everything zero trans fats but nobody about they they fish or taking uh microalgae or or you know fish oil supplement to get omega-3 and so I I just kind of like to highlight that because it think that the way thinking about food in that you know what are we what do we need to feed our our body our metabolism we need co-actors magnesium you know vitamin D omega-3 like these are things if we focus on what we need to consume we don stuff and so you know people sort sort of get fixated on what to avoid and don supposed to be taking in what they supposed to be eating so the omega-3 index is one of the best measures of Omega-3 so this was pioneered by um doctor Bill Harris and uh his colleague Von shaki many years ago back in 2004 and um it omega-3 levels in red blood cell membranes as opposed to plasma phospholipids and the reason for that is because it is a long-term biomarker of Omega-3 so your red blood cells take about 120 days to turn over whereas your plasma phospholipids it you you get your omega-3 levels measured and it like what did I eat you know the past week or you know something like that so um it fast blood glucose would be the immediate you know biomarker and then the hba1c right is your long-term blood glucose level so it here so omega-3 index is a really important way to measure omega-3 and um it scientific studies of course many I think a lot of conflicting data out there also has to do with the fact that plasma phosphor lipids were measured and again it goes down to this well was it just that they didn last week or they did and so we saying they have high omega-3 because of that just recent dietary um choice right so omega-3 index was um this is again from Bill Harris and his colleagues found that people with a high omega-3 index which is defined as 8% at least 8% had a 90% reduced risk of sudden cardiac death compared to people with a low omega-3 index of 4% um the standard I in in the US the omega-3 index most people it about it so most people in the United States are are at a very low omega-3 index they don know so sudden cardiac death is reduced by 90% if you omega-3 INX group cardiovascular disease is the number one killer in the United States and and actually most all developed countries every 33 seconds someone dies of a heart attack so um anything you can do to improve cardiovascular health is really really on your side in terms of improving Health span improving your lifespan High Omega the high omega-3 index also from Bill Harris found that people again with an 8% omega-3 index had a 5year increased life expectancy compared to people with a 4% omega-3 index so that was the low end and um it Japan their life expectancy on average is about 5 years longer than in the in the United States or average average life expectancy is 5 years less here than in Japan and they happen to have an omega-3 index in general above 8% whereas again I mentioned we so um sort of an interesting sort of observation that also correlates with the increased average life expectancy in a country that eats a lot of seafood but this is what really I think is almost is his eye opening um it study from Bill Harris they stratisfied these part participants and looked at their omega-3 index and then also look at their smoking so the very very top curve the green curve people live the longest if they had the 8% omega-3 index and they were non-smokers and the very very bottom curve the red one was people that were smokers and had a low omega-3 index 4% so those they had the the lowest life expectancy but this is what blows my mind if you look at the orange and blue curves they overlaid on top of each other so people that had a I high omega-3 index but smoked had the same life expectancy as people that didn omega-3 index so essentially if you just look at this data alone smoking was like having a low omega-3 index and it just again it course it can never really establish causation but I just feel like that openening um because again everyone knows smoking is bad for you but nobody getting enough omega-3 and how easy is it to take a a fish oil supplement for example or increase your you know Salamon intake so to summarize this part of my talk with respect to micronutrients we talked about vitamin D low hanging fruit um as simple as a supplement 4,000 I use a day is a pretty good start to get most people who are deficient to a sufficient level that studies getting people from from a you know deficient level up to a sufficient level can be done with 4,000 I of vitamin D A Day omega-3 fatty acids um omega-3 index um getting the omega-3 index test you want your levels to be in the 8% you want to be High um and then there takes around 2 grams of supplemental omega-3 to get from a 4% omega-3 index to an 8% really not that hard and then um again um omega-3 is is found in prescription form I didn the randomized control trials today because that would take the remainder of my my time here but um you can get omega-3 in purified ethylester form either in the form of EPA only vaspa or DHA plus EPA laesa and those are prescribed in four grams a day per dose and so what I said was you know sort of conservative it takes about two grams a day just to get from a 4% on average 4% omega-3 index an 8% again it as getting the test done and and you know supplementing and then testing again and seeing if you your index up to 8% and then magnesium we talked about uh you know getting getting that RDA hitting it um with either you know increasing or a combination ideally increasing leafy greens and also taking a supplement magnesium glycinate citrate malate are all pretty bioavailable sources of magnesium	Success
How fasting affects women's hormones and stress hormones | Dr. Mark Mattson	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Xzkz9ylQtQ	FoundMyFitness Clips 	very very interesting mark to kind of shift back to the women part of this um story there whether or not fasting affects women differently and different than men and you know if women if if women um you know should should fast or if it affects their cycle menstrual cycle or hormones like thyroid things like that whether we intermittent fast that more um strong like longer than time restricted eating something more like a maybe 24 to 48 hour or people perhaps even a more prolonged fast do you have any thoughts about that yeah um major calorie restriction so i humans so in animals for example i had one post doc uh bronwyn martin in that like 2 000. or something she took rats and she put them on ad libon feeding 20 daily calorie restriction 40 daily calorie restriction which is a lot uh or every other day fasting and she had both males and females so and then she followed him over time and then the females she um essentially did vaginal swabs and to do staging of the cycle and so as far as that goes the the rats with 20 daily calorie restriction there was no change in their estra cycles the rats were with 40 calorie restriction and this was over a period of like four or six months they shut down they stopped cycling and they lost a lot of body fat during over those months then the rats on every other day fasting they kept slight they kept cycling but there was some increase in irregularity of the you know the the timing between the cycles but they are still presumably fertile um then what else she did all sorts of stuff she tested their learning in memory oh then interestingly the males even on the the 40 percent daily calorie restriction so the males their sperm count didn change and they didn body weight as the females during over these months so then and she looked at act like this the the activity of the rats moving around the cage and the females when they restriction became very active like they lot looking for food maybe uh so my interpretation of this and we had like a few sentences in the discussion of the article uh okay in the wild if there animals are getting to the point of starvation so that would be the 40 restriction uh the females they don now they if they get pregnant there food to support you know development their baby so they shut down their cycling they become more active looking for food the males um the males if before the male starved the nest it would be advantageous to them to be able to inseminate as many females as possible before they die of starvation so they stay for so that um you know the female has the egg that the genes on and you know so i don and then but with the intermittent fasting they kept cycling and their activity in the cage increased a little bit but they they maintain pretty good body fat uh compared to the 40 calorie restriction um one one issue is if and this applies mainly to adolescent girls if an adolescent girl goes to intermittent fasting eating pattern would she be more prone to developing anorexia nervosa which is a kind of obsessive compulsive psychiatric disorder the answer is we don we just don so from an evolutionary perspective you would think that would be selected against but you know so and it know enough about anorexia nervosa but you know how back in human recorded history how is rexia nebosh even common or is this something has arisen more as girls are more conscious of their body image and so on and you know therefore there psychological factor that i don something that i guess what i it doesn that anorexia would be something that would not be so strongly selected against during evolution right because and they these girls often they usually quit cycling too you know so yeah i guess we just don on the one hand intuitively it it wouldn this to adolescent girls but if they with obesity or overweight i don i we just don i don it may be okay but we just don you adolescents well so what about women that are not adolescent and are you know do not have an eating disorder and are perhaps even normal weight not obese or overweight is there a concern with other hormonal imbalances i don is it a bad thing i mean if you amenoratic for a short period of time um and you go back to eating normal calories what does that mean do you do do you delay your reproductive lifespan longer or is there even implications that well in animals that what happens if so for example where to take these rats and do 40 calorie restriction for three months or four months so that they stop cycling and then you put them back at liberty feeding they gain their body weight back they start cycling these aren studies then those rats will be able to have keep cycling to an older age than they would have previously stopped cycling so in other words in theory maybe you could extend age of menopause by shutting down cycling for 10 years i don this is like this speculation this is just thinking and not anything that coming close to even encouraging someone to do something like that which would be crazy but um it think about i don there haven studies where this is a big thing that lacking in in this field is studying hormones except for like simple things like leptin and ghrelin for example um fshlh um oxytocin you know anything to produce oh we do knew do know the animals anyway there seems to be increased activation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal stress response system and that that results in increased levels of cortisol and this was something that was noted early on in the animal studies the animals live longer when they calorie restriction or intermittent fasting but they have elevated cortisol levels which is usually you know in the clinical arena that because it can suppress the immune system however so the animals are living longer and we did a study uh jay juan lee is a who was a graduate student when i was in kentucky and then he came to baltimore with me when they moved so this gets a little bit into endocrinology cortisol there cortisol two proteins inside the cell that bind the cortisol and those cortisol binding proteins are transcription factors so cortisol comes from the blood into your cells it could be a muscle cell nerve cell doesn and it binds to the receptor and then which is a transcription factor it then goes into the nucleus and affects the expression of certain genes and in fact the nobel prize was given uh to the person who uh she i should know that sue discovered uh this okay there receptors for cortisol one is called the glucocorticoid receptor or gr the other is called the mineralocorticoid receptor or mr um and okay so there cortisol in relation to chronic uncontrollable psychosocial stress so people who are [Music] you know whether it you know their work or life situation they they have elevated cortisol levels and it brain nerve cells in the brain have a decreased level of one of the cortisol receptor the mr and an increase in gr so the way that the cells are responding to the cortisol is changing not just the cortisol levels so we did a study where we measured levels of gr and mr the two different receptors for cortisol in the hippocampus of mice that had been on every other day fasting or ad libitum control feeding and what we found is that in contrast to chronic uncontrollable stress the intermittent fasting caused a decrease in levels of gr and a sustained level of mr so the take-home message is there response pathways with intermittent fasting but the ways your cells respond to the stress is different than the bad ways yourselves to respond to bad types of stress chronic uncontrollable stress that important point to make you	Success
Doing this 4-7x a week reduces all-cause mortality by 40%!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzITCON3SkE	FoundMyFitness Clips 	what dependent effect with frequency and duration in the sauna so in other words the more frequent the sauna use the more robust of the effect so I example all cause mortality is 40% lower in people that use the sauna four to seven times a week so four times would be minimum right versus people that use it two to three times a week they have a 24% lower all cause mortality right so the bare minimum would be two if you want something um this is compared to people that use it one time a week but if you want the most robust effects the bare minimum would be four up to seven right every day so that would be frequency and the duration in that sauna is also important so if people only stayed in for 11 minutes they weren getting a very robust effect they had to stay in for at least 20 minutes so 20 minutes at 174 degree fah four times a week	Success
These 3 Health Habits Are a Must for Increasing Longevity - Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDgowWr4WIo	FoundMyFitness Clips 	okay so the next uper of question is from Jim s and it experts disagree on many things one second something is great the next it a death sentence what are the three to five most compelling things related to improving Health and Longevity that you strongly believe in that others might not for example using the sauna and then there are some comments there about um the the protocol for the sauna and uh things like that um take a sip of water so I would say that um so the three to five things that I you know I think are good for longevity that other people may not think are great I would say that for one thing that doesn three to five things that are the best so if we most people do agree on I would say most people agree cutting out refined sugar refined carbohydrates is great for longevity most people agree that you know exercise and not being sedentary is good for longevity um most people agree that high vegetable intake is great so those things are all obvious obvious ones but you know things that are that I think are also good for longevity that most people um don consider I would definitely say the sauna uh using the sauna four times four times a week would be probably have the highest um would have the most robust effect so we know that from studies out of Finland that using n sauna four to seven times a week is is associated with like a 50% lower cardiovascular disease risk a 66% lower Alzheimer dementia risk um so those are uh you know those are really you know age related diseases and certainly cardiovascular disease is one of the the top killers in the unit unit States and Al also in a lot of other countries as well um the sauna mimics cardiovascular exercise in a lot of respects but we also know that in addition you know in addition to that it vessel uh pliability so um blood vessel blood vessel function um it the way that your blood vessels are working in general uh it your heart to do less work because there um and uh you know basically your your blood your blood is Flowing to to organs a lot easier which means that your heart has to do less work to pump it to get to get it to your different organs uh including the brain and also heat Chu proteins are another really um pro- longevity factor that have been shown in multiple studies um including uh human studies um humans that have a polymorphisms that that make them have more heat chock proteins are more likely to be centenarian um we know that from from studies human studies that um have looked at heat chock proteins in uh muscle biopsies um that sitting the sauna for in 163 degree Fahrenheit sauna for about 30 minutes can increase heat chock proteins by about 50% and that that lasts for two days so you don do the sauna for two days and that heat increase in heat heat Chuck proteins will be sustained for 48 hours um which is also really really nice so um this the studies out of Finland that I cited that the the temperature was about 174 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 minutes at least 20 minutes so that was that was sort of like the minimum temperature and the minimum time was about 20 minutes to have the the a robust effect the 50% lower cardiovascular disease was a 40% lower all cause mortality 6% lower Alzheimer mortality so um I think that the four times is the most robust two to three times also had an effect it wasn as robust for example instead of a 50% lower cardiovascular d uh cardiovascular disease related mortality it was a 24% lower risk so um not quite as robust but still you you really want that Pro longevity I would say the four four times a week is the the minimum dose at 174 degrees for about 20 minutes um that would be and and at that degree you you protein effect as well so that would be one um the second thing I would say would be um that maybe most people aren Sprouts I think sulfurane is an up upand cominging longevity compound lots and lots of clinical evidence that it you know it decreases cancer incidence decreases cancer recurrence increas es a variety of antioxidant in anti-inflammatory Pathways in humans uh it it lowers um risk factors and biomarkers for um you know oxidized LDL and and and and cardiovascular disease related uh markers good for brain function I mean just a whole whole um list of benefits so I I that probably pro- longevity people are not talking about and then the third I would say for example I would say time restricted eating and I think that kind of becoming more popular talk about at least in this in the in the intermittent fasting respect people are talking about that being a pro longevity I would say for sure time restricted eating within a at least no longer than 11-hour time window preferably like 10 hours um and then I would say the other one is high-intensity interval training it increasingly interested in and um you know V2 Max is is is a biomarker for aging we know that so V2 Max is the ability of your body to take an oxygen during exercise and then transport that oxygen to various tissues um V2 Max decreases by 10% per decade and um high-intensity interval training in fact there showing that is one of the most efficient ways to increase V2 Mech aerobic aerobic exercise absolutely does it as well but I when I say efficient what I mean is for example um Studies have shown that doing just 24 sessions of a high-intensity interval training protocol 45 minute protocol where you having like four one minute high-intensity pushes you know separated by by um you know active recovery recovery and you have a warmup and a cool down period and all that after 24 sessions people 12% and that like literally turning you back a decade in terms of Aging so I say that that is another probably um upand cominging I uh practice for pro longevity that I don just yet but I I do think that it going to be um something that may play a role uh also it studies and humans to increase mitochondrial biogenesis the growth of new mitochondria in cells um um up to like 70% and I mean that because you essentially replacing damaged old dysfunctional mitochondria with young healthy new mitochondria and mitochondria are how you energy so that you know more better energy more efficient energy production and also you out damaging Bri products which are you know constantly being made by your mitochondria reactive auction species free free oxygen rad radicals these things are damaging a variety of you know things in your cell including DNA including mitochondria so young mitochondria you know leak out less of these damaging p uh byproducts than old mitochondria so if you take like for example a 20-year-old and compare them to an 80-year-old and you look at um you look at their their mitochondrial efficiency a 20-year-old will have less you know damaging byproducts being leaked out than than an 80-year-old so replacing your old damage mitochondria is also a good thing again high intensity interal training so I think those are the three things I would say um most people are not talking about they necessarily end lbl but they three things I compelling and I strongly think that are gon that are uh going to make their way into the longevity Arena um very soon uh in terms of how many high-intensity interval sessions per week I would say three um in fact the study that I talked about so this is Bill asking the study that I talked about U with the 24 sessions um that was over an eight-week period and interestingly that study also looked at people that did were doing um more high-intensity training within that time period so they were doing like four or five high intensity interval sessions there was actually a a threshold so after um the doing it three times a week uh people that started doing it four five times a week there was diminishing returns so their v2max did increase but it was like an 8% increase as opposed to like a 12% which really suggests that your body needs to recover so um I would say that you know probably even two to three times a week would be optimal um you know for the high-intensity interval training uh you definitely don be doing that like you know for five times a week okay uh let yeah and then in terms of what what what is a high-intensity interval training I mean there essentially you know over over 80% of your maximal oxygen intake a lot of times what people what you know people do to do that is like a Sprint you know a Sprint a hill Sprint um I I I do mine on on stationary bikes a Sprint and also I do Hill sprinting um swimming you can do it with swimming burpees all these things you can do lots of you know lots of things you can do uh for a high-intensity interval training um it doesn necessarily have to be just the biking	Success
\"This Micronutrient Improves Brain Health & Treats Migraines\" - Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu5NPQtvsfE	FoundMyFitness Clips 	okay so on that note let brain health there research that suggests there potential association between dietary magnesium intake and brain health so this was an observational study using data from over 6,000 participants they were aged 40 to 73 it was UK biobank data and those who reported a higher magnesium intake had on average larger brain volumes which could convey up to approximately one year of reduced brain aging compared to those with lower magnesium intakes so the results revealed that so the higher dietary magnesium consumption this was about 550 milligrams per day seem to correlate with larger gray matter and hippocampal volumes than the average intake of about 350 milligrams per day which is actually closer to the RDA um this was actually particularly notable in women I would say this is an intriguing link obviously interpretation of these results have to recognize that these are observational studies so they really can cause and effect relationship only suggest a c a possible Association so the data is based on self-reported diet dietary intake that could be influenced by other overall you know dietary patterns or other factors like lifestyle habits or health conditions to really I would say conclusively say state that magnesium is improving brain health by increasing brain volume particularly gray matter in the hipocampal Regal of the brain we would need clinical trials you know to substantiate that potential relationship those probably aren to be done so kind of just have to to look at this data and and make what you want out of it um magnesium has been linked to the development and progression of various age related brain disorders higher cerebral magnesium levels have been shown to decrease um oxidative stress and inflammation and improve synaptic plasticity also counteract other mechanisms leading to neur degeneration so there was a recent systematic review that revealed individuals with Alzheimer significantly lower plasma magnesium levels compared to healthy controls the researchers looked at a lot of data from different sources like blood serum plasma the fluid around the brain the cerebral spinal fluid which helped them sort of be more confident about their findings however when they specifically checked the fluid the cerebral spinal fluid it wasn there was a hint that Alzheimer patients might have lower magnesium in the cerebral spinal fluid but it wasn as clear cut as in the plasma in the blood for example in serum in a study that followed over 1,000 middle-aged adults for 17 years researchers found that those who ate the most magnesium so they were getting at least 196 milligrams per day had a 37% lower chance of getting dementia when they got older compared to those who ate the least magnesium so they were getting 174 milligrams per day or less there was another study in people aged 60 and above who did not have dementia also showed that eating more magnesium so this was at least 434 milligrams might help them from um getting uh mild cognitive impairment which is the stage before dementia the numbers from this study suggest that you know the risk was much lower for those who ate more magnesium and again another observational study this was 2 thou over 2,500 older adults who were mentally healthy again found higher magnesium intake this was over 407 milligrams per day was also linked to overall better brain function um but this benefit was actually only seen in women so again all these studies are observational uh they showing associations they really can Pro prove that higher magnesium intake directly causes these health benefits we need more controlled trials um clinical research to really establish that definitive link but we do know that magnesium is a vital co-enzyme that plays a crucial role in a a variety of biochemical processes in the brain so it serves as the key factor in a variety of brain specific enzymes so adenosine triphosphatases these are atpases they control our ability to hydrolyze ATP which is the major energy source for all of our cells very important in the brain so magnesium is a co-actor it essential for those enzymes to properly function and you know this is really important for the sodium potassium atpa and then calcium atpa which help establish this electrochemical gradient across our cellular membranes in our brain it function another enzyme would be involved with creatine so everyone you guys have heard of creatine uh most people think about it in the context of bodybuilding muscle muscle mass but it also um is important in the brain as well so creatine passes phosphate groups um from phosphocreatine to ADP to make ATP that energy currency and so you know the enzymes that are doing this again require magnesium to do it so another reason why magnesium would be important for the brain it another enzyme called glutamine synthetase so this enzyme it enables the conversion of glutamate into ammonia and glutamine and magnesium is required for the appropriate function of this enzyme because and this is really critical because maintaining that glutamate to glutamine balance in the brain is important for preventing ayot toxicity so this could potentially lead to neuronal damage if you if you maintaining that balance you might have too much glutamate which could lead to that excitotoxicity and neurotoxicity right so too much excitatory activity from glutamate you end up with neuronal damage so magnesium plays this is just three examples of enzymes in the brain where magnesium plays a critical function and why magnesium is so crucial for brain function I would say one area with respect to the brain where the data is a bit stronger is migraines so ma magnesium might play a role in managing migraines which is a condition that affects many people worldwide there recent randomized control trials that have really shed some light on magnesium suffering from migraines so what is happening in the brain during a migraine one key element is something called cortical spreading depression so it kind of wave of brain activity that leads to visual and sensory changes we often associate with migraine oras so interestingly magnesium supplementation seems to help prevent these waves but there may also decrease the release of certain chemicals in the brain like substance p and glutamate which are known to transmit pain signals so by reducing their release magnesium could play a role in lessening the pain associated with migraines also it prevent the further narrowing of brain blood vessels caused by serotonin another neurotransmitter involved in migraines so as it turns out individuals who suffer from migraines are often found to be deficient or have insufficient magnesium now this might not be entirely surprising when we consider that nearly half the US population doesn enough magnesium in their diet but it does highlight a potential link between widespread nut nutritional gaps and specific health conditions like migraines understanding these connections can can offer us insights I think into simple yet impactful ways to improve our health so there R randomized control trials that we going to discuss there were five randomized control trials that indicate that magnesium supplementation can effectively reduce the frequency and intensity of migraine relapses so magnesium is believed to work by preventing cortical spreading depression the brain signaling waves often responsible for migraine Aura we just talked about um and additionally magnesium reduces those the release of those pain transmitting chemicals like substance p and glutamate the effective magnesium dose for preventing migrain seems to be around 600 milligrams per day which is almost twice the suggested upper limit to minimize gastrointestinal discomfort I think it divide the dose into smaller amounts such as 200 milligrams taken three times throughout the day this can really help minimize you know the irritation on the digestive tra while still providing an effective dose for migraine management so I I mentioned this data comes from five different randomized control trials I do think that while there studies the implications could be significant you know migraines they not just headaches they complex neurological events so understanding how something is accessible as a magnesium supplement for some people could mitigate these symptoms I think is really it offers new hope and a potential new Avenue for relief for some people so it into some of the brain science and understanding magnesium looking at some of the clinical studies can kind of help lead to some practical everyday health benefits	Success

This supplement could help you excrete a toxic plastic chemical	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nElcDrI56Hw	FoundMyFitness Clips 	but I do think that there made for the compound found in highly in broccoli Sprouts but also in mature broccoli sulfurane because sulfurane increases um an enzyme that causes BPA to um be converted into like a fat soluble into water soluble product and um it it so it increases that enzyme I there sulphoraphane doeses increase the excretion of BPA I to find out I think highly highly likely based on the fact that that very same enzyme is what causes BPA to be excreted um the one that sulfurane activates but we do not that sulfurane activates so that enzyme is part of what Phase 2 detoxification enzymes and those enzymes detoxify a variety of chemicals that we pollution things like acryline or Benzene and Studies have shown that people that take sulfurane in increase their Benzene and AC acryline excretion by like 60% after 24 hours	Success
This Supplement Benefits Metabolic Health, Skin, and Even the Brain	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OefojVVBPUU	FoundMyFitness Clips 	and the first question uh was that I I submitted by Libby and Libby was asking whether I could provide any information or research on alphal lipoic acid its Effectiveness um how it can control blood sugar the R versus S and reliable Brands so um this is a question I haven just want to you know cover a few of the the background Basics just to start with um you can find alphalipoic acid in Foods so it tissues like kidney um animal organ tissu so that the kidney heart and liver are pretty high in alphalipoic acid you can also find it in some vegetables like spinach and broccoli then there supplemental form so um you can find alphalipoic acid in typical supplements it times greater than what you would find in food and the recommended doses usually are anywhere between 200 to 600 milligrams a day you know depending on what the outcome is and what the research has shown on that outcome there is an oxidized form of alphao lipoic acid in a reduced form they kind of cycle between the two much like vitamin C there its free radical Scavenging um capabilities so it can basically help um prevent DNA damage damage to proteins and lip in our body it neutralizes reactive auction species it shown to protect cells from UV induced damage and uh the alphalipoic acid recycles between its um oxidized and reduced form it also regenerates vitamin C and vitamin E so vitamin C and vitamin E also become oxidized and um they go through for example Vitamin C go through goes through like four Cycles well alphalipoic acid can help regenerate some of that vitamin C so it kind of prolongs the life of it um interestingly alphalipoic acid also has some interesting metal chelation properties so it can it can keate some free metal ions so iron zinc and copper for example so when you have those I metal free Metals floating around in cells they can induce oxidative damage so what alphalipoic acid does is it binds to and keates these free Metals preventing them from inducing oxidative damage inside of cells it also uh has been shown to reduce Advanced glycation and products so these are damaging products that that happen when you have a combination of fructose Plus either protein or um you know fructose with protein or lipids and DNA and so the advanced glycation end products can bind to the lipids and DNA and protein sort of cross link them and and it can damage them you can find a higher proportion people consume actually consume uh Advanced G glycation end products from really deep fried foods uh from barbecued and grilled foods hamburgers hot dogs for example really really fried foods like french fries cracker chips you know processed foods like like those are really high in advanced cation end products so apal lipoic acid has been shown to decrease or reduce the formation of red of advanced lication end products it also has been shown to play a role in brain aging so it increases the the production of of um anti-inflammatory genes and genes that can respond to oxidative stress as well it interestingly there studies showing that alphalipoic acid can mimic some aspects of caloric restriction in the brain specifically so again it same genetic Pathways in brain regions like the cerebellum that caloric restriction induces uh so that pretty interesting now where the blood sugar stuff come in there variety of studies showing that alpal lipoic acid can improve insulin sensitivity and it can lower blood sugar levels it role in diabetic neuropathy so um you know this is a big big problem with people that have type two diabetes for example 600 milligrams of alphalipoic acid per day for 3 weeks was able to reduce symptoms of diabetic neuropathy and it play a role in aging skin which also has uh piqued my interest interest so um it you know collagen in in is one respect that it alphalipoic acid can increase the production of type one collagen in the skin it also increases the expression of an enzyme a gene that produces an enzyme called pral hydroxylase that to produce collagen also has been shown topically to play a role in um lowering the production of like melanin in the skin so so um it it show treat uh what hyperpigmentation in your skin so um that alphal lipoic acid uh I I think that um you know the the combination of the RNs Brands um pure pure encapsulations makes a good one um I supplement list today because that was another question but um I with it I I do I did place an order for my mother to have it so um it might be something that I so if you guys want to check back again with my supplement list again soon then um you know I may be I may be trying that as well I see some people asking in the chat about athletic greens I have covered that in a previous crowdcast um personally I I think that there the Blu green algae in there you know that are in some of these supplement powders um including the the athletic greens um I there you know piggybacking in in those but there know so I just I don I don powders above and beyond um taking you know your your

How 5:2 intermittent fasting differs from time restricted eating | Dr. Mark Mattson	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVnOPE89f0Q	FoundMyFitness Clips 	The key thing for your viewers to\\nunderstand is that when they see intermittent fasting, intermittent\\nfasting is an eating pattern. It Oftentimes, in kind of the lay\\npress and so on, intermittent fasting will be lumped in as a diet. But it It A diet is what you eat\\nand how much you eat. Intermittent fasting is an eating pattern\\nthat includes intermittent periods of not eating, sufficient to deplete the glucose\\nstores in the liver and cause a switch to the use of fat from your fat cells and\\nthe ketones produced from those fat cells. Right. So if a person eats breakfast, lunch,\\nand dinner, and doesn exercise, every time they eat they the liver and they may never tap in to\\nthe fat stores and, therefore, their ketone levels will remain low because\\nthe metabolic switch hasn It typically takes at least 10 hours\\nto deplete the glucose in the liver. So if a person eats breakfast, lunch,\\nand dinner, and then has a snack around 8:00 or 9:00, you know, they\\nmay get up and eat breakfast and have not depleted the energy in their liver\\nand have not switched to using fat. So, with intermittent fasting, the\\napproaches that have been used in experimental studies, both in animals\\nand in humans, are as follows: One, is called daily time-restricted\\neating, where the time window that one eats is compressed into, say,\\na six to eight-hour time period. So, that means the person would\\nbe fasting for 16 to 18 hours, which is sufficient time for this\\nmetabolic switch to have occurred. And scientists think, based on a lot\\nof data, that this metabolic switching is important for health benefits of\\nintermittent fasting, but also maybe even of exercise in some instances. So, the daily time-restricted\\neating is one approach that can result in daily metabolic switching,\\ndaily elevation in ketones. So, for example, if a person\\nskips breakfast, eats all their food between noon and 6 pm. And if they were to measure their\\nketones, they morning, they Okay. If they wake up and go for a run in the\\nmorning, they metabolic switch has already occurred. So, they can actually enhance\\nthe effect of the fasting in terms of elevation of ketones. And we think, in terms of beneficial\\neffects on the brain, the cardiovascular system, perhaps even physical performance,\\nwhich is an area that is being studied now with intermittent fasting, there meals a day plus snacks, intermittent\\nfasting is beneficial for the heart, and the brain, glucose regulation. But it There Okay. So, let Another intermittent fasting\\neating pattern is one that called 5:2 intermittent fasting. And this is where the individual,\\n2 days a week, they one moderate sized meal of, say,\\n600 calories in those 2 days, then the other 5 days they eat normally. And so, in that case, 5:2 intermittent\\nfasting, the person will have the metabolic switch occurring two days\\na week, but not the other five. In fact, this 5:2 intermittent fasting,\\nin a sense, kind of triggered the popularization of intermittent fasting. And I We that intermittent fasting was\\nbeneficial for the brains of animals. And we can talk about\\nthat, some details on that. And then, we resting heart rate and blood pressure\\nand having anti-inflammatory effects. And then, I was approached by a\\nnumber of clinical investigators. One was Jim Johnson, who\\nworked with asthma patients. And, in 2007, we published a\\nsmall study where we found that... These were overweight asthma\\npatients, and we put them on a really rigorous regimen where every other\\nday, they only ate 400 calories. So, that because it But in these overweight asthma patients,\\nover two months, it had profound beneficial effects in improving their\\nsymptoms, their air flow in their lungs. My lab, we measured indicators of\\noxidative stress and inflammation in the blood, which went down not right\\naway but between two and four weeks of initiating that every-other-day\\nmetabolic switching regimen. Okay.\\nSo, we published that study. Then, I was approached by Michelle\\nHarvie, who was in England, and works with women at risk for breast\\ncancer because they and they also have a family history. And she came to my lab, she And there beneficial in suppressing cancer growth. So, anyway, Michelle and I designed a\\nstudy where we took these 100 women, and we randomly assigned them to either\\nwhat fasting or we had a control group where\\nwe had them eat breakfast, lunch and dinner, but each meal had 25% fewer\\ncalories than they normally take in. And because we had done a calculation\\nthat the long-term calorie intake would be similar in the two groups, the group\\neating 600 calories two days a week versus the group eating three meals every\\nday but reducing their calorie intake. Over six months, both groups of women lost\\nabout 8% of their initial body weight. And both groups had improvements\\nin glucose regulation and other health indicators. But the women on 5:2 intermittent fasting\\nhad a greater improvement in insulin sensitivity and lost more belly fat\\ncompared to the group that was counting calories, if you will, every meal.

This literally kills tumor cells floating around your blood	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSTiOtTlItY	FoundMyFitness Clips 	most of us here know that exercise is one of the best things you can do to prevent cancer but also as an adjunct cancer treatment many different ways that that most people don through the shearing forces of your blood just blood flow so just getting that blood flow flow to go faster by exercising by getting that exercise um kills what are called circulating tumor cells um these are these are tumor cells that have escaped a primary s of the tumor get into circulation and they go and you know try to travel to other tissues and take Camp there and you know metastasize well circulating Che cells are very sensitive to the mechanical forces the shearing forces of blood flow and they can stress like our normal cells can and they die um and so that I think that really interesting way to think about it because it to get my blood flow up I need to I need to get my heart rate going and my blood flow up and that is something that has an antistatic effect	Success
This Type of Exercise Supercharges Metabolism, Optimizes Glucose Homeostasis, & Repairs Mitochondria	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efpyPjM8Z4Y	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so let interval training so as I mentioned this is a very time efficient way to uh get your heart rate up and exercise so it involves very short bouts of intense exercise one uh we heart rate up at at least 75% max heart rate followed by periods of recovery there we been lots of studies talking and and showing um that high-intensity ofal training can improve glucose homeostasis in insulin sensitivity um it also decreases fat Mass improves body composition and enhances mitochondrial function so a meta analysis of 50 different randomized control trials compared high-intensity interval training to moderate intensity continuous exercise so this would be exercise that kind of intensity where you can have a conversation but you breathy sometimes called zone two and and um this is a longer duration type of exercise so high-intensity interval training outperforms moderate intensity continuous exercise at decreasing insulin um resistance it also improves hba1c levels so the longterm biomarker for elevated blood glucose levels it leads to a decrease in body weight and also significantly lowers fasting blood glucose levels again this is 50 different randomized control trials and a another systematic review of many different randomized control trials has found that again high-intensity interal training outperforms moderate intensity continuous exercise at improving cardiorespiratory Fitness improving diastolic and systolic blood pressure improving HDL triglycerides and fasting glucose lowering oxidative stress improving adiponectin and insulin sensitivity as well as beta cell um function to produce insulin it increases PGC Alpha which is a biomarker for mitochondrial biogenesis which we discussing in a little bit and it also improves cardiac function and this is all better than moderate intensity continuous exercise so it really provides a opportunity for people to have a time efficient way of improving metabolic health and part of that is because when you get your heart rate up high when you are putting in the effort you are you you mitochondria and your muscle and your mitochondria are unable to produce energy quick enough to keep up with the demand and so your your your muscle cells shift to using glucose as a source of energy through glycolysis and that ends up producing lactate which was thought to be a byproduct a metabolic byproduct well decades couple of decades ago Dr George Brook books at the University of California in Berkeley um was one of the Pioneers to find that lactate generated from exercise is anything but a byproduct so steady state lactate levels are less than one millimar when you when you crank up the intensity of exercise you can go anywhere up to 15 17 Millar and that lactate it gets in circulation and it goes into the brain it goes into the heart it goes back into the muscle it goes to the kidneys it goes to the liver and it source of energy so it lactate can be used you know and converted into um acetyl COA and used by energy by the mitochondria but probably one of its most important roles is as a signaling molecule it connect to to uh communicate with other organs and other tissues and one of its signaling roles is back in the muscle it translocation of glucose for Transporters to the cell surface of the muscle glute for Transporters and so lactate gets back into the muscle it it hey we for energy so we need to bring more glucose in and the way it does it is by increasing glute for Transporters at the muscle and I mentioned um lactate levels go up during this intense exercise that minutes when exercise stops your lactate levels go back to Baseline because all these other organs including the muscle are consuming it so quickly however the increase in glucose for Transporters stays you know elevated for up to 48 hours with the first 24 hours being the most robust so you a longterm effect from that signaling from lactate back to the muscle to increase glute for transporters and that is why uh high-intensity interval training is so potent and Powerful at improving glucose homeostasis so there was an another metaanalysis of 36 randomized control trials that were looking at optimal conditions of high-intensity Nal training for improving body composition and so it duration of of of the hit workout high intensity Nal training workout 8 weeks is optimal for for improving body composition the frequency is at at least three sessions a week and the intervals are 60 seconds of 60 seconds or less of the robust intense you know interval followed by about 90 seconds of recovery and this leads to improvements in um reducing fat Mass cycling and running was the best at at doing that also improving percent body fat so body fat reduction and that was the best with running and then then um increasing fat-- free Mass which includes muscle and the best at that was actually cycling so these are some of the optimal conditions for improving body composition with respect to high-intensity interval training protocols we high-intensity interval training can regulate mitochondrial function but before we talk about that I think it important to recognize that people with metabolic syndrome insulin resistance obesity and type 2 diabetes have been identified to have pretty profound disregulated mitochondria so the mitochondria and skeletal muscle from people with type 2 diabetes and obesity have been found in multiple studies to to respire about 40% less than skeletal muscle cells from people that do not have type 2 diabetes or people that are lean so their their mitochondria are dysfunctional and subsequent Studies have also identified structural defects in the mitochondria so mitochondria from people with type 2 diabetes are fragmented so mitochondria are typically they form a very connected Network this sort of look like rachelli spaghetti and um that beautiful network of mitochondria that you know are able to um undergo respiration and do their functions um quite robustly when when mitochondria become really fragmented they are dysfunctional they they can produce energy very well and they their way to basically dying and causing cells to die so there connection between structure of mitochondria and the function of mitochondria and that because vigorous exercise high intensity exercise has been shown to increase this repair process in mitochondria known as mitophagy so when exercise is intense enough it increases the nutrient sensing protein aamp kyes ampk it activates it and this causes the mitochondria to send the signal that they need to repair themselves and so mitochondria can be sort of dysfunctional or they can be really dysfunctional so my phagy can clear away an entire dysfunctional mitochondria to be used and recycled or it can clear away pieces of A Dysfunctional mitochondria so when that ex when you doing that acute exercise your mitochondria if you have a dysfunctional one the the mitophagy pathway gets activated and the mitochondria fizzes off it kind of goes to this mitochondrial fision process and that damaged part of the mitochondria then goes and is recycled to through the lome and then you what you have is a long-term effect of after doing you know routine high-intensity exercise you then have more healthy functional mitochondria because you rid of the damaged part of the mitochondria if the mitochondria is dysfunctional enough you rid of the whole mitochondria and by the way the amp kise pathway many of you are probably thinking oh well that that activated during periods of fasting and that is true um kindness is activated during periods of fasting and fasting is a powerful signal for inducing autophagy and mitophagy however in this particular study people that did this high-intensity vigorous exercise for 30 minutes it did not matter if they had fasted for 16 hours or not there was no difference in the mitophagy so in other words the exercise itself was such a strong signal for activating mitophagy that it didn fasted for 16 hours because it was so powerful on top of the repair process High intens interval training is one of the most robust exercise modalities that can increase mitochondrial biogenesis so the growth of new mitochondria increasing mitochondrial volume so you where you mitochondria getting rid of the unhealthy parts and then you increasing the growth of new mitochondria so one of the reasons high-intensity interval training is very good at increasing mitochondrial biogenesis compared to let moderate cont um continuous exercise is because lactate that that vigorous exercise is a signaling molecule to activate the protein that very much regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and skeletal muscle pgc1 Alpha so again lactate is playing that signaling role it the muscle it muscle and then it the muscle it energy fast enough because this exercise is so intense we need more mitochondria to be able to do that so it adaptation to the vigorous intensity exercise and that adaptation is making more mitochondria which is obviously very beneficial for not only people with type 2 diabetes metabolic syndrome obesity but also everybody so it Inc so mitochondrial biogenesis improves um Energy Efficiency in mitochondria and also is associated with other benefits like decreased atrophy and inove improved exercise endurance as well so there host of benefits with increasing mitochondrial biogenesis so a lot of the high-intensity inval training protocols that were used in these systematic analysis and these meta analyses were um evidence-based hit protocols so Tabata is one that 10sec off interval 20 seconds at the highest intensity you can do you going all out and then you for 10 seconds and that times for a total of a 4minute workout in some cases the Tabata protocol was repeated twice the winggate um hit protocol is another very commonly used one and that is a 30second allout Sprint followed by 4 minutes of active recovery where you do that for to six times that 20 minute or so workout and then there the conventional workout it minute on one minute off so you as intense as you can for one minute and then you have one minute of very light active recovery and then you repeat that 10 times so that it is hard but it at improving a variety of metabolic parameters and then there workout also known as the Norwegian 4x4 which I like to call it because the Norwegian ski team often uses this hit protocol for their training it 4minute interval where you intense as you can for four minutes and then you have light recovery for three minutes so you getting your heart rate down and that repeated four times so it minute workout	Success
Rhonda Patrick's 2025 Strength Training & Cardio Routine	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mojqFgs6Jbw	FoundMyFitness Clips 	Tim is asking in the chat how many times a week do I do high inable training and sauna do I sauna right after my hit so typically um I high-intensity interal training three times a week I do either I so twice a week I do well actually it three times a week it CrossFit type of training protocol where it involves strength training but it also incorporates a lot of high intensity training as well and so I do that you know there I hour long um two days a week I go for like a pretty nice zone two run and um with respect to sauna I try and do it I like doing it after my my workouts sometimes my hit workouts are just so intense that um I I do a sauna like later in the night but I do I do actually like doing it right after my workout oftentimes I only do a sauna at like 175 for like 20 minutes because I spent but um so that like you know and my saunas I a bit of late but typically I try to do it like three or four times a week another rapid fire question um someone wants me to ask someone share some of my insights on the details of my strength pring training protocol what kind of exercise do I do frequency um do I do fix set or do do I go to failure or Neil near failure okay so um I mentioned I do for my strength training I I do some form of strength training I do it three times a week and um it hybrid CrossFit form and um so typically the for two of those two of those sessions those sessions will involve me doing strength training for like the first 30 minutes where I on something like squats or I deadlifts or I pull-ups and or I or a combination of the those all of those or I doing you know front squats or back squats or I with a clean or I have the bar have the the rig there with the barbell so I don and so in in those cases um I always always always do Progressive loading so I start out light and I go heavier and then um in my final set I I am not going to failure for these These are more strength training exercises that I know types of workouts the first like 30 minutes of my hourong workout and then the last you know 20 minutes or so will be a workout that includes strength training and also includes some type of aerobic high-intensity interval training like biking or rowing or sprinting or jumping rope um and in those types of workouts I will also still incorporate push-ups and squats and deadlifts as well and um they and I will do more reps and and then I do them you know there of it and so um in in those in that sense like if I that has dips then I I would say near failure uh because the workout has me doing so many of them and it do so many rounds of it and it like a circuit and so I often find that I am definitely going near failure on things like push-ups or dips um I don going too much to failure um except for I would say with my deadlifts and my squats it um it it I would say actually it is pretty close to failure but but it just like I heavy weight for me and I I of it so um that my my strength training workouts go I also do incorporate I I also do pelaton tatas as well um so like I just and I and I incorporate those like on top of these other workouts you know I minute Tabata where I just get like a quick quick hit oftentimes I before a podcast or I know if I need some extra energy or boost to feel better to be you know just have blood flow to my brain	Success

This Is Everything Rhonda Patrick Eats in a Day	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy4g1sI1A4I	FoundMyFitness Clips 	okay Jessica says H hello haranda could you share what a day look like for you I examples of breakfast lunch dinner snacks desserts that you have on a typical day I of your favorite recipes that you haven smoothie recipes salmon roast Stacks Etc what are some other go-tos that provide optimal nutrition okay so um like I said I do time restricted eating and I don do Tim restricted eating for for whatever reason decide that they going to skip meals so they skip breakfast to increase their fasting window um I don breakfast I don don part um I have done that and I occasionally if like I more of a you know let my let my organs rest Ty kind of uh deal um then I will do like a one meal a day but that something I do every day I mean it it you know I do that occasionally um and it of a repair Rejuvenation process happen so it routine typically for my breakfast I always try to go high protein high protein and I combine that with uh something that I would consider gut health promoting so examples are um I usually do either boiled eggs or I scrambled eggs and I eggs with some arugula and a little bit of feta cheese um or I scrambled eggs with some spinach and cheddar cheese but I I I usually try to do high protein and then I the eggs with either a cafir smoothie with some berries or I with a kale Berry avocado smoothie so so most of the time I some kind of smoothie either cafir or a kale Berry and the cafir one also has berries so the berries are in in both of the smoothies um so that this morning I had scrambled eggs with a little bit of of cheddar cheese and then I had um some kale blueberry strawberry avocado collagen powder smoothie so that said mostly I focus on the high protein so I sometimes do high protein or um sometimes it it thing so it depends on like what I doing sometimes I like sardines and an avocado I I definitely if I round I do sardines and avocado for lunch um I also or Macaro I do Macaro as well or sometimes I canned um wild Alaskan salmon so I that with some lemon or I nuts and apple slices and like a little bit of cheese with Apple apple slices or sometimes I some spinach and some um you know maybe some like broccoli or something in there and then for dinner dinner is also protein and veggies so for dinner I if I had a salad for lunch then I grilled veggies for dinner if I didn have a salad for lunch then I probably do a big salad for dinner but I always have either grilled veggies or a salad on the side and then my protein examples include I bake some salmon in the OV oven I usually do wild Alaskan salmon or I do some cod sometimes or mahim Mahi sometimes most of the time I do salmon and then um I also do Chicken Kebabs I thighs for my protein source for dinner or I minion so or you know sometimes I stir fry my chicken with the veggies if I it combination for dinner for me Paul breakfast um for myself it it really it really depends like if I my lunch and stuff I usually just I do like three three eggs is good for me now my husband does four he than me um so Jane three meals how do you do TR like this is my point like this is my point like you don restricted eating I like it that I think somehow on the internet that got popular popularized and I don I I guess it don and and so it you get up at at at like the same time every morning and you know eat breakfast at the same time every morning then you know figure out when you when you know if you want to eat within an 8 hour or 10-hour window figure out when you have to eat your last meal and then you can eat three meals within that time window you don restricted eating does not mean skipping meals it does not mean skipping meals that mean that when you skip meals that restriction you calories you um so I really I think that uh you know you have to you have to kind of keep that in mind um that time restricted eating does not mean you have to skip a meal um maybe people do that for convenience you know I I like I just don usually eat I usually eat breakfast at 8:00 in the morning and then I have dinner at 600 like I like 5:30 it usually done around 6 um you know there are times that I cheat and I am you know I I I uh eat a little bit later than that for social reasons and that fine but but that for me and if you like like this plenty of times to eat three meals I mean there have to you have to cut out um you know three meals for that right so I really think that um please please keep in mind Tim restricted eating does not mean meal skipping it does not meal skipping is more equivalent to caloric restriction because you you whole meal um you know it time restricted eating has to do with eating your food in a restricted time window so that you give your body Time Repair so that you line with the Circadian rhythm U of your metabolism um those sorts of things	Success
This how much protein you ACTUALLY need	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80lxinO5_8o	FoundMyFitness Clips 	about you know 40 years ago this RDA was set and it was set to be 0.8 gram of protein per kilogram body weight and that was thought to be the amount that you needed to take in every day to not to minimize um the amino acid losses from muscle right to replace all your amino acids to be able to to get enough protein right the the way that that RDA was 40 years ago uh set was it was flawed um in terms of like the techniques that they used they nitrogen balance studies they underestimated the amino acid losses and so here we are 40 years later scientists have more sensitive tools we have a lot more at our disposal and they no actually we rid these studies and we found it protein per kilogram of body weight as the bare minimum to just basically be able to uh not be pulling amino acids from our muscle right um and then that number goes up if you active up to 1.6 grams per per kilogram of body weight	Success

Can exercise actually kill cancer cells?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDr-eElglVc	FoundMyFitness Clips 	Exercise is one of the best things you can do for cancer prevention and also for cancer treatment. But also the cancer cells uh have something on them called they mechano receptors on them which our normal cells have too sense they sense movement basically and as you exercise your blood flow is moving right and so um again it that kills the cancer cell but not normal cells and these are usually cancer cells that have that are in your vascular system right so these are called circulating tumor cells and so those are the ones that the blood flow itself just the shearing force of it can kill because um the cancer cells can take that shearing stress, that shearing force stress. And there of studies that have been done now looking at people that have colorectal cancer or breast cancer and they engage in exercise. You know, these people are like 40% less likely to have cancer recurrence and 63% less likely to have their die from die from their cancer. So they outcome.	Success

This is the best workout for improving VO2 max	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4LIzslmXiE	FoundMyFitness Clips 	I would say in terms of the V2 Max improvements what the most beneficial is the Norwegian 4x4 protocol that I mentioned because for whatever reason the longer intervals of of of going as hard as you can for a longer period of time this is not all out it maintain for that duration of four minutes right and so it different for everyone but you kind of have to pace yourself and you do something you do on a treadmill or a stationary bike or a rowing machine you can do it on any of them um I I doing it on a rowing machine but um it was actually I think you know stationary bikes or what some of these other uh Studies have shown as well um people can do running on a treadmill I mean it really you can kind of pick what you want but the idea is you want to do four minutes as at the intensity at the highest intensity that you can maintain for that 4 minutes which is not all out you do recovery for 3 minutes at a very low intensity and then you do that and you repeat it four times so you do it four times it called the Norwegian 4x4 that shown to be one of the best ways to improve cardiorespiratory Fitness	Success

Should You Supplement With Cocoa Flavanols? - Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5vRJLD5lXQ	FoundMyFitness Clips 	okay so Jessica is asking you mentioned earlier in a a Q&A that you take cocova as a supplement I unfamiliar with this supplement what are its benefits so uh cocoa um has cocoa uh flavonols in it and um one of these is uh the egcg it concentration actually in chocolate and it blood circulation improve cognition and uh actually even reduce wrinkles in um in human studies so uh let let was a um a study with elderly patients that had peripheral artery disease and those who drank a beverage that had flol Rich cocoa in it three times a day for 6 months were able to uh walk 46 yards further in a six walking test compared to those that drank the placebo um beverage and so uh it was shown that the uh Improvement in their walking ability was a consequence to increased uh blood flow in their calves and also improved muscle function so that was um a super interesting study there was another study that was actually done in young healthy males that showed um that dark chocolate improved their their cycling so basically those that had dark chocolate were able to uh cycle 177% farther in the same amount of time than those that had uh the placebo control which was white chocolate um and the study also showed that they basically didn to basically cycle farther as well uh there was another randomized double blinded crossover study in young healthy people that consumed uh various doses of these cocoa flavonols um ranging from 0o to 80 milligrams or sorry 800 milligrams of these cocoa flavonols for day per day for one week and um circulation and blood pressure uh was was measured and so there was a dose dependent increase in circulation um effects were were seen as little a with a dose as little as 80 milligrams per day for one week and the 800 milligram per day showed the best Improvement in terms of circula improved circulation uh the Coco also decreased systolic blood pressure by about five points and diastolic blood pressure by about three points so so basically a person whose blood pressure was 140 over one uh 140 over 90 went down to 135 over 87 so so those were the three studies that were involving blood circulation um cognition there been some studies with cognition so um and of course the improve you know increased and improved blood flow also means improved blood flow to the to the brain um cardiovascular health is very very tightly correlated with Cog cognitive function and cognitive Health in general uh so one study showed that a single dose of 450 milligrams of these Coco cocoa flavonols has been shown to increase blood flow to the brain as measured by MRI imaging um so one of the areas of the brain that gets increased blood flow is the dentate gyrus uh region which is uh part of the hip campus associated with memory and increased blood blood circulation translates um to protection from cognitive decline another study found that elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment that were using up to 990 milligrams of these cocoa flavonols per day for eight weeks saw Improvement in their verbal fluency and their mental tests compared to the placebo controls so um they also had an uh Improvement in their uh they saw a decrease in insulin resistance and a decrease in blood pressure as well as a decrease in lipid peroxidation so there were metabolic improvements that also corresponded with the improvements in in cognitive function and last but not least the skin um there have been uh there has at least been one study uh that has shown that um in a randomized double blinded Placebo control trial and Korean women that uh age ranges from their 40s to 80s that took 320 milligrams of Coco flavonols per day for 24 weeks they had an improvement in their their facial skin wrinkles and skin elasticity compared to placebo group um so so I I typically I think take around the 375 milligrams of the cocoa flavonols the reason I use cocoa is because um I third-party testing uh for example a consumer lab has done pretty extensive testing on a lot of the the cocoa um they bars they supplements and they they like um the the cocoa powders as well and they factors including contamination from cadmium and arsenic lead um these things are a major problem with um chocolates Cocos and things like that and they also looked at the actual concentration of the cocoa flavanol so there was so there you want a uh a product that the cocoa flavonols but low in the contaminants and and uh covilla was the absolute best in terms of lowest contaminants and very concentrated flavon and in fact the cocoa itself was used in um several of the the randomized control trials that I just mentioned so I give it to my mom um I also take it and but one thing to consider is that it does because it is um uh chocolate it does have H A moderate amount of caffeine so it the morning and not with you know not with your dinner because you don to take caffeine at night and you know you don sleep in fact I got got my brand of cocoa right here on on my desk so typically this is what I I take they also have an unsweetened um packet that you can make like cocoa with if you want to add things like monk fruit or stabia to it uh by the way I have no affiliation with cocoa at all I just uh happen to have done a lot of research on on their their brand and I like it	Success

Omega-3 may be anabolic at higher dosages	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-48BsIWRWTg	FoundMyFitness Clips 	there is converging evidence that omega-3 fatty acids are at the very least anti-catabolic and likely anabolic as well they do this by Shifting the balance more towards muscle building particularly in context of anabolic resistance animal studies show omega-3 fatty acids augment muscle development steers fed Omega-3s showed improved amino acid efficiency in activated Pathways involved in muscle growth similarly pigs given a high omega-3 diet exhibited larger muscles and markers of improved amino acid absorption in use but more importantly we have human evidence in one study young women taking 5 grams of Omega-3s cut their muscle loss almost in half and increase muscle protein synthesis after two weeks of leg immobilization in another study older adults consuming four grams of Omega-3 daily for two months had an increase in muscle protein synthesis in the presence of amino acids and Insulin interestingly yet another study found that healthy older adults taking omega-3 daily for half a year increased various measures of muscle size and strength in yet another study older adults who consume four grams of krill oil daily for six months improved knee strength grip strength thigh muscle thickness and measures of muscle nerve response there are still open questions for example a consistent theme is that many of the studies are high dose at four to five grams per day does that imply that these effects in muscle only happen at high doses another question we might ask is in what context are Omega-3s more anabolic for example in old age during immobilization or when protein intake is sub-optimal for muscle building which is often for many of us listen to recent podcast guest Dr Chris McLoy explain further you know the series of papers by between a endorphos group I think were the landmark papers in this field where you know they were the ones that did the the showing there synthetic response to amino acid infusion with Omega-3s and they replicated that in in younger people and older people if you look at the difference that the Omega-3s had on the protein synthetic response you thinking there that is huge and then they followed it up with a another study in younger people so kind of led a lot of credence to it and then they followed up with a longitudinal feed and I think it was six months of two grams per day of EP and DHA and the changes there were quite significant I believe it was in I believe it was mass some more too sure strength and at that point you need to see that strong lab very well respected high quality work people Stuart gray then published the paper with krill oil similar uh participant cohort similar duration and replicated what had been shown by patina mittendorfer then you something really going on here um and then you know we protection against issues atrophy in young women so there uh body of evidence that suggests that Omega-3s are anabolic and they seem to be anabolic particularly in in older adults not just from a pretty synthetic point of view but also from the perspective of an a kind of mitigating the declines in in muscle mass and size you can learn more about Dr mclory work and the effects of Omega-3 on skeletal muscle by listening to episode 81 of the found my fitness podcast on Apple podcast Spotify and YouTube get the comprehensive show notes or transcript at foundmyfitness.com forward slash episodes forward slash Chris mcglory	Success

What Alcohol Does to Your Brain (not good... or is it?)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYA98E-r-v0	FoundMyFitness Clips 	but now I want to Pivot to discuss some of the research on alcohol and brain health this is a fascinating area that there are some incredibly insightful studies that can inform us about the long-term effects of alcohol on the brain there Incredibly informative study in this area that I want to lead with because it of evidence as to why any amount of alcohol seems to be detrimental for the brain the title of this study is associations between alcohol consumption and gray and white matter volumes in the UK biobank the UK biobank is a research database with health information from more than half a million European participants and this study included data from about 36,6 78 individuals this study highlights the significant impact even moderate alcohol consumption can have on brain structure consuming just one to two units of alcohol daily equivalent to roughly half to one standard drink in the US is linked to reduced overall brain vol volume this reduction includes both gray matter which consists of neuronal cell bodies and is crucial for processing information and white matter which involves the connections between different brain regions the way alcohol is measured in the study is critical to understanding its effects in the UK where the study was conducted what considered two units of alcohol is equivalent to one standard drink in the US such as a can of beer or a glass of wine this means the detrimental effects on brain volume can occur at low lower levels of alcohol intake than might be assumed by those using UK standards furthermore the study supports existing evidence that alcohol contributes to cerebral volume loss particularly affecting brain white matter this loss impacts areas crucial for memory processing and visual spatial functions in more severe cases like those seen in individuals with alcohol use disorder heavy consumption leads to the loss of neurons in several critical brain regions including the hypothalamus cerebellum hippocampus and amydala areas involved in regulating emotions memory and spatial navigation alcohol has profound negative effects on the brain primarily through its impact on nutritional absorption direct toxicity and inflammatory processes let down these mechanisms first alcohol consumption can lead to a deficiency in thiamine or vitamin B1 which is essential for nerve function and brain health this typically occurs in two ways first alcohol can impair the absorption of thomine from the digestive tract second it can inhibit the body to utilize thomine this is because thomine needs to be converted into its active form by an enzyme that alcohol inhibits additionally this conversion process requires magnesium another nutrient often depleted by alcohol consumption the resultant thomine deficiency can lead to decreased cellular defense against oxidative stress contributing to brain damage some of this damage may be related at ated to iron toxicity thiamine also again known as Vitamin B1 helps maintain the Integrity of the bloodb brain barrier a thomine deficiency could impair the bloodb brain barrier function allowing more iron to deposit into the brain this is known as the brain iron overload and thomine hypothesis and though it is supported by some animal and neuroimaging studies it is yet to be fully validated in humans I will mention one study that observed an association between alcohol consumption and brain iron levels consuming more than seven units of alcohol per week was associated with higher iron levels and worse cognitive function among a cohort of more than 20,000 participants from the United Kingdom I definitely think there is some support for the idea that iron in some way plays a role in alcohol rated cognitive decline acety alahh High toxicity is another mechanism I want to talk about when you drink alcohol your body metabolizes it into acetyl alahh a substance that is toxic to brain cells this compound can damage DNA and proteins within brain cells leading to Cellular dysfunction and cell death neuroinflammation is another mechanism so alcohol affects the gut brain axis as we discussed earlier this is a direct communication pathway linking your GI tract to your brain heavy drinking increases gut permeability this is referred to as leaky gut this can lead to the release of pro-inflammatory cyto kindes into the bloodstream once these cyto kindes are in the bloodstream they cross the bloodb brain barrier they cause infl inflammation within the brain additionally alcohol can increase glutamate the excitatory neurotransmitter it can activate the stress response system further promoting brain inflammation this inflammation is mediated by the activation of microa and asites they immune cells which then release even more inflammatory mediators and cyto kindes resulting in this vicious cycle so the ongoing activation of these Pathways by chronic alcohol consumption leads to sustained inflammation which is detrimental for brain health and it manifests as a significant neuronal loss reductions in brain volume observed during even moderate drinking all of this information doesn rosiest picture of alcohol and brain health and based on this evidence it would probably seem best to keep alcohol intake to below one drink per day however when we take a look at the epidemiological and clinical evidence on the relationship of alcohol to neurod degenerative diseases the story does change a bit research shows that alcohol cognitive function is quite nuanced a number of Studies have found that light to moderate alcohol consumption in Middle to late adulthood is associated with a reduced risk of cognitive impairment and dementia while heavy alcohol use and alcohol use disorder increase the risk for these diseases there are lots of methological differences among the studies in this area so we sense out of this evidence to try to provide some practical recommendations some studies suggest that the risk redu ruction associated with light to moderate drinking may be as high as 26 to 28% for dementia and Alzheimer disease but others suggest that the protective effects may be more modest in one analysis of 10 perspective studies a lower risk for dementia was found to be zero between zero and 7.5 drinks per week or just under one standard drink per day but the lowest risk a 10% reduction occurred at four drinks per week however it the dose dependent response relationship alcohol has with cognitive health so once consumption exceeds about 23 drinks per week which equates to more than 2 and a half drinks per day the risk for dementia significantly increases this suggests that while moderate drinking might offer some protective effects excessive alcohol use certainly outweighs these benefits and poses substantial risks unfortunately some of the studies did not account for the SI quitter bias that we talked about earlier remember that the SI quitter effect occurs when studies include both former Drinkers and lifetime abstainers in the non-drinking group which can artificially increase the risk for adverse Health outcomes in the abstainers compared to light to moderate drinkers this is especially important for brain health because the lasting effects of former heavy alcohol use on the brain may not be completely reversible after someone stops drinking although there is some evidence of a a partial recovery of brain white matter in former heavy alcohol users after a period of abstinence however even studies that do account for the sick quitter effect have found a beneficial association between light to moderate drinking and the risk for dementia in middle-aged and older populations whereas heavy drinking is often associated with a greater risk so a study of adults between 35 and 55 years old found that abstinence from alcohol in midlife was associated with a 40% greater risk of dementia when compared to light to moderate alcohol consumption this is of 1 to 14 units per week an association that was still significant after taking former Drinkers and abstainers into account drinking more than 14 units of alcohol per week was not associated with a greater risk of dementia however among adults consuming more than 14 units per week each seven unit per week increase in alcohol consumption was associated with a 177% increase in dementia risk a protective effect of light to moderate drinking seemed to be mediated by cardi metabolic disease so rates of which were higher in abstainers we cardiometabolic Health when we discuss the mechanisms that could explain the protective effects of alcohol on brain related diseases another comprehensive analysis brings together data from over 15 International Studies focusing exclusively on adults over the age of 60 this age specifically is crucial because it addresses a popul ation at an increased risk for cognitive decline in dementia the study accounts for what quitter effect again this bias where individuals who have stopped drinking due to health issues might skew results if considered alongside lifelong n drinkers so in this study drinking categories were defined as follows occasional drinkers consume about one drink per week light to moderate drinkers consume up to two drinks per day moderate to heavy drinkers have about three drinks per day and heavy drinkers consume more than three drinks per day the findings are quite revealing compared to those who abstain from drinking occasional and light to moderate drinkers had a 22% lower risk of developing dementia those who drank moderately to heavily saw an even greater reduction with a 30% decrease risk however drinking more than three drinks daily did not show a statistically significant increase in dementia risk compared to abstain ERS additionally when isolating the data to only include current drinkers the differences in dementia risk between light to moderate and moderate to heavy drinkers were no longer statistically significant so this suggests that while moderate alcohol consumption might be associated with a reduced risk of dementia moderate tohey or excessive drinking does not have greater protective benefits and may Plateau or even potentially lead to negative outcomes so what can we take away from this study is that moderate alcohol consumption particularly less than two drinks per day might have a protective effect against dementia and older adults however escalating to higher levels of alcohol intake does not seem to provide additional benefits and could be risky I would say one noteworthy limitation of this study is the age of participants which was 72 years because none of the participants had been diagnosed with dementia at the time of the study it quite possible that these people had already a low General risk for dementia in the first place so the results might not apply to the general population or people with a genetic predisposition to dementia so speaking of genetic predisposition now might be a good time to bring up APO lipoprotein E3 and apol lipoprotein E4 this is a topic that many people including Fami Fitness members who submitted questions for this podcast may have concerns about so there significant interaction between genetics and lifestyle factors that affects our brain health as we age one specific area of interest is the apoe for alil it genetic variation that is known to increase the risk of Alzheimer and dementia so APO lipoprotein e or APO e is a gene that provides the instruction for our body to make APO lipoprotein e which combines lipids cholesterol and triglycerides to form lipoproteins there are three common variations or alals of the apoe gene apoe 2 apoe3 and apoe4 the apoe4 Le is associated with an increased risk of dementia and Alzheimer earlier age of onset of these diseases in some populations around 15 to 25% of people have one copy of the apoe4 alil and 2 to 5% carry two copies having one copy of this apoe4 ail elevates Alzheimer to having no copies and having two copies of the apoe4 AIL can increase the risk of Alzheimer if you want to determine whether or not you do this by ordering a genetic test kit from one of the many available services such as 23 andme ancestry DNA and you can also run a free genetic report to determine your apoe status by uploading your genetic data to the F my Fitness website very few Studies have investigated whether ape4 modifies the association between alcohol and Dementia or Alzheimer evidence suggests that the risk of dementia increases along with increasing alcohol consumption in people with one or more copies of the apo4 AIL but not in people without the apo4 AIL so carriers of the ape4 AIL who consumed alcohol less than once a month still had 2.3 times greater risk of dementia than carriers who never drank and carriers who drank several times per month had 3.6 times greater risk of Alzheimer disease so to put it another way increasing alcohol consumption in midlife increases dementia risk only in adults carrying one or more copies of the apoe4 AIL at least when alcohol consumption stays below the threshold discussed earlier another study of older adults aged 59 to 71 years old found something similar for cognitive decline like previous studies adults who reported consuming two or more alcoholic drinks per day had no copies of the apil we4 AIL had a 30 to 74% lower risk of cognitive decline compared to non-drinkers on the other hand for adults with one or more copies of the apoe4 alil any alcohol was associated with a greater risk of cognitive decline with 90% greater risk for two or less drinks per day a 170% increased risk for 2 to five drinks per day and a 730% increase risk for five or more drinks per day not all studies support a lower threshold for the negative effects of alcohol on dementia risk such as one meta analysis published in 2017 which actually found a protective effect of alcohol consumption up to 14 drinks per week among apil we4 carriers while protection was only observed up to seven drinks per week among non-carriers if we consider all these results I think it a single copy of the apoe4 AL you should limit your drinking to occasional but zero drinks appears to be the smartest choice to maximally reduce your risk of developing Alzheimer dementia in any case ape4 carriers don appear to experience the protective effect of light to moderate alcohol consumption that non-carriers have whereas most other epidemiological studies show that light to moderate drinking is associated with a lower dementia risk in people without the ail4 alil understanding how moderate alcohol consumption might positively or negatively impact dementia risk involves delving into the metabolic functions within the body let the key processes involved first one of the Hallmark problems in Alzheimer disease and other forms of dementia is impaired glucose metabolism in the brain the brain effectively is crucial for maintaining cognitive functions alcohol interestingly might help improve the brain potentially due to alcohol increase the presence of insulin sensitive glucose Transporters which help cells absorb glucose more effectively thus supporting better brain function another critical aspect is how alcohol affects cardiovascular health which is directly linked to brain health moderate alcohol consumption has been shown to increase levels of HDL cholesterol HDL plays a protective role in the cardiovascular system by helping remove other forms of cholesterol from your blood and preventing them from forming plaque in the arteries blood coagulation and plate activity may also be involved so Alzheimer dementia are also associated with abnormal platelet activity and other thrombotic factors that can affect blood flow alcohol can reduce platelet aggregation essentially it can make platelets less sticky and less likely to form clots this reduction in coagulation and Improvement in blood flow can be beneficial for brain health by ensuring that the brain receives adequate blood supply which is essential for its function and maintenance there more mechanism I want to discuss and that is alcohol lymphatic system the lymphatic system is our brain system for cerebral spinal and intertial fluid exchange which is most active during sleep it serves a few purposes for one it clears away waste products and metabolites from the intracellular space of the brain via lymphatic drainage vessels in the head and neck these waste products mostly proteins protein aggregates and metabolites are then taken through circulation to the liver where they proteins of major importance here are beta ameloid and Tow both of which which are neurotoxic and have been implicated in the development of Alzheimer disease proper function of the glymphatic system ensures that these neurotoxic proteins don mice acute and chronic exposure for 30 days to a low dose of alcohol of 0.5 gram per kilogram body weight corresponding to about two standard drinks per day for a human actually improved glymphatic activity whereas intermediate and high doses corresponding to about eight and 21 drinks per day for a human impaired glymphatic activity these results line up with all of the evidence that we just discussed on the seeming benefits of light to moderate alcohol consumption on dementia and Alzheimer the detriments of heavier doses if any benefit indeed is due to alcohol it might be via enhanced lymphatic drainage but this probably requires that you avoid the negative impacts of alcohol on sleep because the lymphatic system is most active during this time time sleep is when most of the brain removal occurs we alcohol affects sleep very shortly while the authors of this animal study caution that the results should not be used to make recommendations for alcohol consumption guidelines in humans they do know that this may present a novel cellular and physiological mechanism contributing to the delay and onset of dementia in people with Light alcohol intake namely through lymphatic clearance so at the very least it is an interesting mechanism that should be explored further another interesting yet still debated idea in the realm of nutrition and brain health is the potential neuroprotective effects of compounds found in the non-alcoholic parts of alcoholic beverages like Resveratrol found in red wine Resveratrol is a polyphenol known for its antioxidant in anti-inflammatory properties it has been studied for its ability to protect neurons by neutralizing free radicals reducing inflammation and enhancing neuronal energy metabolism some research has also s suggested that ratol can improve cerebral blood flow and even Aid in the clearance of beta ameloid proteins which are implicated in Alzheimer however there to be made here between the effects of resveratol itself and the effects of drinking red wine while resveratol has been shown to have potential in laboratory studies the actual amount of veratrol in red wine is quite small ranging from about 0.03 mg to 1 MGR per glass to achieve the levels used in pharmacological studies which are often between 50 to 500 milligrams one would need to consume an impractical amount of red wine literally thousands of glasses therefore it consumption of red wine as part of a daily diet provides enough resveratol to have a significant pharmacological effect on cognitive functions or neurod degenerative processes so while resveratol is certainly a beneficial compound found in red wine its concentrations and typical servings are too low to account for the observed health benefits associated with moderate wine consumption this suggests that the other factors perhaps even the alcohol itself or a combination of other compounds and lifestyle factors associated with moderate wine drinkers might be contributing to the protective effects noted in epidem ological studies on cognitive health and other diseases so let brain and hit a few takeaways from the research I relationship with the brain is a tale of complexity and contradiction on the one hand studies show that light to moderate alcohol consumption might reduce the risk of Dementia in individuals without an apoe4 alil which is a known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer protective effect could be due to alcohol health Poss possibly improving blood flow to the brain and reducing inflammation which are crucial factors in maintaining cognitive function there is also some possibility that the glymphatic system activation could also play a protective role but there enough evidence to support this last one yet on the other hand the same light to moderate drinking is associated with decreased brain volume to understand this it the brain structure and function are not always directionally correlated in a straightforward way for instance while reduced brain volume is generally viewed as negative it does not necessarily translate to diminish cognitive function in this context the key might lie in the body mechanisms the brain is highly adaptive and capable of compensating for certain types of structural changes in the context of alcohol consumption while there may be a general reduction in brain volume the remaining neuron networks might adapt in ways that maintain or even enhance cognitive functioning this could could involve the strengthening of synaptic connections or improvements in neurochemical signaling allowing the brain to operate efficiently despite structural reductions however this compensatory capacity is not uniformly distributed across all genetic profiles individuals with the AP forol which is the genetic re variant linked to a higher risk for Alzheimer exhibit the same level of neuro adaptability for example the apoe4 alil has been associated with reduced neurite out growth which is crucial for forming new neural connections this genetic difference means that apoe4 carriers may have less capacity to compensate for brain volume loss or other neural damages that occur with alcohol consumption so it is my opinion that to be on the safe side limiting alcohol consumption to one to two drinks per week on social occasions perhaps weekends is probably not going to give you dementia per se finally if you carrier of one or two of the apil we4 alals zero drinks per day is associated with the lowest risk for neurocognitive diseases you might want to limit your alcohol consumption to only social occasions if ever	Success

Can't improve your VO2 max? This could be why	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq1RdtVaW8Q	FoundMyFitness Clips 	But for people that are not doing such long hours of training, there have been studies that have shown that even people that are meeting the 2 and 1 half hours of moderate intensity exercise, you know, per week, if they this sort of zone 2 training, you know, where they vigorous zone, um, a lot of up to 40% of people have a hard time improving their V2 max and they non-responders. And so, why is that? Why are they not responding to you know cardiovascular just simple endurance training se 70% max heart rate let or below so about moderate intensity exercise and um it why but it isn adaptations to allow them to improve their V2 max and so when you take those nonresponders and then have them engage in vigorous intensity exercise then they cardiorespiratory fitness again coming down to that adaptation where you putting a greater stress on the cardiovascular system and there therefore your body is responding to that stress with a variety of different beneficial you know response pathways.

The best way to remove microplastics from your water	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IM_NHxKjhBo	FoundMyFitness Clips 	There traveling, it water out of a plastic bottle, but for the most part, trying to not drink water out of a plastic bottle is is is really advisable because that is a a big source of microplastics. And then if you can get a well, first of all, any type of activated carbon filter will filter out a lot of the plastic associated chemicals. Um, but if you really want to filter out all these microplastics in all their sizes, including nanoplastics, a reverse osmosis filter at home, whether it just drink your water out of or it whole whole home filtration system, is the is the way to go because it does filter out even the nanoplastics.

How Stress Depletes Your Magnesium Levels | Dr. Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf7RjJQZixw	FoundMyFitness Clips 	the other area I want to kind of dive into and I find very interesting with respect to where magnesium plays a role in physiology is the stress response so the stress response that your body experiences involves the production of hormones stress hormones like adrenaline cortisol those stress hormones can potentially lead to a reduction or depletion of magnesium levels in the body so these hormones are released during times of stress and then subsequently your body uses up more magnesium ium to try to help manage the the stress reactions so what ends up happening is this can reduce overall amounts of magnesium available for other functions of the body so to better understand how stress hormones like adrenaline can lead to magnesium deficiency or lower magnesium levels and its clinical implications there was a study by white at Al that looked at how adrenaline which is a well-known stress hormone affects our magnesium levels and what they found I personally thought was an interesting study um they found when adrenaline was infused into people it didn temporarily lower magnesium levels these levels stayed significantly reduced even an hour after stopping the adrenaline infusion without showing any immediate signs of bouncing back so in other words the adrenaline immediately lowered magnesium levels and those levels stayed low for quite some time there there have been a range of studies that have found that stress exposure things that are stressful and are known to increase cortisol adrenaline can influence magnesium levels both in blood and urine so for example young adults undergoing persistent or even intermittent stress like for example anticipating a military conflict they experience substantial decreases in their overall and plasma magnesium concentrations over 3 months and there is similar results or out comes found um when the impact of shortterm so this is a one day and also a long term which would be like a month of sleep deprivation on magnesium levels was examined so this was done in healthy men and both short-term and long-term sleep deprivation caused reduction in magnesium red blood cells so the the the magnesium levels in red blood cells with the long-term sleep deprivation having the the most robust impact another study found an increase in anxiety levels and a corresponding rise in urinary magnesium excretion in University students during exam time so that would indicate if you magnesium in your urine that you are not uh absorbing it and and and using it in in your body in another related study this was done um over the course of four weeks this was post exams researchers found a significant reduction in the concentration of magnesium in red blood cells among college students yet again sort of solidifying how the stress response will lower magnesium levels so yet another study confirmed this this was done um in in people that were impact they were affected by noise exposure so they had been subjected to noise exposure and their magnesium levels of course went down after the after the noise exposure and their urinary excretion peaked after a few hours and it continued for up to two days so it seemed like there was some sort of long-term effect with respect to excreting more magnesium through urine which is something I mentioned that alcohol also does just from that stress response from the the very loud noise exposure it magnesium levels respond not only to mental stress but also physical stress like exercise so acute or shortterm stress can lead to a brief spike in our blood magnesium levels this is a phenomenon known as transient hyper magnesia this has been observed in the aftermath of like short intense exercise sessions lasting around 20 minutes but after pushing your body hard it appears it rallies the Magnesium resources probably to Aid in the energy production you know and other vital functions but when you start to engage in a more prolonged let initial elevation in magnesium is not found and it seems like there threshold after which your body does not respond in that way and um magnesium levels then have been noted to go below what your Baseline resting levels are so exercise does deplete magnesium but let physical stress can decrease magnesium so the body responds to stress through a process that many will recognize as the fight or flight response so this is primarily activated by the adrenal glands uh the hormones adrenaline and cortisol rapidly increase during this response they responsible for preparing the body for that for Action Now part of this preparation involves the mobilization of magnesium which is a crucial co-factor for enzymes that drive energy production and utilization in the form of ATP so during this stress response the body rapidly pulls magnesium from the cells causes a temporary surge in serum serium magnesium levels but the catches this mobilization of magnesium is not an infinite resource so as the stress continues it magnesium and it and then and then expelling it through the body through urination which then gradually depletes our overall Body store of magnesium and then there is often considered the prim the body primary stress hormone so when cortisol levels rise it signals to the kidneys that they need to kick into turbo mode and start expelling more magnesium out of the body this action further reduces our body then on top of all this stress also triggers certain hormones that can affect The Balancing Act of magnesium in our body especially in in in organs like the gut kidneys and the bones so these hormones can result in less magnesium getting absorbed in the intestines more getting expelled from the kidneys as I just mentioned leading to this downward spiral in magnesium levels if we don replenish it properly	Success
The 4 Most Important Players for Muscle Mass - Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm6voqsG5Jg	FoundMyFitness Clips 	all right Chris says H Rhonda in an interview a long time ago with Joe Rogan you mentioned two supplements that counteract muscle atrophy oric acid and to uh tomato deine that they were looking promising has there been any more research on their usefulness in preserving muscle in older adults um I will say this the most important players for muscle mass are protein intake at least 1.6 gram per kilogram body weight resistance training any anything you can do body weight exercise that that anything then after that would be omega-3 so you want to have more of the um higher higher uh two you going to get to the two to four gram triglyceride form range and uh heat from either a sauna or hot tub so um both omega-3 and heat worked work on um basically preventing disuse atrophy which is a pretty pretty big problem in older adults so like when they physically active you know when you not doing resistance training um you know atrophy sarcopenia these things these you so Omega both omega3 seems to sensitize amino acids your muscle um to amino acids uh that are anabolic like Lucine and so it kind of almost seems to help make um a lower dose of protein more more effective in other words you getting more bang for your buck with the same dose of protein that hypothesis at least from Dr Chris mcclory uh you know more more work to really confirm that but um it working hypothesis right now heat from the sauna there studies on that that really seem to suggest that heat is is uh preserving and and preventing muscle atrophy and possibly even in combination with resistance training uh more adabolic than resistance training Itself by itself so you know more more work needs to be done on that but I would say I would focus on those things those are the major players	Success

Avoid These Common Sources of Harmful Microplastics	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvjr9kpM9m4	FoundMyFitness Clips 	Plastics are everywhere every week without even realizing it we are consuming the equivalent of an entire credit card in plastic we are unknowingly ingesting and inhaling millions of plastic particles every year and these tiny particles aren passing through they our organs and our tissues in early 2024 human brain samples were found to have on average 0.5% plastic by weight in the reproductive system higher levels of plastic like PBC have been linked to lower sperm counts and it doesn there these microplastics are often made from or contain harmful chemicals like BPA BPS phalates these are widely used to harden Plastics make them more durable and these chemicals are known to disrupt hormones they alter metabolism they issues from reproductive problems to neurodevelopmental diseases but how are these microplastics entering our body IES and why are they so pervasive the primary roots of exposure are oral ingestion and inhalation we them through bottled water through tap water packaged foods and even fresh produce that Soil and Water we microplastic particles suspended in the air especially in herban environments where synthetic clothing fibers and degraded plastic waste become airborne and they don are accumulating they in the lungs liver heart brain reproductive organs and even in the placenta this widespread presence raises critical questions about what these microplastic particles might do to our health could they be disrupting our cells altering our brain function contributing to chronic disease in today the reality of microplastic exposure we particles get into our bodies and what it might mean for our long-term Health we be influenced everything from our brain health to our reproductive health and importantly we actionable steps to reduce our exposure to them and help our bodies get rid of them whenever possible microplastics are everywhere and they really small we particles ranging from 5 millimet in size so that of rice all the way down to a 100 nanometers which is about a thousand times smaller than a grain of sand when they nanoplastics and these particles are the result of larger plastic items breaking down over time through a process called oxidation so this is a slow but Relentless breakdown process actually more than 70% of microplastics come from this breakdown from larger Plastics while the rest are intentionally added to everyday products like micr beads and cosmetics fibers in our synthetic clothing and also industrial Plastics use in manufacturing but here issue we microplastics almost constantly and it happening through two primary Roots oil ingestion and inhalation so think about that when we food or simply just breathing we taking in microplastic particles and the numbers are actually staggering the average person inhales or ingests up to 120,000 microplastic particles per year from sources like tap water bottled water and packaged foods and it just the obvious items microplastics have been detected in Seafood in fruits and vegetables because they contaminated in our water in our soil and also in the air around us which lands on the fruits and vegetables also we have utensils cups baby bottles like plastic items that we and these things are shedding microplastics directly into the food and drinks that we consume tap water alone can account for the ingestion of anywhere between 220,000 to 1.2 million microplastic particles per year depending on the source studies show that people who drink bottled water exclusively could consume up to 990,000 more additional plastic particles per year compared to those who only drink tap water so the contamination in bottle water is often due to that breakdown of plastic through the oxidation process itself why does this matter because while tap water contamination often comes from environmental sources bottle water brings an additional layer of plastic leeching from the packaging itself into what we about it well one solution we into later is using a reverse osmosis water filter which can filter out not just microplastics but also nanoplastics and other contaminants it of the most effective tools we have for cutting down our exposure to microplastics and nanoplastics in our water but before we go deeper I want to highlight another really unsettling aspect of microplastics their role as carriers for harmful chemical additives so Plastics often are infused with chemicals such as BPA BPS phalates and the pasas these are the for forever chemicals and they to enhance the durab durability and flexibility of the Plastics and so these chemicals come with significant health risk which we detail in a moment but take BPA for example or even it these compounds can mimic estrogen in the body leading to hormonal imbalances that affect everything from reproductive Health to brain function actually a study published in the Journal of hypertension found that drinking from aluminum cans lined with BPA containing resin can increase blood pressure within just a few hours which is really a clear indicator of immediate impacts on our cardiovascular system from these endocrine disrupting chemicals like BPA phalates are another group of chemicals that are commonly used to make Plastics more flexible they linked to endocrine disruption reproductive issues and developmental problems in children research actually has reported that higher levels of phalates correlate with decreased testosterone levels in males affecting everything from muscle mass to mood then there the perr and poly floral alkal substances they chemicals I past throughout the podcast but the reason they chemicals is because they resist breaking down in the environment and they accumulate in our bodies over time so pasts are used to make products resistant to water oil stains they imp they appear in things like non-stick cookware water repellent clothing and even food packaging exposure to past has been associated with immune system suppression thyroid dysfunction and increased risk of certain cancers but what these chemicals can leech out of plastics especially when they or when they or fatty foods so think about that hot takeout container you pour soup in it or plastic water bottles that are left in a hot car in a sunny day many paper cups are lined with plastic and when we pour hot coffee or hot water to make tea into the cup we caffeine boost we are ingesting microplastics that are breaking down from the heat which accelerates the oxidation process and we a slew of chemicals like BPA so one study found that heating polycarbonate bottles to just 100° C can increase the release of BPA up to 55 times and it doesn beverages are stored in cans lined with plastic that can leech these chemicals like BPA andalites into our food especially when that food is acidic or fatty so a recent study found that microwaving food in plastic containers can release over 4 million microplastic particles into a meal in just 3 minutes along of course with the chemicals they carry have you ever microwaved popcorn I have that bag is often lined with the forever chemicals P fast to prevent oil from soaking through the bag when heated these chemical migrate into the popcorn adding of course a chemical burden to our popcorn without us even realizing it remember past are called Forever chemicals because they are very resistant to degradation in fact the half-life in our bodies is from 2 to 5 years it cumulative effect of these exposures that don accumulate over time potentially leading to long-term Health consequences so understanding the sources of exposure is really important for us to be able to take proactive steps to minimize them whenever it means choosing products that are packaged in glass or avoiding microwaving plastic or using popcorn bags or even just bringing our own reusable to go coffee mug to the coffee shop so we when we cover mitigation strategies but I do want to mention unfortunately microplastics are not confined to contaminated food and water they in the air we breathe this allows them to enter our respiratory system where they can then Lodge themselves deep within our lungs in fact this raises significant concerns about potential chronic lung inflammation and other health issues associated with long-term exposure but also breathing in microplastics is one way to get them into our circulation and once they our circulation they can make their way to organs and tissues a major source of Airborne microplastics is actually synthetic textiles used in clothing this is polyester nylon acrylic fibers every time these Fabrics are washed they shed tiny microfibers microplastic particles that can enter waterways and eventually end up in our tap water and our oceans but it contamination these microfibers become airborne as well meaning we inhale them during our regular wear especially when handling laundry indoor dryers can exacerbate this issue if not properly ventilated to the outside although ventilating merely does just shift the microplastic exposure to the environment and contributes to broader air pollution um another significant contributor to Airborne microplastics is tire wear and the degradation of synthetic soles on our shoes so each time we drive or we walk or we run tiny particles of rubber and plastic are worn away and they released into the air and these particles become part of the ambient dust we inhale every day in urban areas with high traffic density this can represent one of the most substantial sources of Airborne microplastic exposure and it want to note this that air pollution including particulate matter like microplastics has been increasingly recognized as an environmental risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer discussed this in great detail in a previous episode episode 79 with neuroscientist Dr Axel Montaine make sure you check that out if you want to dive more into the role of air pollution in Alzheimer	Success

\"This Could Extend Your Lifespan By 5 Years\" - Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdXIoD0puAc	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so let exercise so cardiorespiratory Fitness is probably one of the most important biomarkers that we can measure via V2 Max so maximal oxygen uptake during maximal exercise that really indicates our fitness levels right but it also is a probably one of the most important indicators of longevity and there have shown probably the most important I would say the maximal benefits you get from improving your cardiorespiratory Fitness go from if you and you go anywhere above that so if you just to normal you 2.1 increase in life expectancy if you go below below normal to high normal which is about where half the population lies then you three-year increase in life expectancy and then if you go to like more of an elite level so you above the upper limit that increase in life expectancy compared to where were when you were below normal um and about each unit increase in your V2 Max is associated with a 45-day increase in life expectancy and there was a really important study published in J Journal this was like in 2018 and there since then but I really liked this study because it really sort of showed that there wasn longevity benefit of improving your V2 Max and so people that were in the elite group of V2 Max so this is we like the top 2.1% those people had a 80% lower all cause mortality compared to people that were in the lower 20% or so v2x if you were not the elite but like just you still were really fit you had a high v2x you had great cardiorespiratory Fitness you still had a 20% increase in um all cause mortality compared to the elite athletes like the people that had the really good V2 Max so there seemed to really be a benefit at every level but what was so interesting about this study was that people in that low fitness group they had a low VO2 max their risk of Death and All cause mortality was similar to having diseases like type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease it was similar to smoking I mean these things that everyone focuses on these disease states that everyone focuses on and we know they decrease life quality they decrease lifespan but what people don is how not having not being physically fit not having a good cardiorespiratory Fitness is almost like having one of those diseases and I really think that puts it into to perspective how important V2 Max is for longevity so how do you improve your v2x how do you improve your cardiorespiratory Fitness well aerobic exercise is definitely one of the best ways to do that what type of aerobic exercise I think it clear that high intensity interval training is one of the best ways to improve your B2 Max and particularly when you do longer intervals yes you can improve your your cardiorespiratory Fitness with any type of uh aerobic exercise particularly if you from being sedentary and then going up right but there was a really important study that was published a large large population of people that showed people that are doing Moder intensity sort of zone two like training you know this is the kind of exercise that is more enjoyable you can go run and you can still have somewhat of a conversation you 2 and 1 half hours per week they meeting the guidelines and yet they couldn of those people so you half the population here until they added in some high-intensity interval training and once they like once they added in some high-intensity interval training they were able to improve their V2 Max and so I really think that again this highlights the importance of really trying to get your heart rate up to you know at least 80% max heart rate or more um the question is well what kind of Protocols are best for improving BO2 Max I mentioned longer intervals I think probably you know so Dr Martin gabala does a lot of This research at McMaster University in Ontario Canada and he has talked about you know one minute being sort of like probably the the bare like the minimal effective dose for improving Vmax like at least getting in one doing some one minute intervals and repeating that four or five times but I would I think one of the most evidence-based protocols if you look in the literature out there for improving cardiorespiratory Fitness is the Norwegian 4x4 protocol and this is where you do four minutes of the most in you maintain the intensity that you can for that entire four minutes so you don want to like go out all out in the first minute do you want to be able to like pace yourself it know high intensity exercise followed by three minutes of recovery and you do that four times so it workout but it and it cardiorespiratory Fitness as measured by BO2 max if you are interested in measuring your V2 Max the best way to do it obviously would be directly to measure it go to a lab that measures V2 max if you don those you don um there way of estimating BO2 Max and that really the 12-minute run test or walk test depending on your Fitness level and essentially all you need is a wearable device that attracts your distance and you run you need a flat surface because uh anything hilly will obviously you won challenging so you need like a flat surface like a track field and you run for 12 minutes and you pace yourself you want to you want to go hard but you want to be able to like do it the entire time um and then there look up 12 minute run test equation V2 Max and it this whole equation will give you a really good estimate of your V2 Max for anyone that seeing how their training affects their their V2 Max	Success

This Is How Much Protein You REALLY Need | Dr. Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkClffGJ0DY	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so let intake the optimal amount of protein will not be the same for everyone some people want to build muscle mass some people want to maintain it and others want to improve their body composition by building muscle and losing fat each of these goals requires a more tailored approach the first thing to know is that it needs should be calculated based on a lean body mass or an adjusted body weight reflecting a healthy body fat percentage so for example 12 to 15% for men and around 20% for women this prevents unrealistic targets especially for those who are overweight or obese so when I refer to protein intake in grams per kilogram of body weight per day what I or goal body weight let thing up front the recommended dietary allowance or the RDA for protein of 0.8 gam per kilogram per day is thought by many to be too low this is because the r a was derived from nitrogen balance studies which have limitations due to incomplete collection and inaccurate estimates of amino acid losses the optimal range for daily protein intake is closer to 1.2 to 1.6 gram per kilogram body weight per day or roughly 0.54 to 0.72 G per pound this is based on alternative methods like stable isotope studies which consistently show that higher intakes are necessary to maintain a positive protein balance far above the 0.8 G per kilogram often cited so aiming for at least 1.2 G and up to 1.6 G is what we optimal protein intake there evidence to suggest this for example older adults consuming at least 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day prevented age related losses in lean mass when compared to consuming the RDA of 0.8 G per kilog body weight old older women were also 30% less likely to experience Frailty when consuming protein above the RDA so what is the optimal protein intake for building muscle while resistance training for people engaged in resistance training a protein intake of 1.6 gram per kilogram body weight per day has been shown to maximize gains in lean body mass with a 27% increase in muscle mass over even a 1.2 gram per kilogram intake that really just serves to really underscore how low the RDA really is when you talking about 0.8 grams per kilogram body weight by the way for an excellent discussion of the protein RDA and much more see my interview with Dr Stuart Phillips in episode 76 of the found my fitness podcast there are special circumstances where even a higher protein intake might offer some marginal benefit the first example is people undergoing body recomposition where they are in an energy dep deficit to lose fat Mass while preserving or even increasing muscle mass so let more about body recomposition and weight loss a higher protein intake tends to improve satiety it helps you feel Fuller for longer and may help prevent overeating for people who want to lose weight this is a major benefit eating more protein is also essential during weight loss to prevent the loss of lean body mass when you eat a higher protein calorie restricted diet more weight loss comes from fat mass than muscle mass but remember resistance training is also important to prevent the loss of lean mass high protein diets may also cause a slight increase in the metabolic rate due to the thermic effect of food helping you burn a few more calories throughout the day the second example where a higher protein intake above 1.6 gram per kilogram may be beneficial is with professional athletes where extremely marginal improvements in muscle protein synthesis gives them an edge on competition so in this scenario this is where up to 2.2 gam of protein per kilogram per day or one gram per pound May provide marginal benefits despite common misconceptions a very high protein intake is not harmful to Kidney Health in people without pre-existing kidney conditions research consistently shows that high protein diets are safe for most people and any concerns over kidney damage are largely unfounded so let early interpretations of certain studies suggested that excessive protein intake might overwork the kidneys while protein restriction can slow the progression of kidney disease in some individuals we now know this does not imply that a healthy people should limit their protein consumption higher protein diets do induce changes in kidney function but they do not overburden the kidneys The observed increase in markers and kidney function is a normal adaptive response to eliminate Ura and other waste products generated during protein metabolism this is entirely normal for individuals with healthy renal function so current evidence does not support an association between higher protein intake and kidney disease among healthy adults or those at risk such as individuals with obesity hypertension or even diabetes moreover research and athletes has shown that consuming protein intakes as high as 3.2 to 4.5 grams per kilogram of body weight per day for up to one year does not cause any adverse changes in kidney function and is considered safe this intake is four to six times higher than the RDA for protein and emerging research even suggests that higher protein intake may actually be beneficial for people with chronic kidney disease some Studies have found that consuming protein at levels above the RDA is associated with reduced mortality risk in this population challenging the traditional approach of protein restriction the bottom line we can finally put to rest the myth that high protein diets harm healthy kidneys it aspect of protein intake and that often and when we should consume it we consume our daily protein intake whether we should spread it evenly across 3 to four meals or load it up into one or two meals second and related does protein have to be consumed within a critical anabolic window or timed with our workouts in short the answer to both of these is that factors are less important overall than you might expect emerging evidence reveals that the body can effectively utilize even very large protein doses this challenges the notion that protein must be meticulously spread over multiple meals to maximize muscle protein synthesis even though an even daily protein distribution is ideal this doesn total amount of protein in fewer high protein meals is ineffective protein distribution is important but not vital when you eat a larger dose of protein it takes longer to digest but your body will eventually use it this is contrary to what some people think happens when you consume more than 20 to 25 grams of protein in a single meal they think that the excess protein will just be excreted by the body and otherwise wasted in fact a study by Dr Luke vanloon and colleagues found that consuming 100 grams of protein after exercise led to a more robust and prolonged anabolic response than did 25 grams of protein but had negligible effects on amino acid oxidation the conclusion from this study was quote the magnitude and duration of the anabolic response to protein has no upper limit in humans and has been severely underestimated end quote this dispels a few myths about how the body can use only 20 to 25 grams of protein at once as a practical takeaway a more evenly distributed pattern of protein intake throughout the day is probably what we should be striving for but evidence like this highlights why more and more experts seem to be aligning on the simple fact that the vast majority of us athletes or not should be thinking about protein intake from the standpoint of total daily intake with less overall focus on factors like timing or the per meal intake another question that people have regarding protein timing is whether protein needs to be consumed immediately after exercise to enhance the effects of training this idea is known as the anabolic window the anabolic window is a period after exercise typically lasting from 30 minutes to 2 hours during which the body is primed to absorb and utilize nutrients particularly protein and carbohy hydrates for muscle repair and growth it occurs because the body ability to synthesize protein and replenish glycogen stores is heightened aided by exercise induced hormonal changes like increased insulin levels consuming 20 to 40 grams of high quality protein often paired with carbohydrates can enhance Muscle Recovery and growth during the anabolic window or so it was one reveals that muscle protein synthesis remains significantly elevated for a full 24 hours following exercise effectively debunking the notion of a very narrow anabolic window lasting only a few hours furthermore supplementing with protein before exercise has the same effects on body composition and strength compared to supplementing with protein immediately after exercise in other words there are no meaningful differences between pre and post exercise protein ingestion this means that you to consume protein in relation to exercise so long long as your total daily intake of protein is adequately High to support optimal muscle protein synthesis of course there is definitely no downside to consuming protein immediately after a workout especially for people interested in achieving marginal gains in strength or muscle mass to wrap up our discussion on protein timing and distribution I want to bring up one more strategy to help with muscle building that relates to protein distribution and timing pre- sleep protein there at this one way is through the lens of Tim restricted eating and the other is through the lens of actively optimizing for muscle protein synthesis on training days it Luke Van L and colleagues that protein consumed before bed is digested and absorbed overnight it also increases overnight muscle protein synthesis rates and improves net protein balance in people who had performed resistance training earlier in the day to enhance Muscle Recovery the benefits of pre-sleep protein have also been shown during chronic resistance exercise training consuming about 30 grams of protein before bed every night while resistance training appears to increase muscle mass and muscle strength another thing about pre-sleep protein is that it does not seem to reduce appetite or diminish the muscle protein synthesis response at breakfast the next morning which may have been a concern for some people overall I think pre-sleep protein is just one way to increase total daily protein intake if you don to bed hungry having a low calorie protein shake on training days may have the benefit of potentially enhancing your muscle gain on those training days but don wild we should still be mindful about the fall and insulin sensitivity that happens as we get close to our habitual bedtime and this is particularly true if you summarize some key points about protein timing and distribution first while it not necessary to consume protein immediately after a workout there harm in doing so for those who exercise fasted having a protein Rich meal right after may be beneficial ultimately total daily protein intake is the most crucial Factor second evenly Distributing protein across meals is ideal but your body can use even large protein meals and finally consuming protein before bed isn strategy to boost total daily intake or support Muscle Recovery especially in those who are actively training	Success
The Top 10 Ways to Protect Yourself from Microplastics (easy and effective)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=701k30zzwLM	FoundMyFitness Clips 	all right well let you know the like the things that we can do like what is the like what what is the you know in terms of like Risk and danger like where should our attention be focused I think that question because um otherwise you can drive yourself literally yeah I mean it be like the the boy in the bubble and God forbid that bubble is made out of plastic right right yeah like what are you going to do then oh um like Howard Hughes you be like in the room and you yeah you and then all that plastic from the bubble oh no so I think the worst offenders right so it of like an imperfect solution but really like you really want to sort of avoid the worst offenders when it comes to the worst offenders first of all heating plastic absolutely a no so you want to of course never microwave anything in plastic but also you have to think about these plastic bottles of water like yeah they and grab it out of the fridge but like was it cold when it was on the freight train or the boat or you know wherever it was to get there and how long has it been there in the warehouse before it was in the fridge and probably been exposed to some heat in some shipping container you know coming overseas on you know in the South Pacific or something knows I I would say um now there it a plastic bottle but for the most part trying to not drink water out of a plastic bottle is is is really advisable because that is a big source of microplastics and then if you can get a well first of all any type of activated carbon filter will filter out a lot of the plastic Associated chemicals um but if you really want to filter out all these microplastics and all their sizes including nanoplastics a reverse osmosis filter at home whether it your water out of or it home filtration system is the is the way to go because it does filter out even the nanoplastics now the thing to consider with that is also it filters out essential minerals and Trace elements so you will have to make sure you make or you can even get some drops that are in like a glass bottle to add back to the water mineral drops they they make that you can add back to the water to make sure you essential minerals and Trace elements back water important minerals that it fil there of them another 4our yeah I mean it like magnesium and calcium and uh maganese and iodine and lithium like there are filtered out that that are usually in in the water um so you want to make sure that you taking a multivitamin supplement most of your bases are going to be covered probably but there supplements out there that are just like the it that covers all the ones that are that are filtered out from reverse osmosis alternatively some people like to get these drops that are specifically made for people that have reverse osmosis filters and they one that plastic and then you want to introduce those into your water there filtration systems that will reintroduce the minerals back in um however I sure if those filtration systems are made of plastic so you know you don want to reintroduce the plastic after you just filtered it out so oh my God you know you have to that but but I guess I mean look there million different water water filtration systems out there it know for the average consumer as long as it going to be okay you you like 95% there right and and on that topic of of plastic bottles is there any wisdom at all in I mean not all plastic is the same right like there are different types of plastic bottles and you look underneath and there plastic safe Etc is that all bunk from your perspective as long as it because there that are crinkly you know obviously you know that that this is not good right and then there robust like you know Gatorade comes in you know like so you aren you bring up a good point so the crinkly ones are more like I mean those are like degrading like like they like yeah so that microplastics are being shed like through the degradation process um I would say the black Plastics are like the ones to really avoid and those are like the reason for that is there was a there was a study that came was published last October the problem with the black plastic so think Sushi container or um or like rotiss or any take right rotisserie chicken like container or take takeout you know container um or those black Forks you know that you have at parties or whatever those are often not always but often made of recycled plastic from recycled electronics and the study that was published I forgot the name of a journal it was some kind of environmental uh you know Health Journal um that journal found that those black Plastics like the black plastic spatula for example those Plastics contained a variety of chemic chemicals that um are carcinogen known carcinogens so they have like flame retardants in them things that are just bad bad chemicals and so they worse so you black plastic and especially heating those right so you think of your Togo food it that into your food even more I mentioned that heat you know causes the the leeching of chemicals like BPA 55 times more so you want to you really want to try to avoid those black Plastics also the other The Other M of fenders would be to-go coffee mugs those are most Togo coffee mugs are lined with plastic and that plastic breaks down with heat and BPA and those are you yeah hot in there yeah so is it the same lining that you would find inside like a can of a canned soup or a can of beans it is yeah it is and then also in a can of sparkling water right like those cans are lined aluminum cans are lined with plastic lining to prot protect the aluminum from corrosion from the beverage or food so you think you think you out of a can turns out you drinking out of a plastic L can and God so if you can not drink those every day I had heard about like the the black Plastics but the way I heard about it was through like the spatula version right I hadn thought about like the Togo food packaging and all of that and I think it brings up a another issue that maybe deserves a little elaboration which is which is which is the difference between what we think of as single-use plastic and then the kind of plastic that you know we all have in our houses whether it which it which is like robust and thick and you use plastic like this is probably okay um no especially if you it right because it is cooking heat is accelerating that whole degradation process it is you are shedding microplastics and chemicals into the food so you want to get wooden um utens cooking utensils and also I I would say uh I mean you can use the stainless steel as well but you want to like use stainless steel on a stainless steel pan but avoiding also the pans lined with like non-stick stuff right because that has forever chemicals in it the Teflon stuff so uh yeah I I I still if if you on any type of plastic how robust it seems it doesn is really what breaking it down and it into the the food or the beverage so the heat the heat is the thing to you talking about avoiding the worst Defenders really it anything that your plastic big big time you know try to avoid that the water filters another one and then you know shellfish probably not not something to eat all the time it the shellfish are are they they have unfortunately a lot of microplastics in them and um fish do as well as long as you of the fish you know but it produce as well but you wash your produce you you food packaged in the Plastics now your strawberries come in a plastic container and so you have to wash your strawberries really good right because it it does shed shed particles now it not like those strawberries have been in that plastic container for that long so it and tons and tons of particles into your strawberries right um it that the strawberries take took it up from the soil that with with the plastic um but I think um in terms of consumption that the main um things to to sort of avoid those worst Defenders and then um with respect to breathing it in right like getting a highquality HEPA filter for your house several rooms in your house I mean is it and you can have them you know in multiple certainly in the room you sleeping in so getting a HEPA filter can filter out some of those microplastics as well because they are in our circulation we do breathe them in um unfortunately using a dryer making sure that you ventilation that it outside it because the microplastics are coming from our clothing in fact our clothing is the major one of the major sources aside from the breakdown of the large plastic trash in our ocean which is the major cause of the microplastics in our ocean our clothing is the second major cause so when we our our all of our clothing that fibers um when we wash them that that runoff is going into the ocean and it full of microplastics so um is it is it are the are the nanoplastics part of the clothing also that are being absorbed into our skin do we know this or not like I are like edge cases like this is getting in a Neurosis land I like my vitamin I vitam mix it no get the stainless steel one but it thick yeah like I don plastic one it sometimes like we we in that and blending it up and I thinking like I probably shouldn that no yeah I did the same thing I actually just got in the past you know few months since I did this deep I know there was a stainless steel there stainless steel Vitamix container I I I got it a few months ago and it it in-laws anyone in my family that uses Vitamix I it container because it Vitamix that you have um unfortunately friction does increase the shedding of microplastic so blending itself also affects it but yeah I I I was doing the same thing I was doing the same thing I mean I don know what I mean yeah I mean look you can you can you can take this to the X degree right like you can you can definitely go down that rabbit hole but if there is a stainless steel Vitamix container why not get it if you can it not super expensive and you know it not going to hurt so why not get it I I would say um but that focus I I would say we them the worst of vendors right talk to me about how salt contributes to this problem yeah so salt especially sea salt right if you getting it from the ocean which is polluted with microplastic so sea salt is um is a contributor of micr Plastics to people and I you know you buy it in a PL little plastic in a plastic container exactly and so um if you salt it like you know pink chalayan salt which also does have microplastics but less it has fewer particles than sea salt does uh so you know salt is also a contributor um I don the main main contributor but um if if you salt rather than the the sea salt or even the Morton like the old Morton salt you know that was like at everyone table 20 years ago those are rock salts as well and should we be concerned about the receipts that were given every single day I is there is there truth to this um I mean I I avoid like putting my hands on it just because this is what I but I haven know how like how robust of a problem this actually is um so receipts are made of thermal paper which are just heavily coated with BPA and I think the first study came out gosh almost 10 years ago I remember reading it 10 years ago and um it it was a study that was uh looking at people that had put lotion on their hands and then touched the the thermal paper the receipt and it was like the BPA that got into their circulation was like AST astronomical I mean so usually trans dermal absorption isn that big of a deal like you know so we not like I through my through my skin very easily from the clothing I really it ends up in the water table results yeah and sometimes you know if you exercising in in that clothing maybe you the majority of the particles that you your clothing directly they from the air from the other sources right uh but I do think that people that are that h i I also try to avoid receipts and so I always opt for no receipt or can you trash it for me but I do think people that work in you know in in Industry where they handling them all day long yeah they should be wearing night trial gloves so that there have been now studies showing that people that handle handle thermal paper which is the the receipts and they blocks the BPA from being absorbed in their skin and so um I don did the same thing it really had to be a nit trial glove so anyone that industry that really should be wearing gloves it it it should it should be something that I think all you know companies employ like to protect their I mean people don about this right I think I think that they they should be told so I mean you behind a cash register and dealing with those BPA receipts and I told you the study came out showing that you know pregnant women with higher urinary BPA have sixfold you know higher likelihood of having a child with autism so yeah there there are little steps that can be taken that um that I think you know there bang for your buck right and and certainly if you industry where you receipts you should be wearing nitrol gloves	Success

Does Grounding Actually Reduce Inflammation? - Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WN3lvhjwOAk	FoundMyFitness Clips 	okay so this next question I happy to to address because there lot of hype around it and this question was submitted by Gary Turner and Gary says what are your thoughts around all this hype about grounding and um you know I of people ask me that and sort of my my my gut reaction is oh there there could be something to it but I really don probably a lot more hype to it so grounding is it earthing it used to make physical like direct physical contact with the Earth so you electrically with the Earth like that sort of the the theory behind it and proponents of grounding claim that it offers a variety of health benefits including reduced inflammation improved Sleep Quality decreased pain just enhanced overall mood and well-being a lot of a lot of very strong claims here and you know this these claims have really I think attracted a lot of enthusiasm certainly a lot of attention but the scientific evidence supporting these Health claims around grounding is extremely limited and it really does require I would say Critical examination so at the core of grounding the hypothesis is that the Earth possesses a mild negative charge and that by connecting with the Earth the human body can sort of balance positive charges particularly what are called free radicals so these are associated with oxidative stress they associated with inflammation these things caught can play a role in exacerbating and accelerating a variety of diseases right so this concept suggests that grounding could potentially and theoretically neutralize these this oxidative stress in the body and then you get a variety of health benefits because of the neutralization of these you know free radicals which by the way this is what things like polyphenols do antioxidants sulfurane right so so the idea is that somehow contacting with the negative charge in the Earth is going to do something similar and there that have explored the potential effects of grounding on health but there are so many methological limitations in these studies that I would say you really cannot make very you can claims that grounding is is improving all these things in in in my opinion so for for example the biggest problem is that you know you studies are not randomized right and they subjective markers rather than biomarkers so you know for example you inflammation you measure inflammatory biomarkers that would be actual data to show inflammation is improved instead it it feels better they feel like they can walk more and they very subjective measure that is very very prone to for one the placebo effect but honestly you know anything that directly affecting oxidation which is what the claim is here is very easy to prove or disprove with data right because there can measure in blood that measure oxidative status and infl inflammatory status so I would say my conclusion is it of potential it could be that people just don the right types of tests or I don honestly the data does not support that grounding is like if you reduce inflammation and oxidative stress I mean I can I can rattle off many more things that are way more powerful and potent and evidence space than grounding right so omega-3 fatty acids one of the most potent you know inflammatory mediators that we have um exercise as well I mean exercise is very anti-inflammatory and and also improves oxidative markers as well uh you know sulfurane is another one really improves oxidative stress biomarkers I mean time and time again studies showing that so I just don grounding would be something that I would put high on my list in terms of improving oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers	Success
The role of zinc in immunity | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpiyT_7xSDg	FoundMyFitness Clips 	The RDA for zinc is 11 milligrams per day\\nfor adult males and 9 milligrams a day for females. Approximately 8% of the U.S. population has\\ninadequate zinc intake, and up to 45% of people, 60 and older, have inadequate zinc intake. Zinc deficiency in the U.S. is rare. People that consume alcohol or vegetarian\\nmay require more zinc. Alcohol increases zinc excretion by 50%. Vegetarians are getting their zinc from plant\\nsources, which has zinc bound to phytate and lowers its bioavailability. Vegetarians are getting their zinc from plant\\nsources, which has zinc bound to phytate and lowers bioavailability. Vegetarians may need to consume up to 50%\\nmore of the RGA for zinc in order to get adequate levels. Zinc has been shown to play a role in pneumonia. A randomized control trial in about 600 elderly\\nindividuals, given a multivitamin that contains zinc for 1 year found those individuals with\\nthe highest zinc levels after supplementation were almost 50% less likely to get pneumonia. Another randomized control trial in hospitalized\\nchildren found that 20 milligrams of zinc per day reduced pneumonia symptoms by 30%\\ncompared to a placebo. A meta-analysis of 6 randomized control trials\\nfound that zinc supplementation in children reduced pneumonia prevalence by 41%. Zinc has also been shown to play a role in\\nthe common cold. A meta-analysis of three trials, found that\\nsupplementation with zinc acetate loss hinges around 80 to 90 milligrams a day found that\\nthey had a threefold faster recovery rate from the common cold compared to a placebo. Another meta-analysis of seven separate trials\\nusing either zinc acetate or zinc gluconate lozenges found they reduced the common cold\\nduration by 33% compared to placebo. Doses lower than 75 milligrams per day, have\\nnot been shown to have an effect on the common cold. So let Studies have shown that mild zinc deficiency\\nmay decrease immune function, including dysfunctional cytokine production in T-cells and regeneration\\nnot occurring in CD4+ T cells. Multiple in vitro studies have found that\\nzinc inhibits the replication of RNA viruses, but this is in vitro. Zinc is a positively charged ion, so it cannot\\nget into the cell without a transporter. But there is another way that zinc can get\\ninto the cell without a transporter, as zinc ionophore can help transport zinc across the\\ncell plasma membrane. And this can help zinc get into the cell.	Success

Can high-intensity exercise improve glucose regulation & insulin sensitivity?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_yPUgQsZ1o	FoundMyFitness Clips 	vigorous intensity exercise high intensity interval training when when that lactate production accumulates it stimulates the expression and activity of glucose Transporters known on the muscle known as glute 4 and this is on the muscle cell membrane and so that lactate acts as a signaling molecule to increase the transport of glucose Transporters on on the muscle cells and this then allows for more efficient uptake of glucose into the um from the bloodstream into the muscle even at rest and so consequently then insulin sensitivity is also improved and blood glucose levels are better regulated there demonstrated that hit can improve glucose uptake enhance insulin sensitivity and decrease the risk of developing type 2 diabetes this may be due to the intense metabolic stress created during hit which leads to Greater activation of glucose transport great glucose Transporters um and improved glucose clearance	Success

Check These Biomarkers on Your Next Blood Test - Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU-s3HupcaY	FoundMyFitness Clips 	dear Dre sorry if I butchered that name um asked hi Rhonda for the average healthy person what diagnostic tests would you suggest for managing Health as you age you have recommended some tests like the omegas or microbiome tests in the past could you give a list of which types of tests could be done periodically to inform you know preventative actions like um yeah so the caveat being that I am not a medical doctor obviously I can mention some of these clinical markers that I you know time and time again with my discussions with the experts uh in my own research scholarly Pursuits I come across I think there that I try to keep an eye on in collaboration of course with my you know qualified medical professional so um just keeping just keeping that in mind obviously we and I think one of the most important things is the the basic lipid panel uh I maybe I shouldn um there aren of have to ask but like you can you can ask your your general practitioner to measure a lot of these things and they will do it for a fraction of the cost that you will find on some of these other consumer available tests um so some of the things I think are important obviously you cholesterol and all that but HDL particle number and size LDL particle number and size triglycerides um vldl HDL to the triglyceride ratio the tri like when you get all that stuff you can get all these ratios the triglyceride to the HDL ratio the vldl to the triglyceride ratio um non-hdl the percent of small dense LDL so when you get the particle size you get all the particle sizes um APO B part so APO B particle um number the APO A1 APO B to APO A1 ratio uh LPA you know these are some of the just basic I think lipid lipids that should that are important um you know obviously cardiovascular dis disease is uh the number one killer globally at least in all the developed countries and so um those are the these lipid you know biomarkers are are things to keep an eye on and um of course in addition to that you know doing the homocysteine so it acid in the blood that might be linked to heart disease if levels are too high so homosysteine kind of included in that it cardiovascular health panel obviously the basic metabolic panel so like you measuring things like glucose calcium electrolytes this is giving information about kidney function um you know muscle function heart function to some degree um hemoglobin a A1c so HB A1C that really shows the average blood sugar levels or blood glucose levels over the last two to three months so um that important fasting insulin level um that resistance which obviously is a precursor to type 2 diabetes then there inflammatory biomarkers that can be done obviously including high high sensitivity C reactive protein um fibrinogen is another one um that can be done thyroid function tests so you want to do you know the the TSH free T4 T3 and possibly the thyroid antibodies to assess thyroid Health complete blood cell count you want to just look at all the different types of blood cells in the blood like red blood cells white blood cells platelets vitamin D obviously um measuring that is important um the omega-3 index test sex hormones um so testosterone estr diol for example um and perhaps even igf1 could be something interesting as well so I would say those are kind of ones that you could even just get your general practitioner to do you know for like your your I don willing to do it but like you could talk to them and see can we do it quarterly can we do it you know semiannually or something like that um and those are I think those are uh pretty standard ones to do and then there about um you so the omega3 index test Omega Quant is like the leader in that um and then there Diagnostics they do the gut test is really good for them and that anyone sort of optimizing their gut health I think is good it also does some inflammatory markers as well and um markers of gut permeability which I think are are important so I think that is also another sort of good test to do alongside as well with with the um just general sort of you know lipids and metabolic and omega-3 tests LP is saying do you have any online Labs that can fill the Gap after Wellness FX closed um yeah so Wellness F they tests performance or premium um that are now being sold through Thorne so Thorne owned Wellness effect so they still going to be providing a couple of the main most popular test um if you interested in having um you know the same sort of panels that were done with like the performance test which I like I used them um as well um life extension is another one that I also use and that where you they cardiovascular panel and then you can like add stuff or like you can just like mix and like you can choose like like you can create your own sort of panel that you want to do as well they another option so again Wellness effects a couple of their tests are still being offered um from Thorn and then uh I I think life extension is the other the other one that I I use as well and then I mean again just going to your physician and you know using you know it through them uh as well it possibility	Success
Why you shouldn't use a sauna hotter than 200 degrees Fahrenheit	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgxzIZ3i1TI	FoundMyFitness Clips 	people that use the sauna frequently uh had a much lower risk of dementia and Alzheimer weren over 200 degrees Fahrenheit if they were getting in a sauna that was over 200 degrees Fahrenheit they were actually having the opposite effect and I don talk about that a lot because it really understood why and I don to like people to get scared but I do think it kind of highlights the role of like why do you need to go in a 215 Dee like have you it and your brain is in there like so I I don Fahrenheit SAA is the way you have to do it I think you can get in 180 185 if you really want to go 190 yeah like but maybe stop before it gets to 200 to refer right	Success

Can exercise make you less likely to be depressed?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd76_pDC6nA	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so skeletal muscle has the ability to take up a compound known as curine and convert it into chric acid which is a non-toxic metabolite um and it does this by increasing an enzyme on the muscle called curine aminot transferase so this essentially reduces the amount of curine available to then be transformed into other harmful metabolites such as quintic acid in the brain so quintic acid is a neurotoxin that plays a role in depression it plays a role in schizophrenia and neurodegenerative disease um and so this is just one other mechanism by which you know exercise also seems to improve Mental Health	Success
Limit microplastic absorption by making this simple dietary change	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9pW8sXSLRg	FoundMyFitness Clips 	but the other thing that interesting that actually can affect the the the way you absorb these microplastics is Believe It or Not dietary fiber um because so there types of fiber there you know this is what the bacteria in the distal part of your gut this is the colon um they of short chain fatty acids to regulate your immune system and do all sorts of beneficial things for your gut then there just moves stuff through your intestines right the fermentable fiber which is found in fruits and vegetables that um is fermented into like this viscous gel that encapsulates microplastics and nanoplastics and stops them from being absorbed the non-fermentable fiber just like the stuff that moves you know Foods through your through your intestines also just moves the microplastics as well so you through feces more rapidly so those two um those are two ways that fiber actually is beneficial for basically inhibiting the absorption of microplastics and nanoplastics	Success
Is Salt Actually Bad for You? - Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWwQF5gbbXE	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so the next question is actually a deep dive and it hotly debated there there anything there on and on and the topic is about sodium how much sodium can you take in and still be healthy uh what salt can the average P person consume um you know do you really need to use electrolytes is genetics involved there say um I summary and then we kind of dive into this because um again there influencers that have talked about it that still talk about it and you a lot of people that don problem and so I I personally after like my team and I have dug into this I think that excess salt is is definitely bad for health most people the the sodium that is found naturally in foods not that not unprocessed so unprocessed Whole Foods is sufficient for your sodium intake I don to supplement with electrolytes by and large now there are exceptions but generally speaking people are getting a lot of sodium so you know that that there people sensitivity to Salt so there genetics um being female older overweight having a low potassium intake that people that have high blood pressure or impaired kidney function there of factors to consider okay it one-sized fit fits-all increasing sodium loss from things like sauna exercise you know extreme endurance um or exercise you know these all do counteract what is a I would say normally High dietary salt intake however people I think overestimate the amount of sodium that lost in sweat and that can then lead to them sort of doing excessive electrolyte supplementation especially if they unaware of how sensitive they are to sodium so um I think that something to keep in mind like people think they amounts of sodium from their sweat and really you lose sodium from sweat uh but you you think you are people that are keeping their processed food intake to a minimum while doing a lot of intense exercise or sauna and have no specific risk factors I think electrolyte supplements with a small amount of sodium is is reasonable do you need 1,000 milligrams of it probably not probably not like maybe you take half of a element te so with that said you know people might think they processed foods but if you eat out or if you order food from a grocery store that is prepared all these prepared foods even if they seem healthyish they generally speaking I I yet to find a prepared food that um keep in mind that even if think you you lot the the the other people preparing food for you you can intake because you putting the salt into it and um it very likely that it hypertension is a real concern about 30% of the population is 30% of hypertension is attributed to high dietary sodium and um that there sodium consumption can have a larger impact on blood pressure than is identified that has than has actually been identified I mean there lot of analysis done that have like estimated you know a 30% reduction in sodium could save 40 million lives within 25 years uh there of that stuff um sodium sources so only a small amount of dietary sodium comes from unprocessed natural food so you getting about less than 700 Mig a day of salt if you type of diet where you you me meats and fish and you them yourself um so I would say that that about 7 700 milligrams or so or less are coming from of salt is coming from that type of diet if you Paleolithic vegetarian type of diet this salt goes even lower it milligram now a lot of people that eat vegetarian unfortunately do not avoid processed foods they actually do eat a lot of there vegetarian foods that people do eat and so I don vegetarians are more prone to you know needing needing more salt but if they are if they Foods diet and they probably they probably are um because because there naturally just in in vegetables and fruits so there was a an enhan examination survey that was done in 2017 2018 found that more than 50% of the US population had their um their their dietary sodium was coming from Pizza breads cured meats soups tacos burritos snacks cheese burgers um mixed cheese dishes cookies cakes you know sausages turke you know lunch meats so those are the major sources of sodium in our diet there controlled trials and I pain of going through them all in detail that have really shown that reducing dietary sodium intake decreases blood pressure in both people with and without hypertension it does it in children does it in adults does it in all ethnic groups it sodium intake reduces blood pressure that there is a lot of nuance that can be found so you can find what are called j-shape and u-shaped relationships with sodium intake and all cause mortality or cardiovascular events cardiovascular mortality which um it you don and you don sodium that generally means okay so let little bit about salt sensitivity so about 1/3 of otherwise healthy individuals and and and about um greater than 50% of those with hypertension the effect of salt intake on blood pressure elevation appears to be exaggerated so people are categorized as either salt sensitive and salt sensitivity of blood pressure is considered an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and death salt sensitivity appears to be determined by genetic factors it determined by race and ethnicity it determined by age it prevalent in women body mass index plays a role as well as diet so there are some genetics and in fact if you do our genetic report we do um we do cover some of the salt sensitive genes some people are uh extremely sensitive in other words uh if they are homozygous for a certain snip that regulates sodium intake they and decrease their sodium intake they will dramatically have dramatic reductions in blood pressure whereas other people without that snip might just have minor reductions if any so so there genetic component in in terms of salt sensitivity African-Americans seem to be really salt sensitive and there of different sodium transporter polymorphisms that have been described to be more common in African individuals and so again um we do cover the sodium Transporters polymorphisms in our genetic report so if you have done any sort of DNA testing make sure you run it through our report to see if you have those those um Snips physical activity obviously plays a role as we mentioned you are excreting sodium in sweat and so physical activity can you know and there improves blood pressure for other reasons not that are completely independent of of sodium itself but if we obviously being Physically Active is going to make you have a lower you less you because you it intake from your diet will have less of an effect for you because you sort of reducing some of that salt by excreting it through sweat on a daily basis	Success

Why I Stopped Adding Bananas to My Smoothies	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nObbzv07pko	FoundMyFitness Clips 	the first question and there was sort of a related question from Stephanie and Steve um about first of all my smoothie so Stephanie says on the call last month you suggested we remind you to cover your smoothies you said you had an update for everyone will you please address your smoothies and then the related question from Steve was about bananas destroying polyphenols and uh Steve asked if I had seen the study and indeed I did see the study and this was the the reason for are updating my smoothie ingredients um so let talk a little bit about that for those of you that are unaware of this this recent study so um it came to my attention that there was you know basically adding a a bananaer smoothie could you know negate and degrade polyphenols and those are obviously beneficial compounds we about them they about in the context of a smoothie usually they berries like blueberries for example are high in polyphenols so there that is in some foods in very high in bananas and it PPO and it basically chews up and degrades polyphenols so um what the this particular study did show was that if you drink a smoothie that example epican so epic iin is a type of polyphenol it is found um very concentrated in green tea I matcha my jade matcha green tea here and cocoa um but it as well and so um the the the pp the PO enzyme degrades epic and therefore reduces the amount of epican that found in plasma in people so and and we more than 80% reduction we just you know astronomical so in a subsequent study people were given you know polyphenols and they were co-ingested with a very high po banana drink and um in this context the metabolites of the epeans or the polyphenols were were reduced um basically suggesting that you know eating and we about what foods are high in po eating foods that are high in po or blending them together even eating them like a banana and blueberries or a banana mixed with blueberries like like I went and got you know an assah Bowl the other day for my son and there was like banana and blueberries and assah and I the banana you know is kind of negating all this so we took the banana out um what the study does not tell us is how high the PO activity needs to be to have a significant effect on epican or polyphenol levels so we can only say that the activity of about 96 international units per milliliter which is um included in a drink that has about 50 grams of berries so including blueberries and blackberries raspberries strawberries these all have the polyphenols um that does not have a significant effect so so 96 international units doesn anything to the polyphenols but when you go really high to almost 9,000 International unit so this is a drink that now contains about 177 gam of banana then you significant effect on lowering the polyphenol levels so um it to I I would say to it extrapolate the results to other Foods because they really only tested the PO activity per Mill of the drink and not per gram of the ingredients uh I I you know the those those polyphenols that were tested also were only the epeans so there was not other types of polyphenols as well um because there are of course a variety of different types of polyphenols I would say it opinion and this is where I talk about a little bit where I a change in my smoothie ingredients um I think it mixing foods that are high the really the the biggest you know food that high in PO is banana um but we about another one in a second so I I would avoid mixing those Foods together in the smoothie and just eating them right back to back um if you you polyphenol so that includes you know cocoa um it includes you know matcha green tea it includes you know all all those types of of blueberries blackberries you know all that stuff that has the polyphenols because it can degrade them and I think that it there might affect your polyphenol levels which is essentially what you don um so some foods that are high in po I I have a chart here so Banana is really the highest so it at the activity of the PO it 3,258 you know units per 100 grams now the other one that beet greens so these are the greens that are like come out of beets and um they per 100 grams and um I would say that what what piqued my interest on the beak greens was I I oh there there leafy green and it kind of looks a little bit like charred and so I started looking up Swiss chard because I often will add as a Swiss chart is a great source of vitamin K1 it of lutein zanthin of you know magnesium calcium there very very um healthy leafy green to eat and so um I would often add it to my smoothie if I had it around in the refrigerator and apparently the the the Swiss Chard is much much like the beet green greens with respect to the PO in fact the first time that enzyme was ever isolated it was isolated from Swiss chard so that made to my smoothie is this was charred apples um particularly red delicious have about 570 um you know so significant drop from like a banana but I would say you know after after that everything else kind of really drops down to almost nothing so like I was concerned about avocados because I add avocados to my smoothie but avocados have a very very low amount of po like 24 um units per per 100 gram so so consider just comparing the same units that we about so I would say um the bananas are the biggest thing Swiss Chard is also the big another big one for me that um I I interesting tidbit of information vitamin C is an inhibitor of Po so obviously I mean the berries themselves have vitamin C you know adding extra vitamin c in there could also help to maintain polyphenol content in smoothies so that of information as well but nonetheless I do think this is I mean it important especially like a lot of kids Smoothies have bananas in them so I think that um you know it information I bananas in in my son some people in the chats were talking about studies being poorly done um I don done it was a small study and it there there was a lot of things that weren tested like I mentioned right I mean um but I think at the end of the day the the the bottom line is that PO is very high in bananas and so a lot of people are adding bananas to their blueberry smoothie essentially um and the other take-home really is like if you so I typically drink my cocoa in the afternoon when I need a little more pickme up I add a small amount to my coffee as well in the morning but you know make sure that you banana and washing down the banana with some cocova right because then you going to be degrading a good portion of those epeans that are doing so many beneficial things in the Coco Villa so I think um it but just having the greater context like having that information in your head oh if I like I shouldn cocoa or my green tea or my blueberries or something with polyphenols so um I think I think those are the most important things and then of course I mentioned the chard um I still you know if I it greens it chug it down for the you know for the for the green or um the best thing I the other thing I like to do with chart is I like to uh you know just do a little bit of like blanching of it and eating them like a little bit just a little bit blanched and I think that good source so um there greens that I would be concerned about there High po activity it beet greens and the Swiss chard so spinach kale Roma lettuce um all of those things all those types of greens are are totally you know fine and they have a low poo content um I think the biggest thing people have to worry about is a lot of people I mean think about any smoothie place you go to like the main staple ingredient in every smoothie is a banana so um I think that bananas are really most people are not putting Swiss chard in their smoothie I mean we do it right like that we but um it think has a broad application here so that was the first question I thought that was a really good um an important you know it wasn comprehensive study but I do think there it and I think that it to you know apply this to our life it not going to make that much of a difference it bananas it them with in combination with polyphenol rich foods and that bottom line with that	Success
This is how much magnesium you ACTUALLY need	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMlf-fLIA6I	FoundMyFitness Clips 	the requirements for magnesium depend on age gender so you know men require a little bit more than women it somewhere like 400 milligrams a day for men and somewhere like 300 to 350 or something like that for women um if you you use the sauna um you actually can require anywhere between 10 to 20% above the RDA because you do lose magnesium through sweat so if half the US population isn then you can imagine the Physically Active people are probably you know fairing even worse because they already they requirements are even higher	Success

Why you should eat most of your food earlier in the day	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPQQcMO0QnE	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so metabolism does change throughout the day I know there when healthy adults eat the same exact meals the same caloric content the same macre nutrient content I mean the exact same meal for breakfast lunch and dinner and you measure their postprandial glucose response it breakfast and it dinner um even though the meals are 100% identical and that really probably has to do with the Melatonin production so melat is something that we naturally start start to produce later in the day um the our levels start to go up and melatonin binds to uh it it binds to receptors on the pancreas and basically signals the pancreas to stop producing insulin insulin is needed to take glucose up into our muscle tissue into um adapost tissue so that means glucose doesn organs it stays in the bloodstream and this can lead to elevated blood sugar levels	Success
Is Nicotine a Safe Cognitive Enhancer?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYO0rXyH0lk	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so the first question we talk about was actually left over from last month and the question was submitted by Michael and Michael says H Rhonda what nicotine is it safe is it effective to increase Focus does it have other health benefits so Michael let down uh from the ground up I think nicotine is this really interesting molecule that at very low doses say a milligram or two possibly three can sharpen attention and reduce anxiety in the short term we do see some data that non-smokers taking 2 milligrams of nicotine gum can do better on certain cognitive tasks but here that 4 milligrams of nicotine actually made performance worse so there evidently a very low sort of narrow sweet spot a minimum effective dose if you will now a big caveat is we don have robust data on the long-term effects especially for people who are micro doing consistently so nicotine is addictive even at modest levels so what starts to happen is maybe a once a week experiment might turn into a multiple times a day habit I how that might spiral especially because nicotine also elevates heart rate and blood pressure which over time can bump up cardiovascular risk and there cancer angle as well this is a bit nuanced nicotine itself isn a full-blown carcinogen but there research linking it to tum t promotion so that or resist therapy so even if you inhaling smoke you compound that may influence the tumor micro environments it may influence angiogenesis that blood vessels that tumors use to sort of metastasize to other areas and it just may influence the promotion of tumor growth in general there is a weight loss angle that people are interested in so yes nicotine does blunt appetite for some people some folks who quit smoking often can gain weight anywhere between 11 to 15 pounds in the first two years which is pretty significant but losing weight via nicotine is really a slippery slope because you short-term gains for a potential addiction and then as they mentioned the potential cardiovascular impacts independent of smoking itself just from the nicotine I how nicotine does act as a potent driver of dopamine in the brain which is why people often say it helps with concentration and motivation so dopamine is essential for wanting for craving for doing something that motivation to sort of move to do something so it surprise that you can probably develop a dependence on something that is tapping into the dopamine System including nicotine in the short term it might give you that sort of crisp mental Edge but you have to ask yourself am I hacking the system at a deeper cost right is there a trade-off because chronic nicotine can rewire dopaminergic Pathways so that without it you actually can start to feel dull and unmotivated particularly when you start to go into the higher milligram nicotine milligram range and when you when you start to go into that multiple times a day habit as well there links with Parkinson would say you know it is true there fascinating correlation where smokers have a lower incidents of Parkinson but that same population also has higher rates of dementia and cardiovascular disease so it there it dealing with a molecule that it different Pathways some of them are beneficial it har ful so it think about sleep is another aspect so on sleep nicotine can fragment rest so it can fragment sleep you can see reduced REM sleep and deeper stages of sleep if you use if you use it too close to bedtime and then withdrawal can actually throw you into REM rebound so it sort of messes up with your mood Your Sleep Quality so if you do experiment with nicotine you really have to be mindful of the timing you don have have late night doses um obviously because that might disrupt your restorative sleep so I think the bottom line my conclusion here is if you do want to experiment a little b a little bit with nicotine for Focus I think you have to ask yourself if you are prepared to navigate a potential addiction risk you have to decide okay yes I am willing to do that um what are the absolute smallest doses that I can take what the least frequent usage I can do and really set clear boundaries where you you say okay I once or twice a day and that if I want more I you really have to set these clear boundaries but in my opinion I think given the current data there ways you can improve cognition right so high quality sleep good nutrition I use high-intensity interval training that really boosts mood cognition immediately after doing it Coco vs so some of the the flavanols in cacao have been shown to lose cognition they increase blood flow to the brain deliberate cold exposure as well lowd dose caffeine so there sort of tap into that improved focus and attention um you know effect that you getting from nicotine	Success
8 Key Takeaways on Protein Intake From Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVuIdqThxZY	FoundMyFitness Clips 	all right everyone that just about does it for our discussion on the science of protein to wrap up I want to provide eight of the most important takeaways number one for most adults a protein intake in the range of 1.2 to 1.6 gram per kilogram of body weight per day should be consumed to support overall health older adults athletes and people who want to lose weight while sustaining lean body mass should consume 1.6 G per kilogram per day or more Pro protein need should be calculated based on lean body mass or an adjusted body weight that reflects a healthy body fat percentage this is typically around 12 to 15% for men and 20% for women this means that if you weight you should determine your protein requirements using the target weight you it comes to protein timing the so-called anabolic window after exercise isn narrow as once believe consuming protein either before or after a workout is effective but also just focusing on total daily protein intake is what is most important for optimizing resistance training gains number three it is ideal to try and distribute your protein intake evenly across the day aim for around 3 to four protein Rich meals each containing around 20 to 25 grams of high quality protein to stimulate muscle protein synthesis for older adults increasing each meal to 20 to 30 grams may be advantageous due to their higher protein needs and and anabolic resistance but remember that total daily protein intake is much more important than how protein is distributed throughout the day number four consuming protein before bed a practice known as pre-sleep protein intake this can be particularly beneficial for older adults and athletes this strategy enhances overnight muscle protein synthesis and AIDS in Muscle Recovery it contributes to better muscle health and performance number five for those considering protein supplementation high quality sources like whey and casine proteins are excellent options whey protein is rapidly digested and effective at stimulating muscle protein synthesis making it a great choice post exercise or even before bed to provide additional boost of amino acids casine protein digests more slowly providing a prolonged release of amino acids even if you through diet alone supplementation can offer targeted benefits such as supporting recovery during sleep or after very intense exercise number six animal protein are generally Superior to plant proteins for maximizing muscle protein synthesis due to their higher protein density better digestability and complete essential amino acid profiles particularly their loosing content however vegetarians and vegans can still meet their protein needs by consuming larger quantities of plant-based proteins diversifying their protein sources and incorporating plant-based protein isolates and concentrates to ensure they get all their essential amino acids number seven concerns about High high protein intake harming healthy kidneys are largely unfounded for individuals without pre-existing kidney issues and finally number eight despite some schools of thought in the longevity field that higher protein intakes May reduce longevity or promote cancer growth the available evidence in humans just isn positively influences how the body uses amino acids and growth factors like igf-1 and proteins like mtor directing them towards the muscle and brain health where they	Success

These Are the Only Hangover Strategies That Actually Work	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UM6vIkqSHqU	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so let hangover is defined as the combination of negative mental and physical symptoms which can be experiened after a single episode of alcohol consumption starting when blood alcohol concentrations approach zero hangover symptoms are not due to alcohol intoxication in other words because they often occur the next day or after alcohol has been fully metabolized we also need to distinguish alcohol hangover from alcohol withdrawal hangover is an acute phenomenon that appears after a night of drinking but alcohol withdrawal occurs when someone who regularly drinks alcohol stops drinking and is due to several different neurochemical changes in the brain only people who alcohol can experience withdrawal but anyone can experience and a hangover withdrawal symptoms are also more severe and can include anxiety shaking Tremors and sleeplessness traditional views on alcohol hangovers suggested that they only occur when blood alcohol levels reach a certain threshold specific Ally around 0.11% Which is higher than the legal intoxication limit in many places of 0.08% however recent findings challenged this notion indicating that hangovers can occur at much lower levels of alcohol consumption the key factor isn just the numerical value of blood alcohol concentration rather it how intoxicated you feel what we call the subjective level of intoxication and how this amount compares to what you normally consume the subjective experience can be more predictive of whether you have a hangover than the actual amount of alcohol in your blood this variation is due to several factors including genetic differences in how we metabolize alcohol variations in our body size and differences in our usual drinking habits for instance someone who rarely drinks might experience a hangover after consuming just one or two drinks whereas someone who drinks regularly might not feel the same effects there does seem to be a genetic component to Hangovers and while the specific genes haven it appears that genetic factors May account for up to 43% of being hangover resistant which is defined as being able to consume alcohol without having a hangover more than 47 symptoms of a hangover have been identified but some of the most common are fatigue thirst drowsiness headache and problems with memory and concentration people will also often experience an elevated heart rate light and noise sensitivity and muscle cramps during a hangover hangovers are a subject of much debate particularly regarding their causes many people attribute hangovers to dehydration or electrolyte imbalances due to alcohol recent studies suggest these aren primary culprits well it alcohol suppresses anti-diuretic hormone or ADH leading to an increased urine production the volume of fluids typically consumed with alcohol often compensates for this increase so despite common beliefs total body water balance might not be significantly impacted and therefore just drinking more water might not help with a hangover when it comes to electrolytes the evidence also suggests that alcohol intoxication only somewhat disrupts overall electrolyte balance and it the symptoms of a hangover but is not the primary cause however what does occur is metabolic acidosis a decrease in blood pH due to alcohol metabolism hangovers appear to be primar driven by the metabolism of ethanol itself which increases the production of reactive oxygen species these molecules can cause oxidative stress in the mitochondria and the central nervous system leading to an inflammatory immune response this inflammation can manifest as nausea vomiting headaches and cognitive impairments symptoms commonly associated with hangovers indeed levels of inflammatory markers such as il6 tnf Alpha and C- reactive protein as well as markers of oxidative stress have been found to correlate with the severity of hangover symptoms hangovers also seem to be caused by the alterations in hormones and neurotransmitters including Gaba glutamate dopamine and serotonin poor Sleep Quality probably contributes to some hangover symptoms as well especially drowsiness confusion and trouble concentrating alcoholic drinks not only vary in their alcohol content but also in their coner content congeners are chemical byproducts of the fermentation and distillation processes they contribute to the taste Aroma and color of alcoholic beverages these substances include compounds like methanol Esters tannins histamines and alahh drinks that are rich in congeners such as Brandy red wine rum and whiskey tend to produce more severe hangovers compared to drinks with fewer Congers like gin vodka tequila and beer the reason for this is partly biological congeners can enhance the inflammatory response in the body they can compete with the metabolism of ethanol and prolong the processing of alcohol in the system leading to a longer and more intense hangover symptoms this inflammation can affect the brain and other systems exacerbating the typical symptoms of a hangover such as headaches nausea and overall malays however it important to understand that while congeners can influence hangover severity the primary driver of a hangover is still the total amount of alcohol consumed drinking large amounts of any type of alcohol can lead to inflammation dehydration disturbances in electrolyte balance and disruptions in sleep architecture all of which contribute significantly to how you feel the next day sugar content in drinks often thought to worsen hangovers doesn role according to current evidence so lastly I probably all want to know about and that is how to relieve hangover symptoms or prevent hangovers in the first place I need to begin by saying that there is not a lot of good research here very few supplements or other strategies are effective for hangovers and most of what I talk about is either anecdotal or speculative no treatments have undergone systematic evaluation there is fascinating research exploring how certain fruits might influence the metabolism of alcohol this involves primarily the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase and alahi dehydrogenase which are crucial for breaking down ethanol and its byproduct acetyl alahh in the body studies conducted in vitro which is in the lab and in Vivo in in which is in living organisms have shown that fruits such as pear sweet lime and coconut water can enhance the activity of these enzymes significantly by about 20 to 90% this suggests that these fruits could potentially speed up the breakdown of alcohol thereby reducing hangover duration and severity the authors proposed that these fruits and their combination could represent an effective hangover product but there is no human evidence to back this up further research has examined a variety of fruits for their effects on alcohol levels and Liver Health and animal models for instance fruits like the star fruit the Chinese Quint yellow lemon pear and Java Apple have demonstrated the ability to reduce ethanol levels in the blood interestingly fruits such as yellow lemon melon the star fruit and banana also showed protective effects against liver damage by reducing levels of liver enzymes a and alt which are indicators of liver stress the underlying mechanism for these effects appears to be linked to fructose a type of sugar found in fruits fructose has been shown to accelerate the elimination of alcohol from the body by increasing metabolic activity in human studies consuming fructose was found to reduce the duration of intoxication by nearly 30% and enhance alcohol elimination by up to 44.7% these findings suggest that consuming fruit or even some fruit juice think cranberry and vodka while drinking alcohol could theoretically help mitigate hangover symptoms or even some of the effects of sleep by enhancing the body alcohol more quickly however it is crucial to note that while these results are promising they are preliminary and more research especially in humans is needed to confirm these effects and to understand the optimal types and amounts of fruit that would be beneficial let talk about vitamins and mineral minals understanding the relationship between micronutrient intake and hangovers reveals fascinating insights into how our body handles alcohol zinc and vitamin B3 also known as nicotinic acid are two micronutrients that appear to have a significant impact on how we metabolize alcohol zinc is crucial for the function of several enzymes involved in alcohol metabolism helping to break down alcohol more efficiently and potentially reducing the severity of hangovers similarly vitamin B3 plays an important role in the enzymatic processes that convert alcohol into less harmful substances before they are cleared from the body so therefore higher intakes of these nutrients might correlate with less severe hangover symptoms at least that is the correlation that has been found also remember that alcohol increases zinc excretion by up to twofold so this is another reason to make sure you are replenishing your zinc stores while consuming alcohol let and talk about nids so when it comes to managing hangover symptoms not all common practices are advisable for example taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs known as IDs like ibuprofen to prevent hangovers or to help with headaches can actually be counterproductive these medications might slow down the enzymes that metabolize alcohol and its byproducts potentially worsening hangover symptoms more critically aeta manif fin commonly found in Tylenol should be avoided with alcohol as it can lead to increased liver toxicity due to enhanced metabolism when alcohol is present as for the old adish a hair of the dog or drinking more alcohol to cure a hangover this is a myth that does not hold up under scientific scrutiny consuming more alcohol in the morning only delays the inevitable hangover symptoms and can increase overall toxicity in the body this approach should be avoided as it can exacerbate the negative effects of alcohol many of you had questions about two supplements liposomal glutathione and anical cysteine so let them alcohol consumption has a well document impact on reducing glutathione levels in various organs including the liver which is crucial for detoxifying harmful substances in the body glutathione is a potent antioxidant that helps neutralize free radicals thereby protecting cells from damage when you drink alcohol the demand for glutathione in the liver goes up as the body works hard to metabolize alcohol and combat the oxidative stress alcohol generates however chronic or excessive drinking can deplete glutathione leaving cells more vulnerable to damage from free radicals and other toxic byproducts of alcohol metabolism like acetyl alahh this depletion might contribute to the increased oxidative stress and inflammation observed after heavy alcohol consumption which are key factors in the development of hangover symptoms some animal studies and preliminary research have suggested that boosting glutathione levels either through direct supplementation or via precursors like anical cysteine or knack for short could help mitigate these effects for example studies in rats have shown that glutathione supplementation can reduce blood concentrations of alcohol and acetyl alahh potentially easing hangover symptoms by enhancing the activity of alcohol metabolizing enzymes and exerting antioxidant effects however translating these findings to human applications has been challenging while there is theoretical support that increas inreasing glutathione levels could help manage alcohol induced damage and hangovers clinical evidence in humans remains sparse a placebo controlled study that tested anical cysteine supplementation in humans found mixed results overall anical cysteine did not significantly reduce hangover symptoms though some subgroup analysis did suggest potential benefits for women in terms of reducing symptoms like nausea and weakness so anical cysteine is the drug of choice for the treatment of a Menin overdose it is thought to provide cysteine for glutathione synthesis and possibly to form an adduct directly with the toxic metabolite of acetam Menin an acetylcysteine might also reduce the toxicity of alcohol metabolites similar to his interaction with the camenen toxic metabolites an ayine could theoretically react with it with acetyl alahh it harmful metabolite of alcohol and this reaction could form less harmful substances that are easier for the the body to eliminate but there is a not a lot of direct evidence that this happen so it really does remain speculative glutathione is another substance that might help with alcohol metabolism so like ANL cysteine it increase glutathione levels in the body the liposomal formulation could potentially enhance the absorption and efficacy of glutathione providing better support for detoxification processes in the liver but again this is largely based on speculation and not solid evidence another possible way to increase glutathione is through sulphoraphane supplementation which has been shown in clinical studies to increase both plasma and brain glutathione levels alcohol also depletes brain glutathione levels as well several from my Fitness members brought up a product called zbiotics which is marketed as a pre- alcohol probiotic drink that is supposed to reduce hangover symptoms after a night of drinking zbiotics is a genetically engineered probiotic bacteria that once consumed produces the enzyme acetyl aldhy dehydrogenase or alh in your gut you remember from our discussion on alcohol metabolism that our liver naturally produces alh which can metabolize most of the acetal alhy jide during alcohol metabolism about 80 to 90% of alcohol metabolism occurs in the liver however before alcohol is absorbed in the bloodstream and metabolized into the liver gut bacteria process some of it about 10 to 20% into acety alahi which then stays in the gut our gut cannot process aoide like our liver can and this can contribute to some of the negative symptoms associated with alcohol metabolism with more alh enzyme in the gut more acetol alide can be metabolized remember that acetol alide is one of the toxic byproducts of alcohol metabolism so the hypothesis is that less acety halide or faster acetal halide metabolism should result in fewer hangover symptoms but this doesn appear to be entirely true although a faster metabolis ISM of ethanol into acetylide is associated with having less severe hangover symptoms there evidence that a faster elimination of acety alahh which hangover products like zbiotics claim to promote is effective for reducing hangover severity now this doesn I control trials that have tested zbiotics or other similar products however some people who possess an alternative form of a gene known as aldah dehydrogenase 2 which make them makes them slower at metabolizing acetyl alahh report experiencing worse hangover symptoms and experience hangovers at a lower level of alcohol consumption which is some indirect evidence that modifying the activity of acety Alid metabolizing enzymes could affect hangover symptom severity I do not have any affiliation with zbiotics and I haven the product personally so it me to give a recommendation here especially since there evidence all I like something worth trying if you willing to spend the money on a pre-accredited a supplement called metabolism but some newer evidence in rodents suggest another mechanism might be at play dhm does reduce alcohol intoxication and also decreases signs of alcohol withdrawal and reduces voluntary alcohol consumption the mechanism seems to involve the ability of dhm to counteract the effects of alcohol on Gaba receptors in the brain which are known to play a role in the development of alcohol tolerance and alcohol use disorder for this reason dhm has actually been proposed as a treatment for alcohol use disorders even though there evidence to support its use two other strategies that I think should at least help people feel better after consuming alcohol or exercise in sauna though I mention that I do not think either of these negates the toxic effects of alcohol in the body anecdotally exercise and Sonic can help you feel more energized and less lethargic if you hung over but not because you sweating out the alcohol but hydration and electrolyte replenishment are important here as you lose water and electrolytes via sweat though you might not feel like exerting yourself much after a night of drinking breaking a sweat May lift your mood by increasing endorphins enhancing blood flow and metabolism and overall promoting relaxation and reducing anxiety that you might be experiencing during a hangover let remedies currently there is no strong human evidence to support any one hangover cure the most important thing seems to be to moderate your alcohol intake or avoid it all together but if you want to try out some hangover remedies I think there support that liposomal glutathione an acetylcysteine sulfurane eating a meal with fruit and hydrating with electrolytes may help mitigate some symptoms	Success

More people would supplement with vitamin D if they knew this	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAxnPzfeI2o	FoundMyFitness Clips 	Vitamin D is not just a vitamin. Vitamin D gets converted into a steroid hormone that regulates over a thousand genes in our body. It enters the nucleus of our cells and it regulates, it activates and turns on or it suppresses and turns off up to nearly 5% of the protein encoding human genome. This is very relevant because up to 70% of Americans fall into a range known as deficient or insufficient. So almost 30% of Americans actually are vitamin D deficient. They have levels of 25 hydroxy vitamin D below 20 nanogs per milliliter. The other 40% or so has levels that as insufficient. So these are people that have vitamin D levels above 20 nanogs per milliliter, but they 30 nanogs per milliliter. And there really a simple solution to avoiding this deficiency and insufficiency, and that is a vitamin D supplement.	Success

Sauna use promotes changes in immune function that may bolster COVID-19 defense	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwjiMSNqX0Y	FoundMyFitness Clips 	the next question has to do with saunas and the question is can you discuss whether sauna use may help prevent Coppa 19 first of all there to suggest that using the sauna or other modalities of heat stress such as steam showers or hot baths will have any effect on Kobo 19 illness I can discuss other data that is published on pneumonia and the common cold and also the effect on just the immune system in general but I can Coba 19 because there is no data to suggest whether or not the sauna will have any effect on Kobo 19 let by discussing lung health sauna use has been associated with a reduced risk of developing certain chronic or acute respiratory illnesses including pneumonia sauna use promotes mild hypothermia which in turn induces a wide array of physiological responses these responses reduce oxidative stress and inflammation and activate cellular defense systems that provide protection against many diseases so data from a 2017 studies suggest that sauna use reduces the risk of developing certain chronic or acute respiratory illnesses including pneumonia which is a acute respiratory illness characterized by cough fever chills and difficulty breathing it influenza and other viral illness infections including Koba 19 as well as bacterial infections pneumonia affects people of all ages but children older adults and people who are immunocompromised seem to be most vulnerable so this study drew on data from a population-based prospective cohort study of more than 2,000 healthy middle-aged men between the age of 42 and 65 years old and it was conducted in Finland where most people have a home sauna the average sauna exposure reported in the study was approximately 20 minutes per session and the temperature was 174 degrees Fahrenheit or 79 degrees Celsius the data was adjusted for a variety of potential confounding factors like body mass index smoking status education level alcohol consumption total energy intake socioeconomic status physical activity inflammatory status and a history of diabetes heart disease asthma bronchitis or tuberculosis so the study revealed that the frequency of sauna use was inversely associated with the incidence of respiratory illness men who used the sauna two to three times weekly were 27% less likely to develop pneumonia than those who use the sauna once a week or not at all men who used the sauna four to seven times a week were 41 percent less likely to develop pneumonia compared to the infrequent sonic users the saunas protective effects on the lungs may be due to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation associated with hyperthermia or the direct beneficial effects on lung tissue frequent sauna use may decrease pulmonary congestion and lead to other improvements in lung function including vital capacity tidal volume minut ventilation and forced expiratory volume sauna use has been shown to improve lung function in people with obstructive pulmonary disease typical Finnish saunas are not the only type of heat stress that have been shown to be beneficial for lung health way on therapy which uses far infrared dry saunas also has been shown to improve lung function in patients with chronic pulmonary disease also known as COPD the temperature of far infrared saunas are significantly lower than typical Finnish sauna so they around 140 degrees Fahrenheit since the temperature is lower the duration in many studies is longer around 45 minutes and the frequency in many studies is daily for a few weeks one of the major differences between dry saunas or finished on us and far infrared saunas is that both dry and Finnish saunas the heat the ambient air and that heat is transferred from the air to the body but in far infrared saunas the thermal radiation is directly used to increase body temperature sonna bathing was shown to reduce the incidence of common colds in 25% participants that use the sauna 1 to 2 times per week for 6 months compared to 25 controls that did not it took 3 months before the sauna had a protective effect the mechanism by which frequency on use reduces the incidence of colds is unknown but it could have to do with the modulation of the immune system white blood cells lymphocytes and neutrophil counts were all increased in both trained and non trained athletes after sauna use while these findings are interesting they and larger studies are needed to confirm one of the protective adaptive responses to heat stress is the production of heat shock proteins heat shock proteins are a conserved class of proteins with critical roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis and in protecting the cells from stressful conditions heat shock proteins have been shown to be increased by approximately 50% after 30 minutes in a hundred and 63 degree Fahrenheit sauna in healthy young men and women once activated they can remain so for up to 48 hours it acclimated to heat such as from regular sauna use results in the production of more heat shock proteins under normal conditions and even more so under stressful conditions such as cell and tissue injury this is good because as we age we make less heat shock proteins so anything to boost them is beneficial heat shock proteins like heat shock protein 70 are also readily induced by fever and when released from cells heat shock protein 70 can can stimulate the innate immune response through toll-like receptors 2 & 4 the relationship between exposure temperature and maximal heat shock protein 70 protein levels was linear between normal body temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit and a hundred and five point eight degrees Fahrenheit so increasing approximately 50% per degree Celsius in human lung epithelial cells increasing evidence suggests that certain heat shock proteins player role in both innate and adaptive immunity he Chuck proteins can directly stimulate the innate immune responses such as the maturation and activation of dendritic cells and the activation of natural killer cells this means that there may be a direct role for heat-shock proteins in regulating the innate immune response which plays an important role in the body fight off a disease that it exposed to before he Chuck protein 70 when given to mice acts as an adjuvant and stimulates the innate immune missus but in it stimulates the innate immune system it confers a protection against for example HSV you when exposed in addition to directly impacting the immune function heat shock proteins such as heat shock protein 70 have also been shown to directly inhibit viral activity and replication of influenza virus a while the effect of heat shock proteins on viruses is a bit nuanced the more important thing is that heat shock proteins activate the innate immune system and sauna use has been shown to increase white blood cell and other monocyte levels I know many people don have access to a home sauna and without gyms open you know gyms or gyms are closed at this time so it impossible for a lot of people to use the sauna so let about hot baths since most people do have access to a bath tub hot baths have also been shown to increase heat shock proteins which is good news one study found that participants that sat in a hot bath from their waist down for one hour were able to increase their heat shock protein levels so just in in summary it appears as though sauna use is protective against um respiratory illnesses like pneumonia and as well as COPD and has been shown to be protective against the common cold it to increase the innate immune response in terms of increasing white blood cell numbers and other monocyte numbers and it immune response hot baths which also is another mode I the of heat stress have been shown to increase heat shock proteins which are thought to be the main regulator by which are the

This reduces your risk of sudden cardiac death by 90%	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnIT2YZj-ok	FoundMyFitness Clips 	people with a high omega-3 index which is defined as 8% at least 8% had a 90% reduced risk of sudden cardiac death compared to people with a low omega-3 index of 4% um the standard I in in the US the omega-3 index most people it about it so most people in the United States are are at a very low omega-3 index they don know so sudden cardiac death is reduced by 90% if you 3 indix group cardiovascular disease is the number one killer in the United States and and actually most all developed countries every 33 seconds someone dies of a heart attack so um anything you can do to improve cardiovascular health is really really on your side in terms of improving Health span improving your lifespan	Success
Do this after working out for more gains ??	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWEuhrJvh04	FoundMyFitness Clips 	but there was also a very recent study and this is small so it needs to be repeated but people that were engaging in resistance training either just alone or then went into the sauna right after the resistance training they had greater gains in muscle mass if they went to sauna right after the resistance training compared to resistance training well they actually it was biomarkers of it so they didn muscle mass it was biomarkers of but but anyways I think it promising area that of course I excited about I there researching um but it possib possibility for um a Synergy between resistance training between like vigorous intensity exercise your exercise program and then engaging in deliberate heat exposure as well	Success
What added sugar is doing to your brain	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hm1HeaPtGI	FoundMyFitness Clips 	ultimately people are eating 133% of their daily caloric intake is coming from added sugar that 2,000 calorie a day if you just consider that like on average that coming from sugar in fact um guidelines so the the guidelines for like the strictest guidelines suggest no more than 5% of your total um daily caloric intake coming from added sugar so that would be like no more than 25 gram a day 5% people are eating 133% of their total calorie intake from added sugar but there well and that certainly a lot of animal studies but also some human data as well so there been studies showing that if if people eat added sugar it activates dopamine reward Pathways in the brain in the striatum and there if you look at people that are obese you know the obesogenic diet is largely consist of a lot of added sugar well um people that obese have a lower density of dopamine 2 receptors D2 receptors um really indicative something called tolerance so what happens if you keep activating the dopamine reward pathway is that your body as a adaptive response a feedback to it goes ohes I don so many dopamine receptor because I had a lot of that signal coming in right um but what ends up happening is when you have fewer of those receptors then the little bit of dopamine that you have you need more and more right	Success
This is why the sauna makes you feel so good	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFXKRVCECx0	FoundMyFitness Clips 	So that interested in the sauna was the effect on my mood. When you get in the sauna um or when you deliberate heat exposure, say a hot bath, something similar, you release endorphins, and that opioid that you when you know, same thing. Um but you also release something that that. It is the opioid that that discomfort feeling, that dysphoric feeling like it miserable. I hate it. Why am I doing this myself? Exactly. And that you during physical activity as well. And um and so what it does, it actually cools down your core body temperature somewhat and that response. And um but when you release that discomfort feeling, there feedback loop. It actually tell it actually you actually make more receptors and you make them more sensitive to the feel-good endorphins so that you feel better	Success

Lactate generated during exercise increases mitochondrial biogenesis by increasing PGC-1alpha	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj4WaE9aqkY	FoundMyFitness Clips 	mitochondria are also very important in the context of Aging as we age our mitochondria become less efficient at producing energy and this poses a problem for physical activity but also just for normal functioning of our organs now that problem of mitochondria not producing enough energy can actually be overcome by increasing the mitochondrial volume or what mitochondrial biogenesis and exercise particularly vigorous exercise is one of the best ways to do that so one of the most powerful indicators of healthy mitochondria is the ability to generate new healthy young mitochondria called mitochondrial biogenesis vigorous intensity exercise like high intensity high intensity interval training I mentioned um it most powerful stimulators of mitochondrial biogenesis this has to do with the metabolic stress that is induced from vigorous intensity exercise the lactate itself again lactate is a signaling molecule when you greater amounts of lactate that actually activates one of the major Pathways that regulates mitochondrial biogenesis it called pgc1 Alpha and again lactates acting as a signal to produce more of that pgc1 Alpha	Success
Why you should take an electrolyte supplement during a prolonged fast	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdFx1Ri3bHc	FoundMyFitness Clips 	over a prolonged fast the body does continue to use its stores of electrolytes and so without replenishment the risk of electrolyte imbalances does increase um that could potentially lead to issues like arhythmia or muscle weakness changes in blood pressure things like that so um it probably is wise to take an electrolyte supplement and then there the prevention of what refeeding syndrome so refeeding syndrome can occur when you reintroduce Foods after a very long period of fasting and so you can get like a really you know um robust shift in electrolytes really quickly and that could potentially be dangerous so maintaining your electrolyte supplementation during the fast kind of reduces the risk of refeeding syndrome which means that you stable electrolyte levels throughout the fasting period	Success
Is lead in popular greens powders a real concern?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZGS-Gtd7Ts	FoundMyFitness Clips 	These greens powders that a lot of people are consuming are incredibly high in lead. Take a look at my expost. I have the graph there of the different green powder extracts and the ones that have the highest versus the lowest lead. And so if if essentially you green powder just because it multivitamin, you taking a multivitamin because what happens there in the soil and so plants take these up. And it a salad, but these green powders are taking just kilograms and kilograms and kilograms of greens and they concentrating them down, right? They dehydrating them and concentrating them down and you concentrated amount of these heavy metals in in some of these green powders, especially, you know, ones that are not NSF certified. So, um, really something to be aware of if you you and if you just love green powders because you love them, that go to a thirdparty testing source like Consumer Lab and choose one that that you can see what levels of contaminants like heavy metals are in those because lead is something to not mess around with. Obviously, we about it in the context of neurodedevelopment. It for the brain particularly in developing um you know babies and children as well. But it also lead accumulates in our bodies and gets stored in our bones and as we age and our bone breaks down or even when we become pregnant bone bone remodeling happens. Lead gets released into our system and so it can have an effect like throughout the aging process as well or during pregnancy. And so you just don continually exposed daily from your greens powder to you know two mic two milligrams or micrograms of sorry of lead. Um, it it that I think is important for people to consider.

Avoid this food to reduce your colorectal cancer risk	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXaOJUqb660	FoundMyFitness Clips 	I would say the biggest thing that you want to avoid is processed meat. At this point, I is linked to colorectal cancer. In fact, it you look if you look at the colctal cancer incidents dating back to like the 1930s, it keeps rising exponentially each decade. Each decade. And what happening what diets over the the course of these decades is we intake of ultrarocessed foods. We taking in these foods that are high in refined sugar. They They calories, high in sodium, and we taking a lot of these processed meats that have all these preservatives and additives. And we whole food. And it truly is reflected in the increased incidence of colorectal cancer. So I think that limiting ultrarocessed foods, limiting processed meat will clearly reduce cancer risk.	Success
Could omega-3 prevent dementia? | Axel Montagne, Ph.D.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of6OWL9VYBY	FoundMyFitness Clips 	omega-3 and its brain transport may turn out to be an incredibly important Target intervention for dementia and the preservation of brain capillary Health people with high levels of Omega-3 DHA are almost 50 percent less likely to develop Alzheimer people with low levels but why brain transport of DHA via the mfsd2a transporter is crucial for maintaining the blood-brain barrier furthermore where we lose parasites which prevent brain barrier leaks just so happens to overlap with the loss of these Transporters of Omega-3 I cannot agree more I think there is a more and more studies coming up nowadays omega-3 animation mfsd2a which is uh one of the market we are studying carefully because it blood vessels in the brain so the capillaries and that the parasites Hall and there is a recent studies uh um that shows that as we age and with dementia and my physical so the receptor omega-3 it vessels and there is also a link that where there is a reduction on this mfsd2a on blood vessels that see parasite loss so we can almost connect what we were seeing earlier of course these are just a few studies and it has to be uh confirmed but apparently there inflammation of the blood vessels to go back to the first question to link it which uh as we age also mfsd2a transpose and other Transporters not only this one but this one in particular is decreased at the capillary at the capillary bed which have an impact apparently on parasite function because we can see that this hot spot of mfsd mfsd2a loss are also hot spots of parasite loss which means that where we have the leakiness of the bark so yes I cannot agree more I think we have to study a bit more DHC omega-3 and how this impact wavelength value functions because that could be a some preventive interventions uh things like that even like targetable drugs like with drugs but um yeah I cannot agree more I reading a couple of studies years ago where animal studies where omega-3 deficiency caused a reduction in in glute one Transporters in the brain again of course omega-3 deficiency also breaks down bloodray barrier you know so it kind of um what always glucose reduce glucose getting into the brain affecting blood-brain barriers blood-brain barrier affecting the glucose Transporters or both you know I mean it of figure out but um that time same thing with you know with the I mean I it comes to parasite loss on the table activation like pro-inflammation breakdown of the barrier loss of blood flow what is happening first it difficult to address those questions because in human most of the clinical studies are cross-sectional you look at one time point no um I think there that follow individuals the longitudinal leave with scanning with looking at biomarkers looking at neurocyte testings so we very soon so there to that but for the omega-3 yeah um I aquamiga3 deficiency leads to a reduction of good work that said yes it that paper but um but it goes well with what we said earlier right there is a vicious circle um where um I think it of course the undertale parasite crosstalk should be very very involved in that uh problems in my opinion and that study I I a sort of interactive review article back in gosh it must have been like 2018 or something I think and I have references because I for a lot of the studies like the the deficiency in omega-3 causing one Transporters to go down and I just remember um reading a couple of stories and it very relevant to what we do in the lab is that yeah Omega-3 the fact that you give omega-3 to and to aged animals and I told you what as you age here for information like like a hyper activation of the brain endothelium and a couple of studies I I omega-3 to the mice and I remember seeing the reduction of one particular protein that I really like to study and we are currently studying is we came what vascular cell addition molecule one and that and uh and omega-3 was able to reduce these levels and we know in the lab we know that vk1 plays a major role uh Upstream of parasite detachment so again it um there connected uh I think it interesting and just another word on dcm1 is Tony with Korean uh Stanford University one of the big lab working on potato mix and all these fancy homics techniques he looked at Alzheimer um and healthy controls he looked at their plasma and he has looked at using proteomics looking at different proteins which which Alzheimer aging and what he found I think the most striking finding was normal itching he found um I think 30 plus proteins in the plasma that were elevated with normal aging that were related to blevant barrier and if you look down I think the top five candidates were uh proteins the top part of the uh on the teal cells obviously but the number one that stood out as the number one protein that is elevated with normal aging was soluble dkm1 so everything um you know if you put some studies together it kind of makes sense there is a bit more 2D but I think it it makes sense and it might go well with also what omega-3 omega-3 is doing to the to the vascular trip so that leak further it you mentioned uh Tony Weiss Corey as well because if I recall correctly he also been involved in research where he um young plasma into into you know older mice and it sort of rejuvenated in the brain and it proteins I think the opposite was done as well whereas old plasma was transplanted into younger mice and is sort of accelerated and I think if I recall correctly blood brain breaker breakdown was part of that um and so it proteins that is causing he fantastic work and uh and yes correct uh he proteins that we have in the Young Blood that will help not only uh brain functions or anything like uh to help not aging too fast but also we found a few key proteins that are involved in the maintaining blood barrier as we age so I think it he model very important studies I think you mentioned this very early in in our discussion about you know blood brain barrier when it becomes quote unquote leaky you know this allows molecules that usually don the brain to then pass and you had a paper where you had published a couple years ago with I think it was with your postdoctoral Mentor Dr slovovic about a protein called fibrinogen which interestingly enough is also like when I go and get my inflammatory biomarkers measured I like to look at fibrinogen as well as well as high sensitive sensitivity reactive protein it inflammatory marker I mean it in blood coagulation but um you found this in the brain what is the significance of that yes um yes and it starts only two years ago I think there it report was on again brain tissue samples very valuable tissue samples from the donors where we see that uh in if you compare a control brain uh someone cognitively normal though no issues whatsoever and another service brain or a small vessel abuse is brain you start seeing what we call this um extravascular deposition of fibrinogen is one of the it supposedly in the blood it shouldn in the brain at all but we start seeing this extravascular deposition of fibrinogen which means that to cross it has you have to have some degree of breakdown of the of the barrier um so it has been found in Alzheimer disease we also found that in animals that either do have Alzheimer or have some sort of prevent bowel issues and we know that this protein um that is important for blood coagulation as you said and inflammation has nothing to do in the brain and it toxic it and we found that it toxic to neurons it oligodendrocytes where we found that um the the odigodendrocytes are basically cells that are making up myelin and make sure that the white matter is intact and we can function properly and those those articles are crucial in the break and we show that when you have a lead key barrier and you have fibrinogen going in the oligos are very sensitive to that to that fibrinogen so they take it up so the internalized fabinogen and they die by what we call autophagy so it almost like a suicide cancer test and which leads to white metal disease and if we go back white matter disease is a common feature of Alzheimer smoothness of disease and as I said earlier also it source of white metal disease is likely a brain period breakdown so fibrinogen might play a role in this formation of white matter uh disease so yes it that we found we um interestingly we in animals we were able to reduce uh fibrinogen levels systemically in the blood of course at a level that you don to increase to have some coagulation problems or increase bleedings and things like that so you have to reduce at a level that you don bleeding or clothing but just by doing the reach just by reducing the the fibrogen fibrinogen level in a mouse model that do have blood brain power issues we were able to to demonstrate that there is less obviously it makes sense less fibrinogen going in to the brain damage and also interestingly by reducing fibrinogen we were able to to partially restore vascular functions in terms of blood flow and also Integrity of the barrier so fibrogen does probably different roles not on the coabulation and inflammation probably a bit more but that other way we can Target toxin things in the blood to avoid doing damage to the brake I think it don rather than doing that but at least it another evidence that okay a Reiki barrier is leading to to your damage to the brain and and you don you see and the last thing on fibrinogen is just remember now fibrinogen can activate the brain resident immune cells that are microbial cells through cd11b so that fibrinogen gets in it can bind to microglia so it will induce an over reaction over inflammation of the brain which will be detrimental for uh for many things for the functions of the cell surrounding and that reminds me that there is a fantastic researcher uh Katarina kasudu she is a Gladstone University UCS set value where she I think she developed an antibody that blocks the interaction between fibrinogen and microvia to avoid that over uh like over expression of information or over activation of microbial cells because she strong believer that let functional very early and the major contributor to Dimension so that very interesting research it said it it really shows the importance of maintaining the blood-brain barriers so that it doesn like fibrinogen which is involved in blood coagulation to cross into the brain and again as you mentioned the inflammation it cells and it whole process you described earlier the inflammaging and parasite Detachment perhaps and all that it also as I was reading and doing some background research on some of your work um and because I knew of the inflammatory role of fibrinogen you know I protein you know separate of uh what happens when it gets into the brain I um I was looking up omega-3 because I had remembered coming across some studies with it and interestingly uh people so air particulate matter so when you have like air pollution particular matter when people are exposed to high amounts of it it causes their fibrinogen to go up right it inflammatory marker as well but people that were taking in high amounts of Omega-3 it blunted the increase in fibrinogen and plasma and so it would be very interesting to see if in some of the animal models you were discussing if omega-3 could blunt you know the white matter dysfunction caused by fibrinogen getting into the into the brain so again it easier low-hanging fruit thing that people can do now right I mean yes make sure they yes exactly um no I cannot agree more we don we said but yeah there is this uh kind of vicious cycle where omega-3 may play a major role into uh vascular functions of course it that it does pretty raw um and it might be even a more important role in people as risk for Alzheimer it that we	Success

How to Improve Glucose Regulation & Lower HbA1c (supplement, diet, & exercise protocols)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqBi0zy7deo	FoundMyFitness Clips 	first and foremost compared to physical activity and weight loss for example those are the main things that are they respect to improving hba1c levels even something like doing these vigorous intensity lifestyle you know this physical activity um lifestyle sort of short bursts of just high-intensity exercise so like let say you like do you know 10 to 20 body weight squats and you know for like a minute that can really significantly improve blood glucose levels as well so making sure you that what the guideline you know the the recommended guidelines for physical activity are so that would be 150 minutes a week of moderate intensity physical exercise or 75 minutes a week of high intensity exercise combined with two to three days of strength training resistance training you know the more muscle you for glucose and the more muscle mass that you building the better your glucose regulation is going to be so you know adding in resistance training is every bit as important as also doing some cardiovascular and endurance exercise as well so making sure you goals number one that that that makes a huge difference in like glucose regulation full stop the second thing again would be you know weight loss if you are overweight then you have to like you whatever type of way to lower your calorie intake that works best for you I think a lot of people do like intermittent fasting Tim restricted eating naturally if people are doing an eight hour eating window and they fasting for you know 10 hours or so um sorry 16 hours or so they are more likely to reduce their calorie intake Naturally by anywhere between 200 to 500 calories a day okay so whatever works best for you some people like to count calories I there fits-all recommendation for weight loss for people that are overweight but like I said um you know time restricted eating is one thing that really works well because people don think about the calories they just naturally don have to make sure you protein and doing your resistance training and being physically active as well now there recommendation so this this is for people of course um that need to lose weight but also that perhaps are still trying to tweak their hba1c they already at a healthy body weight we talked a lot about glycemic index glycemic load there one siiz fits all in terms of how your body respond how your glucose regulation is going to respond to different dietary macronutrients like protein versus carbohydrates versus fat people do have you know some people do respond with a higher insulin response for example or glucose response to protein than others I think one thing that is pretty well known is the more refined the carbohydrate the more you have a higher glucose response right glycemic load is it glycemic index so glycemic load is um it high your blood glucose can go and how quickly your blood glucose Rises after eating a particular food the the first part of that the load is how high it goes that how quickly your blood glucose Rises after eating a particular food that glycemic index I don index is interesting but I think it not as important as the glycemic load generally speaking the more processed the food the higher the glycemic index especially if you something that strips away the food Matrix and the fiber and everything as well gly like making sure you have a lower glycemic load there of meta analyses looking at you you know people with a lower glycemic load um if they have diabetes and how having a lower dice glycemic load can reduce their hb1c in a dose dependent manner so there randomized control trials showing that people um with diabetes can significantly reduce hb1c by you know in a dose dependent manner by like 31% there was also small reductions in fasting glucose and some other secondary outcomes like improving lipids triglycerides body weight blood pressure things like that as well the certainty of evidence was high for reducing hba1c wasn outcomes so again I think I think looking mostly you know a high a high glycemic load food is going to be you know a more refined carbohydrate meal it to be something like a fruit that while it still has you know some glucose it has a a food Matrix it has a lot of fiber it does it slows the glucose response and it high glycemic index Foods or high glycemic load foods that just raise your your blood glucose levels extremely high there say it there I your meal sequence or food order eating pretty much anything like protein fat fiber before a carbohydrate um that might be a little bit more refined or even just generally speaking um you can sort of lower your blood glucose response somewhat and these Studies have been done in mostly in people with type type two diabetes it you know but for for someone that really trying to control every little measure particularly if they have pre-diabetes and they prevent transition to diabetes you know focusing on the exercise on the caloric you know reduction to to lose to lose some of the body fat but also food order might help a little bit certainly the glycemic load lowering that seems to be strong evidence early time restricted eating I talked about that um if you doing like an eight hour time time window where you eight hours people are naturally reducing their caloric intake that thing but also there are studies showing it improves glucose regulation even when calories are equated so another way to do that another way to you know tweak tweak the needle a little bit is I I would say doing practicing some form of um time restricted eating like an 816 where you within eight hours most of the time and then fasting for 16 that may also help on top of everything else I said now with that said there are some supplements that have been shown to affect hb1c um again we here from most important to least I would say don supplements if you you exercise and the time for exercise if you that you eating window I think these things are all more important and there stronger evidence in those lifestyle modifications affecting blood glucose regulation but with that said um burine is probably one of the there of supplements bur berberine being one of them that um does seem to consistently show promise for lowering blood glucose levels improving insulin resistance there was a meta analysis of 37 studies involving people with type 2 diabetes that showed berberine could significantly reduce fasting blood glucose levels by about 14.8 milligrams per deciliter and it could reduce hba1c by about 0.63% it also could reduce plasma blood glucose levels after the oral glucose tolerance test so so um that oral glucose tolerance test that we talked about those levels could be reduced by about almost 21 milligrams per deciliter 37 trials I would say not all of those trials are high quality you know it but that problem that is you know ubiquitous within clinical trials and nutrition not every study is high quality nonetheless it is promising I do think uh a lot of times the dose range you see around 500 to milligrams a day of berberine it does seem to to have an effect in many many studies that have been published and so um I do think it has a pretty good safety profile overall we have a topic page on berberine please go look at it on our topics Pages lots of references there you can ask more questions about it we buring a lot and a lot of other q&as as well so um that tool in the toolkit and then I would say the other main one is alpal lipoic AET so this has also there studies carried out in people with type two diabetes that improve glycemic control so I would say it berberine but it does seem as though alpha lipoic acid could affect um it seems to really mostly affect insulin sensitivity I think is the is the main one and then also hb1c was reduced as well not as many studies this is this is up to about 600 milligrams a day of alphalipoic acid so I which also has a pretty good safety profile the other thing I like about alphalipoic acid is it ALS there that have shown it can reduce Advanced cation and products which is one of the bad side effects of high blood glucose levels um and that is what damages it cross links proteins and so it damages proteins in our body lipids it damages DNA it collagen in particular is very sensitive to it so so it affects skin aging but it also really affects cardiovascular health because you know your collagen that heart for example it stiff it plays a role in stiffening of the heart with age Advanced cation end products do and so anything that can lower Advanced cation end products is going to be good for cardiovascular health um and sorry I should have mentioned this before the supplements sleep sleep is one of the most important lifestyle factors along with exercise and again your diet quality quantity that affects blood glucose regulation getting you know night after night of sleep restriction like really does disrupt glucose regulation some of that can be improved if you do something like very Physically Active the next day like an you know high intensity interval training for example has been shown to improve blood blood glucose disregulation caused by Sleep restriction um but even like getting less like getting so the the a aage amount of sleep that to be getting that would say that of good sleep would be seven hours so like once you once you dip below seven hours of sleep a night so you start to get to six and a half for example or six then you are you into territory where you know metabolic regulation blood pressure these things start to be affected a little bit more in a dose dependent manner in other words the more the Sleep restriction the more intense uh the the adverse effects on metabolism um and and cardom metabolic effects in general so making sure you every night is also very important for regulating hb1c levels there other interesting supplements that I see out there like cinnamon and apple cider vinegar there you know these these supplements can also have somewhat of an effect on glucose regul a I would say you know it kind of down on the list but like there one study I mean there there studies showing that cinnamon does seem to lower hb1c very very subtly so 0.1% which is you know small but you know it something that people are also interested in again it I don effect I would try the other things first but you know if you like cinnamon then you know adding cinnamon to to your coffee and and tea or whatever go for it	Success
Watch this if you supplement with electrolytes	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqf1M7QwSs4	FoundMyFitness Clips 	a lot of the electrolyte drinks out there and packets or whatever they all contain either Stevia or monk fruit a lot of them contain Stevia um and again it single day if you coffee if you drink if you if you are we getting what is it doing I mean you know in small enough doses it seems to be fine but like is there some kind of little Insidious thing we don about and I scared I about it the way I think about these non-nutritive sweeteners is I think you can get tricked into thinking oh yeah they thing so I I maybe even multiple times a day like we don that you know consuming it every day multiple times a day doesn negative effect like it going on in faith there	Success
Why you should use the sauna as much as possible	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx_atGCfeNQ	FoundMyFitness Clips 	what dependent effect with frequency and duration in the sauna so in other words the more frequent the sauna use the more robust of the effect so I example all cause mortality is 40% lower in people that use the sauna four to seven times a week so four times would be minimum right versus people that use it two to three times a week they have a 24% lower all cause mortality right so the bare minimum would be two if you want something um this is compared to people that use it one time a week but if you want the most robust effects the bare minimum would be four up to seven right every day so that would be frequency and the duration in that sauna is also important so if people only stayed in for 11 minutes they weren getting a very robust effect they had to stay in for at least 20 minutes so 20 minutes at 174 degree fah four times a week	Success

The importance of rest and refeeding after a fast | Dr. Mark Mattson	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8IGRyTdrOs	FoundMyFitness Clips 	one point you just mentioned is important and this can occasionally get lost as these conversations go on and that is it intermittently is important um the number for example in the muscle cells with exercise the number of mitochondria doesn it actually increases during the rest period but if you had never exercised you would have never gotten a stimulus that triggers what they increase the number of mitochondria so they between the metabolic challenge whether it fasting or exercise and the recovery whether you know eating resting sleeping you know so and there to all of this obviously with fasting starvation if you you know if you start to lose muscle mass then you you and as you mentioned you can overdo it with exercise too and sometimes get diminishing returns so it have these recovery periods you the brief the importance of what are you know called the refeeding phase um both you know you and dr walter longa have discussed this and in publications and vaulter on the podcast previously and it like you mentioned it lot of you know people don that recovery period how how important like you know for the for the refeeding period you know how important is that and how long is that window do we know you know is it like a week is it just a couple days well with these these intermittent fasting eating patterns i are kind of trivial from an evolutionary perspective that is limiting time window you eat six to eight hours each day um you know that the remaining whatever 18 16 18 hours is more than sufficient to recover you know if you if you fasted for if you tried to do fasting for five days one day recovery fast another five days one day recovery and keep that up it won start to have problems so and it um there you know my understanding is there quite a few ultra marathoners who when they get in their 50s and 60s start to have a lot of problems so they be some you know long-term consequences of overdoing it whether it fasting or exercise and what you and i are talking about today is well within any you know any bounds of even getting close to having adverse effects and having to worry about am i recovering or not but perhaps more of a someone doing a more of a prolonged fast um [Music] might have to consider you know the refeeding and how important yeah i know there in europe for example in germany there are clinics where people go in for a couple weeks and they ten days to two weeks under you know supervised it like a resort actually you know and everybody else there is doing the same thing and they they and starting to publish and uh but what they see a lot of improvements in health indicators even within that you know two two fasting period but they don long-term effects and in talking to the the people who run these centers um oftentimes the person a person will only do this once a year and so they may be overweight and you know have insulin resistance and they and they even during that short period a little bit of improvement in their insulin sensitivity but then they come back a year later and they where they were worse so um you know one question then is if someone wants to fast for longer time periods what frequency would be reasonable for long-term health you and he uh eating pattern where the subjects um five consecutive days a month they eat only one moderate size meal and then the other days of the month eat normally and that seems to be beneficial um the key thing is you know how long can people maintain this in in their lifestyle incorporated into their lifestyle and daily time restricted eating for example seems to be easy for a lot of people to do for years and years and years you know maybe five days a month that but at some point you have to think about it that way looking kind of a long view of what can you and then another thing is what about you know so daily time restricted eating if you skip breakfast then you can still have lunch with people at work uh and dinner with people where to if you maybe like vultures maybe five days a month you go out to dinner with somebody and say well i can so yeah right you	Success

How to get rid of the microplastics in your body	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsZmHD-JDFo	FoundMyFitness Clips 	how can I get rid of them I got too many microplastics in my body how do I get rid of them yeah so microplastics we kind of talked about a little bit getting rid of them and that really the main source is excretion through feces and that happens with dietary fiber so if you are eating a lot of fruits and vegetables that does increase the chances that microplastics are going to move their way out through feces is that only microplastics that you along with it or is it able to pull microplastics sort of detoxify them from your body I think it general to be honest because if you think about like fiber what does it do it moves stuff through your body it doesn be something that you just ate right like it could be something that you had hours before	Success
Importance of essential amino acids and protein during fasting refeeding | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrwmU_MyItA	FoundMyFitness Clips 	post fast feeding so a lot of questions about this what a fast so you talked a little bit about this you know is there a method to the madness with macro timing and this is from brian ab chin is there a method to the madness with macro timing and as it pertains to glycogen levels or is it fine to eat anything in particular once you reach your your what you break your fasting window once you end your fasting windows so what should we be consuming ideally after this fast well I think we kind of address that you know if we talking about the prolonged fast or someone that hours you know you at that at that point after your igf-1 has gone lower and you some of the atashi and clearing away of the of the damaged parts of the cell and also apoptosis the damaged cell itself you want that igf-1 active and what activates igf-1 our amino acids so it particularly essential amino acids so so eating some protein actually to break a fast seems like it would be a good idea because you want that igf-1 higher the other thing that actually regulates igf-1 bioavailability is carbohydrates so so carbohydrates allow AGF want to be more bioavailable so most the time you the sense you want to have that regrow signal so so eating you know eating a balanced diet but you know when when people are breaking a prolonged fast some people have sensitivity you know their guts a little more sensitive if you haven know so so you really have to sort of listen to your body like soft-landing out of it yeah some people you know I had people talk to me about taking like you know making a shake with some blueberries and they had a little bit of you know protein powder or like a little small piece of salmon and some fruit other people like to kind of ease into it with some soups or bone broths and then eventually kind of make it make it yeah a small piece of protein or something it circadian or like 16 eights I mean the thing I sort of want to emphasize here is that you know a lot people use fasting as a license to kind of binge which obviously is not a good idea like when you especially a longer fast you know giving your body a chance to adjust back to a feeding state is important in eating you know no non-processed foods is super important would you agree yeah absolutely you know I think that eating eating a healthy diet with you know lots of vegetables and you know healthy meats and fatty acids and things like that it avoiding refined sugar all those things I mean if your console eating refined sugars and and all that you have a hard time your body is gonna have a hard time switching over from metabolizing glucose to fatty acids it gonna make it transition more difficult so so that this another thing to keep in mind as well you	Success

Why It's Never Too Late to Start Building Muscle	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrQSUZB3iQ	FoundMyFitness Clips 	how much muscle we have tells us more about how we are aging than body weight or BMI ever could here fact after the age of 50 the average person loses about 1% of their muscle mass every single year and it muscle mass strength plummets even faster dropping around 3% annually by the time you reach 75 if you engaging in regular strength training you could be losing up to 4% of your strength every year so what can we do about this exercise both before you need it building muscle Reserve but also in old age to slow and reverse the decline while resistance training is the most important factor for building and maintaining muscle mass and strength protein intake plays an important role too a meta analysis from Dr Stuart Phillips and colleagues highlights the importance of protein intake by showing that people who engage in resistance training and supplemented with additional protein taking their total daily protein intake up to 1.6 G per kilogram body weight increase their muscle mass by 27% and their strength by 10% more than those who did resistance training without additional protein supplementation so these people were getting around 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram body weight so dialing in that protein intake matters for both muscle mass and strength when combined with resistance training skeletal muscle makes up around 30 to 40% of our lean body mass more muscle doesn more strength it means better metabolism enhanced insulin sensitivity and a pretty good defense against type 2 diabetes it also dramatically decreases Frailty and the risk for sarcopenia one of the main risk factors for Falls and fractures in older adults research has shown that individuals who suffer from a fragility fracture are twice as likely to die compared to those without such fractures and between 22 to 58% of people with a hip fracture pass away within just 12 months after the injury in old age falling and breaking a hip can literally be a death sentence a better body composition dramatically improves quality of life and reduces disability risk having a higher muscle mass can decrease the risk of early death by 30% whereas having a high fat Mass can increase that risk by 56% so what explains our greater susceptibility to lose muscle mass as we get older there are a few factors that play a role in this but a big player here is a phenomenon called anabolic resistance so as we age our muscles become less responsive to amino acids meaning they don protein synthesis in response to protein intake as effectively so for older individuals the same amount of protein results in a smaller increase and muscle protein synthesis compared to younger people some Studies have shown that an older person requires almost twice twice as much protein for the same response for example around 0.24 g of protein per kilogram body weight or 0.1 gram per pound that about an 80 kilogram man maximally stimulates muscle protein synthesis in someone young but this dose is higher for older adults who need about 0.4 gr of protein per kilogram or 0.18 G per pound of protein per dose an older adult man weighing about 80 kg would need about 32 gram of prot protein to maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis by the way for anyone taking notes this suggests that the optimal amount of protein per dose is between 20 and as high as 35 gram of protein depending on your personal level of anabolic resistance so this means a few things the first is that if you you need a higher total daily protein intake to maintain or increase muscle mass it also means that you need a higher dose of protein at each meal to stimulate muscle protein synthesis but anabolic resistance is not inevitable or only due to aging as some might suggest in fact physical inactivity may actually be the biggest contributor reducing physical activity worsens anabolic resistance for example taking fewer steps for just two weeks causes anabolic resistance in older adults and reduces their insulin sensitivity imagine what decades of inactivity can do that bad news but the good news is that exercise makes muscle more sensitive to protein and essentially negates anabolic resistance when older adults exercise before protein intake their muscle anabolic response is identical to that of a younger adult so how do I interpret this active older adults probably don experience as much anabolic resistance as inactive people and therefore it might not be such an issue for people that are Physically Active the most effective way to combat anabolic resistance as we age is through regular physical activity combined with a higher daily protein intake ideally around 1.6 G per kilogram body weight we do not have to be frail in old age we can build muscle into our 40s 50s 60s and even our 70s and Beyond and we can definitely increase muscle strength and power output at this age in one study that recruited adults aged 90 years and older eight weeks of high-intensity strength training produced 174% increase in muscle strength and a 48% increase in the size of their leg muscles muscle strength and size increased even in the ninth decade of Life an age when most people wouldn about touching a weight	Success

If you drink alcohol, consider supplementing with these two micronutrients	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYJqO3SUBSA	FoundMyFitness Clips 	alcohol could also lead to deficiencies in two micronutrients that are indispensable for our body zinc and magnesium both are involved in literally hundreds of different enzymatic reactions and serve crucial biological functions alcohol causes us to absorb less zinc in the intestine and excrete more zinc in urine this is a double whammy for this micronutrient because we both absorb less and excrete more heavier alcohol use is definitely associated with poring status between 30 and 50% of people with alcohol use disorder have low zinc status however moderate alcohol use may have a milder effect on zinc losses in either case regular consumption of alcohol probably increases the need for more zinc in the diet or supplemental Zinc at least slightly in people who are low or moderate consumers alcohol consumption also increases magnesium excretion in a dose dependent manner with chronic heavy alcohol intake increasing excretion up to two to threefold	Success
This Is Rhonda Patrick's Skincare Routine	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utNFq06DelY	FoundMyFitness Clips 	okay so the first question on my list here I don was the top voted question I do look at top voted questions as well but the question was submited by Lisa and Lisa was asking a question regarding my skincare routine I use a lot of cellbone products I don with them I just really like their products and Lisa asked if there was a reason why I omit popular skin care ingredients like retinol vitamin C or Alpha Hy Al Alpha hydroxy acid collagen nide Etc so um I should note that I haven you know my my general skinc care routine like the the the I would say the template something something I do every every every single day is definitely um what I the neutralizer ingredient that I use as a sort of like a serum I put it on my skin and I let it soak in and for about 10 to 15 minutes you look like happy people but uh it soaks in and then it your your skin is very hydrated um I also do use other products as well so I do occasionally there is a retinol product by cellbone that I like and I use it renewal and it has retinol in it and I week um another thing that I using of recent I would say the last definitely month maybe just a little bit longer than a month is salicylic acid they have a salicylic acid sort of like peel and um you you put you you know you put it on your skin and you let it sit for like anywhere between 1 to 3 minutes and then you rinse it off with cold water and then I put my neutralizer on and let it soak in and that really helps also with like slopping off the dead skin so it sort of that Rejuvenation effect where you cells and allowing kind of space for the new ones to to breathe so um the salicylic acid I find really helps with that and I more than I I was sort of doing the retinol kind of once a weekish but I really changed to the salicylic acid sometimes I of the retinol as well so I do um I do use those and uh the other thing is Vitamin C um sometimes I do use a vitamin C serum as well but it kind of one of those like you know I feeling like a spa treatment for myself I do that the reason I that is because a lot of the vitamin C in skincare products is um is it the ascorbic acid form which oxidizes fairly quickly and um so it matter of you know perhaps it something or perhaps it effective as you would think it is is because it oxidized but um there are other forms of vitamin C there there lipid soluble form which I also think is good and again I I do have some products that I use occasionally with those as well but um for me it what I like the main thing I do is is the the neutralizer Susan the company name it n e and uh their products I just find are really they like it quality it like stuff you can you they products or just high quality um things and also they um they they don outrageously priced you know where it like some I find like some of these other skin care creams and stuff are just I mean they just charge like five times more than they really need to and um you packaging and a good feeling I guess so Margaret the salicylic acid 15 versus 20% I think that this the you know these can be like it stings when you put it on your face it very you know it somewhat a peel to to a degree um and so uh you know I think I have the 20% but I difference and again it it factor so let salicylic acid and you leave it on your skin for 6 minutes versus 3 minutes of the 20% so I mean it sort of thing but um if you very sensitive skin I would go with the 15% because that that would be um a little bit less harsh as well	Success

This is what high blood pressure does to your brain	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpRwZ8tr0UI	FoundMyFitness Clips 	Gosh, it individuals aged 20 to 39 have hypertension. Yeah. You know, these are young adults with hypertension. And we now know that hypertension isn risk for cardiovascular disease, it risk for dementia and Alzheimer disease, particularly if you start earlier, right? if you person. So like it to hypertension, you know, it because you have to get blood flow to your your brain and um you know, you got all these tiny like 90% of the of the brain vascular vascule surrounding the brain is made of these tiny tiny blood vessels that are like the smaller than the size of a hair in terms of diameter and they have to get blood flow to them. So exercise helps that, but hypertension exacerbates the lack of blood flow going to those blood vessels. And what happens is they they start to sort of constrict. Yeah. And and sort of fall fall off. And you can get many strokes and many strokes. But also neurons don and the oxygen they need. And so then you start to lose neurons, right? And you get brain atrophy.

How the gut microbiome regulates immune cell types | Dr. Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofZTJoIVBg0	FoundMyFitness Clips 	the microbiome is also important for immunity not all pathogens are bad some are good emerging data over the last several years has unveiled important roles that commensal bacteria which are often referred to as good bacteria play in human health the gut microbiome regulates immune cell populations when fermentable fiber which is the fiber that passes undigested into the colon is consumed the bacteria break down some of the fiber for their own use the byproducts of this bacterial action are several short chain fatty acids including butyrate lactate acetate propionate as well as other compounds short chain fatty acids are important for maintaining gut barrier function but they also play a special role in regulating cytokine production and immune cell populations the gut microbiome directly influences immune cells that reside in the gut and indirectly influences immune cells outside of the gut via short chain fatty-acids including the production of T regulatory cells which are immune cells that keep autoimmunity at bay many studies have found that short chain fatty acids derived from the gut microbiome promote the expansion of T regulatory cells reduced he regulatory cell numbers have been found in severe Cova 19 patients and t regulatory cells have been shown to help resolve acute respiratory distress syndrome so reduce CT regulatory cell numbers might lead to worse lung pathology gut bacteria also use flavonoids found in fruits teas etc to control the immune response and protect against severe damage from the influenza virus the bacteria metabolize flavonoids and produce a compound called des amino tyrosine or dat for short which helped produce interferon a signaling molecule that activates the immune system this helped protect the lungs against damage from the flu virus the DAT did not prevent the flu but it did significantly reduce the severity of it some of the main dietary sources of flavonoids include tea citrus fruit berries apples and legumes mice that were fed fermentable fiber specifically inulin had reduced mortality better lung function and less tissue destruction after exposure to influenza virus compared to my fed nan fermentable fiber which was cellulose short chain fatty-acids derived from the fermentable fiber prevented neutrophils from infiltrating lung tissue and this prevented lung tissue damage the short chain fatty-acids also enhance cd8 t-cell effector function and viral clearance the microbiome also plays an important role during early life several studies have shown that early exposure to microorganisms in the dirt particularly before the first year of life has been shown to significantly lower the risk of allergies wheezing and asthma in children early exposure to bacteria and certain allergens such as pet dander may have a protective effect by shaping the child in such a way that prevent allergies and asthma this becomes very important in infants that have genetic predisposition to allergies eczema or asthma particularly if a parent or sibling has one or more of those diseases one study specifically found that wheezing was three times as common among children who grew up without exposure to such allergens compared to children who were exposed before their first year of life interestingly exposure to allergens after the first year of life did not decrease the child allergies or asthma even exposure to certain species of bacteria in early life can have differential effects on the immune system particularly with respect to autoimmunity an imbalance between the so called healthier good bacteria and the pathogenic or bad bacteria referred to as dysbiosis also plays a role in shaping the immune system a healthy or dysbiotic microbiota can influence the hosts innate immune system by our two types of signals microbial cell components and metabolites in a dysbiotic state alterations in the signature of microbial molecules sent by the host can lead to different activation state of the immune system for example animal studies have shown that certain species of bacteria in the gut promote antibody responses to the influenza vaccine TIV they do this through generating a toll-like receptor v signal in humans it was shown that the same toll-like receptor v signal was correlated with a higher antibody titer four weeks after the influenza vaccine in a way that microbiome acts like a natural adjuvant at least in animal studies ablating the gut microbiome in animals has been shown to affect the gut epigenome and transcriptional genome of lymphoid cells and the transcriptional genome of myeloid cells this occurs through tryptophan metabolites and short chain fatty acids generated via the microbiome you	Success
How to Improve Sperm Health (supplements & lifestyle recommendations)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5gCcSg4AjU	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so the next question was submitted by Marina and Marina was wondering about male fertility Marina says hi Rhonda could you please advise on improving sperm quality particularly motility morphology and DNA fragmentation especially when having good reactive auction spei levels so it oxidative stress I know about the general rules like being fit and active not being overweight but would appreciate if you could be more specific or even even talk about some supplements it under researched area compared to female fertility okay so there was one systematic review of metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials looking at the influence of oral vitamin and mineral supplementation on male infertility so just as a brief overview some things that affected total sperm count were omega-3 and co-enzyme Q10 sperm concentration were affected by selenium zinc omega-3 and CoQ10 sperm motility were affected by selenium zinc omega-3 CoQ10 and carnitine sperm morphology was affected by selenium omega-3 CoQ10 and carnitine the dosage um the dosages were for selenium it was 200 micrograms per day for lcarnitine it was two grams per day for CoQ10 it was 200 to 300 migs per day for zinc it was 66 milligrams per day for EPA it was one gram per day and for DHA it was 700 milligrams or sorry yes 700 milligrams per day and as mentioned in the question oxidative stress is actually one of the main mediators of male infertility so sperm damage induced by reactive auction species um about 30 anywhere between 30 to 80% of male infertility cases have been attributed to oxidative stress it causes sperm dysfunction it damage triggered by reactive oin species it occurs naturally in sperm cells because high levels of sperm motility induce reactive auction species but to high of levels of reactant auction species are what with sperm DNA damage and low percentages of sperm fertility selenium is essential for spermato spermatogenesis and it plays a role in actually increasing glutathione peroxidase expression and activity selenium is important for the production of uh glutathione related enzymes so you know making sure a you know getting enough selenium in the diet is important for that reason for sperm for sperm Health uh zinc is another one that also plays a part of this antioxidant response it stabilizing activity by inhibiting membranebound oxidative enzymes so an excess of antioxid ents could result in significant Adverse Events um and can promote that what we were talking about earlier reductive stress which can be detrimental for for male fertility so again um it you don want to have too you don sort of randomly start overdosing on too many antioxidants either because then you might cause the the reductive stress effect but having enough of them is is is really important Omega-3 has been shown to so DHA is actually highly concentrated in sperm cells it actually one of the cell types interestingly that has a very high concentration of DHA it has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects it mod it modifies the cell membrane composition again so um it plays a lot of important roles in sperm coq1 is also import important for mitochondrial function and um it inhibits peroxide formation in seminal fluid so it basically could reduce sperm oxidative stress through that mechanism and then elar lcarnitine and El acetylcarnitine play important roles in sperm metabolism by basically providing immediate energy for use by spera which positively affects the sperm motility as well it in the transport of fatty acid across the mitochondrial membrane so that fatty acids can get in and be used as energy as well so El carnitine also plays a role in in that so those are some of the the supplements at least evidence-based that positively effect a variety of sperm characteristics as we as we mentioned um alcohol I would say is one um that can negatively affect sperm so there was a meta analysis in investigating the impact of alcohol intake on semen quality by looking at 18 different cross-sectional studies and basically daily Al alcohol consumption worsened seamen quality particularly in terms of the volume and sperm morphology there was also a very recent study looking at invitro fertilization and it found that alcohol intake in men basically prevented infro fertilization from working and it had to do again with a sperm so alcohol probably something to um avoid if not dramatically reduce uh when trying to conceive and then also uh sauna use hot tub use can affect sperm motility temporarily it transient but for someone who to conceive probably best to not be doing n sauna and hot tub um particularly if you problems because of the effects on sperm motility those effects go away after about six weeks so um again hot tub SAA great for a lot of you know Health parameters uh but for some for a male trying to conceive it can affect sperm motility in a negative way as mentioned in the question obesity definitely um it reduces you know it been shown to reduce testosterone leads to fewer sperm so um definitely weight loss is a uh important strategy for any male trying to conceive as well and then U Mediterranean diets one that associated with improved uh you know basically sperm outcomes as well General General uh I guess things that you could just exercise helps as well so like things that that you would think would be good for you know Health are generally good for sperm with the exception of sauna which does a you know decreased sper motility Nick is asking in the chat whether it to or advisable to take DHA and EPA separately uh one in the morning and one in the evening as I do uh I don that it it omega-3 brand that I take happens to do it in a high EPA and high DHA sort of version um you can choose to do that if you want but I don to take them together I don don Justin as the as a form of contraception no absolutely not it you know even though it affects sperm motility um many sperm can still make it and um it men that are are having fertility issues uh I I know some people that were under the impression that sauna could be used as a form of contraception and boy were they surprised U by a baby so definitely um not not uh advised um Beck is asking about sauna for females before contraception um I there there there negative effect on female before contraception and um so now now after like during pregnancy I you know again on the safe side I would uh not do the sauna because there evidence that doing hot tub can um women that do hot tub during pregnancy can sort of ha it can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome so it can have some negative effects on brain development	Success

Can vitamin D actually boost cognitive function?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaC4YCH23Io	FoundMyFitness Clips 	But there have been a few trials that have actually looked at vitamin D supplementation in people with either Alzheimer cognitive impairment. So both in both those scenarios and people with mild cognitive impairment, if they took around 800 IUs of vitamin D daily for a year, they had significant improvements in multiple areas of cognition, memory, attention, overall IQ. And the same goes with the Alzheimer people that took again 800 IUs a day for over a year and these people were already diagnosed with Alzheimer disease. They also had improved scores on memory and attention tests similar to that first trial I just mentioned. But additionally there was also a reduction in blood biomarkers of amaloid beta pathology such as amaloid beta 42 which is associated with Alzheimer progression. So, this data really strengthens the argument that low vitamin D can increase dementia risk and that supplementing with vitamin D can help lower that risk.	Success

Could protecting your brain be as easy as taking this supplement?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3eL2S3UjzU	FoundMyFitness Clips 	There which vitamin D can support brain health. So vitamin D can enhance the removal of amalloid beta. This is a protein that disease by promoting its elux from the brain. Now I mentioned in that study it was a randomized control trial in people that were giving an 800 IUs of vitamin D a day, people that already had Alzheimer amaloid beta plaque burden. Um vitamin D also is an immune modulator. So vitamin D receptors on micro GA and aststerittes in the brain help reduce excess neuroinflammation. So it it basically helps lower the pro-inflammatory cytoine response in the brain. We know that neuroinflammation plays a major major role in the cause uh of dementia and Alzheimer upregulates a variety of neurotrophic factors including nerve growth factor and um also brain drive neurotrphic factor. So this is helping support neurotransmitters, supporting learning and memory. And then lastly, vitamin D also decreases oxidative stress. It been shown in the the mild cognitive impairment trial that I mentioned earlier. This was a randomized control trial. Those individuals that took vitamin D also had decreased levels of various markers of oxidative stress compared to people that were given the placebo.

Intravenous vitamin C and viral infection | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDyUsg90-Gs	FoundMyFitness Clips 	the next question has to do with vitamin c and the question is is it true that high-dose intravenous vitamin c may help treat covid19 so first of all there published data looking at the effect of intravenous vitamin c on 19. so cannot speak specifically to whether or not intravenous vitamin c may help treat coping 19. there is a randomized placebo-controlled trial that began in china on february 14th investigating the effect of high-dose intravenous vitamin c on severe coba 19 infected pneumonia the study will treat severe cova 19 patients with 12 grams of intravenous vitamin c twice a day for a total of 24 grams of intravenous vitamin c for seven days the trial is expected to be completed by september 30th of 2020. there is some anecdotal evidence from correspondence from physicians in china that have been using intravenous vitamin c to treat complications associated with covid19 these correspondences are not peer-reviewed they from physicians that have been posted on websites for example one physician in china used was treating 50 cases of moderate to severe cover 19 with high intravenous vitamin c the dose ranging from 10 to 20 grams a day for 7 to 10 days with 10 grams for moderate cases and 20 grams for the more severe cases the pulmonary status and coagulation status was the determining factor for the severity of copa 19. all patients who received the intravenous vitamin c according to the anecdote improved and there was no mortality compared to the average of a 30-day hospital stay for cover 19 patients those patients who received high-dose intravenous vitamin c had a hospital stay about three to five days shorter than the overall patients again that is anecdotal data so there there be made from from that data but what we can speak a little bit more about today is published data on the use of intravenous vitamin c for infections acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis both acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis can be complications associated with severe coba 19 illness so let difference between intravenous versus oral vitamin c bioavailability intravenous vitamin c bypasses intestinal absorption and the saturatable transport mechanism so consequently the bioavailability of vitamin c differs appreciably between oral and intravenous administration so for example in healthy adults intravenous administration of vitamin c might reach blood level concentrations that are anywhere between 30 to 70 times higher than the same oral dose in one clinical study in which 12 adults between the ages of 19 and 27 were administered 1.25 grams of vitamin c either orally or intravenously peak plasma concentrations reached 135 micromoles per liter of blood and 885 micromoles per liter of blood respectively furthermore a high dose of three grams taken every four hours resulted in peak blood concentrations of 100 220 micromoles per liter compared to 1760 micromole per liter for a single 3 gram dose of intravenous vitamin c let intravenous vitamin c for the treatment of sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome which as i mentioned earlier are both complications of severe coping 19. sepsis is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by the body immune response to acute infection under some circumstances aspects of this response that are typically associated with defense against infection can induce extensive cell and tissue damage leading to multiple organ failure the hallmark of sepsis acute respiratory distress syndrome also known as acute lung injury is a serious lung condition that causes low blood oxygen it is a common sepsis associated injury and it can lead to respiratory failure and death people diagnosed with sepsis typically have low vitamin c levels which might be predictive of increased risk for organ failure evidence suggests intravenous vitamin c might be an effective treatment for sepsis a 2019 phase ii clinical trial found that intravenous vitamin c reduced mortality in patients with sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome the randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multi-center trial took place in seven medical intensive care units in the united states over a period of three years the study participants included 167 male and female participants with sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome every six hours for four days the patients received either intravenous vitamin c 50 milligrams per kilogram of body weight or placebo the authors of the study noted a substantial difference in the death rates for the two groups whereas approximately 30 percent of patients who received the intravenous vitamin c died more than 46 percent of patients who took the placebo died patients who received vitamin c had fewer ventilated days spent less time in intensive care seven days versus ten and their hospital stays were approximately one week shorter than those who received the placebo these findings suggest that intravenous vitamin c administration might be beneficial in critically ill patients who have sepsis a separate study treated 47 patients with 6 grams of intravenous vitamin c four times per day for four days along with a steroid medication and vitamin b1 thymine a control group of 47 patients identified as having similar baseline characteristics of sepsis when admitted to the intensive care unit received standard of care the death rate in the treated group was only 8.5 percent compared to 40.4 percent in the control group in addition the treated group exhibited improved organ function compared to the control group these studies suggest that intravenous vitamin c alone or in combination with other treatments like thiamine decrease the risk of organ failure and mortality in patients diagnosed with sepsis there have been several other studies that have successfully used intravenous vitamin c and thiamine for the treatment of sepsis for the past several decades intravenous vitamin c has been used as an effective antiviral agent for the treatment of multiple types of viral infections including myocarditis epstein-barr virus and others furthermore some studies have observed that in critically ill patients such as those with viral infections plasma levels of vitamin c might be less than 25 percent of those observed in healthy people intravenous vitamin c treating viral infections is likely due to its ability to enhance the immune system and also due to its ability to directly produce hydrogen peroxide which we cells such as lymphocytes and neutrophils actively participate in eliminating pathogens such as bacteria or viruses from the body vitamin c is highly concentrated in immune cells with neutrophils and leukocytes having between 50 to 100 times higher vitamin c concentrations than plasma one of the early stages of the body bacterial infection involves neutrophil infiltration into affected tissue where the cells engulf the pathogens and initiate their removal neutrophils also generate large quantities of reactive oxygen species the high levels of vitamin c found in immune cells protect the neutrophils from reactive oxygen species induce dna damage while also promoting neutrophil ross production studies in humans have shown that vitamin c can enhance neutrophil function in young men between the ages of 18 to 30 as well as in older women in addition studies in guinea pigs suggest that vitamin c plays an important role in facilitating neutrophil migration to sites of infection vitamin c also appears to boost the immune system by promoting the proliferation of t cells and preventing t cell death t cells play a major role in driving an immune response against pathogens such as bacteria or viruses multiple in vitro studies in both mouse and human cell lines have demonstrated that growing t cells in culture with vitamin c might enhance t cell development while vitamin c acts primarily as an antioxidant at physiological concentrations of approximately 50 micromoles per liter pharmacologic doses of intravenous vitamin c greater than 1 gram generates hydrogen peroxide a type of reactive oxygen species that can damage dna rna and proteins leading to tissue damage multiple in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that high-dose intravenous vitamin c leads to the formation of hydrogen peroxide but it is important to note that successive treatments with high dose intravenous vitamin c has not been shown to increase pro-oxidative markers in healthy individuals suggesting that while the high-dose intravenous vitamin c may produce hydrogen peroxide and this hydrogen peroxide may be killing other pathogens such as

How to Improve Sleep With Light, Temperature, Meal Timing, & CBT-I	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OYbbSGey4I	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so I think it restriction poor sleep does cause dysfunctional metabolism and so the question is can you fix your sleep and improve metabolic health so there are Vari there ways we sleep both of them involve good sleep hygiene so good sleep hygiene is really the foundation of good sleep and there a variety of factors that are like a checklist of it and I didn of them but some of the main ones here are using light smartly so bright light exposure first thing in the morning at least 30 minutes is one of the most important ways to reset your circadian rhythm so that you become sleepy at a normal time very very important for resetting circadian rhythm but also important for stopping that melatonin production when you right also avoiding bright light blue light exposure in the evening after Sunset right blue light is what is inhibiting melatonin production in our eyes um it actually not in our eyes but it inhibiting um melanopsin which then is involved in in you know the signaling of producing Mel melatonin to make us sleepy and so you want to avoid blue light either by having light dimmers or different color lights maybe red or orange also glasses you can wear to filter it out but also really realize that screens are full of bright light blue light as well as well so you know turning down the screens maybe avoiding screens at night is another good idea also making sure your room is dark because there that even a little bit of ambient light coming in disrupt sleep managing temperature is important so part of what melatonin is doing besides making you sleepy is it temperature and this is part of the Circadian rhythm it sleep and so you want to make sure you and there obviously maintain your bedroom temperature optimizing meal timing is also important so in in addition to the importance of avoiding eating you know like 3 hours before your bedtime because of the Melatonin production it also improves your sleep so this has actually been some work by Dr sain Panda uh at the sulk Institute as well he identified from large studies that he done that people that stop eating 3 hours at least 3 hours before their bedtime sleep better and that partially because because you digesting I mean digesting is a lot of is an energy consuming process right that it makes sense that it would also disrupt sleep somewhat regular exercise so again this is all these are all tied together so the exercise is also a very powerful zeit giber so you know just routine exercise is also really important for resetting the Circadian rhythm and helping you just get on that Rhythm and go to bed at a a normal time and then monitoring caffeine intake caffeine shifts the circadian clock by 45 minutes so if you that shift and then you have another cup of coffee that shift right and so you going to bed hours later if you drinking four cups of coffee particularly if it um obviously there variation between the way we metabolized caffeine so yeah there variation but generally speaking it still shifts circadium um Rhythm by by about close to an hour so sleep extension is one of the evidence-based ways that improve sleep and this involves really just adjusting your bed times to increase the sleep time so either going to bed earlier or sleeping in both of those it also involves a lot of consultations with Sleep Experts and then sleep hygiene recommendations like we just discussed and so there meta analyses looking at sleep extension in people that are short sleeper so they sleep per night and when they undergo this um this type of Behavioral change when they extension they additional that they night they improve their insulin sensitivity regardless of their body weight they improve and normalize their hormones leptin and gin they have reduced appetite right they getting so hungry their sugar intake goes down and their caloric reduction goes down and they lose weight so all all these things of course the the sugar intake and reducing the calories it all regulated by the the satiety hormones which again if you increasing your sleep you can you can basically flip that switch to to kind of help regulate them back and normalize them back the other type of evidence-based way of improving sleep is a certain type of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia cbti this is probably one of the most used well-known and effective ways to improve insomnia it involves a variety of factors I in depth on but stimulus control is the main one so that means the bed is only associated with sleep so no watching TV in your bed no scrolling on your phone no doing any anything screens on your bed bed is for sleeping only so that stimulus control it involves sleep restriction which is a little ironic um paradoxical but so that means if you laying in your bed and you and turning and you two or three it means getting out of your bed and going going into another room dark room like a your your living room couch and laying there and you do some relaxation techniques that are you learn about and then wait till you get sleepy and then go back into the bed so again bed is for Sleep only it also involves implementing a variety of the Sleep hygiene factors that we talked about sleep education and again some relaxation techniques so metaanalyses of cbti have also been shown to improved metabolic health and people with insomnia including improved hba1c impove improved blood pressure of course their Sleep Quality and insomnia factors and all those things improve as well so it pretty clear that people that have poor sleep that are in have insomnia that are short sleepers if they work on fixing their sleep they improve their metabolic health	Success

Does a ketogenic diet provide the same brain benefits as fasting	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao2Ke9ns3sE	FoundMyFitness Clips 	what are your thoughts on the benefits of this metabolic switching from intermittent fasting you know in terms of you know can you get similar benefits by just doing a ketogenic diet are there differences between the intermittent fasting and the ketogenic diet my opinion is that you can get some but not all the benefits of intermittent fasting with a ketogenic diet you know early on i talked about how increased activity in neural networks is good for neurons and with intermittent fasting there is evidence that during the fasting there increase at least in some neural networks in activity neural networks i guess that kind of makes sense from an evolutionary perspective that if you you haven long time um your brain cells better be active your brain better be you better be alert you better be motivated and you better be thinking cognitively on you know where do i go to find a prey animal or to find fruit on trees you know based on that you know so the ketogenic diet uh will not cause that increase in neural network activity so you know the ketogenic diet one thing it seems to do is enhance um activity of what transmitter called gaba um so i 101. oh let me ask you around i asked this question to people this out of curiosity and actually writing a book on this now second book um name a neurotransmitter besides gaba okay just one dopamine serotonin glutamate okay the third one you name that glutamate is the most important neurotransmitter um a lot of people have heard of dopamine and serotonin because dopamine links with addiction and serotonin but turns out that at least 90 percent of the nerve cells in your brain deploy glutamate as a neurotransmitter and those neurons are distributed in every brain region throughout the cerebral cortex other brain regions hippocampus brainstem uh basal gangli whereas the the neurons that produce dopamine and serotonin are few in number and they regions in the brain stem they but the only way those neurotransmitters affect behavior is by acting on glutamatergic neurons okay and then the main inhibitory neurotransmitter is gaba and neurons that debo deploy gaba are distributed throughout the brain and their main role is to kind of control excitability of glutamatergic neurons you know in throughout the brain so if you if you were to block the function of gaba-producing neurons your brain circuits would fry themselves on the other hand if you have too much gaba then it quite can quiet down the glutamatergic activity so much that your brain doesn so an example of that is drugs called benzodiazepines like valium they activate gaba receptors so they quiet down the glutamatergic neurons but if you take too much valium you if you were an animal in the wild and you hadn you don you you want your nerve cell circuits to to function anyway so the intermittent fasting similar to intermittent exercise you get this activation enrollment network so one of the main effects that i haven about yet in the brain of exercise intermittent fasting and intellectual engagement is to increase the production of proteins that are called nerve cell growth factors or neurotrophic factors one of those proteins that in neural networks and in response to the metabolic stresses of exercise and fasting is called that neurotrophic factor is called bdnf brain derived neurotrophic factor it such nerve cell growth factor in the brain and it is essential for learning in memory uh you can uh you can in mice they you can reduce levels genetically and then that will impair learning and memory actually interestingly if you reduce levels of bdnf by about 50 the animals will over overeat and become obese so bdnf regulating appetite um okay so let right so ketogenic diet uh it will definitely your neurons will switch from using glucose to ketones we think that essentially ketones is a more efficient energy source for cells than glucose um and there actually less free radicals generated in the burning of if you will burning of ketones compared to glucose and then the ketones have these signaling functions affecting gene expression that glucose doesn so i guess two things the ketones are a good energy source for neurons and they have signaling functions but those signaling functions are more limited than than are activated by exercise or intermittent fasting or keeping your brain active you	Success

Magnesium deficiency and inadequacy is hard to measure accurately | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNJN8wFvPAw	FoundMyFitness Clips 	I would say that I absolutely think magnesium is really really important and as you said you know like they know half at least back back in 2014 you know 45 percent of the u.s. population was not getting adequate amounts of it what does that mean for people like if they feel like I do okay I or something like what is what does that mean in terms of symptoms like why do we need this much magnesium well for one it magnesium is stored in muscle tissue and in bones your your body anytime it it pulls it out of those so your plasma levels unless you deficient your plasma levels aren going to really indicate much of a deficiency so the way that inadequacy or deficiency like I measured is from dietary intake so people aren supposed to be getting you know depending on if they it a day of magnesium and most people aren eating the right foods you know these foods magnesium is high in dark leafy greens it center of a chlorophyll molecule chlorophyll giving plants or green color so things that are dark and green plants how we course it it know affect the bioavailability nuts also a great source but the thing is is you clinical symptom like you to wake up and and go oh my you know like I can see DNA damage happening because magnesium is critical to repair damage of your DNA but that something you can see it something that measured right I mean it you had scurvy right your but you were so vitamin C deficient you had scurvy that your gums started bleeding wake up in the morning you oh my plums are bleeding maybe I like you know should should get some vitamin C but magnesium I mean this is this is one of those things where it types of damage that over the course of decades builds up and starts to lead to diseases of age right you know defects and DNA repair absolute play a role in cancer big-time mold answer and also just in like cellular dysfunction when you start to accumulate damage instead of cells don well including in the brain so magnesium is also critical for the production of ATP and the utilization of it so you can have low energy that is one of you know potentially maybe but see you know the thing is is that it because you need to make energy to survive that that your your all your magnesium then will be used for things that are critical to prevent death in the short term right so this is um part of my mentors theory triage theory on Aging but that he about and published on where you know some of these some of these little insufficiencies in in micronutrients like magnesium they are they are resulting in insidious damage that builds up over decades things that you aren life and actually as diseases of Aging and so you know regulate the aging process itself so I don you a real clinical symptom unless you severely magnesium deficient you	Success
It's time we put this myth about protein to rest	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlUOGH5Lsa8	FoundMyFitness Clips 	despite common misconceptions a very high protein intake is not harmful to Kidney Health in people without pre-existing kidney conditions research consistently shows that high protein diets are safe for most people and any concerns over kidney damage are largely unfounded higher protein diets do induce changes in kidney function but they do not overburden the kidneys the observe increase in markers in kidney function is a normal adaptive response to eliminate Ura and other waste products generated during protein met metabolism this is entirely normal for individuals with healthy renal function moreover research and athletes has shown that consuming protein intakes as high as 3.2 to 4.5 gram per kilogram of body weight per day for up to one year does not cause any adverse changes in kidney function and is considered safe this intake is four to six times higher than the RDA for protein the bottom line we can finally put to rest the myth that high protein diets harm healthy kidneys	Success

What Microplastics Are Doing to Your Brain (not good)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZNwll3NmHk	FoundMyFitness Clips 	and I want to talk about this now so there autism spectrum disorder there are multiple human observational studies that suggest a connection between maternal BPA levels and an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder for example one study from Harvard School of Public Health found that higher BPA levels in pregnant women were associated with behavioral problems in their children particularly boys so these included issues like anxiety aggression impaired Social functioning these are traits that overlap with autism spectrum disorder symptoms another large cohort study followed pregnant women and their children over several years and found that higher maternal BPA exposure during pregnancy was associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcomes in children including several behavioral problems and again these effects were more pronounced in boys while the study didn behavioral impacts they observed align again with that are seen in autism spectrum disorder there analysis that reviewed several studies on maternal BPA exposure and neurodevelopment and although it didn conclusively prove a direct link to autism it did find consistent evidence that prenatal BPA exposure increase the risk of Behavioral issues like hyperactivity and in attention which are common in children with autism spectrum disorder and also other neurodevelopmental disorders and when you pair that with the animal data it becomes harder to ignore this potential connection animal Studies have consistently shown that BPA exposure during pregnancy causes Offspring to have deficits in social behaviors increased anxiety and altered brain structure in key areas like the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus the same brain areas that affected in humans with autism and it exposure during pregnancy there actually another layer to this so one study found that children with autism spectrum disorder actually struggle to metabolize BPA so their bodies aren detoxifying the chemical as efficiently so it builds up especially in its active form free BPA which means it circulating in their systems longer and potentially affecting brain development throughout childhood and Adolescence this is important because estrogen receptors in the brain play a key role in things like cognition memory social behavior areas that are often imp impacted in autism some research actually suspect that this impaired metabolism of BPA in kids with autism spectrum disorder could be disrupting those key neural Pathways which could explain some of the cognitive and behavioral challenges that are seen in autism it punch first you during pregnancy which affects the structure and development of the brain then if that child is less able to metabolize BPA efficiently it sets up this prolonged exposure to a chemical that development so animal studies consistently show that early life exposure to BPA disrupts neuronal circuits responsible for learning attention behavior and this could explain some of the cognitive and social deficits seen in children with autism spectrum disorder but the effects of BPA on the developing brain don autism there prenatal exposure to BPA is linked to a higher risk of behavioral problems like anxiety attention disorders and even ADHD so a study published in 2017 found that kids who were exposed to higher levels of BPA during pregnancy were more likely to develop ADHD along with anxiety and depression later in childhood so how does BPA do all this damage well it seems like it interferes with the key neurotransmitter system specifically dopamine and serotonin that affect brain function so these these chemicals are crucial for regulating mood attention cognitive function and during development serotonin actually pays a key role in shaping the structure and function of the brain it called a brain morphogen during development so it and differentiation of neurons during early life it acts as a growth factor during embryonic development influencing the development of key brain regions like the cerebellum by promoting dendritic growth and synapse form and stabilization these are critical processes for proper neural circuit formation and coordination between brain regions disruption of the serotonin system during this very critical period could absolutely affect brain development in fact vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy may also disrupt serotonin production which could affect autism risk I actually published two studies on this very topic a few years ago so the fact that BPA is linked to autism and it disrupts the serotonin system and vitamin D deficiency also is linked to autism during pregnancy and also disrupts the serotonin system to me strengthens the connection because when you start to see different environmental factors that are all sort of aligning and converging on a similar mechanism it that BPA also induces oxidative stress in the brain so this means it generating harmful free radicals that damage brain cells it impairs their ability to communicate and to adapt this is what we call synaptic plasticity that oxidative stress can also trigger inflammation which is sort of amplifies the damage especially in developing neurons now I want to get on to something that we touched on earlier in the podcast that also is pretty concerning and it microplastics could actually be making their way into the adult brain so when we think about how the body protects the brain we usually think of the bloodb brain barrier this is a highly selective Shield that substances out of the brain but there emerging evidence suggesting that microplastics especially the smaller nanoplastics so these are less than one micrometer can actually cross the bloodb brain barrier and once they could cause some real damage for example one study found that polystyrene microplastics were accumulating in critical brain regions like the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex these are areas responsible for memory for learning for emotional regulation when these microplastics settle into brain tissue they can trigger an inflammatory response they Spike levels of pro-inflammatory cyto kindes like tnf Alpha il6 these are markers that are associated with chronic brain inflammation and we know chronic brain inflammation is link to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer disease and even just normal cognitive decline if you want to learn more on how neural inflammation plays a major role in the development of neurodegenerative disease please check out my previous episode episode number 79 with Dr Axel Montaine on the blood brain barrier and Alzheimer animal studies that connection there showing accumulation of microplastics in brain samples taken from Human autopsies in one study research examined tissues from livers kidneys and brains of autopsied individuals while all organs contained microplastics that concerning the brain samples alone were were particularly concerning because on average of the 91 brain samples studied they contain 10 to 20 times more plastic in the brains than other organs and these findings are even more disturbing when you consider their implications for neurogen diseases among the brain sample studied 12 were from individuals who had died with dementia including Alzheimer disease these samples contained up to 10 times more plastic by weight compared to those people who had Plastics in their brains without dementia while this doesn correlation is enough to raise serious concerns about the role of microplastics in cognitive decline and diseases like Alzheimer is the increase in microplastic concentrations over time so human brain samples from 2024 had about 50% more plastic than similar samples dating back to 2016 this trend mirrors the Rising level of microplastics found in the environment suggesting that as our environmental plastic pollution increases so does the plastic accumulation in human tissues like the brain so the question becomes what does long-term low dose exposure look like for humans especially in urban environments where microplastic air pollution is high and what about kids so we already discussed this somewhat during early development the bloodb brain barrier is even more permeable which which means that pregnant women and young children could be at a greater risk for neurodevelopmental issues like autism or ADHD if exposed to microplastics and observational evidence seems to suggest that this is the case for chemicals associated with them as well like BPA so the implications are that we could be looking at higher risk of nerd degenerative diseases cognitive impairments and even ner developmental issues if exposure starts early in life this is something we absolutely need more research on but the early signs are not good	Success

Drs. Bill Harris and Rhonda Patrick comment on omega-3 prostate cancer study SELECT trial	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LncobFcnYlg	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so there would i would kind of love to get your thoughts on sure one is a question i a lot of people um will ask me or email me about and it is about this 2013 paper that was published by yeah bradsky pulaski yeah um yes and he he looked at blood omega-3 levels i don was platinum plasma phospholipids yeah omega-3 and the incidence of prostate cancer in a trial of people was called the select trial where people were given high dose alpha tocopherol and or selenium selenium right um and he found a correlation between the plasma phospholipid phospholipid omega-3 and right prostate cancer and it was statistically significant yes it was the the range of high to low omega-3 was like this like 4.6 versus 4.2 something like that it very small which makes you go that doesn plus i mean my biggest i i don criticize the results so much as the discussion in that paper because they said therefore ergo taking fish oil or eating high omega few fish is going to cause prostate cancer they turned a an association into a cause and effect in that study you weren supplement nobody in that study was on omega-3s and so they these guys already had a bent that they didn about them supplements in general omega-3 happened to be the supplement du jour and so their discussion and what they said on tv and what they said on other interviews was what went way beyond the data the data itself have not been confirmed they by other studies those studies don of course and you weird thing hanging out from now eight years ago that still pops up that uh hopefully this podcast will not cause somebody to go look at because if you do look at it realize that the the levels of omega 3 are very tiny plus i mean we we submitted a letter to the editor about that me and michael davidson and one of the things we pointed out was there some cancer cells they can actually up regulate fads activity and you might actually be making some more omega-3 because you got cancer if i mean that again it difference in levels between those who did and those who didn but there are other mechanisms one if it was even true then that you can explain it by and once you have expected it to be repeated with yet there were other studies as you mentioned that refuted that weren yeah that showed that actually omega-3s were more protective even prostate cancer um but i don my thoughts too on this with the selection yeah sure am i allowed to ask her i mean so i you know the the fact the trial design the fact that these men were actually they were given like it was a 400 i used of alpha tocopherol or selenium i mean the the 400 i used of alpha tocopherol uh my mentor bruce ames and his um one of his postdocs had shown that when you give like a high dose of alpha cophoral much like the rda of it is like 25 15 15. something like that yeah um that you basically deplete another um tocopherol gamma tocopherol which is anti-inflammatory and so there actually not good to take megadoses of the vitamins the alpha tocopherol form of vitamin e and so it looking at blood samples from a very confounded you know cohort yeah you assuming that selenium and elephant golfer had no effect on right and we have no idea what could have happened right so i didn interesting yeah and then plus the the the the lack of confirmation of that study it you know get this out there i mean this the study it was not believe this stuff yeah no it as anything that is thought to be good for you but then is not good for you and not only not could be bad for you totally they love you you know yeah it makes it makes the headlines um so glad we got that taken care you	Success
Why sleep is improved by heat Â the growth hormone mechanism	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qj8NoVuXzY	FoundMyFitness Clips 	studies on sauna have long shown that heat stress can produce a growth hormone Spike that is transient but also utterly profound doubling it or even multiplying it by as much as 16 fold compared to normal levels this is a classic Hallmark response to heat but the question is what is the physiological relevance growth hormone releasing hormone stimulates gabaergic neurons and the hypothalamus crucial for both temperature regulation and sleep control this creates a fascinating interplay between growth hormone and slow wave sleep for more in-depth insights here from my recent episode on this topic find the full discussion on YouTube and podcast platforms the relationship between growth hormone and sleep appears to be bi-directional on the one hand the majority of daily growth hormone secretion occurs in the initial phase of slow wave sleep on the other hand growth hormone and its releasing hormone growth hormone releasing hormone have also been shown to promote sleep particularly slow wave sleep regular sauna use is probably one of the most powerful stimuli that increases both growth hormone and prolactin so growth hormone the effects of Sony use on growth hormone levels really depend on many factors including duration temperature and frequency so for instance to 20 minutes sauna sessions at 80 degrees Celsius with 30 minutes of cooling period in between can double growth hormone levels um basically from their Baseline on the other hand two 15-minute sauna sessions at about 100 degrees Celsius dry heat separated by a 30 minute cooling period can cause a five-fold increase in growth hormone levels so there um when you do sort of repeated sauna use so repeated sauna use for example you do one you do two one hour sauna sessions at 80 degrees Celsius this is very very high for seven days in a row that leads to a 16-fold increase in growth hormone levels in men heating activates warm sensitive neurons in the hypothalamus that promote slow wave activity in response to increased core body temperature and skin temperature yet again another potential mechanism behind why sauna use why hot baths and even exercise which elevates core body temperature May promote slow wave deep sleep	Success
Why you don't need to drink a protein shake immediately after you workout	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHelyhNCkmw	FoundMyFitness Clips 	the anabolic window is a period after exercise typically lasting from 30 minutes to 2 hours during which the body is primed to absorb and utilize nutrients particularly protein and carbohydrates for muscle repair and growth it occurs because the body ability to synthesize protein and replenish glycogen stores is heightened aided by exercise induced hormonal changes like increased insulin levels consuming 20 to 40 gram of high quality protein often paired with carbohydrates can enhance Muscle Recovery and growth during the anabolic window or so it was once thought recent scientific evidence reveals that muscle protein synthesis remains significantly elevated for a full 24 hours following exercise effectively debunking the notion of a very narrow anabolic window lasting only a few hours furthermore supplementing with protein before exercise has the same effects on body composition and strength compared to supplementing with protein immediately after exercise	Success

How ketone ester supplementation may improve brain health | Dr. Mark Mattson	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Kp4bnJ0jOI	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so in neurons like up to it neurons that are active this during normal activity up to 50 percent of the atp is used to drive the the sodium pump and the calcium pump to pump so pump those ions back out after the neuron is fired so when the neuron fires an action potential when it active the sodium and calcium rush in then you get a voltage change across the membrane and then that important to rapidly remove the sodium potassium so that the charge across the membrane gets back to where it was and so yeah during normal aging alzheimer parkinson if the mitochondria aren well then they are there excitability and so anyway that of the sculpture and destroyer how much of a role would the gaba production from being in ketosis help negate that well that question i think that from a drug standpoint drugs that that enhance gaba tone could be beneficial uh the trick it it glutamate is critical for learning and memory and it that you know all our circuits essentially are glutamatergic so you don to go out of control but you don too low so that function isn what about testing that with something like a ketone ester to see you know transiently no we so richard beach in i can anyway bottom line is he he sent a pulse back up to my lab and uh what was his name kashi a japanese postdoc and together with people in my lab in a mouse model alzheimer they gave the animals in the in the food ketone ester or or not and then we had isocaloric and then we looked at the amyloid accumulation the neurofibrillary tangle tau and learning in memory and the ketone ester was beneficial and um no i think the key the ketone ester is very promising um a friend of mine up in uh in canada steve kunan has done some really nice work with pet imaging so all right so one can get images of relative levels of utilization of glucose by brain cells or of ketones so steve kanan used he had radio-label glucose 2-deoxyglucose and um radio labeled um he uses acetoacetate but it doesn hydroxybutyrate okay so he had had these were just normal initially normal people but he studies in people with mild cognitive impairment and alzheimer so he had them so when they brain cells use mainly glucose when they go on a ketogenic diet the brain cells switch they clearly switch it they use a lot more ketones maybe still using some glucose and then in alzheimer other investigators decades ago had shown that very early on you know people with mild cognitive impairment even somewhat during normal aging there by brain cells and however we think based on some of our animal studies and some preliminary studies in alzheimer steve that at least in people with early alzheimer even though the brain cells have problems using glucose they still seem to be using ketones very well so this is something that is uh i there at nia that he intermittent fasting and people at risk for cognitive impairment and he may be one of the places where these ketone ester studies are done it and then you know that um why am i blanking on her name karen clark work at oxford with ketone esther and the elite british cyclist um so yeah that athlete endurance athletes and you know the the cost right for the average person the cost of the ketone ester is way too much to to make it practical and we we don it would be interesting to do like a comparison of you know someone you know fasting versus ketone ester um you know then you could sort out you could maybe sort out whether any endurance enhancing effect of intermittent fasting is in addition to ketone ester or if it but yeah bottom line is i think that really promising as you mentioned it the cost is very prohibitive for most people and um i i think of it so i can tell you from just anecdotally and i have to go i just it speaking with you so um as a sort of a foot in the door to like maybe someone who is not motivated to try a ketogenic diet perhaps they have cognitive decline or dementia or maybe even you know early stage alzheimer when they notice a beneficial effect from the ketone ester and that more motivating for a person to have a real world piece of evidence where they feel an effect and say okay well maybe i can try this diet that you know that quite easy to do but um they may be more motivated you	Success

Why exercise is one of the best things you can do for mental health	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtZdr-XWhrY	FoundMyFitness Clips 	the brain Drive neurotropic factor is growing new neurons can increase the size of the hippocampus but also it really important for something called neuroplasticity and that is I it of like you can think about keeping our brains more pliable and and malleable and um adaptable so really neuroplasticity allows our brains to adapt to a changing environment and this is important for aging but it important for mental health so so people with major depressive disorder for example they have dysfunction and neuroplasticity so and then that kind of makes sense right if you can a changing environment it stressful and can cause anxiety it can be depressing so um there have been a variety of different you know researchers that are trying to Target neuroplasticity as a treatment for depression so neuroplasticity not only plays a role in brain aging but it also plays a ro and mental health and I I think that important to to point out because I mean I think I think almost everyone by now knows that exercise is one of the best things you can do for mental health right I mean it can even just even doing like a 10-minute high-intensity workout you feel better	Success
This What Losing Just 1 Hour of Sleep for 3 Nights Does to Your Body	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxNhhPReHow	FoundMyFitness Clips 	okay so let I want to discuss um this this morning and it has to do with poor sleep and how most of us I think are aware when we don feel cognitively on game our mood is affected we feel lethargic not we don have as much energy but I that most people realize the profound effect that even mild sleep restriction has on our metabolic health and glucose regulation and this is extremely relevant because about onethird of people in the United States do not meet the recommendations which is 7 to nine hours of sleep per night for sleep and um again this is very relevant for jet lag I mean there relevance here for poor sleep so mild sleep restriction this is one to three fewer hours of sleep night so I mean one it in a row can increase fasting insulin levels it can lead to higher insulin concentrations elevated fasting um uh gluc glucagon levels and also it decreases insulin sensitivity again this is just getting one hour less of sleep a night for three nights I mean how many of us have probably even done that at this conference right I mean it easy and very applicable and and it having a profound effect on metabolism sleep debt is the the cumulative effect of of sleep restriction right so this is when you Sleep restriction so in this case it was four sorry 3 days of 4 hours less of sleep per night that led to 40% slower glucose clearance 30% decrease in glucose Effectiveness so this is independent of insulin similar to diabetes and 30% um lower insulin response so this is really indicating early diabetes and these are people after just three nights of having 4 hours less sleep at night very profound effect on on metabolism there analyses done on longitudinal studies looking at type 2 diabetes risk and sleep duration and it that the optimal range of sleep for the lowest type 2 diabetes risk is 7 to n hours of sleep a night so going below 7 hours or above 9 hours were both associated with increased risk for type to ABS so the 7 hour threshold getting less than 7 hours of sleep at night uh was associated with increases in fasting insulin increases in glucose levels hir was elevated um higher hba1c and then also visceral fat was increased as well so again getting less than 7 hours of sleep a night which a lot of people do routinely and speaking of the elevated hb1 A1C I think this is really important most of you probably realize this but when you are constantly having elevations in blood glucose levels this leads to Advanced glycation end products or ages as they certainly a huge problem in people with type 2 diabetes because they are constantly having glucose disregulation and their elevated um blood glucose levels but generally speaking when you have the hb1c high you are talking about glucose reacting with lipids and proteins through the mailer reaction including collagen and this is all inside of our blood vessels Our arteries you know our M myocardium making you know surrounding our heart when you have those Advanced glycation end products forming it stiffens that collagen okay col hba1c levels turn over after about what 120 days your collagen is in there forever so what happens is your you have those Advanced cation end products there stiffens the blood vessels and this leads to hypertension plays a big role in hypertension when it the arteries and you know the in the in The myocardium this this decreases cardiovascular compliance and it really plays a role in the stiffening of your heart with age and so these Advan application and products increase the risk of cardiovascular disease heart attacks and hypertension so having these elevations in your blood glucose levels and you know subsequently the hba1c biomarker which biomarks that is is so much more than just type 2 diabetes risk it really a cumulative effect that that plays a role um as we age there are variety of mechanisms that have been identified for how short sleep and you know mild sleep restriction can uh cause dysfunctional metabolism so there decreased insulin signning in adipocytes we cell sensitivity to glucose we to talk about impaired glucose absorption in muscle and liver and then changes in satiety hormones so there looking at sleep restriction this is about four hours of sleep at night for four days it decreased insulin signaling in adipocytes by 30% so I mean your ad your atopos sites are one of the major syns aside from muscle for glucose disposal right storing storing it as fat you know for energy but a 30% reduction in in in cellular insulin signaling ataides is I mean you unhealthy people this is like a healthy person immediately becoming obese or immediately becoming type 2 diabetic after just four days right of sleep restriction so it terms of metabolic Health Sleep loss so sleep my mild sleep loss even um it does promote an obesogenic profile and so a lot of work has been done out of Eve van coucher lab and um she hunger hormones satiety hormones so after two days of 4 hours less sleep leptin levels go down so people are not feeling satiated by their food because leptin regulates satiation um and their gin levels increase so it whammy gin is the hunger hormone it tells you you getting this continual hunger so Global hunger ratings go up Global appetite goes you know up so people are not satiated by their food and they hungry throughout their day and um again e Eve van counter people eat more so they and they cravings for processed foods highly refined sugars salty foods um you know processed fat and fatty foods so they eating up to 45% more of those processed unhealthy foods and their H their hunger ratings are 24% higher so they even more than they would if they were getting a good night	Success

Supplemental ketones in the context of fasting | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4fD4djZgYA	FoundMyFitness Clips 	you talked about ketones a bit in that last answer so let question about ketones from Austin well consumption of exogenous ketones disrupt a fasting state and I know that there been a lot of work in producing ketone supplements so that think is what will that disrupt it fast it myself I hydroxy butyrate ester so beta hydroxy butyrate is the major circulating ketone body that starts to go into ketogenesis a lot of things do happen when you that between it takes anywhere between you know 12 to 36 hours for your liver to deplete the glycogen and once that depleted what ends up happening is you immobilize fatty acids from your adipose tissue they go to the liver and they actually used to to make ketone bodies so you using them to make ketone bodies like beta hydroxy butyrate those ketone bodies can then be used as an alternative energy torch themselves which is incredible I mean just on that point the fact that you know that the the analogue I you a you know burning gas to diesel it like a completely different fuel glucose to two ketones it bodies can even do that and in some ways you know it different organs in our body right it seems as though it might be it certainly seems to be metabolically efficient you know so it takes less energy to use a ketone body compared to glucose so so it sense which which is nice so it doesn sounds like it doesn it fast it well so yeah let me oh so I continue that is that was the natural phenomena I was exploiting right now what um what ends up happening so there that I mostly clinical studies with exogenous ketone esters and just for the audience exhaust meaning not produced in the body exactly and you you forma good yeah thanks for clarifying that so the the exogenous ketone esters that are taken basically a lot of the studies that have been done have been looking in the context of like athletic performance hmm but they also look at other metabolic parameters which is interesting because that worried you can find some of this data if you look carefully right and and within these five studies there have been it seems to be that what what been shown is that the exogenous consuming for example the exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate the Supplemental beta hydroxy butyrate ester it ends up increases the the blood levels you know beta hydroxy butyrate pretty pretty high but it also seems to decrease circulating free fatty acids which suggest mmm you fatty acids from your adipose tissue to be used to make your own which means you may not be getting the benefit of what you would call fat loss right and that and that in the body so it you know when you when you butyrate levels get high enough you know your body says okay we don make any more of these so it stops the immobilizing called lipolysis the cutting of the fatty acids from the adipose tissue right interesting so your body right so that does seem to happen um but then again the exogenous ketone esters don exercising or doing physical activity it it active you are the quicker you use up those ketone bodies yeah it interesting because you know I know that when I gets my ketones way up and then I doing a ketogenic diet which does the same thing and then I go for a big workout I ketone bodies and they and I guess it missing tones during the workout for energy yeah yeah exactly what happens yeah so that with that I would be aware of with we know consuming the beta hydroxy butyrate supplemental esters or salts if you want but salts don point is that they consuming the the exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate has been shown in humans to prevent the use of amino acids from muscle so it stops and which also is you know makes sense during a prolonged fast your body has mechanisms that play that help prevent you from you know using muscle using proteins and amino acids from your muscle as energy and one of those is that you know the ketone bodies prevents that from happening so that trade-off potentially and again this is something that you know I don much of a difference it makes but it something to keep in mind yep and if you needing fuel maybe you candidate than someone is just looking for purely metabolic body based ketone production and it right to factor you	Success
This Is How You Know What Zone You're in When Doing Cardio	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTUVhsJfi4M	FoundMyFitness Clips 	since we intensity and adding more of a a stressor and a more stronger stimulus um maybe you can recap some of what Dr LaVine Dr kabala talked about on the podcast when they were sort of defining the various training zones what these zones are because there is a lot of information out there on that which is can be quite confusing to people it can be and some people will like to use zones for training I think it in sort of the exercise with you know coaches who are coaching endurance athletes to use this five zone model if people you know are familiar with listening to podcast on Fitness they reference five zones there are obviously other zones to use but yeah Dr line defined these sort of five Training zones and kind of before I go and Define what these are and how people can use them to guide their training I think it different metrics and that we to use to define each of the zones but lactate levels are one way to do it but we because in reality you know most people are not going to be measuring their lactate levels weekly monthly or even you know certainly not daily during exercise and so it point to say you know zone two exercise is this lactate level most people don really know what that is and so there are other ways to measure intensities and use these zones one way is just rating of perceived exertion or RP um and this is just a subjective measure of how hard you think you this is typically on a 6 to 20 scale now that might seem kind of weird for people like oh why is it not 1 to 10 1 to 10 is kind of typical what people use like a how hard is this scale but it the Bor RP scale and the 6 to 20 is essentially because the um initially the theory behind that scale was that you were just add a zero to whatever your RP was and that would correspond to your heart rate so say average person has a maximum heart rate of around 200 if I give you an RP of 18 that means my heart rate is probably around 180 which is a fairly high intensity whereas maybe my RP right now is a six maybe my heart rate rate so that that scale so people kind of can understand what what what that means and why we another way is to use the talk test and that able to do a full conversation barely get out words or not talk at all that kind of another way to to kind of gauge zones and the final way to describe the zone is to be um based on your percentage of your maximal heart rate and a lot of people have heart rate monitors so they measure their heart rate during exercise so we three of those kind of metrics so if we look at Zone one this is going to be a recovery intensity this is pretty much easy as you can go it it RP scale this is going to be anywhere from a six to an eight um it be about 50 to 60% of your maximum heart rate and if you test to measure that intensity it would be you could hold a full conversation so what you and I are doing right now Rhonda just talking having a podcast cast you could basically do that if you were in zone one or recovery intens because you um something like that zone two intensity people will hear about zone two training all the time this is still kind of a low a light to a moderate intensity exercise so um it correspond to an RP of about 9 to 12 60 to 70% of your maximal heart rate and then the talk test again you should be able to have a conversation in zone two if someone were listening to you they could probably tell you were exercising but in general you could hold pretty much a a full conversation and so these you know Zone one and zone two there going to be your light to moderate intensity exercises um in particular you know that zone two train good for kind of building uh your aerobic base then there veering into the territory of high-intensity interval training um it thought of a lot as your threshold intensity or maybe steady state exercise it to 15 about 70 to 80% of your maximum heart rate and then this is where talking gets a little bit difficult so you could speak in broken sentences it you can speak in broken sentences and that would be a good way to indicate kind of this Zone during uh using the talk test and then zone four this is where you get into the high intensity training so it a 16 to 18 RP it of your maximal heart rate and you could probably only speak one word or two at a time maybe if you were trying to gauge that zone based on the talk test and then zone five that intensity that hard as you can go so RP 19 or 20 it 95 plus% of your maximal heart rate and then you shouldn you intervals or something like that this is zone five you shouldn at all during that exercise intensity so those are the five zones and I think what different metrics to define the zones is that you know if people don want to train using heart rate or maybe they don monitor they can use the talk test they can use RP or maybe a combination of all three of these and they reliable I mean they have been kind of well evidence to correspond to the different zones but I think what these to train and it doesn lot of technical ability a lot of experience um and so this is I think you know in my mind the best way that people can think about kind of training intensities is using the zones as we Define them here at least using those as a guide I I really like the talk test way of defining it because I as you were sitting or talking about this I was thinking about my my whole exercise protocol and I that Zone 2 is really more Zone 3 what I doing here with respect to heart rate monitors do you I I know LaVine mentioned there can be a lot of error with using some like a smartwatch and is there more accuracy in using something like a chest strap like a maybe a polar strap versus a smartwatch versus like the talk test so let have a chest strap should you be using a talk test or can you still use your Smartwatch is it still what accurate yeah I think the accuracy of the smart watches is is obviously there they EKG and things like that but as LaVine mentioned and as others have kind of drawn caution they tend to get less accurate as the intensity of exercise increases they you know it reading from a sensor on your wrist um versus your chest so I would encourage everybody to invest in a heart rate chest you know a chest trrap monitor it going to give you a lot more accurate data some people find them uncomfortable but most of them now are are pretty comfortable and if you really want to train using heart rate I would say invest invest in the chest strap but you know the the watches aren and they can be used as a good kind of reference as to as to where you are but like I said my experience and I think the experience of others the harder that you go the higher the intensity goes kind of the less accurate that they get so if you want to use heart rate great it can be a good indicator but the talk test is a very good I think way to assess your exercise intensity especially for people who are newer so I think one of the not flaws with rpe but one of the caveats is that you need a little bit of experience to really know where you is I mean if somebody has never actually gone to a maximal intensity then how do you know how do you know what a 20 out of 20 is if you the point of volitional exhaustion so if somebody is just beginning to exercise they might be at 70% of their maximal intensity but they might think that they learn kind of what your RP is to be able to assess them accurately so I would say you know if people are more experienced with exercise then you could use something like RP to kind of gaug your intensity but those newer exercise might actually have a lot of good feedback with the talk test I even kind of used that I mean you know it running with a group of people and you can have a conversation okay well we probably in zone two if I struggling to like breathe then I might be in zone three four even five so um I think it test anybody can use it but I think newer people might benefit more from that and I think also what people can think about doing is using a combination of all three you know you can use heart rate you can use RP you can use the talk test and maybe see if those you know correlate with one another doing exercise but use all of those to kind of inform your exercise intensity exactly I usually am not wearing I do have a chest strap I have a Polish chest strap I have used it before but I wearing it when I so I I think using my my smart my Apple watch along with the talk test because I often have someone with me when I working out is like okay well maybe maybe it getting into my zone three perhaps zone four but I know I can word so it combine them both both	Success

Differences in tissue-specific utilization of NAD+ boosters (NAD+ flux study) | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTXWEDBKEYo	FoundMyFitness Clips 	the next point of concern is the bioavailability of either nicotinamide rai beside or nicotinamide mononucleotide the important point to address is whether nicotinamide right beside or nicotinamide mononucleotide can reach other tissues intact and directly form nad without going through that nad recycling pathway that I mentioned earlier called the salvage pathway the salvage pathway would mean that nicotinamide rai beside or nicotinamide mononucleotide were first metabolized into just nicotinamide before forming nad instead of directly forming nad this is an important point because nad produced from the salvage pathway is subject to feedback inhibition and therefore cannot raise nad levels in tissues above a certain level so let an animal study using isotope tracers allowed nad made directly from nicotinamide rai beside or directly from nicotinamide mononucleotide vs nad made from nicotinamide via the salvage pathway to be measured what the study found was that at a low oral dose of around 50 milligrams per kilogram body weight of either nicotinamide ride beside or nicotinamide mononucleotide they produced very low levels of nad made directly from those precursors but only in the liver not in other tissues low levels of nicotinamide drive nad on the other hand were found in the kidneys and very low levels of nicotinamide drive nad were found in the muscles and also in the brain the human equivalent dose of 50 milligrams per kilogram body weight is roughly 4.0 7 milligrams per kilogram body weight so for a hundred and eighty pound person that is approximately three hundred and thirty-two milligrams of either nicotinamide rai beside or nicotinamide mononucleotide which is a pretty doable dose but very little increases in nad were found at least in animals at that dose a higher oral dose was also done but only for nicotine my DRI beside a dose of 200 ml grams per kilogram body weight of nicotinamide rai beside showed no difference compared to a low dose in terms of making nad direct from nicotinamide right beside in any other tissues other than the liver however more of the nad derived from the salvage pathway was found in the kidney muscle and the brain then at the lower dose so 200 milligrams per kilogram body weight translates to around a human equivalent dose of 16 point 3 milligrams per kilogram body weight which for a hundred and eighty pound person is about 1.3 grams which is pretty high when nicotinamide rai beside or nicotinamide mononucleotide were given intravenously at varying doses so 50 milligrams per kilogram body weight or 500 milligrams per kilogram body weight directly produced nad was found in the liver kidney and muscle in a dose-dependent manner however the only nad detected in the brain was that which was salvaged from nicotinamide suggesting that neither nicotinamide right beside nor nicotinamide mono nucleotide crossed the blood-brain barrier it is noteworthy that had to head comparison of identical doses of injected nicotinamide rai beside and nicotinamide mononucleotide produced more nad made directly from nicotinamide right aside in the liver kidney and particularly in the muscle tissue compared to nicotinamide mononucleotide so what does this all mean and should we care what this data from the isotope tracer studies means is that even at very high oral doses neither nicotinamide rai beside or nicotinamide mononucleotide appeared to directly be transported to other tissues other than a liver at least again at those doses that were measured however nicotinamide rai beside and nicotinamide mononucleotide were converted into nicotinamide which was then transported to other tissues and some of that nicotinamide was then converted into nad and at the end of the day isn cellular nad levels what is most important anyway the other animal studies a previously mentioned that showed positive health benefits in tissues like the muscle or the brain were at a very high oral of nicotinamide right aside and nicotinamide mononucleotide in fact in some cases they were double the dose so they were about 400 milligrams per kilogram body weight so it aside and nicotinamide mononucleotide can be transported to other tissues other than the liver at very very high oral doses but that however it very high doses the nad derived from the salvage pathway was high enough to do something beneficial the isotope data also suggests that if nicotinamide Rui beside or nicotinamide meinem nucleotide is administered intravenously both of those compounds are able to be transported to other tissues and directly form nad and not be subject to feedback inhibition this also raises nad levels in multiple tissues to a much higher concentration than otherwise would be of course IV injection of these nad boosters is very challenging to translate to humans you may be wondering why all the messing around with nad boosters like nicotinamide bribe aside and nicotinamide mononucleotide in the first place the reason nicotinamide Rui beside and nicotinamide mononucleotide are popular is because they can be transported into multiple tissue types including the liver kidney muscle and heart the brain is the exception neither nicotinamide right beside nor nicotinamide mononucleotide seem to be able to directly cross the blood-brain barrier but both form nicotinamide which can be transported into all tissue types including the brain where it can then form nad so why not just go to the source and take or inject nad directly well for starters nad has poor bioavailability animal studies have shown that upon ingestion orally administered nad is primarily digested into the precursor nicotinamide but also to nicotine my driver side and nicotinamide mononucleotide before being absorbed while oral bioavailability of nad is low the hope is that intravenous nad infusion may bypass that digestive system the problem is that no mammalian nad transporter has been identified and with the exception of the brain and the heart extracellular nad has not been shown to be taken up into tissues when nad was injected into the abdominal region of mice it was able to raise nad levels in some brain regions similarly mice that were injected with a high dose of nad had increased levels of nad in the heart and also protection from cardiac hypertrophy this suggests that direct injection of nad at a high dose may be doing something beneficial at least in the brain and in the heart I would like to mention that just because no data exists that does not mean that nad delivered intravenously cannot raise nad levels and other tissues other than the brain or the heart it extracellular nad could be metabolized to nicotinamide and that could be transported to other tissues like muscle and also be converted into nad while there is very little preclinical data and zero clinical data on direct IV injection of nad it does seem like this may also be a good idea or a good area to explore as a potential way to boost energy levels and tissues you	Success

Rhonda Patrick on the role of melatonin in viral illness	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3Ii4syzEFQ	FoundMyFitness Clips 	all right so let question i will address in this episode which has to do with melatonin the question is what are your thoughts on melatonin being a potential factor to impacting the severity of the virus via its effect on inflammation and oxidative stress before we dive into this i want to emphasize there is no data to suggest that melatonin may prevent or lessen the severity of coba 19 illness there was an article published in march of 2020 discussing the potential role of melatonin as an adjuvant treatment for coping 19. we can discuss some of the the rationale behind that publication so as we know some of the coven 19 disease pathology includes excessive inflammatory and immune responses that may activate a cytokine storm and this could result in cell death of epithelial cells and endothelial cells disrupting the vascular endothelial barrier and leading to vascular leakage abnormal t cell and macrophage responses and these can induce acute lung injury acute respiratory distress syndrome a common clinical feature in coba 19 patients is low albumin levels low lymphocyte numbers low neutrophil numbers and decreased percentage of cd8 positive t cells so let melatonin melatonin is actually a hormone it controls the activity of over 500 genes many of them involved in circadian rhythm inflammation immune function antioxidant activity and more in mammals melatonin is synthesized in the pineal gland with a rhythm regulated by an endogenous circadian clock the most important factor for regulating its metabolism being the light dark cycle so melatonin is inhibited with blue light and uh it melatonin production starts um in the evening in the evening hours as the light goes away melatonin production in the pineal gland declines with age starting around 40 years old besides being produced in the pineal gland melatonin is also synthesized in many other organs like the gastrointestinal tract retina and also leukocytes both in the peripheral blood and in the bone marrow for example human lymphoid cells are an important physiological source of melatonin since resting and activated human lymphocytes synthesize and release large amounts of melatonin with melatonin concentration in medium increasing up to five times the nocturnal physiological levels in human serum t lymphocytes natural killer cells and mast cells possess melatonin receptors melatonin has the capability to regulate leukocyte function and contributes to the control of inflammation in tissues acting as both an activator of the immune system and an inhibitor of the inflammatory and immune responses depending on the biological context so melatonin seems to play a homeostatic role in regulating the immune system activating it when it reducing inflammation when levels are too high so let the immune system melatonin administration increases the proliferative response of rat lymphocytes increases the number of natural killer cells stimulates to release a pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor it enhances phagocytosis and it modulates apoptosis so it can have immune activating functions but on the other hand in other experimental systems melatonin can inhibit the translocation of nuclear factor kappa b and f kappa b as it the nucleus which then blunts the production of many different pro-inflammatory cytokines which are regulated by that nf kappa b melatonin stimulating versus immune dampening effect really depends on the biological context so the immune dampening effect occurs in circumstances where inflammation is elevated so melatonin has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in the lungs it has been shown to be protective against acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by other viral pathogens in preclinical animal studies melatonin ameliorates rsv-induced lung inflammatory injury in mice via inhibition of oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokine production rsv is a very contagious and common virus that infects the respiratory tract of most children by two years of age two clinical studies have shown that melatonin has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions in the lungs in newborns born with respiratory distress syndrome melatonin treatment reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines and improved the clinical outcome so melatonin can decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines as we several clinical studies have found that melatonin can reduce circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in people with higher circulating levels a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials suggested that the use of melatonin is associated with a reduction of tnf alpha and il-6 levels in chronic inflammatory conditions like in an eight-week randomized control trial with patients with diabetes and also periodontitis supplementation with six milligrams of melatonin per day decreased serum levels of il-6 tnf alpha and high sensitivity c reactive protein which are all biomarkers of inflammation and another trial in patients with multiple sclerosis supplementation with 25 milligrams of melatonin per day for six months promoted the reduction of serum concentrations of a variety of different pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as biomarkers of oxidative stress also during the acute phase of inflammation for example during surgical stress brain reperfusion and coronary artery reprofusion melatonin intake for less than five days reduce the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines some evidence suggests that melatonin modulates the nlrp3 inflammasome inflammasomes are large intracellular complexes that detect and respond to internal and external threats activation of inflammasomes have been implicated in a host of inflammatory disorders sarge cove one the virus responsible for the original sarge outbreak activates the nlrp3 inflammasome triggering nf kappa b and a cytokine storm in the lungs during a cytokine storm the excessive immune response ravages healthy lung tissue and drives acute respiratory failure melatonin has been shown to reduce the infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils into the lung in acute lung injury animal models due to the inhibition of the nlrp3 inflammasome melatonin is commonly taken to improve sleep sleep is very important for regulating the immune system and lack of sleep can significantly dampen immunity a meta-analysis of 19 randomized controlled trials demonstrates that melatonin decreases sleep onset latency increases total sleep time and improves overall sleep quality trials with longer duration and using higher doses of melatonin demonstrated greater effects on decreasing sleep latency and increasing total sleep time melatonin has a a pretty high safety profile short-term use of melatonin is safe even at high doses there effects that have been seen at doses even as high as one gram per day for a month in patients in the icu doses of three six or ten milligrams were shown to be safe compared to placebo also in animal models for acute lung injury acute respiratory distress syndrome there of melatonin supplementation but even though melatonin has been considered safe in many many human studies there are currently no studies with you know melatonin supplementation in copa 19 patients so that needs to be carefully monitored in summary melatonin seems to be beneficial for a variety of respiratory and inflammatory disease models it been shown in clinical studies to to dampen inflammation it regulates the immune system lowers oxidative stress as well and it does dampen the the cytokine storm it to improve sleep and that is associated with a decrease in anxiety while there melatonin use could prevent or treat covid19 it plausible that melatonin may possibly have some some beneficial role you	Success

More Women Would Avoid Alcohol If They Knew THIS	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNZUfF1N0-0	FoundMyFitness Clips 	let affects males and females separately alcohol consumption has been associated with several reproductive disorders in women including irregular menstrual cycles absence of ovulation and increased risk of spontaneous miscarriage and early menopause compared to women who don who drink are 74% more likely to experience pain during sexual intercourse a lack of sexual disire fire and disturbances in sexual arousal or orgasm they are also 45% more likely to experience premal syndrome also known as PMS heavy drinking defined as consuming one or more standard drinks per day further increases the risk of PMS to 79% when compared to never drinking alcohol consumption also reduces the ability of women to experience a pregnancy compared to women who never drink light drinkers have an 11% lower chance of pregnancy and moderate drinkers have a 23% lower chance light and moderate drinking were defined here as consuming less than one standard trink or more than one standard drink per day respectively for every one extra drink per day the chance of experiencing a pregnancy dropped by 2% however some studies suggest that avoiding alcohol altogether may not be necessary to achieve a pregnancy in one observational study of Danish women cons consuming up to 14 alcoholic drinks per week did not affect fertility which was only negatively impacted when women consumed more than 14 drinks per week the type of alcohol consumed didn to matter beer or wine were associated with the same odds of fertility among drinkers there consuming alcohol may reduce egg and embryo quality in a study of 54 women taking part in a program for invitro fertilization there was a dose response relationship between alcohol consumption and embryo quality the study classified embryo quality as Class A being embryos with a highest reproductive potential Class B being embryos with slight deviations in reproductive qualities and Class C being embryos with considerable abnormalities among the women who reported consuming any alcohol only 4% of the embryos were classified as Class A While 87% were Class B and 9% were Class C among the women who didn consume alcohol 42% of the embryos were Class A 39% were Class B and 19% were Class C in other words consuming alcohol appears to cause some abnormalities in embryos and downgrade them from class A to class B the dose of alcohol consumed also matters in the same group of participants only 15% of embryos were classified as Class A a for women who consumed up to 25 gram of alcohol or an equivalent of just two drinks per day class A embryos constituted just 4.5% of the embryos for women who consumed more than two drinks per day however among the women who reported only sporadic alcohol consumption Class A embryos constituted 44% of the embryos and for those who reported total abstinence from alcohol class A embryos con stituted 70% of the embryos let results in another way more class B embryos came from women who consumed more than 25 grams of alcohol per day so 72% were Class B embryos compared to those who consumed alcohol sporadically only 44% of those were Class B embryos and those who abstained from alcohol only 30% of those were Class B embryos the conclusion here is that consuming more alcohol leads to more abnormalities in embryos and a decreased reproductive potential looking at embryo quality is one thing but is there any evidence that alcohol leads to worse pregnancy outcomes among women who undergo IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection another assisted reproductive technology overall consuming alcohol does not appear to have a strong association with achieving a pregnancy after IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection however the dose of alcohol again seems to be be important there is a negative association between alcohol consumption and the odds of achieving a pregnancy when a woman consumption exceeds 84 gram which is the equivalent of about six standard drinks that amount would be considered moderate drinking for women if we compare moderate drinking women to to women who abstain from alcohol the chance of achieving a pregnancy after IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection drops by about 7% what alcohol consumption was also associated with a lower chance of their partner achieving a pregnancy when the father consumed six or more drinks per week the chance of their partner achieving a live pregnancy fell by 9% alcohol consumption has also been associated with changes in several hormones in premenopausal women an acute dose of alcohol equal to 0.7 G per kilogram of body weight increases plasma estrogen di Levels by 55 to 66% above Baseline levels and consuming a similar dose every day in the morning and evening for one week elevates total testosterone levels daily consumption of 30 grams of alcohol also causes elevations in plasma levels of dheas in the follicular phase estrone and estrodial in the periovulatory phase and estrone estradiol and estriol in the lutal phase now let male sexual health infertility light to moderate consumption of 14 or fewer drinks and even high consumption of 14 or more drinks per week is associated with a lower risk of erectile dysfunction in males however any alcohol consumption does appear to reduce semen quality in males an analysis of over 40 studies involved more than 23,000 men observed that drinking alcohol reduced semen vol volume reduced antioxidant enzymes present in semen and lowered levels of testosterone follicle stimulating hormone and lutenizing hormone but drinking did not influence sperm density motility morphology or DNA fragmentation in this study drinking one to seven alcoholic drinks per week appeared to offer protection against these effects as no significant changes were observed in semen parameters or sex hormones however having more than seven drinks per week was associated with lower semen volume testosterone and follicle stimulating hormone as well as higher levels of estrogen and lutenizing hormone compared to non-drinkers other Studies have confirmed that consuming between four and seven drinks per week May improve fertility compared to drinking one to three drinks or eight or more drinks per week while heavy alcohol consumption of 25 to 40 or more drinks per week leads to drastic reductions in sperm count and normal look looking sperm despite some of this evidence I just presented I really want to emphasize that expecting parents or couples who are hoping to become pregnant should really think about their alcohol use there is some good evidence that drinking Behavior by the mother and father before conception can really have an impact on the baby development this even applies to the time before you know you are pregnant I here but note that most of these studies were conducted in rats or mice unless I specify in one study consuming the equivalent of five standard drinks around the time of conception caused The Offspring to have impaired glucose tolerance and reduced insulin sensitivity when they were 6 months old which could translate to a higher risk of childhood type 2 diabetes and obesity if these findings extend to humans in a similar study exposure to binge drinking levels of alcohol before conception led to smaller Offspring body weight and reduced behavioral and puberal development regardless of which parent was exposed to the alcohol I want to underscore the last point about paternal alcohol consumption also having the ability to influence the health and development of the child because normally it think about paternal alcohol intake has been linked to deficits in skull and facial growth and development reduced organ growth in the heart lungs liver and kidney and impaired development in brain regions respons responsible for complex cognitive functions and behavior several which are characteristic of fetal alcohol Spectrum disorders what can you do if you and trying to reduce these risks well researchers in this field suggest that fathers and probably mothers too should abstain from alcohol for at least 3 months before trying to get pregnant to make sure that any lingering effects of alcohol on sperm and egg quality and function are minimized this is longer than the one month that has been previously recommended but I think it better to be overly cautious and safe than sorry so fathers are just as responsible as mothers for ensuring that they are engaging in lowrisk drinking habits prior to their partner getting pregnant these emerging data are in my opinion so incredibly important because as you alcohol products typically only caution pregnant women to avoid alcohol now based on good scientific evidence in animal models these labels should probably include information on expecting mothers and fathers the ability of a father influence their offspring related to epigenetic changes that I discuss shortly and it really emphasizes that the health of both parents is super important to ensure a healthy happy child now I want to discuss how alcohol affects sex hormones in men because testosterone is often brought up as something that men are concerned about regarding testosterone results from some studies in humans and in vitro studies are somewhat mix mixed in general chronic heavy alcohol consumption is associated with lower testosterone levels while low to moderate alcohol consumption does not appear to reduce testosterone and may even increase testosterone levels somewhat the main mechanism to explain an increase in testosterone levels with low to moderate intakes of alcohol is an increase in detoxification enzymes in the liver metabolizing alcohol requires the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase and nicotinamide dinucleotide or NAD using up NAD increases the nadh to NAD ratio which activates the liver enzyme 17 beta hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase when this happens more of the hormone andren odion is converted into testosterone the main mechanisms by which heavy alcohol consumption reduces testosterone are through its effects on the HPA access oxidative stress and inflammation here I which is the Cascade involved in our body consuming alcohol stimulates corticotropin releasing hormone or CR from the hypothalamus CR causes the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone or act from the pituary gland and finally act stimulates cortisol release from the adrenal gland high levels of cortisol especially chronically high levels blunt testosterone production and secretion from the testes as a wrap up to this discussion on fertility I want to discuss how alcohol can affect the health of newborns through its epigenetic effects I already discussed some of this information when I spoke about how maternal and paternal alcohol consumption can impact fetal Health but it expand upon what I is different from maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy which is highly cautioned against there is no safe level of alcohol consumption during pregnancy or even when trying to get pregnant fetal alcohol Spectrum disorders are entirely preventable if you avoid exposing yourself and the baby to alcohol during these crucial time points it is well known that drugs cigarette smoke dietary micronutrients and alcohol in utero can have effects on the developing embryo that might manifest during childhood and can even last until adulthood but even before conception when a mother maturing environmental and dietary exposures can still impact characteristics of eggs and the health of the child after birth during the egg maturation phase a process called genomic imprinting occurs and impacts literally every cell of the developing child one study observed that mothers who consumed alcohol at any point were less likely to have children with a genomic imprint at a non-coding RNA known as nc886 even though the consequences of this epigenetic change aren apparent because of the function of nc886 aren study as an example to highlight how preconception exposure of mothers and probably fathers to diet and lifestyle factors like alcohol consumption can potentially affect long-term health of their babies it start thinking about this stuff especially if you children maternal alcohol consumption can clearly have direct imp acts on the developing fetus or her own eggs as they grow and mature however paternal alcohol consumption can also affect a child health through epigenetic effects for example rodent Studies have shown that Offspring from alcohol treated fathers have lower birth weights lower individual organ weights smaller brains and impaired cognitive and motor abilities compared to non-alcohol treated fathers the sperm epigenome is very sensitive to environmental exposure which likely explains why paternal alcohol consumption patterns can influence Offspring phenotypes so strongly talking about all of the epigenetic modifications that have been studied is beyond the scope of this conversation but I will know that the literature in rodents in humans indicates that DNA methylation is sensitive to paternal alcohol exposure alcohol also impacts chromatin the genetic material comprising our chromosomes and non-coding rnas in sperm as I mentioned earlier it avoiding alcohol while you get pregnant and especially during pregnancy is the best way to increase your chance of a healthy pregnancy and a healthy child that goes for the mother and father there is not a lot of human research on the epigenetic changes associated with maternal and paternal alcohol consumption or what the implication of certain epigenetic changes are but it does seem that even pre-pregnancy alcohol consumption by the mother and father can alter long-term health of the children in utero and even into puberty so let women any amount of alcohol is associated with lower odds of achieving a pregnancy and lower EG quality for men the relationship between alcohol and erectile dysfunction or fertility is less certain consuming one to7 drinks per week may not impact sperm quality and even seems to protect against erectile dis function while higher levels reduce sperm quality my recommendation based on the literature if you your alcohol intake considerably preferably stop altogether at least 3 months before really trying to get pregnant there low consumption of alcohol will improve fertility outcomes in men or women	Success
These two micronutrients can reduce hangover severity	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWMpj4ZEL9Y	FoundMyFitness Clips 	zinc and vitamin B3 also known as nicotinic acid are two micronutrients that appear to have a significant impact on how we metabolize alcohol zinc is crucial for the function of several enzymes involved in alcohol metabolism helping to break down alcohol more efficiently and potentially reducing the severity of hangovers similarly vitamin B3 plays an important role in the enzymatic processes that convert alcohol into less harmful substances before they are cleared from the body so therefore higher intakes of these nutrients might correlate with less severe hangover symptoms at least that is the correlation that has been found also remember that alcohol increases zinc excretion by up to twofold so this is another reason to make sure you are replenishing your zinc stores while consuming alcohol	Success

The evolutionary origin of hormesis | Dr. Mark Mattson	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_Mm1yPqRHo	FoundMyFitness Clips 	So perhaps to kick things off today, maybe\\nwe could start or maybe you could explain why humans need some biological stress. And how maybe modern-day society\\nhas made that difficult to achieve. Yeah, during evolution, organisms evolved\\nin environments that were very stressful. Even from the simplest of microorganisms\\nlike bacteria, where they had to be able to tolerate changes in levels\\nof salinity in the water, exposure to metals that are potentially toxic,\\nlike iron and selenium and zinc. And they evolved ways not only that they\\ncould resist the toxic effects of these exposures but actually benefit from them. So, for example, in the case of iron and\\nselenium, we know that now that we need iron and selenium for proper health. But high levels of iron and\\nselenium are actually toxic. And so, cells evolve mechanisms where\\nthey actually incorporate iron into proteins and use the iron adaptively in\\nways that help them cope with stress. In the case of selenium, for example,\\nseveral of the antioxidant enzymes that is their proteins in our cells that are able\\nto remove free radicals, those proteins themselves, the antioxidant enzymes,\\nhave selenium incorporated into them. So, that And then, as we move up the\\nevolutionary tree into multicellular organisms and animals, they\\nevolved in stressful environments. Two of the major stresses are actually\\nfood scarcity and predation and competition with other organisms. So, individuals that were able to best\\nhandle these kinds of stressors, and certainly food scarcity is a stressor and\\nanimals will starve to death if they don get food, but that stress of the food\\nscarcity is actually a motivating factor and nervous systems evolved to overcome\\nfood scarcity in many different ways. So, that is some examples of... And then, the case of exercise,\\nindividuals whose bodies function well in a food deprived state and\\nenvironments where there for predation, who are those that\\nsurvived and pass their genes on. So, whatever it is those genes did\\nthat helped them perform physically well in a, you know, food deprived\\nstate had a survival advantage. So, we, modern day, fast forward,\\nlive in a much different world where we have access to food 24\\nhours a day, all day, all night. We don We can just, you know, get in\\nthe car and drive somewhere. And we can even have our groceries\\ndelivered, you know, to our door. So, you and not having these periods of\\nfood scarcity, where people are not eating, may have detrimental\\nconsequences on overall health. Yes. One way to look at that is that when we\\nhave food available all the time and when we don And they do not maintain their\\nability to cope with the kinds of stressors that cause disease. Oxidative stress is one\\nkey example, inflammation. So, a good example is\\nmuscle cells and exercise. During the exercise, it There Cells are electrically\\nactive, the muscle cells. So, if they contract, so there However, having been exposed to\\nthat stress during the exercise, the cells activate gene programs\\nthat help them cope with stress and become stronger and more resilient. So, for example, exercise increases\\nantioxidant defenses in muscle cells. It enhances the ability of the\\nmuscle cells to clear out damaged proteins, dysfunctional organelles,\\nsuch as mitochondria, which are the energy-producing organelle in the cell. And as well, there are proteins that are\\ninitially called heat shock proteins, but their function is to protect\\nother proteins from being damaged. So, all of these beneficial\\nmechanisms are stimulated by exercise. So, in a person who They have accumulation of molecular\\ngarbage in their cells, accumulation of mitochondria that aren And this is also true in brain\\ncells, which is the main thing I studied, nerve cells in the brain. There is evidence that physical exercise, mental exercise,\\nwhat you and I are doing now, Rhonda, keeping our mind intellectually engaged,\\nwe cells, they There now than there would be if we\\nweren We They There now than there would be if we\\nweren But it beefing up their antioxidant defenses,\\nbolstering their mitochondrial function. In fact, we discovered that... And this was originally described by\\nexercise physiologist and it makes sense. When you exercise regularly, your\\nmuscles get bigger, and in the case of endurance muscles, better endurance. And associated with that, there mitochondria, in each muscle cell. So, that makes sense. The cells then are more able to generate\\nthe ATP to support their function. We find a similar thing in nerve cells. And most of this is from animal studies\\nand so we But in animals, we can look more directly\\nat the brain in kind of an intrusive way. And we find that running-wheel exercise,\\nwhat we call environmental enrichment where we have the animals in cages\\nwhere they have essentially like playground-type environment where they\\ncan maintain their mind more active. And under those conditions, exercise,\\nmental exercise, there the number of mitochondria in nerve cells. And associated with that, at least\\nin some brain regions, there can even be an increase in the number\\nof synapses between nerve cells, the connections between the nerve cells. Yeah, so, that keep stressing in a good way and an\\nevolutionarily conserved way that is, by stressors that have been normally\\nencountered through millions of years. These transient, short-term, mild,\\nenergetic stresses, either the energetic stress of expending a lot of energy\\nduring exercise or the more kind of subtle energetic stress of depriving cells of\\nenergy for some extended time period. And we can, I signaling pathways and, for example,\\nketones, which are elevated during fasting and during sustained exercise. And you mentioned you talked to\\nEric Verdin about his work with enzymes called deacetylases. And his work showing that ketones\\nhave signaling functions, in fact, gene expression through modulating\\nthese enzymes called deacetylases. So, fasting does the same thing.	Success
Does vitamin D deficiency actually accelerate brain aging?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQYoFQ2RuGs	FoundMyFitness Clips 	vitamin D deficiency actually accelerates brain aging. So there have been studies that have shown that have looked by fMRI at what matter hyperintensities. So these kind of show up of as little white hypers spots if you brain and it to the white matter in the brain. And the white matter is so important for brain function for communication. It how your brain is communicating. So when you have damage to that white matter, it really does affect cognition. It affects communication and memory. For every 10 nanomal per liter increase in vitamin D, there was a small decrease in the volume of these white matter hyperintensities, suggesting that having higher levels of vitamin D can protect against this type of brain damage.

How intermittent fasting enhances the parasympathetic nervous system | Dr. Mark Mattson	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2whkceVQp4	FoundMyFitness Clips 	i want to mention one thing that of interesting so we found in rats so we implanted rats with essentially transmitters where we could record in real time 24 7 their heart rate and blood pressure and then we switched them from ad lib to either daily 30 cal restriction or every other day fasting and we found that their heart rate and blood pressure went down over a period a lot went down over a period a couple weeks a little bit more down by a month and then stayed down then we switched them back to ad libitum feeding and at about two weeks the resting heart rate and blood pressure going back up and by a month it was back to where it was be you know way back at the beginning so a couple of things so people do aerobic exercise tend to have low resting heart rate low blood pressure and and increased heart rate variability heart rate variability is the variability in the time interval between individual heartbeats so for example if your heart rate was 60 and mine was 60 uh that doesn you know each of us there you know every second exactly every second there 0.8 seconds then 1.2 seconds then 0.9 and then you know so initially i guess it counterintuitive that it to have variability between than the time interval between beats but actually it is so endurance athletes have high heart rate variability and essentially what it means is their heart the regulation of their heart is more adaptable to change to to stress and other changes and so what happens what happens is and this has been known for for exercise and particularly aerobic exercise that the reason it causes reduction in heart rate and blood pressure and increased heart rate rate variability is that the exercise over time will enhance what nerves that innervate the heart and the parasympathetic nerve slow down heart rate the sympathetic nervous system increases heart rate okay so we found the same thing with intermittent fasting it enhances the parasympathetic nervous system that will also and that which is this big nerve coming down here it innervates the heart slows down heart rate um it can increase blood flow dilation of blood vessels um and it can also enhance gut motility so um i guess i kind of want to throw that out there as kind of an interesting effect that i haven intermittent fasting on the cardiovascular system that very similar to exercise it takes a few weeks to a month to see the clear effects then if you stop doing it you stop exercising stop intermittent fasting it doesn back the way uh they were and and people who like me who had you know you exercise regularly and then in my case for an accident surgery i had to stop exercising so within a month my blood pressure went from like 100 over 60 and resting heart rate of like low 50s to blood pressure like 135 over 85 and my resting heart rates up like to 70. you know you	Success

3 Benefits of Running In Nature with Rhonda Patrick, Ph.D.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgjZIU81WPA	FoundMyFitness Clips 	three benefits to running in nature hi I six of my nature run everyday October first and foremost lower levels of stress hormones like cortisol number two there in mood and lowering of depressive symptoms compared to running in urban environments and number three cleaner air less air pollution air pollution itself increases inflammatory biomarkers and increases inflammation and stress hormones so let hormones like cortisol so one study found that people that are Urban dwellers so they live in an urban environment when they spend time out in nature they can lower their cortisol levels by almost 10% so cortisol is an important stress hormone it rises in a very cyclical manner so it is involved in regulating circadian rhythm how everything in our body is going in a certain you know along a clock in a certain Rhythm and cortisol is really high in the morning it that that morning Awakening response the cortisol Awakening response it helps you know increase energy um to start the day it elevated during that time however the problem is chronic elevation of cortisol because cortisol is a steroid hormone it regulates a significant portion of the human genome almost 20% so that one in five genes that are either turned on and activated or turned off and sort of depressed in response to elevation of cortisol so if you think about it you know our body does things on a clock right and and so that cortisol is involved in making sure things are turned on at the right time and turned off at the right time but when you have that chronic elevation of cortisol the timing is all screwed up so things are just on and off and on and off like when they disregulation in a lot of different physiological processes in the body so um lowering that that chronic cortisol by about 10% is pretty significant um the other study that I I sort of telling you guys about is a study that compared people that did physical activity in either a metropolitan environment versus a an um you know out in nature and they did the same sort of exercise protocol I believe it was like a walk or something like that I can but um the study found that the people that did the nature sort of exercise had drastic improvements in um mood and a lowering of depressive symptoms compared to those that did the Metropolitan um exercise in an urban environment you know and also just the air pollution itself right you in an urban environment there more uh pollution from from cars and a variety of other you know industrial factors so breathing in that air pollution itself has been shown to increase inflammatory biomarkers so you know again chronic low-level inflammation is associated with brain aging just Aging in general um but also it plaques and stuff in the brain so and you know potentially being correlated to Alzheimer out in nature so many benefits lowering of the stress response we get improvements in mood we get you know uh decreases in depressive symptoms and also we cleaner air you breathing in that air pollution so that doing some form of deliberate exercise every day this month I hope you guys can join me on this fun fun time to um build healthy exercise habits if you guys have any questions or comments about any of the studies or facts I talked about today I look forward to reading your comments and responding	Success

Are the benefits of exercise and fasting additive? | Dr. Mark Mattson	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqHMKhFiuW4	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so you you mentioned about you know the different types of metabolic stress whether that be exercise or intermittent fasting and how you know the the there in bdnf in the brain do you in animal studies um and i kind of want to go back to to seeing you know what your thoughts are on translating you know these animal studies to humans obviously animals have very different metabolic rates in humans for example if you were to you know fast a rodent for 20 or 48 hours they lose 20 of their body weight whereas a human would only lose two percent of their body weight from a 24 48 hour fast um but i also want to ask you have you seen additive effects in your studies on animals or have you looked at additive effects of animals that are constantly exercising or routinely you know so a physically active animal with their little exercise wheel but you also expose them to these periods of food scarcity um intermittent fasting are the two combined better than just just one type of metabolic stress there is evidence that we that combination of exercise and intermittent fasting can be better uh so i published uh one was we published a long time ago a former graduate student alexis stranahan and she it was it that design but we had normal mice and we had mice that have type 2 diabetes and they have type 2 diabetes because of a genetic um they to have a defective leptin receptor leptin is a hormone that when when you eat a meal and your stomach gets full it and it travels up to your brain a region called the hypothalamus and essentially it tells you you full stop eating so these uh diabetic mice leptin receptor mice they don so they presumably always hungry okay so then what alexis did is she divided these normal mice and diabetic mice into four groups the normal laboratory conditions which is they cages no running wheels and then they have they can eat as much as they want every day then she had a third group that were fed ad libitum and they had running wheels in the cages and then the fourth group um wait a minute what did he say yeah sorry i think i ad libitum um sedentary ad libitum running wheels then she had every other day fasting sedentary every other day fasting running wheels then she let him go for three months and she took out their brains and there hippocampus which is in many respects the most intensively studied brain region for several reasons one it critical for learning and memory it from our eyes our ears our other senses funnels in to the hippocampus and it that um if you will associations between a sight and a sound you know a bear jumping out on the trail and growling you hear its growl the next time you go walking on the trail you hear a bear growl you don you know have a mental image of a bear so the hippocampus is critical for these initial associations and then a second reason the hippocampus is heavily studies is it pathology and alzheimer epileptic seizures even stroke in some instances and the third reason is it study um because the circuitry is actually relatively simple compared to the cortex so we can put electrodes in you know we put electrodes in the glutamatergic neuron here and we stimulate a glutamatergy neuron down here and we can record that we can activate a gabaergic neuron and record reduction in activity so anyway what what we what alexis found was that first what she did is she measured the number of synapses along the dendrites in the part of the neuron that receives information coming from another neuron so she simply counted not simply it actually takes a lot of work but counted synapses and found that two things one the diabetic mice regardless of whether um they were uh intermittent fasting or had running wheels in their cages um had lo smaller number of synapses than did the normal mice then she found that the running wheel exercise and the intermittent fasting increased the number of synapses and the combination of intermittent fasting plus running wheel got a further increase in the number of synapses okay so that suggests that intermittent fasting can enhance the effects of running an increasing number of synapses between neurons and then she took the other hippocampus from the brain and measured bdnf levels and i mentioned bdnf learning in memory it important for formation of new synapses and she found that the intermittent fasting and the exercise each alone increased bdnf levels and the combination got a further boost to bdnf levels and then but uh she did not find that in the diabetic mice synapse levels came up to the level of normal mice you know so there was some beneficial effect but you couldn get it back to like they weren they had never been diabetic okay so that then the second example has to do with endurance exercise and this work was done by a former postdoc christina morosi and a postback fellow um tequila um i so this can you see this yes can you see the whole picture i can yeah so this is about a running group from the lab about 2016 or something anyway so the work i about now is done by keelan mole and and christina morossi christina wasn so so what what they did is they they took mice and they had four groups ad libinum sedentary these were all normal mice alibnum sedentary ad libertum daily treadmill training for 45 minutes every day for two months then she had a group every other day fasting no treadmill training and then the final group was daily treadmill training while they on every other day fasting for two months and then at the end of the two months they did a maximum endurance test oh and then sorry so 45 five minutes a day on the treadmill and then every week they increased either the speed of the treadmill or the incline so they you know increasing the work over the two months so they did maximum endurance and tests how long can the mouth stay on the treadmill without giving up and they found that as you the animals that had not done treadmill training had much poor endurance than the animals that did treadmill training regardless of whether they were on intermittent fasting or not but there was a statistically significant the battered endurance in the mice that were on intermittent fasting during the two months of treadmill training and they measured ketones which were um elevated with intermittent fasting and and the exercise increased the ketone levels much more almost twice as much if by the you know when you take their blood after the end of the treadmill training um and then they took out uh they did a lot of analysis of the blood they did something called metabolomics and anyway and then they took out muscle cells from the soleus muscle which is an endurance muscle in the leg of the mice and they did some measurements that suggested that intermittent fasting and the exercise increased the number of mitochondria in the muscle cells and that the increase was the most when you have the combination of the intermittent fasting and the exercise you	Success
Why the phytochemicals in plants may be better than the antioxidants | Dr. Mark Mattson	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61AhQatltHI	FoundMyFitness Clips 	one thing i want to get into and you mentioned early very early on in the introduction and i think we getting there is uh diet composition and and the question of if well there yes eating vegetables and fruits is good for hell and why is that and and the emerging evidence that has kind of turned the load up on antioxidant idea on its head [Music] and so yeah so during evolution it was two we true with other animals that are omnivores or herbivores it is advantageous to be able to eat plants materials fruits nuts roots leaves because they have energy and however it plants that we eat them in fact it generally not and we know that in the case of insects but it so most plants the most vital parts of the plants in terms of propagation of the species if you were to eat those they have a bitter taste so um the skin so for example the skin of grapes or apples um and you know broccoli the you know seed producing part the broccoli and so on they have a bitter taste and so the thinking is that it was to our advantage to be able to eat these even though they have a bitter taste and have these naturally occurring pesticides is what they are the plants are producing their own pesticides so that one of the reasons plants produce so many of the chemicals is that many of those chemicals their function is to dissuade insects and other organisms from eating them that okay so we co-evolved with these plants and as we covered with them we evolved several ways to protect ourselves from overdosing on these pesticides that the plants normally produce so one way is a bitter taste the second way is vomiting a third way which is interesting from human environmental health standpoint is we have evolved enzymes in our liver that rapidly remove these potentially toxic chemicals when we eat them they p450s okay but the fourth way is that the individual cells in our body have evolved to respond to some of these chemicals by for example enhancing their antioxidant defenses are enhancing their ability to even extrude the chemicals so i specific examples i mentioned broccoli many of your uh viewers probably if they health they sulforaphane which is a chemical that and there it can be good for health and one of the ways it is is it activates um antioxidant defenses in ourselves so it similar to exercise and fastening which are stressors the stress of this chemical that the stressor is the chemical it another example is curcumin which is in turmeric root which in indian food is very common and it also activates antioxidant defenses the most commonly consumed plant toxin by your viewers uh very likely is caffeine so if if you were to take powdered if you were to take concentrated caffeine and put it on your tongue it is extremely bitter taste uh it overdose and die from caffeine and there have been some documented cases of actually people essentially eating caffeine powder if you take tea leaves coffee beans even your ground coffee beans put them on your kitchen table in the summer assuming you don house and there you they avoid the coffee and tea leaves and they caffeine and other naturally occurring good toxins in them so that contrasts with sugar or whatever you know any any a lot of other highly palatable um addictive uh foods uh so yeah so anyway i wrote i was invited to write an article for scientific american on this general notion that the reason fruits and vegetables are good for health is not because there are free radical scavenging things like vitamin e or c can help in certain ways getting rid of free radicals that that we want to swamp ourselves with things that stop up free radicals because actually free radicals are important in ourselves for normal signaling and then our adaptive responses to stress instead the chemicals that are good for health seem to be acting by triggering mild adaptive stress responses in ourselves that are in many that overlap quite a bit with exercise and fasting um yeah and and these are these chemicals again they the exposed parts of the fruits like the skin uh of the fruits uh you know so yeah oh here thing uh green tomatoes um all right so bugs usually don the tomatoes till they start to turn red in the garden okay so why is that the reason is they like the taste of the red ones better than the green ones so it turns out there that tomatidine that that the green tomatoes and then levels of tomato being declined dramatically as the tomato turns red okay by the time the tomatoes start stirring red the seeds in the tomato that have the potential to give rise to another tomato plant and propagate the species there they so if i guess mainly this applies to the birds but so say a bird birds won let um so the bird eats the red tomato and they make some of the seeds the seeds can resist going through their digestive system then they poop out the seeds and the seeds can grow you know and they may poop out the seeds you know whatever half a mile away so now the tomato plants are and and that these are all evolutionary mechanisms that give advantages to one or both of the species um during their co-evolution is there can you if a person is exercising regularly and also doing some form of intermittent fasting and they these activation of some of these stress response pathways and the beneficial effects and using the metabolic switching is there any need to also take in these plant phytochemicals that are also activating you know perhaps the same or different or both you know stress response pathways in other words like can you just say well i don plant compounds because i and i wouldn um what hasn there and the reason is it it there haven a study they do all these various combinations you know of okay we we we do both we whatever take in sulforaphane or and then we plus intermittent fasting and so on and so on and i my view on diet composition is one that i think makes sense from data from epidemiological studies the blue zone where you know there places where people have exceptional longevity and all of them have diets that are mostly plant-based and then the evidence that simple sugar is bad for health is overwhelming the saturated fat i think the evidence is pretty strong it fish than red meat and so when you know complex carbohydrates are better than simple i i think that you know people shouldn say well i can just eat at mcdonald if i exercise in intermittent fast because it they would be better off than having been intermittent fasting and exercising uh you know if they mcdonald up then exercise and intermittent fasting will counteract that somewhat but it it the way i also think about it is you know you have something like sulforaphane which we on the podcast uh hopkins yeah he um and and so you know you have something like sulforaphane that nrf2 pathway which has you know you know all these downstream effects on phase two um detoxification enzymes you know activation activating those and inhibiting the phase one biotransformation enzymes which are involved in potentially making a pro-carcinogen um an actual carcinogen you know and all these there pathways that you know i don much exercise and or intermittent fasting you know activates those pathways i but you know there different types of stressors do have a more robust effect on certain types of stress response pathways yes and so getting why wouldn diversify yeah that makes sense yeah although i should i i should say that so go back to sulforaphane and nrf2 ar e pathway um that is activated by exercise and fasting and so i would say that these chemicals that are in the plants are more targeted in what they do compared to exercise and fastening those chemicals affect the more limited number of pathways in other words you can it intermittent fasting you	Success

Will intermittent fasting affect human lifespan? | Dr. Mark Mattson	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcfIrkHoQPc	FoundMyFitness Clips 	i would just love to know what you your thoughts are do you think for example a type of you know daily time restricted eating maybe maybe something similar to what you are doing or eating with an eight you eat within a six hour window or eight in our eight hour window every day um would have an effect on human lifespan or at the very least health span i would predict it would and this is again this is in comparison to three meals a day plus snacks and and what if the three meals a day plus snacks you you metabolically healthy say that again if let three meals are eating um high quality meals and maybe eating some nuts or something for a snack and they physically active so they metabolically healthy i think maybe because i don we don in animals exercise alone without calorie restriction or intermittent fasting has minimal next to no effect on lifespan maybe like a five percent increase so in animals and in animals that are herbivores um calorie restriction intermittent fasting have a a striking ability to extend lifespan running wheel exercise and the animals run quite a bit every day not much you know but the animals don cardiovascular disease typically or diabetes they died from cancers um kidney disease are kind of the two main causes of death so in as much as exercise has really good effects on the cardiovascular system and glucose regulation i extrapolating you know the animal to the humans because i think exercise is really important yeah if you look at the observational studies actually you know exercise in my own my own personal experience is that the exercise for me has more profound beneficial effects at least on my mental health than intermittent fasting um and i think also on you know i mentioned my blood pressure is now up it you know high clinically but it high compared you know so without exercise even though i daily time restricted eating and my body weights down i i you know showing these bad changes without the exercise yeah yeah right thank you well i 100 agree i when i exercise it almost almost exclusively for the brain benefits and mood sure and the other things are kind of healthy side effects for me you	Success
Long-haul COVID-19 may cause brain atrophy	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LycOsQxkF80	FoundMyFitness Clips 	Well, I think in addition to\\nhospitalization, there of people who have mild symptoms who\\ndon stay at home during the duration of\\ntheir illness, are coming down with post-acute COVID syndrome, which is\\npopularly known as the long-haul COVID. The symptoms range from brain fog to\\nracing heart problems to lethargy. And there at what long-haul COVID is and what\\npopulation it seems to be affecting. And interestingly, you effects would be the ones that\\nwere, you know, on the ventilator. Well, of course, people on\\nventilators do have long-term effects. But you having these long-haul COVID effects,\\nand it turns out younger people, people under the age of 50, teenagers even,\\npeople in their 20s are the ones that are really, you know, coming down\\nwith this long-haul COVID syndrome. There study that was done out of the U.K. It They get large population sample sizes. In this case, it was close to 800 people. It was 780 or something like\\nthat people before the pandemic came in and had MRI brain scans. Researchers have all this data\\non individuals brain structure and volume. And so once the pandemic hit, many people\\ncame down with COVID-19, some mild cases, some more severe, some were hospitalized. And a few months, you know, into the\\npandemic, researchers doing this Biobank study thought, scan and see if there\\ And so that Just, you know, months after\\ntheir first scan, they brought them back in for another scan. And what the preliminary findings, again,\\nthat are not peer-reviewed yet, showed is that there are major differences\\nin gray matter regions of the brain. Gray matter atrophy is occurring\\nin several different regions of the brain, very prominently in the\\nolfactory region, which makes sense because, you know, one of the telltale\\nsymptoms of COVID-19 at least pre-Delta was loss of smell, loss of taste. And also there People that had severe COVID do have\\nworse atrophy compared to the people that only had mild cases, did not need\\nto be hospitalized, but they themselves were also experiencing brain atrophy. These are people that did not\\nhave to go to the hospital. And, of course, people were matched\\nfor the same age, the same gender, the same ethnicity, and the same time\\nin between scans, so trying to keep everything, you know, as comparable as\\npossible to compare apples to apples. To me, that was quite frightening\\nbecause it really suggests that there are complications, and there are,\\nyou know, long-term effects of this virus that we don hundreds of thousands of people. I personally know quite a few. [Kyle] : Dr. Seheult, anything to add on\\nthe long COVID front because I know...that At my age, if I got COVID-19,\\nwould I have lingering symptoms? What are you seeing on your end\\nclinically with regards to that? [Dr. Seheult] : Oh, yeah. So, in addition to me working in\\nthe intensive care unit, I also have an outpatient pulmonary clinic. I blood clots in patients who went to\\nthe hospital, had COVID-19, survived, got better, so they weren shortness of breath, leg swelling. We immediately made the diagnosis\\nand put them on blood thinners. And so that So the 1% is death, but there up to that point than death. There So, totally agree. Absolutely. [Dr. Patrick] : To add on to the blood\\nclots and strokes, there was this study...multiple studies, one out\\nof Israel, and a couple out of the United States, showing that people\\nunder the age of 50 were coming in to the emergency room for strokes. And one of the studies out of Israel\\nfound, because they test everyone for COVID-19, a high percentage of the people\\nthat were coming in for these strokes, these young people under 50, had COVID-19\\nand didn So, I mean, we if they didn [Dr. Seheult] : Yeah, absolutely. And so this is the thing is\\nthat COVID-19 has many different ways of affecting the body. The one that we all know about is\\nthe lungs, of course, because it can cause inflammation in the lungs. But as Dr. Patrick points out, there\\nare blood clot issues. So blood clots to the lungs can also\\noccur, but also blood clots to the brain, which manifest the strokes.	Success

Is antibody-dependent enhancement relevant to COVID-19 vaccines?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efIYlT4DQgs	FoundMyFitness Clips 	Dr. Patrick, this next question is for you. It Can you explain what that is\\nand if you think it or applies to COVID-19? [Dr. Patrick] : Sure. So, antibody-dependent enhancement\\nrefers to when your immune system makes antibodies against a pathogen\\nthat is...it So the antibodies can bind to\\nthe pathogen, for example, in our interest here, a virus. They can bind to it, but they\\ndon And, in fact, not only do they not\\nneutralize it, they can activate other immune cells to become more\\naggressive and cause more damage. So, in the end, the immune system\\ncan end up being more damaging after being exposed to a virus than if it\\nhadn And so when I say previously had those\\nantibodies, most often I to vaccine-induced antibodies. I would say that in the United\\nStates, we really became aware of this phenomenon back in the 1960s. So this was when the respiratory\\nsyncytial virus vaccine...one of the vaccines was made, and it was being\\nclinically tested in infants and toddlers. Half of the infants and toddlers in the\\ntreatment group were given the vaccine, and the other half were given the placebo. And then the infants were then, you know,\\ngoing to be exposed to the RSV virus, which as all of us parents know like every\\nchild gets, and it They end up having a cough that can\\noftentimes linger for quite a while. So, what was terribly tragic about\\nthis vaccine story is that the infants and toddlers that had received the\\nRSV vaccine, about 80% of them were hospitalized after being exposed to\\nthe RSV virus naturally versus the infants and toddlers that had placebo,\\nonly 5% of those infants and toddlers actually ended up in the hospital\\nafter being exposed to the RSV vaccine. So this was terrifying, and, of\\ncourse, the vaccine never made it past this original clinical trial. But, you know, what was happening is\\nantibody-dependent enhancement wasn quite known at the time, but you\\nknow, much research has...you know, decades of research since then have\\nbeen done, and it antibody-dependent enhancement occurred. So the antibodies that were generated from\\nthe RSV vaccine were binding to the virus. They were not neutralizing\\nit, and, in fact, they were making the immune system worse. They virus and become more damaging. And so what was figured out by\\nmany scientists, and including some of the work of Dr. Jason McLellan who I mentioned\\nearlier, is that the antibodies that are generated that play a major role\\nin antibody-dependent enhancement are called post-fusion antibodies. And you probably can guess it. We talked about how viral\\nproteins go from a...they make a structural conformation change. They go from a pre-fusion conformation\\nto a post-fusion conformation. Well, guess what. Your immune system is making\\nantibodies to both of those different types of viral proteins. And so what the brilliant work of\\nJason McLellan showed is that you could basically lock a viral protein into\\nthe pre-fusion complex, and when you then, you know, use that pre-fusion\\nviral protein in a vaccine, you don make post-fusion antibodies because\\nyou don that structure of the viral protein. That vaccines, the pre-fusion viral\\nprotein, the pre-fusion spike protein. We are not making post-fusion\\nantibodies against the spike protein, which is so reassuring\\nthat antibody-dependent enhancement is so...it And, of course, on top of that, what\\nwe would see in the hospitals as I mentioned with RSVs is that if you take\\nan unvaccinated versus a vaccinated person and, you know, randomly choose them at\\nany point, then the vaccinated person would always have the most severe disease. They would be the one that are\\nmost likely to be hospitalized compared to unvaccinated. They would be the most likely to die. And I your population vaccinated. Well, of course, you hospital that have been vaccinated. I What you would see is that\\nunvaccinated people would be less likely to have a severe disease, and\\nthat is not what we point during this pandemic at all. So, that I think a lot of concern for\\nantibody-dependent enhancement came out of both in vitro studies, again, those\\nare studies done in cultured cells in like a petri dish as well as in vivo studies. These refer to animal studies, it can\\nbe, you know, a rodent or a hamster. Pick your animal. These studies were done with the\\noriginal SARS virus back in 2003 or 2002, what we now call SARS-CoV-1. When vaccines were made for that virus\\nand injected into some animals, they did cause antibody-dependent enhancement. That was not the case with all studies\\nand all vaccines for the SARS-CoV-1. So it was sort of an inconsistent data. But that I myself was concerned. I was reading this data, and I thought,\\n So, at the time, I didn involved in that and how, you know, Dr. Jason McLellan and his collaborators\\nhad figured out a way to bypass that, to lock that viral protein in the pre-fusion\\ncomplex so we don So that is really...at the end of the\\nday gives me a lot of peace of mind that antibody-dependent enhancement\\nis not likely to ever happen with our current vaccines in the United States. [Kyle] : Dr. Seheult, anything to add to that? [Dr. Seheult] : Yeah. As Dr. Patrick was saying, if we look at Israel,\\nwhich has been vaccinating with the Pfizer vaccine the longest out of any\\nof the countries on the planet, and we look here at the Delta variant, which is\\nwhat we to make sure that we current variant here in the United States,\\nthere was a study that was released. And you can see here on the graph we in Israel, and green, those who\\nare fully vaccinated in Israel. And you can see here that over the\\nmonths of July and August, which were just pure Delta at the time, clearly,\\nyou can see that it was the unvaccinated that were having the most severe cases. And that would not be the case\\nif we had antibody-dependent enhancement with the Delta variant. That If you break it down in the next\\ngraph even by age, you the same relationship occurs with age. But again, in each of these age\\ncategories, if you age stratify them, you will see that is the unvaccinated in\\nthese that are leading the severe cases. So this goes against the grain of what\\nyou may hear that Israel is telling us that the Pfizer vaccine is just breaking\\ndown, it That which is an important endpoint.	Success
Biodistribution in different organs of the Pfizer BioNtech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_V6wr3wkHs	FoundMyFitness Clips 	but people are concerned that these mRNA vaccines are are getting into multiple organs and therefore the spike proteins getting into these other organs and causing damage again different spike protein so that needs to be considered but a lot of this data stems from a a lot of this concern stems from a some data that was generated by Pfizer and biontech when they were doing a bunch of safety studies looking at you know what happens when you inject really high concentrations of the MRNA vaccine of the MRNA vaccine by Pfizer into rodents and so um I think the first thing to keep in mind and I know that at medcram you guys have had people on like Dr Shane Crotty who MRNA vaccines work how you have you know the MRNA um inside of a lipid nanoparticle along with some other factors like polyethylene glycol and that is injected into the deltoid muscle tissue and that basically after that injection into the tissue happens you have the lipid nanoparticle with the MRNA vaccine now getting inside of muscle cells using your own cell Machinery the ribosome to actually make the spike protein which itself has been shown to Peak after 24 hours and then after 48 Hours the spike protein half-life of the Protein that made is degraded this is not very long lasting the MRNA itself also has a half-life somewhere between you know 48 to 72 hours and the lipid nanoparticle has this a very short leg within hours it really only lasts long enough to protect the MRNA from being degraded but once you actually do make the spike protein the spike protein itself is it is expressed on the cell surface and um what the cell and the spike protein itself has a region on it called a transmembrane domain that sticks it it acts like an anchor it anchors into that plasma membrane so it is not freely floating out into your circulation it is stuck there and at that point you have other immune cells that recognize this foreign protein and begin the process of you know making antibodies and you have that whole you know immunity effect but um the concern was from this from this Pfizer study where rats were given a dose that is 10 times the amount of what if humans are given so humans are given 30 micrograms of the Pfizer biontek vaccine for one dose the rat was given 50 micrograms of the Pfizer biontec vaccine so if you were to do the calculation uh for a rat equivalent dose so if you want to give the rat what humans actually get an equivalent dose based on their body mass it would be more like 4.86 micrograms so they got 50 that okay and um this was done for a reason of okay what happens when we give them a huge amount of the vaccine well what was found um the the lipid nanoparticle that contains the MRNA was radio labeled it like a tag that you can visualize things and that radio labeled tag was found in other organs it was you know found in a variety of organs again it was to a very small degree but it was found in other organs and so people got really concerned that these mRNA vaccines were traveling to other organs and causing damage and a few things to keep in mind there one the dose was super high and in fact within the same document the same Pfizer study they gave a more equivalent dose to mice in this case they give mice two micrograms of the MRNA vaccine and That vaccine did not go to all these other organs in fact the only organ that was shown to have any amount of of the MRNA of this radio label tag was the liver and it was completely gone after 48 hours and so um I think that good news because it suggests yeah when you give you know a rat 10 times the amount of what the humans are getting you might have some spillover but on top of that again the radio labeled tag that we nanoparticle and if there is some spillover you know in the muscle tissue what surrounds the muscle tissue is your lymphatic system lymph where all the immune cells are so you essentially have your immune cells like dendritic cells recognizing something foreign in this case a lipid a radio label lipid nanoparticle with some mRNA in it and they they basically chop it up and you know it undergoes phagocytosis and is and is taken to other tissues for recycling and so whatever we in those other organs we don actually know if that intact mRNA vaccine lipid nanoparticle it because that so I think all of those factors in combination give some reassurance that people should not be so concerned about the spike protein from mRNA vaccines or from the Johnson Johnson vaccine getting to other organs and causing you know wreaking havoc essentially um and I will just add one more thing to that and that is another study and this is something that I about on the internet this this study was done in humans it was a very very small sample size it was 13 people and they were given the moderna mRNA vaccine and um what was what was found in that study is that 11 out of 13 people there the S1 subunit of the spike protein was detected in their their plasma three out of the 13 had the entire Spike protein detectable however the assay that was used to detect this sub S1 subunit and the spike protein itself in these 13 people has a false positivity rate of 25 that one in four people showing they have Spike protein so that so so the way the study this was another study done and it was um they took samples pre-pandemic there should be no people with Spike protein pre-pandemic and they were showing that they had Spike protein so with the sample size of 13 and a false positivity rate of 25 you can small study showing you know that 11 out of 13 people had S1 subunit of Spike protein showing up in the plasma I just it just doesn make any strong conclusions from that so I guess you know the bottom line is that you know as Roger mentioned we over 177 million people fully vaccinated in the United States you know if this thing was causing severe damage and people we would know about it and you know we do know about the the the adverse effects that are occurring like the myocarditis that is happening you know in some young people it quite rare but um it occur and again as Roger mentioned it happening six-fold higher in in younger healthy individuals than it is in people in in these same same individuals that are being being exposed to the to the covid-19 vaccines	Success

Sauna-use may improve immunity and reduce risk of respiratory infections | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3x3AhXpVYI	FoundMyFitness Clips 	the next question has to do with saunas and the question is can you discuss whether sauna use may help prevent copin 19. first of all there suggest that using the sauna or other modalities of heat stress such as steam showers or hot baths will have any effect on coba 19 illness i can discuss other data that is published on pneumonia and the common cold and also the effect on just the immune system in general but i can because there is no data to suggest whether or not the sauna will have any effect on copenhagen let sauna use has been associated with a reduced risk of developing certain chronic or acute respiratory illnesses including pneumonia sauna use promotes mild hypothermia which in turn induces a wide array of physiological responses these responses reduce oxidative stress and inflammation and activate cellular defense systems that provide protection against many diseases so data from a 2017 study suggests that sauna use reduces the risk of developing certain chronic or acute respiratory illnesses including pneumonia which is a acute respiratory illness characterized by cough fever chills and difficulty breathing it and other viral illness infections including cova 19 as well as bacterial infections pneumonia affects people of all ages but children older adults and people who are immunocompromised seem to be most vulnerable so this study drew on data from a population based prospective cohort study of more than 2 000 healthy middle-aged men between the age of 42 and 65 years old and it was conducted in finland where most people have a home sauna the average sauna exposure reported in the study was approximately 20 minutes per session and the temperature was 174 degrees fahrenheit or 79 degrees celsius the data was adjusted for a variety of potential confounding factors like body mass index smoking status education level alcohol consumption total energy intake socioeconomic status physical activity inflammatory status and a history of diabetes heart disease asthma bronchitis or tuberculosis so the study revealed that the frequency of sauna use was inversely associated with the incidence of respiratory illness men who use the sauna two to three times weekly were 27 percent less likely to develop pneumonia than those who use the sauna once a week or not at all men who use the sauna four to seven times a week were 41 percent less likely to develop pneumonia compared to the infrequents on users the sauna protective effects on the lungs may be due to reduced oxidative stress and inflammation associated with hypothermia or the direct beneficial effects on lung tissue frequent sauna use may decrease pulmonary congestion and lead to other improvements in lung function including vital capacity tidal volume minute ventilation and forced expiratory volume sauna use has been shown to improve lung function in people with obstructive pulmonary disease typical spanish saunas are not the only type of heat stress that have been shown to be beneficial for lung health way on therapy which uses far infrared dry saunas also has been shown to improve lung function in patients with chronic pulmonary disease also known as copd the temperature of far infrared saunas are significantly lower than typical finish saunas so they typically around 140 degrees fahrenheit since the temperature is lower the duration in many studies is longer around 45 minutes and the frequency in many studies is daily for a few weeks one of the major differences between dry saunas or finish saunas and far infrared saunas is that both dry and finished saunas the heat the ambient air and that heat is transferred from the air to the body but in far infrared saunas the thermal radiation is directly used to increase body temperature sauna bathing was shown to reduce the incidence of common colds in 25 percent participants that used the sauna one to two times per week for six months compared to 25 controls that did not it took three months before the sauna had a protective effect the mechanism by which frequent sauna use reduces the incidence of colds is unknown but it could have to do with the modulation of the immune system white blood cells lymphocytes and neutrophil counts were all increased in both trained and non-trained athletes after sauna use while these findings are interesting they studies are needed to confirm one of the protective adaptive responses to heat stress is the production of heat shock proteins heat shock proteins are a conserved class of proteins with critical roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis and in protecting the cells from stressful conditions heat shock proteins have been shown to be increased by approximately 50 percent after 30 minutes in a 163 degree fahrenheit sauna in healthy young men and women once activated they can remain so for up to 48 hours it heat such as from regular sauna use results in the production of more heat shock proteins under normal conditions and even more so under stressful conditions such as cell and tissue injury this is good because as we age we make less heat shock proteins so anything to boost them is beneficial heat shock proteins like heat shock protein 70 are also readily induced by fever and when released from cells he checked protein 70 can can stimulate the innate immune response through toll-like receptors 2 and 4. the relationship between exposure temperature and maximal heat shock protein 70 protein levels was linear between normal body temperature of 98.6 degrees fahrenheit and 105.8 degrees fahrenheit so increasing approximately 50 percent per degree celsius in human lung epithelial cells increasing evidence suggests that certain heat check proteins play a role in both innate and adaptive immunity heat check proteins can directly stimulate the innate immune responses such as the maturation and activation of dendritic cells and the activation of natural killer cells this means that there may be a direct role for heat shock proteins in regulating the innate immune response which plays an important role in the body that it heat check protein 70 when given to mice acts as an adjuvant and stimulates the innate immune resist stimulates the innate immune system it confers a protection against for example hsv when exposed in addition to directly impacting the immune function heat check proteins such as heat check protein 70 have also been shown to directly inhibit viral activity and replication of influenza virus a while the effect of heat shock proteins on viruses is a bit nuanced the more important thing is that heat shock proteins activate the innate immune system and sauna use has been shown to increase white blood cell and other monocyte levels i know many people don a home sauna and without gyms open um you know gyms or gyms are closed at this time so it impossible for a lot of people to use the sauna so let bath since most people do have access to a bathtub hot baths have also been shown to increase heat shock proteins which is good news uh one study found that participants that sat in a 140 degree fahrenheit hot bath from their waste down for one hour were able to increase their heat check protein levels so just in in summary it appears as though sauna use is protective against some respiratory illnesses like pneumonia as well as copd and has been shown to be protective against the common cold it increase the innate immune response in terms of of increasing white blood cell numbers and other monocyte numbers and it known to activate the immune response hot baths which also is another modality of heat stress have been shown to increase heat shock proteins which are thought to be the main regulator um by which are the main mechanism by which the sauna is modulating the immune system you	Success

History of mRNA vaccines	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymXtKmAIn4Q	FoundMyFitness Clips 	The other aspect of this that is tossed\\naround is that this is new technology. Now, I know that Dr. Patrick knows more about the technology\\nin terms of the history, but I will just give you a very short timeline. Back in the 1990s, we injected for the\\nfirst time mRNA into the muscle cells of a mouse, for the very first time. By 2005, we had modified the nucleotides,\\nwhich are the signaling in that mRNA vaccine to get around early destruction. So the problem early on was that\\nwe couldn RNA molecules to last long enough\\nto make the protein product. The problem wasn It was that they didn finally figure out how to do that. And by 2013, they started working on\\nmedications that were based on mRNA. And then finally, we have the vaccines. Here is a paper that was published in\\n1990, so over 30 years ago, that was for the first time showing that this\\ntechnology actually had viability. And so this technology is not new. It And with that, I Patrick. I think she has some more details on this. [Dr. Patrick] : Yes. I do. You know, in addition to this technology\\nnot being new in the sense that everyone...most people think this is\\nthe first time it in humans, just to kind of speak to\\nyour point about the acceleration of the process of getting this vaccine\\ninto people, and you were talking about all the money that another really important thing to\\npoint out is the difference between this vaccine and our history of\\nvaccines in terms of how we make them. For the mRNA vaccines, all\\nyou need is the sequence. That And it having to actually grow vaccine\\nin some kind of animal cell type. And like, I mean, you There So, just going back to the actual\\nhistory of mRNA vaccines and this mRNA technology in humans. In 2001, we have the first clinical trial\\nof this mRNA technology that was made. It was mRNA-induced dendritic cells. In 2009, we have another clinical trial\\nwhere mRNA was used as a therapeutic. In 2014, there trying to treat cancer with mRNA vaccines. These are all in humans. In 2017, there were 2 clinical trials,\\none for mRNA-based vaccine for influenza, and another one for mRNA technology used\\nto treat patients with heart...basically had heart failure, and they were\\ninjecting mRNA vaccines into their heart. So, we using this technology in humans, you know. So this is not the new technology that\\npeople in their minds they think that this is the first time it It dates back to decades, well, you know,\\na couple of decades being used in humans. To kind of add to that, I really...moving\\nforward, it has exploded in terms of all the\\nclinical trials now being started and planned for this mRNA technology. There is so much interest, and there this technology as a therapeutic for\\ninfectious diseases in addition to the SARS-CoV-2 virus for other ones. There are now clinical studies that\\nare now starting to look at this technology to treat genetic disorders\\nlike muscular dystrophy where there Can you imagine being the parent of\\na son that has muscular dystrophy and knowing there is no treatment and having\\nto watch your son degenerate and die? I mean, we may see a treatment\\nfor muscular dystrophy in our lifetime because of this. It tons and tons of trials for mRNA\\nvaccines as immunotherapy for cancers where they of different types of solid tumors. And again, we may very well in\\nour lifetime now see a cure for different types of solid tumors. Solid tumors are the type of cancers\\nthat are hardest to treat with chemotherapy because they often\\ngrow far away from blood vessels. And so blood vessels, you need them\\nto be close to the cancer site because that And so you They They And so it many types of chemotherapeutic treatments. So imagine being able to directly inject\\nthe tumor with this mRNA technology where we you know, molecules and things that are\\ngoing to activate the immune system to go right directly to that tumor and kill it. It scared because it And it But there moving forward at an accelerated rate. And we are witnessing something that\\nwould have not have happened otherwise without this terrible pandemic that\\nobviously a lot of bad has come out of. But, you know, to try to see the silver\\nlining here, the good out of it is that the science has really catapulted\\nforward, and there stuff going on with the mRNA technology.	Success

a person can have a flare-up this has been circulating in the media since Cova 19 patients in Korea were reported to test positive shortly after recovering from the disease the three causes could be reinfection a relapse or inconsistent rt-pcr tests an overly sensitive rt-pcr test might be detecting non infective RNA fragments rather than infectious viral particles a study from the Korean CDC traced 790 close contacts of 285 people who re tested positive and found that none of the close contacts became infected researchers tested respiratory samples from 108 of the repositories of the 23 respository the and second serum samples were obtained 96% were positive for neutralizing antibodies it seems unlikely for the SARS cope to virus to cause a flare-up in the future because SARS Cove 2 is a single-stranded RNA virus and does not have the enzyme reverse transcriptase without reverse transcriptase the virus is not able to insert into DNA and cause flare-ups in the future like other viruses such as HIV varicella-zoster virus or herpes virus which all have a reverse transcriptase component the last part of this question is can a person become reinfected this has to do with the adaptive immune system generally after recovery from a virus the body has developed specific antibodies such as memory b-cells to prevent future reinfection z depends on the virus with some viruses such as measles morbillivirus which causes measles infection confers almost universal lifelong lasting protection on the opposite end of the spectrum individuals infected with HIV often have antibodies that do nothing to fight HIV some viruses like HIV use multiple strategies to evade antibodies so what about other coronaviruses antibody titres and individuals that survived Sarge Cove one or marish Cove infections often waned after two to three years or were weak initially however one study showed that calm bliss and Sarah from SARS patients taken three and a half years after disease onset did neutralize the SARS cove one virus and even somewhat cross neutralized Sarge Cove to entry into the cell via the h2 receptor that suggests that SARS Cove Wan antibodies are still able to neutralize the SARS code one virus three and a half years after the initial antibody response this study also provided some preliminary evidence that antibodies made in response to other corona viruses may provide some cross immunity against Irish co2 although another study found that this was not the case but we will come back to that later in SARS Cove one survivors the cd8 T memory cells persisted for six to eleven years suggesting there may be long-term immunity additionally corona virus is responsible for the common cold induce antibody responses that neutralize the corona virus that causes the common cold but they don the course of one to two years that means people can be reinfected with the exact same corona virus one to two years later it is still unclear how long antibodies generated from the SARS Cove to infection last and whether or not they confer protection the immune system is not perfect in over many years the memory b-cells may not recognize a virus that they were programmed to recognize so there get reinfected at some point also viruses often mutate or they find other ways to evade the immune system there is a strain of the SARS co2 virus it has a mutation in a region of the virus that antibodies bind to non-human primates infected with SARS cough too that recover and have antibodies do not become reinfected when re exposed to the virus 28 days later we know that people infected with SARS cough to do develop antibodies against the virus a study found that out of 285 patients in China with cope at 19 100% of them developed antibodies against the saj Cove 2 virus within 19 days of viral exposure the ability of those antibodies to neutralize the virus was not determined but as I just mentioned non-human Prime that developed antibodies after recovering were not reinfected after being exposed to the virus a second time and a study of ten patients in China found a single dose of convalescent plasma from patients that have recovered from Cobra 19 and contained antibodies against Stars Cove 2 resulted in a clearing of the virus in the patient blood within seven days clinical symptoms improved significantly within three days and lung lesions improved within seven days anecdotes from other hospitals in the u.s. report the same studies of the common cold coronaviruses SARS cough Juan and mares Cove indicate that virus specific antibody responses wane over time and in the case of common cold coronaviruses antibody responses may only result in partial protection from reinfection these data suggest that immunity to cyrus coughs you may diminish following a primary infection and further studies will be required to determine the degree of long term protection there are a few large serological surveys being led by dr. Michael Bush who is an MD PhD at the school of medicine at UCSF to look at antibody responses that are waning and to assess herd immunity the handful of rare cases where people have tested positive after recovering from the disease could also be due to testing errors as mentioned previously you	Success

Does blood type influence COVID-19 risk? | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt8AeXjyt-4	FoundMyFitness Clips 	so let which is is there any indication blood type influences covid19 risk so based on some very small studies just very limited evidence there is some indication that people with blood group a may have a higher risk of acquiring coca-19 compared to non-a blood groups whereas individuals with blood type o may have a lower risk of the infection compared to non-o blood groups so blood groups have been involved in the susceptibility to other viral infections in the related sarge cove one virus type a antibodies as found in people with type o or type b blood types can provide protection by inhibiting the interaction of the virus with the ace2 receptor so first blood type is a classification of blood based on the presence or absence of antibodies as well as inherited antigenic substances on the surface of red blood cells one of the most important blood type systems is the system and it the so type a type b type o or a b um is the most dominant antigen so this is the signal that evokes an immune response that is present in blood cells this antigen type is essentially just a modified sugar so people with type a blood have a type a antigen on the surface of their cells which means they make antibodies against antigens that are type b because this is recognized as not self this is why a person with type a blood will reject a blood transfusion with a type b blood type due to immune response so the body makes type b antibodies to attack that antigen and vice versa a person with type o blood which is um i think it express either a or b antigen therefore they make antibodies against both a and b antigens since they are both considered foreign this means that people with type o blood can donate blood to a person with any blood type since their blood cells do not express either a or b antigen um it will not elicit an immune response but they can only receive blood from a person with type o since they make antibodies against a and b antigens so again this very preliminary data suggests that people with type o blood may be less susceptible to cobod 19 because they produce the type a antibodies which are possibly inhibiting the interaction between sarge cove ii and the acetyl receptor now that has been shown to be the case for sarge cove one in one study investigating the relationship between blood group and the cobia 19 susceptibility it was found that people with blood group a have a higher risk for acquiring coping 19 compared to non-a blood groups whereas blood groups o have a significantly lower risk for the infection compared to non-o blood groups another study a retrospective analysis from clinical features in 101 death cases with covid19 the blood group distribution of deaths differed pretty remarkably between that from the han population in wuhan although not analyzed statistically type o was comparably low while type a was high it that some of the protection for type o blood groups and some of the increased risk for the type a blood groups may be similar to the mechanisms that have been seen with sars cove one namely the fact that type a antibodies have been shown to provide protection by inhibiting the interaction between the sarge cove 1 virus and the ac2 receptor which is how the virus gets entry into the cell you	Success

What role genetics may play in immune function | Dr. Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W91JsmdZ6qQ	FoundMyFitness Clips 	There are likely many, many, many different\\nreasons for the varied ways people respond to this virus, but right now, everything still\\nremains speculation. In general, differences in immune function\\nbetween otherwise healthy individuals may be attributed to many factors, which we will\\ndiscuss, including genetics, previous exposure to pathogens, sleep, microbiome composition,\\nexercise, nutrition, gender, and biological age. A large part of the variation in immune function\\nbetween individuals, particularly with respect to adaptive immunity has been determined to\\nbe from non-heritable factors, which we are about to dive into. But genetics does account for some of this\\nvariation. The severity of a viral infection depends\\non the pathogenicity of the virus, as well as the health status and genetic makeup of\\nthe host. Polymorphic regions referred to as single\\nnucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs for short, in various genes may affect the disease outcome\\nof an infected individual. There are several large collaborative efforts\\nunderway to share and analyze genetic data to try and understand the links between human\\ngenetic variation in COVID-19 disease and severity. The largest one is called the COVID-19 Host\\nGenetic Initiative. Several SNPS have previously been identified\\nto affect immune responses to the SARS-CoV-1 virus and several studies have already identified\\nseveral possible SNPs that may potentially impact susceptibility to COVID-19, although\\nthese remained to be tested in large genomic studies and clinical trials. There are some SNIPs that affect general viral\\nentry into the host cell. For example, ACE-2 with the host cell receptor\\nfor SARS-CoV-2. TMPRSS2, a protease that cleaves the spike\\nprotein allowing SARS-CoV-2 to enter the cell. IFITM2, a protein that interrupts the fusion\\nbetween a virus and the cell membrane associated with the severity of influenza. There also a variety of SNPs that generally\\naffect viral replication. They to viral induced inflammation. And there are SNPs that affect acute respiratory\\ndistress syndrome. There are also several SNPS that affect vitamin\\nD levels. Genetically low plasma vitamin D levels are\\nassociated with a higher mortality from respiratory infections and three different SNPs in the\\nvitamin D receptor are all associated with a higher risk of respiratory tract infections\\nin both adults and children. Vitamin D is a very important regulator of\\nimmune function and plays a particularly important role in respiratory tract infections. If you have used some consumer genetic testing\\nservices like 23andMe and AncestryDNA, and you want to learn more about these SNPs, we\\nput together a free viral report that you can find at foundmyfitness.com/genetics.

COVID-19 mRNA vaccines cannot alter human DNA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCXNGRH2_3Q	FoundMyFitness Clips 	for a lot of people new technology technology they haven there are rumors that this is somehow gene therapy and it impacting our own dna within our cells can you speak to that and what are your thoughts about those rumors well sure i i i think it understandable for for most people to to be a little concerned because they never heard of this mrna technology the word rna is in it and you know it it overwhelming in in a sense and i think as i as i mentioned earlier when i was talking about you know from a thousand foot high mile high you know viewpoint how these mrna vaccines work and how there messenger rna inside of a lipid nanoparticle and along with some other factors that essentially when that lipid nanoparticle with the mrna gets inside of your cells your cells themselves are ribosomes translate that mrna into actual protein and so really it protein making technology in a way and um but nonetheless there fear that mrna vaccines are gene therapy that are altering our dna and so to understand that you need to understand i mean i think first and foremost if someone says that to you you might want to ask them where inside the cell is dna and if they don question then they probably don understand what they dna is resides in a part of our cell called the nucleus it is protected by the it and you can pass into the nucleus of the cell in order to get inside of the nucleus of the cell you have to have what localization sequence this is a very specific sequence that allows something to get inside of the nucleus and so there anywhere in this mrna anywhere you know inside of the lipid nanoparticle it just it there inside of the nucleus of the cell if somehow it did somehow miraculously get inside of the nucleus of of our cell where our dna resides in order for it to alter our dna the mrna would first have to become dna and in order for that to happen you would need an enzyme called reverse transcriptase there of our nucleus inside of the you know lipid nanoparticle with our mna it present so that is not likely to happen but if all those things were to happen somehow then in order for the dna so if you somehow got inside the nucleus turn the mrna into dna and then in order for it to alter idna you something called an integrase enzyme would have to integrate into our dna to get in there to change it and again no integrase enzyme present there it so the chances of the mrna vaccines actually changing our dna are so small i mean it would just take some sort of sort of grand conspiracy where you know the we enzymes into this mrna and it all this stuff i mean like it gonna happen it schwell anything to add to that yeah i mean the the central dogma of molecular biology is that dna goes to rna rna goes to protein and what we vaccine is we the ribosomes which reside in the outer portion of the cell to make the protein this by the way is exactly what the virus does and so if you uh freaked out or creeped out by the fact that your cell machinery is being taken over to make something that it shouldn introduce you to copen19 because that exactly what viral infection and instead of it happening just in one or two cells it happening in millions of cells in fact there of the virus that individual and it goes all throughout the body so what the vaccine is that it the ribosomes to make proteins there no aspect of the messenger rna vaccines that do anything with the nucleus and it that add to that dr schwell you know we we speaking of viruses and what viruses do we know some viruses actually can change change back into dna and affect our dna so hiv is one some of the herpes viruses as well so so if anything if there be worried about changing our dna it you	Success

These 3 Nutrient Deficiencies Are Damaging Your Brain (here's how to fix it)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug9QClIjVhw	FoundMyFitness Clips 	You know, I think like it was about 10 years ago, there was a huge study in the Annals of Internal Medicine and it was called Enough is Enough. Vitamins and mineral supplements not only don anything, they may be harmful. Yeah. And I think that was Do you remember that study? It was about 10 years ago. Yeah. And you know, I I I was I just dug in and it was a meta analysis and I went and looked at all those studies and I found that all these flaws again coming. You looked at the actual studies that they made their conclusions from. So they do a review and they go, going to look at all these these studies and we that\\ from that you didn conclusions. You actually went and looked at the data itself from the original studies. Exactly. Yeah. And um I put out a video about it like years and years ago and it again all these flaws that we just talked about were there and um here we are 10 years later and the Cosmos trials was just published. Right? So this is another metaanalysis of a couple randomized control trials where older adults were given a multivitamin. They had about 20 or so essential vitamins, essential minerals, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, right? Magnesium. This was all present in this multivitamin. And they were given it for two years. Yeah. What the study found these are randomized control trials, placebo controlled, right? Um it the the the multivitamin actually did improve brain aging. So they h they were less people taking the multivitamin mineral supplement were less likely to experience um cognitive dysfunction, memory loss and in fact they experienced a improvement in their brain aging that was equivalent to reversing two years of brain aging. Wow. Wow. Yeah. Brand mice control trial. Here we are 10 years later. Yeah. And there show the value of nutrients in many many different conditions. Right. Exactly. Yeah. I you know I think that it it comes down to yes you should try to get your micronutrients from diet however taking you know a multivitamin supplement taking vitamin D taking omega-3s like these are insurance right this is insurance to make sure you getting your optimum levels but it insufficiency and with vitamin D it really big one because it is converted into a steroid hormone so this is something that is going into the nucleus of our cell and binding and interacting with DNA A it has a little sequence of DNA called a vitamin D response element. It our DNA, right? So um to not have enough vitamin D. So 70% of the US population doesn vitamin D which is about 30 nanogs per mill 70%. 30 which would would be and if you add it up to 45 or 50 it like 80 plus 90% right. Yeah. So and and so that would be um there there have been studies looking at all cause mortality and vitamin D levels of course this is again observational lots of metaanalyses out there even dating back for like 30 years and it seems as though having at least 40 nanogs per mill seems to be a sweet spot you know 40 to 60 yeah is a really good place to be where you but again it not it protein encoding human genome that like thousands of genes. Yeah. You know everything from immune function. It plays an important role in pre preventing autoimmunity, brain function. It regulates genes that are important for converting tryptophan into serotonin. Serotonin is an important neurotransmitter that regulates mood, cognitive function, impulse control, you know. So vitamin D maybe I need more of that then. Well, and and the problem is is that you know vitamin D typically you make it from UVB radiation exposure from the sun, but told to shield ourselves from the sun and sunblock and so we live indoors, work indoors and yeah it problem. I mean we half naked hunting and gathering we got a lot of vitamin D and we ate uh and we fish small fish like herring and s they you vitamin D. There population got it the paleithic ancestors but we don Exactly. We don think so people the simple solution is a vitamin D supplement. Right. And so about 4,000 I use a day will generally get someone from a deficient range which is 20 nanogs per mill up to a sufficient range. Okay. But you you talking about 10 times what multivitamin or what doctors will recommend 10 times. I am because you Yeah, you really do. It thousand I it will will raise blood levels between 5 to 10 nanogs per mill. But it all we have genes we have different variations of our genes that are able to do this. And this again comes down to these clinical studies showing that you know nothing happens. We We actually have to take a much higher dose, right? because they have genes that aren into 25 hydroxy vitamin D, which is this circulating form of vitamin D or the steroid hormone 125 hydroxy vitamin D. And so, so maybe you can kind of take us down that that list a little deeper. So, we we get magnesium, and and literally, we could spend a podcast on each nutrient, and probably 10 podcasts on each nutrient. But, but we go through understand like these are the things that are non-negotiables that you you got to measure and figure out whether your levels are okay because the average physician or a practitioner isn know how to do it and they don taught this in medical school. And I working on trying to change that in Washington. But it kind of a it because it staring us in the face that we have this epidemic of micronutrient deficiencies or insufficiencies and they addressed and often worse we told not to fix them. Yeah. So the vitamin D, magnesium, omega-3 we talked about, right? Um, you know, believe it or not, a lot of people, I don exact percentage, but quite a bit of people are not getting enough vitamin C. Something like 30 or 40 40% 40% or something like that are not getting enough vitamin C. Yeah. Okay. I heard that 10% are deficient at the level that would cause scurvy in America. That unbelievable. Just not eating any ve any vegetables or or fruits because vitamin C is also in vegetables, not just in fruits. Calcium is another one. Um, so I mean, these are things that can be tested for and measured. Um, another one is vitamin E. People are are not getting enough vitamin E. Again, that found in things like avocados, nuts, whole grains. And then, um, potassium is a big one because it the sodium potassium pump, which plays a role in blood pressure. And so, when you not enough potassium, it exacerbating that not getting enough potassium aspect, right? Because that ratio is so important. And so not only are I think it the US population doesn adequate intake for potassium. It essentially everyone. Yeah. And our potassium intake is hunter gather should be 10 to one potassium to sodium. Now it other way around. Exactly. And so there problems with blood pressure and uh you know gosh it like individuals aged 20 to 39 have hypertension. Yeah. You know, these are young adults with hypertension. And we now know that hypertension isn risk for cardiovascular disease. It risk for dementia and Alzheimer disease. Particularly if you start earlier, right? If you person. So like it to hypertension. You know, it because you have to get blood flow to your your brain and um you know, you got all these tiny like 90% of the of the brain vascular vascule surrounding the brain is made of these tiny tiny blood vessels that are like the smaller than the size of a hair in terms of diameter and they have to get blood flow to them. So, exercise helps that. But hypertension exacerbates the lack of blood flow going to those blood vessels. And what happens is they they start to sort of constrict. Yeah. And and sort of fall fall off and you can get many strokes and many strokes. But also neurons don and the oxygen they need. And so then you start to lose neurons, right? And you get brain atrophy. And so there this connection between hypertension and dementia. And um you know I about potassium here because potassium does play an important role in regulating blood pressure. Yeah. So does magnesium too. So does magnesium. So does magnesium. It mineral. And then exercise of course is one of the best things that you can do. So, you know, one of the last papers that Bruce published was his second to last paper uh was called longevity vitamins and and it, you know, it was about these vitamins like vitamin D and magnesium and omega-3 uh torine or some other like essential amino acids that play a role in the way we age and and slowing age related decline. Yeah. And you know, there was just a recent study that came out on vitamin D, sufficient levels of vitamin D. people that supplemented with vitamin D were 40% less likely to have dementia. Yeah. You know, so the the reality is is that mean vitamins don urine. They they don you know these micronutrients are running everything in our body. And when you have in insufficient levels of them, you necessarily see it. Although you probably feel it, you know, like you might have symptoms, but you don attach it to that. You don to that. But it damage, right? This insidious DNA damage, a little bit of oxidative stress, a little bit of inflam. I get sick all the time because my vitamin D is low, right? Or you muscles ache, you know, because of vitamin D is low or, you know, I have muscle cramps because my magnesium low, right? So, or I have depression because my, you know, methylation vitamins are low. Like, people have symptoms. They just don with the nutrient deficiencies. Depression is interesting. Um there there one ever talks about um where healthy individuals were injected with lipopolysaccharide. So for those listening, this is a component of your back bacterial outer cell membranes. It because we have about I don many trillions of bacteria like so many bacteria in there, right? A lot 40 50 trillion. Okay. 40 or 50 trillion. There lipopolysaccharide in our gut because those bacteria do die off and these are bacterial toxins. This is what pisses off your immune system to know it. It does. And when we have gut permeability, lots of things that cause that, it releases it, right? It also known as leaky gut, it it leeches the LPS into our bloodstream. Well, this study took healthy individuals and injected them with an amount of LPS that would be equivalent to something that you could get from intestinal permeability. Yeah. and it caused depressive symptoms in these individuals. Okay, one that links inflammation to depression, right?% two, if those individuals were given EPA, so this is one of the omega-3 fatty acids. Uh it does play a major role in dampening inflammation through a variety of mechanisms like resolins and measins and the um SPMs. These are all molecules that are resolving inflammation very quickly. They did not experience those suppressive symptoms. Yeah. if they were injected with the LPS, if they got omega-3s. If they have the omega-3s. Yeah. So, it it it comes down to like again, you know, and omega-3s have been shown to actually help with depression. They have. And ADD. Yeah. With depression. Um, specifically, EPA seems to be very important for depression. And I think that inflammatory component to depression.	Success

COVID-19 vaccines and viral evolution	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xcvIIidBk	FoundMyFitness Clips 	dr patrick i that the vaccines themselves might be contributing to putting certain pressures on the sars cov2 virus specifically this idea that the vaccines can make the virus actually more deadly or more virulent um what are your thoughts on that well i i certainly like coming into to hearing these statements which i heard it different areas of the blogosphere and people that i that i you know friends of friends you know etc my first thought was well if this is we need to know whether or not this is true because if it is it changes everything in a way right you don want to make um a virus you know more deadly to the unvaccinated and that statement is is that vaccines are causing selective pressure for the virus to mutate into a more virulent form which is more dangerous and deadly to the unvaccinated nobody wants that like like if that were the case i mean all of our children are unvaccinated so you know as a parent to me i wanted to get to the bottom of this and understand is this something to be concerned about because if it is it game changer in my mind so um as a non-evolutionary biologist i went on a you know a path to trying to understand is to the best of my knowledge you know the literature and what the literature out there says on on how viruses evolve and um what the selective pressure is and what you know what that typically you know entails and so from all of my reading and understanding again i evolutionary biologist um to me i came out of it with the understanding that viruses the selective pressure on viruses is to evolve to become more transmissible they are not under a selection pressure to become more virulent in other words it their host because if they kill their host then they can incubate the virus and allow them to reproduce and infect more people and so all the studies that i outlined that there factors and that virulence isn is something that happens incidentally to transmission in in other words it sort of hitchhikes alongside so a virus evolves to become more transmissible like that is it in some cases if it becomes more transmissible sometimes it can also become more virulent it can be more you know dangerous to its host and um so another so many of the different studies have outlined that there are factors that limit transmission so if something limits the transmission then it potential of the virus to become more virulent and the factors that limit transmission are one physical constraints so the virus infects human cells and the human cells then make viral proteins and you know are basically allowing the the virus to replicate so our own cellular machinery the ability of our cells to assemble viral proteins the ability of our cells metabolically to do it quick enough like there do that so quickly so once that happens then you know a virus sort of reached its peak transmissibility in in a way because our cells physically can quicker than it that makes sense and so um with the delta variant right now we may be at a peak transit we may be at the point where our cells can proteins quick enough for it to become even more transmissible we don maybe maybe we maybe we are we have we have no idea it transmissible variant so that thing that that limits the the ability of a virus to become more virulent is the the limitation on transmission the other thing is more host mortality and so you know if if a virus you know is is killing uh the host within a certain time frame but you know before transmission ends then you know you start to like not be able to transmit the virus more and you have more variance crop up because the host is dying and so um this is something people have been very concerned about with vaccines because the argument is that vaccines are preventing more you know they preventing hospitals they people from dying from cobalt 19 and therefore they virus to have a chance to mutate and into something that is more virulent again has to it has to mutate into something that virulent hitchhike hitchhikers along the side of that um but if you look at the the deaths uh in coba 19 people that are unvaccinated or just generally speaking people usually die much later than the transmission phase they die you know days and days and days after actually becoming infected with starch co2 and so um the transmission phase is well over before people are even dying so the reality is is that people that are unvaccinated have you know their their their creating these mutations and allowing variants to evolve even at a greater rate because not only are they you know able to do it even before they potentially succumb to death but you know the fact that we just talked about overall transmission reduced by vaccines so um people with that are vaccinated are less likely to even get infected and we talked about onward transmission reduced in other words people are clearing the virus faster that are vaccinated than unvaccinated in every sense people that are unvaccinated there replicate and to potentially mutate and form another variant that be that could become more transmissible and that now people are also conflating the vaccine escaped immunity that is a completely different thing that is not something that is relevant to um to virulence if you look into the if you look at the the large body of scientific literature covering this topic i shouldn quite limited but um you know so so there is no example of human vaccines causing a more virulent strain there are examples of vaccine in escape so in other words variants crop up that are no longer that can evade the antibodies produced by by vaccines and that different thing that isn that that vaccinated because now they be more likely to be infected and their vaccine is less effective that what we evolution the selective pressure on viruses to transmit become more transmissible and that is the selective pressure that exists not virulence virulence hitchhikes alongside the transmis transmis mission aspect of um why viruses you know mutate basically in the selective pressure that

Are children, infants, and unborn infants susceptible to COVID-19? | Rhonda Patrick	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwcixuKuwSo	FoundMyFitness Clips 	the first question we discuss is are children and infants susceptible to coven 19 are some more susceptible to a more severe form of the disease are they carriers of it and possibly spreading transmission so let diagnosis treatment and prevention of 2019 novel coronavirus infection in children experts consensus statement it was published in february of 2020 it stated most infected children have mild clinical manifestations they often have no fever or symptoms of pneumonia with good prognosis most of them recover within one to two weeks after disease onset few may progress to lower respiratory infections another study titled epidemiological characteristics of 2143 pediatric patients with 2019 coronavirus disease in china was published in march this study reports that epidemiological characteristics and transmission patterns of these pediatric patients with cova-19 in china the study found that children of all ages were susceptible to coba 19 with no significant gender differences observed clinical manifestations of pediatric patients were generally less severe than those of adult patients however young children particularly infants were more vulnerable to the sars cove ii infection among symptomatic children five percent had shortness of breath or low levels of oxygen in the blood and 0.6 percent progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome or multi-organ system dysfunction these levels are much lower than those seen in adults infants younger than one year were more likely to have severe illness compared to older children researchers have speculated that a few possible reasons could explain why children experience less severe disease than adults sarge cove tube virus exploits the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 or ace2 as it entry into cells perhaps the maturity and function or binding ability of the ac2 receptor in children may be lower than that in adults children developing and may respond to pathogens very differently than adults children respiratory infections like rsv in winter and may have higher levels of antiviral antibodies compared to adults so let role children play in coba 19 transmission understanding how cope 19 affects children is vital to slowing the pandemic a study titled covert 19 in children initial characterization of the pediatric disease press release published in march of 2020 summarizes children are less likely to become severely ill than older adults children may play a major role in community-based viral transmission children may have more upper respiratory tract involvement than lower respiratory tract involvement but there is still much to learn about the impact of this virus on children as well as the impact of children on viral spread there are some subpopulations of children with an increased risk for more significant illness those seem to include infants and preschoolers immunocompromised children children with other pulmonary health problems this has also been reported for non-covet-19 coronavirus infections a meta-analysis including 45 published studies on covid19 found as of march 18 2020 children have accounted for about one to five percent of diagnosed cova 19 cases they often have milder disease in adults and deaths have been extremely rare diagnostic findings have been similar to adults with fever and respiratory symptoms being prevalent but fewer children seem to have developed severe pneumonia elevated inflammatory markers were less common in children and lymphocytopenia which are low levels of lymphocytes in the blood was rare the clinical spectrum of children with cobalt 19 has often been similar to that of influenza on the topic of persistent fecal shedding of the virus out of 10 pediatric sars cove2 infection cases eight children persistently tested positive on rectal swabs even after nasopharyngeal testing was negative raising the possibility of fecal oral transmission however we do not have evidence of replication competent virus in fecal swabs which is required to confirm the potential for fecal to oral transmission on the topic of mother-to-child transmission of covid19 mother to child transmission of diseases also known as vertical transmission can occur during pregnancy several viruses including hepatitis b herpes varicella zoster which is chickenpox and human immunodeficiency virus or hiv can be passed via vertical transmission a recent report indicates that sarge cove ii the virus that causes cobit 19 is not transmissible from pregnant mothers to their infants at birth the report describes the clinical course of four live-born full-term infants born to pregnant women who tested positive for covid19 in wuhan china three of the four infants did not test positive for the virus the mother of the fourth infant did not provide consent for testing none of the infants manifested clinical signs of covid19 such as respiratory or gastrointestinal problems but two had mild rashes at birth one of the infants developed breathing problems but responded to non-invasive mechanical ventilation although three of the four infants described in the report were born by a cesarean section one was born vaginally and did not test positive for the virus all the infants were isolated after birth and were formula fed the authors of a report collected placenta amniotic fluid neonatal blood gastric fluid and anal swab samples from the infants for further study another study titled clinical characteristics and inter-uterine vertical transmission potential of cova-19 infection in nine pregnant women also found that there was no evidence of sarge cove to viral transmission from mother to child in nine births from coba 19 infected women all nine births were done by cesarean section in the third trimester amniotic fluid cord blood neonatal throat swab and breast milk samples from six patients were tested for sarge cove two and all samples tested negative for the virus the clinical characteristics of cobalt 19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed cova-19 pneumonia and yet another study titled an analysis of 38 pregnant women with covid19 their newborn infants and maternal fetal transmission of sarge cove ii actually described uh 38 pregnant women with coba 19 and their newborns in china the the report found there was no evidence of sarge cove ii um undergoing any type of intrauterine or transplacental transmission from infected pregnant women to the fetuses since all the published data seems to indicate that infants born to mothers with cobalt 19 do not actively have the sarge cove 2 virus the question is what about antibodies from this virus so a publication found that among six mothers with confirmed coping 19 sars cove 2 was not detected in the serum or throat swab in any of the newborns however virus-specific antibodies were detected in neonatal blood cirrus samples igg concentrations were elevated in five infants and igg normally crosses the placenta and igm concentrations were elevated in two infants so igm is a larger molecule and it thought to usually cross the placenta so this either indicates that maybe the placenta could possibly be damaged in covert 19 allowing the igm to cross the placenta or the sarge cove 2 may cross the placenta and could result in the infant in producing the igm that exactly what infants to have the elevated igm concentrations so the cdc has recommendations for the care of pregnant women and breastfeeding they recommend that a mother with cover 19 still continues to breastfeed since the virus does not seem to be present in breast milk but they should wash their hands before touching the infant and wear a face mask if possible while feeding at the breast you	Success
Vaccines and transmission of Delta variant	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJqZsi_nSVA	FoundMyFitness Clips 	dr patrick this question it the delta variant has been a game changer and we vaccines drop to some degree with regards to do they prevent symptomatic copin 19 and we of the delta variant may be happening among well is happening among fully vaccinated people so what are your thoughts on this should this shake people vaccine well i think people have it statements when you see a little piece of data coming in which by the way new data every day things are changing constantly hard to keep up with but um you know i i think people have made this overarching statement that vaccines do not prevent the transmission of virus in other words they did not prevent people from getting contracting coping and i think to understand why that is not true we need to start with the word transmission because there are two major types of transmission when we viral illness here first is called onward transmission and this is the type of transmission that is more on at the individual level so a person becomes infected with a virus they have viral particles in their nose and you know they shedding viral particles and this can be transmitted through aerosols and large respiratory droplets to other individuals right so this is the the the transmission of the virus that most people think about but there its overall transmission and that is the transmission in an overall population this is the population level so if we have a treatment or a vaccine that is able to prevent even a small percentage of people from becoming ill then it still reduces overall transmission because fewer people are actually getting the illness and so um as you mentioned the delta variant has sort of changed everything because when you know we had the alpha variant and even the beta variant we know that the the vaccines in the united states were largely effective still and you know in many cases still 90 95 effective at preventing people from even getting covered 19 symptomatic and seeking out health care we know that in addition people that did become um they that did get infected with with starch co2 virus they were they actually had fewer viral particles they were not transmitting the the virus like an unvaccinated person was that have to aggregate new data see see you know what the data shows and um i think i would say that our the data shows that in about july of 2021 is when the delta variant in the united states really started to become dominant sort of took over and so there was a large study that was done out of the mayo clinic many states were involved in terms of like the sample population from many different states in the united states and uh this was like 25 000 people that were vaccinated versus 25 000 people that were unvaccinated and what the what the mayo clinic study was looking at first was vaccine efficacy like the ability to you know prevent people from getting covered 19 and also looked at the efficacy of preventing hospitalization so that and so when the delta variant became dominant um it was clear that efficacy for preventing infection went down so people that were fully vaccinated with a pfizer vaccine went from an efficacy of like 88 to 93 or something like that down to 41 so so there was still some efficacy in other words you know 41 percent of people that were fully vaccinated were still not getting covered 19 which means that the pfizer vaccine transmission and on a similar level the madeira mra vaccine also had reduced efficacy in terms of preventing infections although it wasn dramatic so so the madeira vaccine is as about as about twice um as protective as the pfizer vaccine in getting a new and getting a uh stars co2 infection so that was about 77 percent effective at preventing uh starch co2 infection so again overall transmission is reduced because you know a large percent of people with that are fully vaccinated with madeira are not getting are still not getting even infected so that was that was good news hospitalizations were still um quite the both vaccines were still quite effective anywhere from 80 to 97 percent effective at preventing hospitalizations which is ultimately the most important thing as dr schwell pointed out earlier in this discussion you don overwhelmed with cover 19 patients because when your parents have a heart attack or if you get in a car accident or your child comes down with a severe form of rsv you know or fill in the blank you need and you deserve and um so so it good to prevent hospitalizations because that protects our health care system from being overwhelmed which is important for all of us the other thing that was found was that that that i think with the um not with a mayo clinic study but there was another study a large study that was done out of the uk and um this study showed that this was the most interesting thing in my opinion in this study this also included astrazeneca vaccine because has largely been used in in some european countries um like in the uk uh that people that were fully vaccinated were still you know there was still some efficacy in terms of protecting against you know getting the virus as i just mentioned with the mayo clinic study something similar was found but when you looked at peak viral load in other words when the virus is at its peak for for replicating the peak viral load was similar in a breakthrough infection from a vaccinated person versus a unvaccinated person that had contracted the starch co2 virus and so that sort of caused a media frenzy to you know to sort of make this general statement that vaccines don and it one they transmission as we just discussed but two you need to look at overall viral replication so so you know it transmission that transmitting this virus to other people at many different stages of being infected and so that pre-print study out of singapore which was with the delta variant showed that while initial um viral loads were similar between a breakthrough vaccinated case and an unvaccinated person that had the sarcopte ii virus infected infected with cytoscope two virus those initial viral levels were the same if you followed those individuals over time the the vaccinated people cleared the virus faster than the unvaccinated so they actually had a um a shorter negative pcr time and and if this if this was true you would have the hypothesis that at any given time if you were to take a random person out of the population and sample their their viral load then you would see vaccinated people at any point in time should have a smaller viral load because they virus faster and that this real-time data that aggregated out of the uk it react study that study found that if you would take a random sampling of people at any point in time vaccinated breakthrough cases they had a lower viral load than unvaccinated so i think with this data it suggests that not only do the vaccines still prevent or sorry still reduce overall transmission they also still reduce onward transmission so they are they still affecting transmission on at on multiple levels and so i think that to keep in mind in addition to that understanding who gets the breakthrough infection you know why why are 41 percent of people vaccinated with pfizer still protected from even getting you know surgical two viruses and why are 77 percent of people fully vaccinating with moderna not getting infected um well there out of israel looking at breakthrough infections now this wasn when delta was dominant but i think it still is important to keep in mind that um you know what these breakthrough infections we don you look at this israel study they were they were looking at health care workers and there was about 15 000 of them basically and these healthcare workers they took blood samples and they could look at their antibody levels against um these were vaccinated healthcare workers they could look at their igg antibodies and i they looked at but they could look at the levels of them and quantitate them and then if they came down with a breakthrough infection they could sort of use that data and go oh could we predict whether or not this person came down with a breakthrough infection based on their antibody levels and that exactly what was found people that had lower antibody titers were much more likely to get a breakthrough infection than people that had higher antibody titers and there was another great study that came out it was a miles davenport group and it was public published in nature medicine and he did this mathematical modeling to predict breakthrough infections and what he found was that that it it seems as though according to his model people need a six-fold higher antibody tighter level to be protected from contracting sarge co2 virus then they need to be protected from being hospitalized from the starch co2 virus in other words you need a much lower antibody level or tighter to prevent prevent yourself from being hospitalized but you need a higher level to prevent yourself from actually contracting the the virus itself so what dr patrick has told us is that there is a difference that you have to look a little bit deeper i was able to find a preprint of a article that just came out a couple of weeks ago that looked at the quality of those viral particles that are shed from those that have breakthrough infections so in other words is it possible that the shedding of the virus that comes from unvaccinated are the same as vaccinated and what this preprint showed very interestingly if you look at this graph here we have the amount of viral load being shed on the x-axis and on the y-axis what they did was they tried to see what was the chances of these viral particles of actually growing in a viral culture kind of a surrogate to successfully infecting the next person and what you can see here is the dark blue are those that are unvaccinated and the light blue are those that are vaccine you can clearly see here that at any given viral load the vaccinated healthcare worker in this study from the netherlands was shown to have a less likelihood of infecting somebody based on viral culture so not only do we see with with the vaccinated less breakthrough infections and when there are breakthrough infections they are cleared faster but we that the viral particles that come out of vaccinated people are less likely to infect and that there has been some um some talk uh going around that it people that are transmitting the virus more and causing these outbreaks to those that are unvaccinated and those are the ones that are showing up to the hospital but clearly here the the data is showing that that is that is not the fact oh just to add to that dr schwell that is very interesting that study is very interesting because the way that researchers are measuring you know peak viral load is through real-time pcr and real-time pcr can actually be detecting dead viral particles so that sort of there hypothesis even quite likely that there are some dead viral particles which you would would even you theorize would be true because if you do have antibodies against this the spike protein that your immune system would start to to kill um or to you know clear the the virus that you you know being exposed to since you have some antibodies you be some um effect you know so that interesting right and it boils down to the thing that i this is pcr is a way of looking it kind of like looking at dead body parts and and assuming that those dead party parts are alive all it parts of the virus and uh parts of viruses don positive right exactly you can have some i mean so so that how many of those viral particles are actually even alive and you if they were alive you you put them in culture that they would you know replicate and you know so um very interesting study you	Success

Why viral evolution is different from antibiotic resistance | Dr. Roger Seheult	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejt_zWBx7M	FoundMyFitness Clips 	And I will, that is made in terms of what we\\nknow that overuse of antibiotics can cause bacterial resistance to those antibiotics. And there That in humans and in animals especially. And that gives rise to these superbugs\\nthat emerge that are no longer susceptible to the antibiotics that we\\nhave, but that That selectively killing out all of\\nthese susceptible bacteria and only leaving those that are resistant. So in other words, the resistant bacteria\\nalready exist, but we the bacteria that are susceptible and\\nallowing the resistant forms to produce. That in the terms of vaccines and viruses,\\nthe resistant viruses don What allows them to be created\\nis the ability to replicate. Okay. And that In bacteria, very few resistant\\nbacteria are occurring because they The only way that they can become\\nresistant is if they acquire DNA that gives them, they to then be incorporated in their DNA. That Viruses and bacteria are very different. [Kyle] : Dr. Seheult, I think the most common reason\\nI get the vaccine is that they feel like\\nthe process may have been rushed, that there isn They may be willing to get the vaccine at\\nsome point, but they will, you know, look at the historical timelines for vaccines\\nand realize that it takes often 10 years, you know, maybe the average for a vaccine\\nto actually be manufactured and go through the authorization and approval process. What are your thoughts\\nabout this sentiment? And, you know, do you feel\\nlike the vaccine was rushed? Do you feel like we can trust\\nthe process in this case with this particular technology? [Dr. Seheult] : That So there this process was accelerated. No question about it. The question is, is was the quality\\nof the product compromised by the acceleration of the process? And here you can see on the\\nscreen a typical vaccine timeline. If this was done under normal situations,\\nwe would have started in 2020, and we wouldn And the reason for that is because\\nthere is risk in making these vaccines, but there So there is the research\\nthat has to happen. Then there one, to figure out the right dose,\\nphase two, to do the small randomized controlled trials to see if there\\nare problems, then finally, the big phase three trials, leading up to\\nbuilding the factories to make these vaccines, and then the manufacturing,\\nand then the approval process, and then finally, the distribution. So what you can see in the\\nlower portion of that screen is everything got compressed. Now, notice that nothing got skipped. So we still had the phase one trials,\\nand the phase two, and the phase three. Some of these were being\\nrun concomitantly, which means at the same time. But notice something very interesting. The factories were being built at\\nthe same time that the phase one and two trials were being done. Why is that? Why were they able to do that? Because what the government did by\\nstepping in and providing them money and resources and providing those barriers is\\nthey\\ money to build the factories, trials are a bust, you you And so that was one of the major barriers\\nto getting this thing done was the risk that the companies would not normally\\nbe willing to take on these vaccines.

Covid vaccines benefit healthy people | Dr. Roger Seheult	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_8t2BKLqK0	FoundMyFitness Clips 	I young people who are in good shape\\nand don What are your thoughts on this? [Dr. Seheult] : Well, Kyle, as you may know,\\nI take care of patients in the hospital. I work in a one ICU hospital\\nin a one hospital town. So, anything bad that happens, it\\ncomes to me in the intensive care unit. I I put the chest tubes in, the central\\nlines, and holding the patient And so for me, in the last couple of\\nweeks, this has become really personal for me because what I is like nothing else that I to February and January of this year. So, what is it that I I with very few comorbidities, maybe\\njust a little bit overweight, and they are ending up on the ventilator. I we can for their sons who are in their\\n30s, newly married with small children. We didn And so, to get to the root of your\\nquestion, is what do people who are younger have to be concerned about? I think it learned about COVID-19 in the past is\\nnow being rewritten by the Delta variant. So, if you look at some of this data,\\nthis is data from Virginia, and you can see here on the left hand side\\nof the screen in January is a graph that we This is basically the monthly\\nhospitalization rate by age group. And what you can see there is on the right\\nside of that first graph is it high number for the elderly, and it goes\\ndown very precipitously for the young. And that But as we go across this screen, you\\ncan see here that when we end up in August, a very ominous sign is occurring. What we hospitalized at almost the same rate. Maybe, instead of, you know, a\\n20th or a 10th, it of the rate of the elderly. And so why is that happening? Well, we know that there the elderly and a relatively low\\nvaccination rate in the young. Even look at the...you can barely see\\nit, but the yellow boxes are describing what Pediatric cases, of course, those\\nless than 12 years of age who can get vaccinated are skyrocketing. And so this is the concern that I have. We look at some of these other issues. For instance, this idea\\nof the 99% survival rate. That Hey, 99% survival, and I really\\ndon So if you look at this data, and we\\ncompare it to something that we know very well like the flu virus, you flu virus in young people is about 0.01%. If you look at the pre-Delta\\nCOVID-19 data, it It Now, if you think about the 1% number,\\nyou you start to think about there won like Florida and Texas and specifically\\nIdaho, is an overwhelming of the critical care hospital health care delivery system. Think about this. The population of the United\\nStates is 331 million people. If just 1% are going to die, that just the people who are dying. Let can We only have under a million acute\\ncare beds in the United States, and so as a result of that, you\\nare going to quickly overwhelm the healthcare system if you have a\\nproblem with an overwhelming infection. Let It has a 39.7% fully vaccinated rate,\\nand what we yesterday, the governor has declared\\nthat hospitals now because they overwhelmed are going to start to\\ndeliver basically rationed care. You should not expect the same standards\\nof care that you in the health care delivery system\\nbecause they Let me give you some specific examples. Instead of having one intensive care nurse\\nfor two patients, it one intensive care nurse for six patients\\nwith some help from non-ICU nurses. Because they level of care for things that they\\nneed to get done if they have very advanced cancers, for instance, because\\nthose hospitals don If you need elective surgery, their\\nelective surgeries are being canceled. Traumas are still happening. Babies are still being born. These are the problems that we because you But if you were to get into a car\\naccident, or you wanted...know somebody that wants to deliver a baby and\\nhas a complication, it difficult for those things to happen. And so this is the thing that And going back to my experience\\nin the last couple of weeks, every single one of those patients in the\\nhospital that were there in their 30s, their 40s were not vaccinated. And it based on whether or not you should\\nget the vaccine because you hear about side effects, or you hear about things,\\nfor instance, about myocarditis. Well, here reviewed published September 16th,\\n2001 looking at the Israeli data with almost a million subjects in each arm. So what we have here plotted in yellow\\nis the risk difference per a hundred thousand persons infected with SARS-CoV-2,\\nand in blue is the risk difference per hundred thousand persons who\\nreceived the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine. First, let We see big risks here for acute\\nkidney injury, for arrhythmia, for deep venous thrombosis, for pulmonary\\nembolism, and for myocardial infarction. And again, notice that there is a\\nsmall signal here in terms of COVID-19 for myocarditis and pericarditis. Clearly, there is a small signal there\\nwith post vaccination myocarditis, and pericarditis, but actually the data here\\non these from Israel is showing that it But in terms of the relative risks for the\\nvaccine, which is in blue, notice that the biggest one here at 78 is lymphadenopathy,\\nwhich is a normal response to the vaccine. Now there process, but have been published\\nto a medical archive server. And again, the peer review process\\nis where the paper is submitted to experts in the field that review it\\nlooking for possible bias or things that were not taken into consideration. And this pre-print non-peer reviewed\\narticle using electronic records in the United States, also agreed with\\nthe Israeli data that was published in the new England journal of medicine and\\ncame to the conclusion that young males infected with the virus are up to six\\ntimes more likely to develop myocarditis as those who received the vaccine. Another pre-print, which is still\\ncurrently in the process of being peer reviewed, made headlines\\nin a number of papers in the UK and also in the United States. And it showed the opposite that the\\nincidents of post-vaccine myocarditis had a higher incidents than hospitalization\\nin pediatric patients from COVID-19. However, the article glean most of\\nits data from the VAERS, which as you know, is a reporting system and\\nraw data based on reports that could be made by anyone and often contain\\nincomplete descriptions and chart notes that require additional investigation,\\nremoval of confounding variables and comparison to background levels of\\nmedical problems to become useful. Now, we see various data, doesn VAERS can use to generate hypotheses,\\nbut not to test them directly. So in summary, I think it from VAERS data, but it observational data that haven So it points out in these papers and\\nif they go on to be published. So to answer your question Kyle it Um, but for a young person now,\\ntoday facing the Delta variant and maybe future variants, it dealing with back earlier in 2021. Yes. Now they are more susceptible to\\ngetting the infection and now the risk of them being hospitalized is higher.	Success
Covid-19 vaccines and VAERS I Dr. Roger Seheult	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk158-WmuQA	FoundMyFitness Clips 	Dr. Seheult, could you explain what VAERS\\nor the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System that we use in the United States is\\nand how that data should be interpreted? [Dr. Seheult] : Yeah. Thanks, Kyle. So, to back up a little bit, let So, if we look at December, January,\\nand February of just a few months ago, that was a period of time at least\\nwhere I where there was a lot of COVID. In fact, we had to build an entire\\nnew ICU with isolation precautions. We had to have nurses trained. We basically used a lot of\\nresources because surgeries weren And compare that with the next\\nthree months after that, which would be March, April, and May. So, the reason why those two groups\\nof three months are very different is the first group of three months had\\na lot of COVID-19 patients coming in. We were very full. And then after that wave went\\naway, we basically disbanded the second intensive care unit. We were able to contract back to\\nwhat we were doing before, and this despite the fact that in March,\\nApril, and May of 2021, we were vaccinating millions of people a day. And so, again, I just\\nwant to underline what Dr. Patrick was saying there. If the spike protein from the vaccine\\nwas so dangerous, how were we able to contract down our hospital ICU intensive\\ncare services during that period of time? However, what did happen during that\\ntime was that there was a huge spike of...so the argument may be made, for\\ninstance, that maybe the spike protein is not causing disease or conditions\\nthat would get people into the intensive care unit, but it might be causing more\\nmild symptoms or more mild problems. And that might show up in\\nsomething called the VAERS systems. Let So, as you can see here on the\\nscreen, there made the rounds on the internet,\\nand what it does is it shows the total reported deaths post-vaccine. And you can see obviously not post-COVID\\nvaccine because the COVID vaccine didn And we And then all of a sudden, there these, again, are reported deaths. So this is evidence, some say, that\\nthese patients that are receiving the COVID-19 vaccine are dying. So, again, I don through the intensive care unit. I guess it never making it to the hospital. So let The thing that you that...first of all, a couple of things. Number one, you have to understand that\\nbecause the vaccines that were given emergency use authorization in the late\\n2020, because of this, they expanded the reporting requirements for the VAERS. In other words, before a physician\\nwould make a report to the VAERS if he suspected that a vaccination\\nled to a death, and they were under suspicion that something was connected. Now that was completely eliminated. Now, no matter what happens, if a patient\\ngets a vaccine, and anything happens, hospitalization, death, anything,\\nit should be reported under law. So, I wanted to take a look at this\\na little bit more, and what I did was I looked at this paper that was\\npublished back in 2016, so pretty early. And it was looking at the flu vaccine\\nbecause a lot of people say that this has never happened before. This huge increase in reporting\\nfrom the vaccine has never happened. But yet there is a situation that\\noccurred, and it was published here in December of 2016 titled, Vaccination in Pregnant Women and Their\\nInfants in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting system, July 2010 to May 2016. So, as you may recall, in 2009, we\\nhad a flu epidemic called the swine flu epidemic, and in that year, there\\nwas a huge amount of H1N1 influenza. And you can see that here on\\nthe screen with that red bar. So you can see the blue is sort of the\\nendemic influenza, and then in 2009, this massive increase in H1N1 reports. And so what you also see here is\\nthat purple line is the amount of vaccinations that happened. So because there was a lot of\\ninfluenza that was going around, a lot of people were being vaccinated. So what you number of reports of adverse events. Okay. So that Even though the vaccine had not changed,\\nthe makeup of the vaccine had not changed, what we saw was because there\\nwas more vaccinations being given, there were more reports being given. But there is that there was more understanding\\nand more awareness of influenza. So what I So how often somebody would get on the\\ninternet and search for influenza, you can see clearly there at the same point\\nin time that we reported spikes, we In fact, the highest that there ever\\nwas during that time because it was a very important news item at that time. Now, again, this was under\\nstrict reporting system. So, they only could report whether\\nthey felt that there was a connection. But even that after they looked at\\nit, and published this paper, this is the conclusion that they came to. Despite the increase in reporting\\nevents, they said that the peak in the number of pregnancy reports observed\\nduring 2009 to 2010 followed by a decrease in reporting suggest that the\\n2009 spike in pregnancy reports after 2009 H1N1 inactivated vaccines may\\nhave been due to stimulated reporting. In other words, the vaccine hadn and so their conclusion was is that as in\\n2000 and 2009-2010, no new or unexpected patterns in maternal or fetal outcomes\\nwere observed during 2010 and 2016. So, if we take the same kind of\\nmethodology that we looked at this huge spike here with\\nCOVID-19, and this is supposed to be evidence that people are dying from the\\nCOVID vaccine, we see a very interesting pattern because, if we look at Google\\ntrends, and we type in COVID vaccine, obviously, there that we would see with the influenza. And then also, again, just to make sure\\nthat we understand here, this is the deputy director for the Centers for\\nDisease Control, and this is what he says. He says, broader than for other vaccines. After someone receives the COVID-19\\nvaccine, their health care provider is required by law to report all serious\\nadverse health events, that would include death, even if the provider does not\\nthink the vaccine caused that event. These events can include death,\\ninpatient hospitalization, or a serious case of COVID-19. That reporting protocol is due to\\nthe fact that the FDA authorized the COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use. So you can see that the rules have\\nchanged in the middle of the game, and so we have to look at that. If we were to give a placebo injection,\\nthe question is is we would still see deaths associated with the vaccine. Why? Because we I did a little bit of an\\nepidemiological exercise. So bear with me. If you look at the U.S. death rate per 100,000 population\\nper year, it So, in other words, if you were to take\\nat random 100,000 people in the United States and follow them for a year,\\nyou would find at the end of that year that about 870 people would have died. Obviously, as the age goes up,\\nthat can go up to as high as 4,000. Here in the 75 to 84-year-old\\nage group that So let We And also if you were to look over the\\nperiod of the last seven months, going from January this year to August,\\nseven or eight months, you there increase in the amount of vaccinations\\nover that seven month period of time. And in fact, over that 7 month period\\nof time, there people that have been vaccinated. So, if that time that someone And over that period of time, which\\nstarted in January, that have the highest death rates, but\\nthen as we go through the year, it comes down to the lowest death rate. So that death rate in the United States. So let If there is 870 dead people per 100,000\\npeople per year, and we adjust that for the 166 million people that we adjust that for instead of 12 months\\njust 3 and a half months, which is the average period of time that people\\nhave been on average vaccinated, we come to this number of about 421,000\\npeople that should be dead just by chance from getting the vaccine. And clearly, that The reports show maybe 10,000 or 15,000. So, clearly, there is a huge\\namount of underreporting occurring. Now, realize that, again, most of the\\npeople who are being vaccinated at least in the country are actually much older. So this number should actually be higher. And number two, that most of the people\\nthat were vaccinated very early on and therefore have a longer range of\\nvaccination were the older group as well. And so when you look at that, you\\ncan see here that the reported deaths totaling about 5,000 or 6,000 is a\\nhuge underreporting of the number of deaths that we should have if we just\\nput a little red dot on their shoulder or gave them a placebo injection. That people will show this and say, cannot be gotten from that type of data. The other graph that you might\\nsee is this graph, which shows the number of days after vaccination\\nthat deaths are reported. So, based on our 400,000 number that\\nwe prorate that on a daily basis, we\\nwould come up with about 4,000 people dying on a daily basis on average. Obviously, that gets bigger as more\\nand more people get vaccinated. But what we 600 to 700 deaths per day. Again, huge underreporting\\nhere at this point. And again, so because there think that what would be the most likely\\nreporting situation, someone who got a vaccine and died the next day, or\\nsomeone who died maybe a month later? Obviously, when you have a death\\noccurring close to an event that has to be reported, the reporting is going to\\nhappen more likely in that situation, and you And that We see that the most reporting\\noccurs within one or two days, and then it goes down precipitously\\nconsistent with that type of pattern. The other last thing I vaccines, with Moderna, for instance, it for Pfizer, it If, in fact, that second shot is\\ncausing the problems that we see with myocarditis, myocardial infarction\\nthat I would expect to see another peak here\\nabout three to four weeks out, but, in fact, we don And so that, again, lends me to believe\\nthat this graph is the result of reporting events and human psychology\\nrather than an actual spike protein that I agree that we should\\nlook for this stuff. This stuff needs to be taken\\nseriously, and that is exactly the purpose of the VAERS system is to\\nlook to see if there are patterns. But to go out and say that simply because\\nthere are deaths, that that must mean that the vaccine is causing deaths.	Success

This Sauna Protocol Could Cut Your Dementia Risk By 66%	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMqNa3w5XFQ	FoundMyFitness Clips 	When we exposure, which is something that you spent an awful lot of time thinking about, what the best way to utilize cold and heat routine throughout a week? Like what simplest way to do an evidence-based cold and heat protocol? I think um one of the best ways would be if so most people should be training, right? they should be doing some sort of resistance training or endurance training um vigorous exercise doing the heat after that I think would be one of the best because you workout to some degree. So there there the endurance side like if you intervention studies that have taken people that have done exercise on a stationary bike or they exercise on the stationary bike and then done 15 minutes of hot sauna like right after that and with basically no break with no break they just go into the sauna after and then V2 max was measured so V2 max is like your best way to measure cardiorespiratory fitness right so maximum amount of oxygen you taking in and maximum you know exercise. So, um the their V2 max was better in people that did that exercise, the the stationary bike plus the sauna versus just the stationary bike, right? And that is a lot because sauna to some degree is mimicking moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise. You know, it it lot of the same physiological response is happening. So, I would say um doing the sauna right after the workout. But also, there showing people that did resistance training and then got into a sauna had like better muscle gains and it just makes your workout more of whatever you did. It makes your, you know, but I think some of that has to do with the heat shock proteins, too. And um also, yeah, there if you um increase blood flow like like if you do resistance training, it used to be like this thing where it oh, don like at this on the same day that you doing resistance training cuz you going to blunt out your gangs or something. I don exactly was called, but that been put to rest. It so to to well I guess there extreme there say ways you could do it but generally speaking like getting some blood flow to your muscles after you actually improves hypertrophy right because you factors and things there and immune cells things that are like playing a role in the hypertrophy. Is there a window post training that you need to get into the heat within not necessarily no within the same day? No, I think you should do it if you Okay, you act you asked me about the optimal protocol. I would say optimally it would be after training. It doesn also heat plays a role in sleep. So pe some people choose to do their heat at night like a couple hours before they going to go to bed. You can go I actually have been kind of obsessive about this of late and I do both. So I do I get in the sauna after I work out and then I do the jacuzzi at night with my husband. um which is another form of heat stress. You 104°ree Fahrenheit water, you can be in there for 20 minutes and get similar responses in terms of biomarkers as a sauna. So, I do think um if you going to do one, you can kind of choose like do you have a hard time sleeping? Do you want to or do you want to kind of extend your workout? And now I don know that you have to do it. Like I think there data. By the way, the study with the cyclists and the sauna that was in untrained people. So you might go, what about train people? there people that do exercise or people that exercise and sauna, so this is all sorts of people. This is these are people that are exercising. These aren right? The people that do exercise and sauna have a higher V2 max compared to people that only exercise. So there kind of makes it a little stronger that it it think it cardiovascular exercise. So, do you have to do it after a workout? No, you don have to. Uh, but I do think it personally like to do it after a workout. It heart rate up, you know? It it extending my workout. Some two uh windows that seem to be at least interesting to use would be 2 hoursish finishing 2 hours before bed. I say that. Yeah. Because some people take longer to cool down. Yeah, me too. I do. Exactly. So, yeah. 2 hours like to get out before, you know, like because then you don to sleep. Then you effect, right? You fall asleep. And then post-workout. So, post-workout and a couple of hours before sleep, what temperature, how long per week, what else? Yeah. So, um temperature, duration, frequency, like how many times, you know? So there sorts of studies coming out of Finland where saunas are ubiquitous and everyone sauna use and all cause mortality cardiovascular rate of mortality dementia Alzheimer things right and what there is a dose dependent effect with frequency and duration in the sauna so in other words the more frequent the sauna use the more robust of the effect so I mortality is 40% lower in people that use this on a four to seven times a week. So four times would be minimum, right? Versus people that use it two to three times a week, they have a 24% lower all cause mortality, right? So the bare minimum would be two if you want something. Um this is compared to people that use it one time a week. But if you want the most robust effects, the bare minimum would be four up to seven, right? Every day. So that would be frequency. Now temperature and duration. Most of those studies in Finland, the average temperature in the publications is about 174 175 degree Fahrenheit. And the duration in that sauna is also important. So if people only stayed in for 11 minutes, they weren very robust effect. They had to stay in for at least 20 minutes. M so 20 minutes at 174° F four times a week is the recipe for I would say the the best you know uh effects for cardiovascular brain all cause mortality. What about if you increase temperature and reduce duration? Yeah. So this question usually I get at the opposite because people are interested in infrared saunas and infrared saunas go only to like 145 degree Fahrenheit. They kind of heat you up a little differently. They ambient air is not as hot. It know electrons that are like moving your molecules in your body up. But um and so in that case you would want to stay in a much longer duration and that used in like Ashley Mason study. But the opposite so like if you know what 180 or how how hot are we talking? My moment is 2:30 today. Okay. So, um, heat is so heat is a stress. It it you have this stress response to the heat, right? So, your body makes heat shock proteins, for example. You get dark thoughts. You you get dark thoughts. Yeah. Exactly. And then and then you get out and you feel great. But, um, you also get chatty in there. So, um it that you don heat because it is a stress like just like you don like all day like you need recovery, right? You don forever like you need food. These things are stressed. They body and our body has a stress response to them. So, this is kind of like hormesis. We talked about hormesis a lot, right? Heat is the same thing. Um, heat can permeabilize the bloodb brain barrier when you start to go to extreme temperatures. You brain. I too high. Yeah, there study that came um that was published was it 2022? It was kind of recentish. And um it wasn Linan who does a lot of studies out of Finland uh looking at you know sauna use and dementia for example he found sauna use is associated with like a 66% reduction in Alzheimer dementia if you to seven times a week well another study came out and this was in gosh it was quite a few I don or 5,000 adults it was a lot or maybe it was more actually um well anyways they looked at temperature and they looked at duration and they looked at Alzheimer disease risk and you know it was clear that you know if you use the sauna you had a lower degree a lower risk of of dementia and Alzheimer there was a subset of group where people were using it at 200 degrees Fahrenheit or more that had the opposite effect wow so U-shaped curve to temperature I think so I don get freaked out because it not everyone the extreme there push where I you going to be that person that goes all the way because that everything you do. The dialup. Yeah. Yeah. So, um I do think with sauna though, it that it is a pretty strong stress on the body, particularly if you out, right? But if you head in there and warming it up to 230°, yeah, this plunge thing is really, really intense. I mean, there of things when you think about like where located? Is it It you bench, you your head to that point. And the difference between this one that I got is two benches and the lower bench is way cooler. Half half as hard as sitting on the upper bench. And the upper bench isn the top. And if you to where the rock heater thing is, if you if you harder. So, you can kind of mitigate within that, I suppose. Um, one consideration like four times a week can be quite intrusive for somebody to get that heat exposure, especially if they don home, it got to go back and forth to the thing and preheat it and all the rest of the stuff. Is there a or if you were to do 20 minutes in at 180, 190, something like that, uh, to make sure that it 174, uh, and then take a little break and then go back in. Is that a way that you could maybe get away with doing three times a week or two times a week and still try and capture some of those really good gains? Um, I don that data is there to make that statement, but I do know that there have been studies looking at going repeatedly and taking a few minutes break and going back into the sauna. And what is clear is that you do get big major boost in growth hormone. Is this a thing that 16 increased? Tell tell us that. Yeah. So what they were doing is they were going so they many times but it was quite four times 30 minutes with a break. Yeah. With break something like that. Yeah. So it been years since I study but yeah so um and that that could give 16fold increase in growth hormone which you know it does it It doesn know also growth hormone is involved with sleep and in deep sleep. And so it like timing your sauna around around bedtime could be highly beneficial for a lot of people. Like a lot of people really do benefit. So I personally, like I said, I do I kind of do both. I did like the I do the hot tub um which is 104 degrees and I minutes and but the difference being that it your skin. Exactly. No. And there studies that have looked at so there heat shock proteins that are activated um in the sauna and they activated in the hot tub and brain drive neurotrphic factor which is from exercise also is activated when you get in the hot tub. So and and the sauna so it biomarkers that are similar between the different heat modalities you kind of go well at the end of the day is your heart rate going up in the hot tub? Yes. It like I like years and years and years and years. I like I know how I feel. I feel the exact same way in the sauna. I like the the sauna better because I likely to cheat. Like I will cheat in a hot tub. I will get my arms out. I like you have to have your shoulders down for 20 minutes. So you have to really like Didn into a you got in trouble with big steam like the steam room versus uh sauna versus jacuzzi thing. I think there lot of people that are like evangelists for the sauna being the only way to get hot. And I think that you there that you can get hot. There different ways you can get hot. And I think I mean I showers again. You rate up. You increasing your uh cardiac output. You You are happening. It response. You of ways. What is it? The a lot of rooms to a lot of roads to Rome, right? I mean, it doesn to easy easy access to a sauna or doesn about just running a hot bath and then continuing to like I I mean, how much is a thermometer that you put in the bath? It probably $5, maybe $10 or something. Throw that in, get it at what temperature, and stay in for 20 minutes. Exactly. I do this a lot when I traveling, by the way. Like, I get I do the um the portable sauna. I do I do it. Um, but so what I what I like to to recommend is like so go and get one of those pool thermometers, right? I mean, they anywhere between $5 to $15. The little floaty ones. You put that in your bathtub and you get it up to 104. Set your timer for 20 minutes. Make your make sure your shoulders are down like submerged below. And if the the the temperature starts to go down, just add some more hot water. And that it. Most most people have a bathtub. And so I like that it can be accessible because that of, oh well I don position. Yeah. You know, and yeah, there Finland. Like we has a sauna, you know. So So I do realize that there saunas and you might go, do I need a like do I need it? know, like I said, so there max, you know, that you you exercise. Now there that are endurance athletes like they I don V2 max? Probably not. But it also helps with disuse atrophy, muscle atrophy. Um, and those studies have been done. And so they this, they immobilize a limb in people for like a period of weeks. And they did local heating in in one study, but there doing sort of whole body heating. And it 40%.	Success
