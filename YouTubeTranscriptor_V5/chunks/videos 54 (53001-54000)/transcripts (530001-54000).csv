So you want to be a podiatrist | REACTION to @MedSchoolInsiders	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rych0bwetu0	FootDocDana	so you want to become a podiatrist i swear if he makes a foot fetish joke hello everybody welcome back to my channel my name is dana i physician in my final year of residency and i am super excited for my video today there a page on youtube called med school insiders and they have a series called so you want to be a blank where it different medical specialties so this weekend they made a video so you want to be a podiatrist and i got sent this video lots of times people wanted me to weigh in on it so i so you want to become a podiatrist i swear if he makes a foot fetish joke you like feet maybe a little bit too much but hey i public perception myths and give it to you straight this is the most common joke by far that people tell me oh boy [Music] let highlight a specific specialty or profession within medicine such as podiatry and help you decide if it for you podiatry is the field specializing in the foot and ankle and related structures of the leg both in medical and surgical management they use principles from sports medicine biomechanics wound healing and various surgical techniques this already looks like a really nice video it together the graphics are amazing techniques to treat anything from discomfort and pain to discoloration or odor some common conditions podiatrists manage include plantar fasciitis which is inflammation of the connective tissue on the sole of the foot ingrown toenails achilles tendinitis structural deformities such as crossover toes nerve or vascular damage ankle sprains ulcers infections such as athlete fractures and bunions this is a pretty good list of all the basics that pretty much all podiatrists would see some see more trauma in surgery than others but these are for sure the basics we care have comorbidities meaning other chronic medical conditions such as diabetes because of compromised blood circulation in the foot and resulting nerve damage diabetics are particularly prone to foot issues such as neuropathic ulcers from losing protective sensation yeah this is true no matter what path you want to take in podiatry during your training you a lot of foot wounds mostly due to diabetes so if you squeamish this might not be the path for you but it is so important that these people are treated because preventing and managing these foot wounds prevents more proximal amputation on the other hand some of your patients may be healthy athletes and you tasked with treating their ankle fractures or other acute injuries with bracing casting orthotics or surgery the conditions you treat within podiatry will be both acute and chronic in nature sometimes for the same injury for example an acute ankle sprain meaning soon after it occurred is primarily focused on dealing with the immediate inflammatory process if the patient continues to have chronic ankle issues and repeated strains say one year later the management plan changes if they have scar tissue and structural changes for instance surgical intervention may be warranted if you the surgeries for chronic ankle instability google internal brace the video will come right up this surgery is basically adding reinforcement over the stretched out or torn ligament and there might be an arthroscopic component too to look at the joint itself podiatrists will assess neurovascular dermatological and musculoskeletal components in making treatment decisions while most presentations are non-urgent urgent and emergent management may be necessary for open fractures degloving injuries compartment syndrome and some infections podiatry is a misunderstood field and as i joked about at the beginning of this video many think podiatrists have foot fetishes maybe some do i can fetish the last thing they want to do is go into podiatry you see a bunch of messed up feet but they probably aren through podiatry as they with ulcers fungus calluses and interesting smells some believe podiatrists only cut toenails and give pedicures while it involve trimming toenails and calluses for patients who are at elevated infection or bleeding risk they do much more than that there population that podiatrists only do the things that he listed and the reason behind it is really interesting for one in many other countries podiatrists aren trained in surgery so they one reason but the main reason is that years ago podiatry training was nothing like it is now it used to be there was just a podiatry school for four years and then that was it there was no residency and now pretty much all of our programs are integrated with allopathic and osteopathic programs and all of us have a three-year surgical residency the problem is a lot of people think podiatry is what it was 50 years ago but we century podiatry now so a lot has changed and i think it continue to evolve podiatrists run the whole gamut from trimming toenails to surgical procedures and last many people confuse podiatry with pediatrics the most common problem like many people especially the younger generation don know the word podiatric so if i say podiatric or spell it they say oh so you work with you like kids and i no no i don i podiatry team and if they are younger and they seem confused i like i because i have to specify they don know what podiatry is so online i always just say foot doctor because it and a lot of people like almost make fun of me for it say it it and no one thinks i so podiatrists earned their dpm standing for doctor of podiatric medicine after attending podiatry school which is four years i quickly this is four years after college you need a college degree before that your first two years are your basic sciences and your system blocks and then my western u dpm program was shared with the osteopathic med students program so we took all of our classes with them every single class and we took the same tests and were graded on the same scale but the difference is while they were taking omm which is osteopathic manipulative medicine we were taking our supplemental podiatry courses so with this system the majority of your time is spent with the shared curriculum courses so you physicians first and podiatrists second but you do have several years of training ahead of you to hone in on podiatry but focus more heavily on podiatry in years three and four i think he was trying to be brief here but third and fourth year are your clinical rotations so basically you spend about a month at a time in different rotations in different hospitals so you is basically a pre-specialized medical program so we already know we to do it because of this we about half of this time in podiatry and then the other half in just general rotations and there to do so like orthogensurge family medicine internal medicine infectious disease other ones i forgetting right now and usually when you rotations the hospital just gives you a badge that says medical student and you have the same responsibilities as any other medical student there in the u.s there are nine podiatry schools with roughly 1 000 students applying each year and approximately 60 gaining admission if you thought that applying to podiatry school would spare you from the mcat think again do note however that podiatry school admissions are substantially less competitive than either allopathic or osteopathic medical school this is true a while ago i made a tick tock comparing american mddo and dpm program stats i just put them right here with a 3.4 overall gpa more specifically a 3.2 science gpa and 3.5 non-science gpa i think there this one is we have a lower applicant pool because not a lot of people know about podiatry and the thing that concerns me about this a little bit is that easier to get into doesn like i mentioned we take all of our classes with the osteopathic medical students and we don grading at all so if someone gets into a dpm program that statistically wouldn to a do program they risk of not making it our class for example we lost about a third from people dropping out or leaving for some reason so i can pretty much guarantee you that out of the graduating podiatrist the average gpa in mcat is higher than this so i would take that as a a word of warning if you are someone that struggles academically and are considering this room podiatry school most states require a three-year residency covering medical and surgical training although the duration does vary by state it doesn it just a small small handful that are four years however there are two types of residencies one is pmsr which stands for podiatric medicine and surgery residency where you train in surgery of the forefoot and maybe some of the rearfoot and then there is pmsr rra which is that plus a rear foot so you trained in both the forefoot and the rear foot um i like with md or do residency podiatrists have various general and more specialized rotations as a first year resident in your postgraduate year one or pgy1 you months on podiatry and the rest of the year on core rotations including anesthesiology orthopedics and emergency medicine as a pgy 2 and 3 you exclusively on podiatry both in the inpatient and outpatient settings gaining additional autonomy as your training progresses yeah the setup varies by program so you rotations your first year but i also had off service rotations my second year too like i was in ortho for a couple months and some other surgical subspecialties podiatry is more male dominated with close to 60 percent of matriculants being men however the gap has been narrowing as more and more women enter the field after podiatry residency you can sub-specialize further with podiatry fellowship which are usually each one year in duration yep that fellowship most people don option sports medicine podiatrists deal with athletes and their associated injuries it includes a high volume of quick procedures i feel like as a first year student everyone said they wanted to do sports medicine conservative management is also common including taping padding dressing splinting and casting yeah this is definitely something that we learn pretty heavily it includes a strong biomechanics component and incorporation of physical therapy modalities and rehabilitation techniques limb salvage and preservation podiatrists work primarily with diabetic or vascularly compromised patients you be preventing or conducting lower extremity amputations and therefore there is a heavier operative component to this fellowship a very large percent of podiatrists do at least a little bit of work in limb salvage and the reason for this is the growing prevalence of uncontrolled diabetes and as far as amputations go that a resident doctor those will be your first surgeries so it done so pretty much all of us do it but whether or not you attending depends on the lifestyle may be more unpredictable however as you may need to take call reconstructive podiatrists are the most heavily surgical dealing with complex reconstructions such as in addressing charcoal food compared to other podiatry subspecialties complication rates are higher so this is the biggest thing people go to fellowship for big recon cases or very complex surgical procedures big recon cases take several hours public health podiatrists place an emphasis on quality care and preventive medicine this sub-specialization is best suited for those who want to think bigger picture about healthcare policy clinical care and making a wider impact on quality of care wound care podiatrists focus on complex wounds managing infections and limiting complications it interdisciplinary incorporating elements from infectious disease dermatology vascular surgery and plastic surgery um i would just add that limb salvage and wound care are one in the same there are other fellowships too including trauma pediatrics and orthopedics so most people see a mix of everything that was just talked about although it is possible to niche down more usually you everything there it work-life balance with podiatrists working generally 30 to 60 hours per week depending on practice type and setting i completely agree with this i think it we consider 60 hours a good work-life balance you aren death situations and outcomes are generally favorable it aren but note that depending on your clinical focus some of your patients may have substantial complexity or comorbidities depending on your interests there is some flexibility in your clinical practice for example you could be more or less surgical depending on your preference or sub-specialize with one of the various fellowship offerings these are some of the things that drew me to podiatry initially so he definitely found some of the great things about the field of the other benefits of already being comparatively narrow in scope compared to something yeah so you school education but your pre-specialized field which allows you to begin your training in day one or having to work extra hard to match into a particularly competitive specialty podiatry isn first and most obviously you be okay with forever working on the foot and ankle for the rest of your career the level of differentiation within podiatry is comparatively limited you won recognition status it says about the social recognition and the status i do love podiatry i would definitely do it again in a heartbeat but it um and i think it someone who and people from reddit can invade my comments section compensation as going the physician route despite spending four years and podiatrists are physicians i sure where he got these numbers um but as i labor and statistics right now the average mean wage for podiatrists is 151 and internal medicine is 2 10. so still a difference i still don though it does depend very widely where you look so for example mgma data basically shows 230 000 for non-surgical podiatrists and then 250 000 for a surgical podiatrist and yes we know your cousin sister per year as a podiatrist but we here that a lot of podiatrists that tell me they make x amount of money and i don whether or not to believe them but who knows after all you could say the same about high earning outliers in just about any specialty or field of medicine i do think podiatry has a much larger standard deviation than average so i do think there are a lot of outliers in both directions there surgeons and podiatrists given the five plus years of surgically focused training orthopedic surgeons receive in addition to specialized foot and ankle fellowship my orthopedic surgeon colleagues believe they are better suited for surgical management of the lower extremity i experiences with orthopedic surgeons that i know in real life i know some of them follow me so in some locations there relationship between podiatry and ortho because we are completely different fields but naturally there is a little bit of overlap because they both could be surgery on the foot and ankle but this definitely isn if you need the ego boost that comes with being a physician podiatry may leave you unfulfilled it true what he says because even though we have the same education as other physicians and our surgical residency and even though we the government there call us physicians because historically we weren didn the level of training that we do now and some people um don decide if podiatry is a good fit for you if you want to build longitudinal relationships with patients work with feet and want to improve quality of life without the pressure of life or death decisions podiatry may be a good fit if you are comfortable focusing on the foot but are not sure how medical or surgical you want to be podiatry offers that flexibility one of the things he didn a lot of people to podiatry is it not you go more of the surgical route or even if you are doing non-surgical clinic things it everything so i don that but otherwise he mentioned a lot of things that are great if you want to work in healthcare but aren competitive pre-med can be podiatry offers a more attainable alternative like i mentioned before you likely to get into a podiatry program than mddo in my opinion you should do podiatry because you want to do podiatry you shouldn because you think you might not get into mddo i think that for failure and being unhappy with your choice so you should really only do this if it into because there no changing specialties at least for now if you like the idea of working within a smaller community podiatry has you covered with only approximately 15 000 active podiatrists in the united states he says only 15 000 and that sounds like a lot but i swear podiatry is such a small field everyone always talks about in our community how small the field podiatry is and it this was a great video by med insiders i really enjoyed watching it and i hope you guys did too so let me know if there that you want me to talk about more and i can make another video about it but i was trying to play it cool but what do you guys think about these lights aren guys next time	Success

Foot doctor reacts to CRAZIEST pedicure TikToks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5z2V1KAwaQw	FootDocDana	look how much is coming off that crazy he welcome back to my channel my name physician in my final year of residency i reacted to callus shaving tick tocks before but since then i got a brand new batch of videos to check out so let difference there calluses like this from forming like one of them is to make sure you in good shoes to not wear sandals and also there you can use ones that are urea and salicylic acid based um so that can kind of help prevent these calluses from forming in the first place and of course to use a puma stone in the shower things like that but these videos are satisfying i admit it i thick callus on the heel look how much is coming off that it with a sharp blade like that at home but it just watching the fissures disappear like that wow he wow looks just like cheese though that it but it looks fantastic if you happen if you stopped cutting your toenails for years this is it they extremely long and discolored and they and curling down so formally this diagnosis is called onychogryphosis because it resembles a ram and unfortunately i cases that are this bad so usually it been neglected for a long time and the treatment would be cutting the nails like this and then evaluating the patient neurovascular status and checking to see if there wounds and then getting them on a good skin care regimen and making sure they have more regular follow-up with medical professionals this does unfortunately happen and it one of those things that you know a lot of people would find gross but it is very rewarding to be able to fix people back up and get them in the right shape triple the experience triple the pleasure so this is a pretty clear example though of foot calluses from biomechanical abnormality so in other words there high area of pressure and at this high area of pressure there callus at the bottom of the foot and the pattern here is very classic of a bunion aka hallux abductor valgus deformity so basically the big toe is turned inward and it and it causes excessive pressure on the inside of the big toe as you see there and that callus on the bottom of the foot is caused by excessive pressure on the second metatarsal which is the long bone on the base of the second toe patients with biomechanical deformities like this could benefit from custom orthotics to help more evenly distribute the pressure on the bottom of the foot or if it surgery if they fail conservative treatment so i had to throw this one in because it is so satisfying to watch so this is a treatment for spider veins called sclerotherapy so basically a foamy solution called sclerosant is injected into the vein and this causes it to like shrink and scar down so the blood that should have gone through in it is rerouted to healthier veins and then the scarred veins basically collapse and are reabsorbed by the body and those spider veins fade away um so some of the benefits of this is it it but it insurances but it is so satisfying to watch and i multiple videos just like this on tiktok i was growing a nail over my toenail so it looks like there a layer of nail over top of another one my girlfriend can oh she nurse is like that explains it she they wasn surgery this one hurt oh no beautiful usually when a nail looks like this it fungus so basically there stuck on the top of it and then a new nail is underneath pushing the dead one out the old nail will slowly be pushed off of the new nail but i would be careful with pulling off the old nail too quickly because you don cause any new wounds and that is it thank you so much for watching don subscribe and click here to see my last video and let me know what you guys want to see next in the comments i	Success

?????CREATINA: El Suplemento CLAVE para ENVEJECER BIEN (Punto de Vista MÃDICO) Â¡BENEFICIOS IGNORADOS!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEaOwKxMdiw	Dr. Borja Bandera 	it is the most effective supplement, most studied and one of the most used, many take it without even knowing how it works or how much they have to take, doubts remain about its safety or if your hair falls out when taking it, even so, hundreds of thousands are taking advantage of its benefits right now while you are watching this video and if I am talking about creatine monohydrate creatine monohydrate and today I will tell you about aspects that I am sure you do not know about this supplement, how it really works, what benefits it will generate in your body at the sports level and less known what benefits at the of some very important diseases finally we will see some cosmetic uses of creatine if you have heard correctly here the doctor work standard-bearer specialist in endocrinology and nutrition and today we are talking about creatine if you want to be up to date on sports clinic nutrition hormones supplements do not forget to subscribe and activate notifications that creatine is creatine monohydrate or monohydrated is the union of three amino acids arginine glycine and methionine is synthesized in your body mainly in the liver also in the kidneys and pancreas and is synthesized at a rate of one gram per day that is to say it is not an essential molecule because your body is capable of producing it for this reason and although creatine is found in foods of animal origin it is not essential to supplement if you are vegetarian or vegan as I said you also ingest creatine with the meat and fish you eat since it is found in the muscle of animals and now you will understand why creatine it belongs to an energy system of cells called the high-energy phosphate system together with atp adenosine triphosphate the energy exchange currency par excellence of your body I want you to understand therefore that creatine is not something foreign to you created in a laboratory it is neither a hormone nor a drug it is a molecule that your body already produces in small amounts understanding how creatine works will make you r an important leap in knowledge about energy systems and cell biology so pay attention because it is not difficult at all the first thing you have to know is that your cells need energy to live to maintain basic cellular processes to do things that energy is stored in the adenosine triphosphate atp bonds when the atp therefore becomes dependent on cindy phosphate and phosphate energy is released energy that is used to do things such as for the muscle to contract and you can move the key data which is your cells they cannot store atp or they can do so in a very small amount, so they have no other option but to continually be transforming other things into atp at a rate that allows them to cover the energy demand of the moment and what things are transformed into atp, mainly carbohydrates glucose fatty acids fats and some amino acids specifically the carbonate skeleton of some amino acids also ketone bodies s derivatives of fats and creatine phosphorus to be able to extract atp from these energy substrates keep these two words in mind cells have three differentiated pathways first, the high-energy phosphate system creatine belongs to it and it is the one that we are going to explain in the video of today, secondly, the lactate glycogen system that exists transforms it without oxygen from glucose into cta pto and we are not going to explain it today and thirdly , the oxidative aerobic pathway that consists of the oxidation with oxygen, therefore, of glucose of acids fatty acids and amino acids within the mitochondria to produce atp energy and we are not going to explain it today the functioning of creatine is always the same pay attention creatine binds to a phosphate group forming creatine phosphorus and the bond formed between creatine and phosphate contains or stores a lot of energy energy remembers it is always stored in bonds between molecules so that when said bond is broken said energy is released It should be useful for cellular processes but it is also that when the phosphorous tina is divided into phosphate and creatine it not only releases energy but that phosphate group that has been freed is used to regenerate the atp inside the cell or the pp that is one of no sinai two phosphate groups is a metabolite that is no longer used to provide energy is a product of atp that is a cellular hindrance because when it accumulates in excess it increases levels of fatigue and decreases your muscle strength what happens is that we have to reconvert said useless adp to atp marvelous energy that we all want how we do it because the phosphate from the vat phosphor binds to pp and since atp is an adenosine and three phosphates we already have atp available again in the cell this metabolic reaction that occurs in milliseconds it is super fast it is catalyzed by an enzyme called ceca or creatine kinase is an enzyme normally measured in blood tests and that rises quite a bit after a hard workout or scaring many of you and also scaring many health professionals and it rises precisely because training damages muscle fibers and that enzyme that is inside the muscle goes out into the blood and we measure it we can measure it and it is elevated after a strong training also muscle is a tissue that requires a lot of dryness why this happens because it needs to be continually passing creatine phosphorus to creatine and renewing and ATP now you understand what creatine is for and you now understand why there is a lot of dryness in the muscle in the brain or heart because they are tissues that need a lot of energy fast and continuous energy therefore creatine is nothing more than an energy pathway plus a resource that your cells have to continually renew that cellular battery that is ATP now we are going to talk about the real benefits of creatine both at a sports level or at a performance level and at a clinical level, that is, at the level of illnesses attention really super interesting today creatine in terms of physical performance increase in intramuscular deposits is of creatine the main objective of taking creatine in supplemented form is to increase the basal deposits of creatine within the muscle of the heart and brain for the previously mentioned reasons , higher creatine deposits will improve the energy characteristics of these tissues, something that is especially important during high-intensity sports practice as we will see now, but also in situations where the brain does not obtain enough energy from other substrates such as high cognitive demands or sleep deprivation we will talk about this later in the last part of the video when we talk about diseases increase in muscle strength and power derived from the above creatine achieves benefits in muscle strength and power shortly after starting to take it that is, you will see that you can do a few more repetitions than you did in a certain exercise or that you can move more weight it is not miraculous, far from it, it is not something that is going to make you ultra strong in two weeks, far from it and if you do not train you will not see any type of muscular benefit how much creatine to take and how to take it because in a very brief way there are two ways the first the most conventional take 0.1 grams of creatine per kilogram of weight and daily per day at the time you want dissolved in water or dissolved in milk or dissolved in the protein shake it is the same example for a weight of 80 kilos 8 grams of creatine for a weight of 60 kilos 6 grams of creatine the second option would be the creatine load that consists of taking 15 to 20 grams daily for 5 consecutive days and then switch to option one as a maintenance dose, doing it this way only makes sense if you need to oversaturate your creatine stores in a short time because you have a competition or event nearby in I have to take the time when I when I take it, a good option is to take it post-training together with a recuperator that contains carbohydrates and proteins for one thing that I very interesting but you can really take it however you want and there are no big differences we continue with the effects on your body you will see an increase in weight creatine will make you gain 1 to 3 kilos when you start taking it but despite what many They continue to believe that those kilograms are not fat , it is water, specifically intracellular water, creatine accumulates inside the muscle cell as it has osmotic power, that is, it attracts water, creatine swells the muscle cell and this will make you look bigger, more swollen, we could say especially when muscle is carb-loaded in the context of a high-carb diet, not so much in the context of a low-carb diet cough or ketogenic is more this has beneficial effects in terms of muscle hypertrophy because this increase in cell volume seems to be a mechanical stimulus that makes it easier for the cell to start anabolic processes increase in plasma creatinine another effect that worries a lot is a slight increase in creatinine not to be confused with creatine in blood plasma creatinine is a metabolic product of creatine that is to say that creatine is transformed into creatinine and creatinine is expelled by the kidney at a fairly constant rate but precisely because it is eliminated quite constantly always the same by the kidney, creatinine and its renal clearance are used in medicine to evaluate kidney functionality, that is, to know if your kidney is adequately filtering the blood or not. When you supplement with creatine, creatinine figures slightly increase because there is more creatine to transform into creatinine but this does not imply that the kidney is deteriorating or is filtering worse, much less does it simply imply that more creatine is being transformed into creatinine. Not knowing this has led many professionals to affirm that creatine burdens the kidney when there is no evidence of such a thing and that we have more than 700 scientific papers on creatine in its effects and it has been intensively studied for more than three decades improves your anaerobic capacity at a sports level supplementing tea with creatine monohydrate makes sense in very explosive glück or lytic sports of short duration and high intensity some examples would be springs in sprinters team sports since they are intermittent by nature, that is, they have an acceleration and rest component crossfit would perhaps be the paradigmatic example of high intensity strength sports in general weightlifting power lifting strongman and because it improves performance in these sports very easy to understand high energy phosphate system rgy covers maximal efforts lasting about 10-15 seconds the perfect example would be a 100 meter sprint which is typically done in 10-23 seconds or a snatch in weightlifting which is typically lifted a few after this duration the high energy phosphate system it has to be renewed to be able to continue working something that takes between 60 and 120 seconds a marathon runner except for strong increases in pace perhaps at the end of the race it will hardly use the high-energy phosphate system increase in recent glycogen it sports regularly and want to have full glycogen stores is to know that the joint intake of creatine and carbohydrates improves this passage of glycogen inside the muscle, that is why I told you that a good time to take creatine is after training together with protein and carbohydrates because we take advantage of that effect in addition to the increase in muscle insulin sensitivity produced by the training itself training that is maximum after training and that will make it even easier for the carbohydrates you eat after training to pass into the muscle and now we are going to see some very important and little-known clinical effects that will undoubtedly serve you no matter how old you are . have it will help you reduce depressive symptoms in recent years the role of creatine in modulating brain health and mood has been studied and it has been seen that it has a mild but quantifiable antidepressant effect and nothing insignificant we could say in fact It is synergistic with famous antidepressant drugs of the class of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, an effect that seems more accentuated in women than in men, disorders related to anxiety and depression are increasing, so complementary tools to pharmacology are more than welcome to reduce or improve the very disabling symptoms that these patients have reduces the damage and n dna induced by exercise and by free radicals other of the most active areas of research around creatine is its role as an antioxidant we always talk about antioxidants that are present in coffee plants fruit vegetables but in the animal world There are also antioxidants and creatine is one of them. Exercise naturally produces a large amount of antioxidants, especially when we train a lot and at high intensity. One of the strongest hypotheses is that creatine would help minimize the damage caused by these reactive oxygen species . nitrogen generated by exercise non-tropic effect in conditions of sleep deprivation another of the most surprising benefits of creatine is that it improves cognitive abilities when we associate a situation of high cognitive demand with incorrect rest the perfect example is a surgeon who has to operate at dawn in the emergency room or a pilot who hasn three hours to study something that is not recommended to avoid or stop sarcopenia sarcopenia, which can be defined as low muscle mass associated with low strength and low functionality, is a growing threat in part due to the aging of the population that it is our duty to maintain peak muscle mass in adulthood as much as possible and slow muscle loss also as much as possible in advanced stages of life for this creatine can help improve muscle metabolism capacity mitochondrial and of course make you train harder not in the end that is very important a recurring question is whether creatine would be useful in people who cannot train or perhaps cannot do it at the desired intensity people with pathologies immobilized people people who are in the hospital people well very old because to date if creatine is not associated with strength training m muscle is of little or no use if all this news but that is what the evidence tells us muscle is not preserved only with creatine benefits in neuromuscular pathologies I have devastating diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy are associated with a reduction in deposits intracellular levels of creatine an abnormality associated with the dystrophin gene and it appears that muscle function is somewhat improved by giving creatine when compared to placebo yet the improvements are quite minor cosmetic effects and it may sound like a joke but creatine has shown beneficial effects on skin, when used in a topical formulation in a creatine cream together with glycerol and guarana, in this study a decrease in wrinkles and greater firmness in the skin was seen, as if that were not enough, it seems to have a pro effect, that is, it helps the synthesis of collagen, something that occurs when there is a surplus of energy in the cell in the skin cells in the fibroblasts so the creation atina is being studied as a person capable of stimulating the synthesis of this protein by giving it topically in in vitro studies, it has effectively stimulated the formation of collagen in fibroblasts, so if we advance in this line of research we will soon have it in many creams and cosmetics to this versatile molecule and so far today thank you for staying until the end remember very important that you subscribe to the channel so that we have better videos every time a big hug see you very soon and continue empowering	Success
POR QUÃ TOMAR CREATINA (Fuerza, Opositores, Ganar peso) ??Cantidad por dÃ­a *segÃºn tu SITUACIÃN*	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRmLaEbh5LU	Dr. Borja Bandera 	creatine is probably the most studied supplement and with greater utility mouths can compete with it except perhaps whey protein and you will quickly understand what creatine is what it is for and in what specific situations taking creatine can benefit you creatine is a molecule formed by three amino acids arginine glycine and methionine and you will say it is something artificial that can only be made synthetically or my body produces it because it is indeed a molecule that your body creates in small quantities in the liver, kidneys and pancreas but is that we also incorporate a certain amount of creatine in the diet by eating mainly meat and fish latte with this detail because it is important for one of the situations that I am going to tell you about in the video but it is essential that you understand what creatine is for how it works imagine to creatine as if it were a fast-acting battery what is a battery for then to give energy to a system, for example, to your mobile phone, it is true that molecules are transformed into energy in your body, fundamentally fatty acids , fats and glucose, carbohydrates, what is the problem that each of these energy sources has its limitations, for example, fatty acids They produce a lot of energy for each molecule used, but that energy is produced very slowly in the mitochondria. It is a fuel that burns little by little like the embers of a fire and helps us to cover our energy needs at rest and when we exercise at intensities. low or moderate smoke what happens with glucose is a much faster source of energy if we compare it to fatty acids and also more available your body can quickly use glucose at any time to generate energy that is why very metabolically active tissues such as the brain or kidneys consume a lot of glucose and when you exercise at a high intensity it is also the predominant fuel because at these intensities the mitochondria is not capable of oxidizing fat in most of us then you will say where creatine is and how it acts you have spoken of fat you have spoken of glucose how creatine provides energy the creative is the fastest of all the energy sources that i have mentioned you will have heard that the molecule that stores energy in your cells is called tp atp is nothing more than an adenosine molecule with three phosphors in whose bonds a lot of energy is stored when one of those bonds is broken and that energy is released from atp it becomes a molecule that is the same thing but with a phosphor - well the role of the photo that athina is how it is stored is very simple is replenish that phosphorus very quickly and in this way recharge the ATP reserves of your cells as I say this can be done by creatine very quickly and therefore it is useful in situations where there is a A high energy demand such as in a weightlifting maximum lift or in the first seconds of a sprint or in a jump to make a slam dunk in basketball and also in many other situations that I happened to tell you about right now the first situation you want to gain muscle is the most extended creatine and creatine helps you gain muscle for a fairly simple reason and that is that it increases the intensity at which you can train more intensity means two things more mechanical tension and more metabolic stress on the muscle and these two things translate to long-term in more lean tissue gain, that is, muscle, but creatine also attracts water into the muscle cell, increasing its intracellular volume, this is an anabolic stimulus in itself for the cell and therefore it will also help hypertrophy and finally the underestimated placebo effect that does not mean that creatine is not useful or that it only works because of a placebo means something deeper and more essential when we implement ourselves with something in which we believe and with the expectation this is the key that is going to make us improve that something we almost always make more effort unconsciously and end up obtaining better results I repeat this does not mean that creatine it works only because it is a placebo but this psychological factor is continually ignored second situation professionals and opponents if your professional present or future depends on your physical performance then creatine is your ally I am talking about opponents who have to face physical tests or I am talking about police of firefighters and obviously of athletes in all these cases creatine will help by increasing strength by increasing power therefore those sports more focused on strength will benefit more from creatine but also team sports for different reasons for example it helps muscle recovery since creatine stimulates the re-synthesis of glycogen, you know that glucose is stored in your muscles in the form of glycogen and that when you have used up those glycogen stores in your training, at work or in any physical activity, then you have to synthesize glycogen again, that takes time and therefore requires certain requirements and let therefore it helps you keep those muscular glycogen deposits full so that you can use them the next time it is necessary, it also decreases the recovery time between maximum efforts, for example between two races of a football game or a basketball game, therefore, if in your work there are situations or potentially situations that involve a period of intense exercise separated from a recovery period and then another period of intense exercise, the clearest example would be two races separated by a recovery period here creatine can help you next situation gain weight because most will look for the opposite but there is a group of people who need or want to gain weight in this case creatine produces an almost immediate weight gain due to an increase in intracellular volume two or three days after taking creatine your muscle cells begin to load of ideal glycogen and this makes you gain a range of between 2 to 5 kilos depending on your initial weight and the amount of muscle mass you have at the beginning now a very little known and very interesting effect is called sleep deprivation as I say little known but creatine makes you perform better at a cognitive level when you are in a situation of sleep deprivation the clearest example would be an airline pilot who has to stay active during a long flight and sleep little or a surgeon who has to get up at 4 in the morning to operate urgently or anyone who needs to perform more with little sleep, this happens because the brain is one of the organs that spends the most energy that consumes more energy and as we have said, creatine can be a wild card providing energy in difficult situations where access to other energy substrates is very compromised. Here I want to launch an important warning: sleep is irreplaceable and no matter how much creatine you take, it will not yield if you sleep anyway. You sleep four hours, so use this responsibly and when you have no other, for example for work reasons, the following situation is vegetarian or vegan, as I said at the beginning, it is food sources that provide creatine, they are animal sources, mainly meat and fish, today we know that there are Molecules such as meat or without carnitine or creatine, which are much more scarce in a vegan or vegetarian diet, these molecules are not essential in themselves, that is, if you do not take them, you will not die, but they do play a very interesting role in your health and especially in different specific situations like the ones we see today but also many others like that that if your diet is free of products of animal origin for whatever reason, it makes even more sense to take creatine, yes, with 35 grams a day, you will already maintain good intramuscular deposits of creatine and lastly, what is h ft, since they are the acronym of high-intensity functional training this high-intensity functional training is very fashionable since it is a very varied and efficient way of training, although here we are not going to analyze the pros and cons, we will leave that for another video, the clearest example would be the cross fit and if there is a sport that is perfect to benefit from creatine, it is this one for several reasons, firstly it improves your anaerobic capacity as well as your strength and power as we have said in high intensity we do not oxidize fat as I said at the beginning of the video we mainly use glucose and creatine phosphorus if your phosphorite deposits are empty you will not be able to benefit from that extra that it gives you also pay attention to this reduce e Oxidative damage acting as an antioxidant High intensity training produces a high amount of free radicals We cannot ignore this, especially when we do not have an adequate rest period between training and training Creatine also acts as an antioxidant in the cell, buffering that excess of radicals releases produced by intense exercise and finally decreases the recovery time in crossfit and other sports one of the elements that will make the most difference are the recovery times the athlete who throws the bar for 34 seconds in a training session breathes and continues training has a great advantage over the one who throws the bar and needs 20 seconds to catch his breath so here creatine can also help you today we have seen up to 6 situations where creatine can be very useful although there are some more and before I leave I will leave you with this video that interests you especially a big hug see you tomorrow and continue empowering	Success

well the role of the photo that athina is how it is stored is very simple is replenish that phosphorus very quickly and in this way recharge the ATP reserves of your cells as I say this can be done by creatine very quickly and therefore it is useful in situations where there is a A high energy demand such as in a weightlifting maximum lift or in the first seconds of a sprint or in a jump to make a slam dunk in basketball and also in many other situations that I happened to tell you about right now the first situation you want to gain muscle is the most extended creatine and creatine helps you gain muscle for a fairly simple reason and that is that it increases the intensity at which you can train more intensity means two things more mechanical tension and more metabolic stress on the muscle and these two things translate to long-term in more lean tissue gain, that is, muscle, but creatine also attracts water into the muscle cell, increasing its intracellular volume, this is an anabolic stimulus in itself for the cell and therefore it will also help hypertrophy and finally the underestimated placebo effect that does not mean that creatine is not useful or that it only works because of a placebo means something deeper and more essential when we implement ourselves with something in which we believe and with the expectation this is the key that is going to make us improve that something we almost always make more effort unconsciously and end up obtaining better results I repeat this does not mean that creatine it works only because it is a placebo but this psychological factor is continually ignored second situation professionals and opponents if your professional present or future depends on your physical performance then creatine is your ally I am talking about opponents who have to face physical tests or I am talking about police of firefighters and obviously of athletes in all these cases creatine will help by increasing strength by increasing power therefore those sports more focused on strength will benefit more from creatine but also team sports for different reasons for example it helps muscle recovery since creatine stimulates the re-synthesis of glycogen, you know that glucose is stored in your muscles in the form of glycogen and that when you have used up those glycogen stores in your training, at work or in any physical activity, then you have to synthesize glycogen again, that takes time and therefore requires certain requirements and let therefore it helps you keep those muscular glycogen deposits full so that you can use them the next time it is necessary, it also decreases the recovery time between maximum efforts, for example between two races of a football game or a basketball game, therefore, if in your work there are situations or potentially situations that involve a period of intense exercise separated from a recovery period and then another period of intense exercise, the clearest example would be two races separated by a recovery period here creatine can help you next situation gain weight because most will look for the opposite but there is a group of people who need or want to gain weight in this case creatine produces an almost immediate weight gain due to an increase in intracellular volume two or three days after taking creatine your muscle cells begin to load of ideal glycogen and this makes you gain a range of between 2 to 5 kilos depending on your initial weight and the amount of muscle mass you have at the beginning now a very little known and very interesting effect is called sleep deprivation as I say little known but creatine makes you perform better at a cognitive level when you are in a situation of sleep deprivation the clearest example would be an airline pilot who has to stay active during a long flight and sleep little or a surgeon who has to get up at 4 in the morning to operate urgently or anyone who needs to perform more with little sleep, this happens because the brain is one of the organs that spends the most energy that consumes more energy and as we have said, creatine can be a wild card providing energy in difficult situations where access to other energy substrates is very compromised. Here I want to launch an important warning: sleep is irreplaceable and no matter how much creatine you take, it will not yield if you sleep anyway. You sleep four hours, so use this responsibly and when you have no other, for example for work reasons, the following situation is vegetarian or vegan, as I said at the beginning, it is food sources that provide creatine, they are animal sources, mainly meat and fish, today we know that there are Molecules such as meat or without carnitine or creatine, which are much more scarce in a vegan or vegetarian diet, these molecules are not essential in themselves, that is, if you do not take them, you will not die, but they do play a very interesting role in your health and especially in different specific situations like the ones we see today but also many others like that that if your diet is free of products of animal origin for whatever reason, it makes even more sense to take creatine, yes, with 35 grams a day, you will already maintain good intramuscular deposits of creatine and lastly, what is h ft, since they are the acronym of high-intensity functional training this high-intensity functional training is very fashionable since it is a very varied and efficient way of training, although here we are not going to analyze the pros and cons, we will leave that for another video, the clearest example would be the cross fit and if there is a sport that is perfect to benefit from creatine, it is this one for several reasons, firstly it improves your anaerobic capacity as well as your strength and power as we have said in high intensity we do not oxidize fat as I said at the beginning of the video we mainly use glucose and creatine phosphorus if your phosphorite deposits are empty you will not be able to benefit from that extra that it gives you also pay attention to this reduce e Oxidative damage acting as an antioxidant High intensity training produces a high amount of free radicals We cannot ignore this, especially when we do not have an adequate rest period between training and training Creatine also acts as an antioxidant in the cell, buffering that excess of radicals releases produced by intense exercise and finally decreases the recovery time in crossfit and other sports one of the elements that will make the most difference are the recovery times the athlete who throws the bar for 34 seconds in a training session breathes and continues training has a great advantage over the one who throws the bar and needs 20 seconds to catch his breath so here creatine can also help you today we have seen up to 6 situations where creatine can be very useful although there are some more and before I leave I will leave you with this video that interests you especially a big hug see you tomorrow and continue empowering	Success

TOP 5 Mejores ALIMENTOS para tu HÃGADO?Â¿Curar el hÃ­gado rÃ¡pidamente?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g6yVEjB1lM	Dr. Borja Bandera 	an organ weighing just one and a half kilos with great responsibility performs countless tasks that are very important for the proper functioning of your body works tirelessly on many metabolic processes that are essential for life keeps what it is worth and is capable of discarding what it is not useful its best allies are the kidneys and we could say that after the brain it is the most important organ despite all this we abuse it continuously and in many cases we do not even realize what we are actually doing to it is our indispensable liver and today we are going to see how with simple actions we can restore it to health we will also see what liquid gold is like as a very fatty and fibrous fruit it helps you mobilize accumulated fat as some molecules present in one of my favorite fruits have been shown to improve liver disorders and Basically a list of foods to include to optimize the health of your liver, remember that they are not detox foods. which, due to their properties and their bioactive compounds, are of interest in maintaining or improving the functionality of your liver the liver is one of the busiest organs in your body, it eliminates environmental toxins and others generated by your own body, it creates essential proteins to transport hormones, also to coagulation can take place is involved in hundreds of metabolic processes without which you simply would not survive such as the creation of glucose from amino acids and other molecules when there is no glucose available in your environment all the blood that comes from your stomach and your intestines passes through the liver receiving a very high and constant flow of nutrients and also of molecules that it has to filter basically it is a filter just like the kidneys are also or act as a filter that keeps what is worth and discards what is not worth In this sense, it works hand in hand with these organs that I just mentioned, the kidneys, but also the The liver creates cholesterol from which important hormones are produced in your body, such as estrogens or testosterone. It also creates bile, without which you cannot digest food properly. It synthesizes key factors in your immunity. It is a very hard-working organ that we systematically mistreat with our lifestyle it is no coincidence that liver diseases were increasing their prevalence and incidence are increasing at a truly dizzying rate the truth is that you do not need green juices or rare top protocols to cleanse your liver all you need is not to interrupt its work with a bad diet or with toxins such as alcohol and now if we go with a selection of very interesting foods to maintain the health of your liver first olive oil in spain liquid gold and we do it for some reason compelling reason what I am going to tell you is counterintuitive or it can be but the fat of the olive oil especially the a extra virgin olive oil helps to eliminate fat from your life in some way the main fat in olive oil mufas monounsaturated fatty acids have an anti-inflammatory role improves the fat profile of the blood and reduces bad cholesterol all these actions they end up improving the health of your liver but also aside from the very fast ones, olive oil contains compounds such as oleuropein that protect against type 2 diabetes and I know I have yet to make a video with all the proven benefits of olive oil and we will do it very soon second food avocado and avocado oil when the liver begins to overload pse with fat several things occur that alter its ability to function the first is hepatic insulin resistance we always talk about insulin resistance in a general way throughout the body but insulin resistance manifests itself very differently in different organs when insulin resistance is present. insulin in the liver it cannot handle nutrients well and greatly increases inflammation oxidative stress in liver cells this study published in 2019 reminds us that avocado and avocado oil help the liver reduce inflammation oxidative stress and function mitochondrial, this in turn will improve resistance to hepatic insulin in the liver and will help to gradually mobilize the accumulated fats, yes, if the rest of the diet accompanies oily fish, if you have come this far, you will have realized that the Inflammation in the liver favors the accumulation of fat in this organ and also its worse functioning, as is normal , since in addition to the mufas of olive oil and avocado that we have just mentioned, there are other molecules that also help your liver in this sense and are omega 3 fatty acids present especially in oily fish the important thing about these molecules is that humans do not have the necessary enzymes as to introduce double bonds at the end of the car box and beyond carbon 9 the fatty acids that translate that for you, it is very easy that it cannot synthesize omega 3 fatty acids and therefore you have to take them from the diet, this is it review reminds us that omega 3 of marine origin improve liver health and help improve fatty liver so in any list of recommended foods for fatty liver or for any liver disease you will probably find oily fish for this reason blueberries there is a group of molecules present in various foods that have proven useful in improving liver disorders are polyphenols you will find many in coffee green tea in fruits and vegetables specifically we are now talking about red fruits and more specifically blueberries are not essential molecules for our survival or much less as some vitamins are but that does not mean that they are not important in fact most ia of benefits fruits and vegetables do not come because they have few calories or because they have a lot of fiber they are only due to these molecules the reasons that help us protect ourselves from oxidative stress and inflammation and the liver also benefits from this among the fruits with the most polyphenols the red fruits take the cake and among the red fruits the blueberries are probably the most interesting in addition to providing benefits to your liver improves cognitive functioning they provide very few calories and there are even works that suggest that they improve your health and we continue with coffee coffee when consumed regularly protects against different chronic non-communicable diseases fatty liver is just one of them those who drink three or more cups of coffee a day have a lower risk of suffering from fatty liver but not only fatty liver also this hepatitis is to say the next step in liver deterioration that also entails In addition to fat in the liver, liver inflammation is also related to the continued consumption of coffee, therefore, with less progression to cirrhosis and less risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, always avoid doses of caffeine greater than 400 milligrams a day because very high doses of caffeine will also cause you problems nuts if there is a vitamin that has been shown to be of interest in preventing or improving liver diseases it is vitamin e vitamin e is not a vitamin but a group of 8 vitamins that together are called tocopherol yes we have to summarize their functions in a single one, we must say that they are antioxidant molecules, that is their main function, their daily needs can be easily covered, which are around 12 milligrams a day with the diet, that is, if you include foods that are rich in this vitamin, you will have enough vitamin and for this reason supplementation is not necessary they are usually fatty foods remember that vitamins s fat-soluble are the and among these fatty foods nuts are loaded with vitamin almonds are probably the nut with the highest concentration of vitamin approximately 25 milligrams per 100 grams hazelnuts pine nuts pistachios peanuts all of them have a good amount of vitamin and remember that nuts are healthy and are recommended even though they provide a lot of calories, so include them in the diet in a reasonable amount in a reasonable intake pattern and according to your individual context today we have seen up to six foods perfect to take care of the health of your liver but the most important thing and as I said at the beginning is not to deteriorate it, so if you think, leave it in the comments below, we are going to make a second part with foods whose frequent consumption seriously harms the health of your liver	Success

NO TOMES VINAGRE DE MANZANA (GOMITAS) SIN VER ESTO	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qgZB3ENmnA	Dr. Borja Bandera 	apple cider vinegar gummies are very good but they help you lose weight they decrease your appetite they improve your digestion they strengthen your immunity they are antioxidants and improve metabolism they are different from taking vinegar alone in a salad for example here doctor borja bandera and welcome to the new video today we are going to do an analysis of this new way of taking different supplements so I combine the gummies as you also call them in some countries and we are going to focus on an old acquaintance of the channel apple cider vinegar therefore we will analyze apple cider vinegar gummies that have become very fashionable I don most widely used home remedies in the world it is used to help you lose weight weight to decrease appetite control glucose levels or even for cleaning it happens to him as bicarbonate is used for many things that yes with n different levels of evidence behind these indications or uses but apple cider vinegar gummies are useful for all this we are going to see it but before we remember what vinegar can really do for your health it is true that as we have seen in other previous videos apple cider vinegar has some benefits backed by science the vinegar product of the fermentation of apples is an acid solution whose main bioactive ingredient is acetic acid that is usually in a concentration between 3 and 5 percent in the solution this acetic acid is really responsible for most of its benefits and is found in any type of vinegar, not only in apple cider vinegar or apple cider vinegar, in addition, vinegar contains a series of flavonoids that are antioxidant compounds such as gallic acid catechins caffeic acid and ferulic acid but its benefits if we had to make a list are summarized in a better cont glycemic role this review of nine studies from 2021 reminds us that apple cider vinegar can lower your blood sugar and lower your glycosylated hemoglobin levels a marker used to assess mean glucose levels over the past 12 weeks also slightly improves oma and it is a marker of insulin resistance you already know that insulin resistance is not a good thing and what mechanisms are involved in this improvement first a delay in gastric emptying the stomach empties more slowly and this leads to a more progressive absorption of everything inside the stomach including carbohydrate sources also slightly improves the consumption of energy substrates such as fatty acids and glucose especially when you are in a caloric deficit increases lipolysis or release of fatty acids and glycerol from triglycerides stored in fat cells suppresses cne or glycogenesis and hepatic lipogenesis i.e. the formation of d e glucose and fat in the liver increases the secretion of insulin by your pancreas which, together with the improvement in insulin sensitivity that I just told you, helps to improve blood sugar levels, decreases lipids, that is, fats in the blood has a lipid-lowering effect apple cider vinegar lowers total cholesterol and also triglycerides in fact this review positions it as one of the nutraceuticals with the potential to improve the lipid profile in the blood all it achieves by increasing the production and excretion of bile acids that are substances present in the bile that are responsible for digesting fats for the formation of these bile acids we need cholesterol and we need fats and lastly but importantly and quite interestingly less appetite the delay of gastric emptying and a direct appetite suppressant effect of acetic acid make you feel less hungry throughout the day, which is why many take it on an empty stomach for intermittent fasting because it helps them reach the end of that fasting window without much appetite and finally there is a slight increase in fat loss derived from the previous points although do n gummies supplements in the form of gummies or gummies are gaining a lot of popularity all over the world we have most vitamins and minerals already in the form of gummies we have cb in the form of gummies or even melatonin and guaranda if you go to your trusted pharmacy you will see many of these supplements in online stores they continue to grow at a rapid rate few people like to stuff themselves with capsules or powders to ingest their supplements because this gives us a medicalized feeling that we are taking medications However, the jelly bean format gives us a different sensation and also who does not like a candy or a jelly bean but this has a c Now see how we will now see that it has some benefits when taking a supplement in the form of a jelly bean because we are going to try to make a breakdown of the main benefits if you can think of any other because you leave it below in the comments and I take this opportunity to recommend that you subscribe to the channel so that we have more and better videos, first of all, jelly beans have a pleasant taste and are easy to consume for most of you it will be much more pleasant to eat a sweet jelly bean than a glass of water with diluted vinegar many do not tolerate is the taste strongly acid of the vinegar so it is a more subtle and more pleasant way of taking it second point a protective effect on tooth enamel one of the few problems with apple cider vinegar, especially when taken directly and not diluted, is that it can damage tooth enamel and its consumption is high and extended over time as it is present in the jelly bean matrix and is progressively released we do not expose it directly to the digestive system, it adds the mouth and an effect that is also protective of the gastric mucosa, in the same way its release will be more progressive and it will not be as irritating for the stomach mucosa for most people, apple cider vinegar is good tolerated at the gastric level but some of you who already have previous gastric problems such as chronic gastritis an infection by helicobacter pylori acro lydia etc. so there is no discomfort when taking vinegar but this format does have some problems that must be mentioned let at least 2 grams of sugar per gummy in the brands I have reviewed depending on the dose required by the supplement in question and how many supplements you take a day you can easily end up adding the amount of free sugar present in for example a juice or a soft drink although of course there are also gummies with sweeteners some of which are more problematic that other second point klein or misleading and oversized claims most sellers of these supplements you can see they use klein as it supports normal energy metabolism it enhances your immune function that your heart gets a powerful antioxidant effect to be able to put these types of claims in the labeling and packaging add small amounts of vitamins such as vitamin b12, folic acid, vitamin c, which among their functions have the above, but of course they will not make any difference to your health unless you are initially deficient in one of these micronutrients, something that it is not so common third point the evidence on apple cider vinegar that I mentioned at the beginning of the video is not transferable to apple cider vinegar gummies this may be confusing to you but I am going to explain it one reason is sugar added that they usually carry and apple cider vinegar has been shown to improve the p academic profile but it has not been proven by the gummies with sugar and a little apple cider vinegar which in the end is what you are eating with these supplements in the same way as we will now see the dosage and the bioavailability of these products make the studies previously mentioned are not applicable to them let apple cider vinegar doses of approximately 15,000 are used and daily distributed throughout the day the majority of gummies have at most 1,000 milligrams that is to say one gram per unit by gummy which means that to take an equivalent dose you will have to eat 15 gummies a day in addition to spending a lot of money you will be adding a good amount of simple sugars or sweeteners daily and all under the belief that what it does is benefit to your health does not have to be this way the bioavailability of these supplements is unknown another problem with delicious gummies is that We don in the form of a capsule, powder or liquid, it has to be digested to be absorbed and reach the tissue in question so that it has a certain effect on the cells. Bioavailability measures this precisely, the amount of compound and the speed at which it reaches the therapeutic target, that is, the tissue on which it acts, while most brands allude to the fact that jellies improve the bioavailability of the compounds, there are no studies at the time of making this video that Support this, the bioavailability will be different for each molecule, we cannot compare sua ganda with melatonin with apple cider vinegar and I have found a study that defends a greater bioavailability with vitamin d3 gummies, eye compared to usual compounds of this vitamin, they are not compatible either with intermittent fasting unless they add sweeteners and not simple sugars always d I know that biology is not black and white and that taking a few calories during fasting will not change fasting physiology however if you eat a few sugar laden jelly beans in the fasting window then you cannot say that you are doing intermittent fasting Since simple sugars are powerful stimulators of insulin secretion, the main brake on fasting physiology is also not compatible with the ketogenic diet, except for the sweetened versions , for obvious reasons, even though some gummies are advertised as all gummies when their main ingredient It is glucose and sugar syrup, that is, sugar and sugar, and it would add an additional concern for those of you who are parents, and that is that in the hands of children they can be very dangerous, the little ones can confuse them with regular jelly beans and take a high and dangerous amount, in addition to the danger it will be different depending on which supplement falls into its maw but it is still a very real danger for those that you have human creatures with judgment yet to be formed and lastly they are expensive, for example if we take these jelly beans that provide a thousand milligrams for each one for each unit and bring the jar in 90 jelly beans because we see that each jar of 15 euros brings about 90 grams of apple cider vinegar or 90 milliliters and we turn it into milliliters a liter of apple cider vinegar is in the supermarket for two and a half euros so you can do your calculations and be careful here we have only analyzed apple cider vinegar gummies but there are many supplements that are offered in gummy format and some if they have their utility, it also remains to be shown if their bioavailability is better, is the same or is worse than other more common formulations, as a conclusion, apple cider vinegar as a nutraceutical or as a functional food has some benefits and can be useful if you know how to take it at the right dose and taking the necessary precautions, knowing its limitations and knowing how far does it go but this does not mean that apple cider vinegar gummies have the same benefits therefore so far it is still an expensive product with very good marketing and that is very attractive to the eye and the palate if you want us to review other supplements leave me in the comments below don appreciate your attention see you in the next video a big hug and continue empowering	Success

CBD: CÃ³mo Utilizarlo Para Vencer ANSIEDAD, INSOMNIO y ESTRÃS | GUÃA	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDD6QIMk-2A	Dr. Borja Bandera 	cb is a molecule present in the hemp plant and its use in conditions such as stress, anxiety, insomnia or pain has grown like wildfire in recent years today we are going to see what is cb from cannabis what is it for what forms There are different ones on the market, what is the optimal dose and its potential risks or side effects, if it has them, is it the acronym for cannabis yolki, it is a molecule present in the hemp plant, as I was saying, we have to differentiate it very well of another molecule called t hc which is the one that confers the psychoactive effects the one that really gets you high there are varieties of hemp with more dvd and others with much more thc the cb of does not have a psychoactive effect and therefore it does not get you high for the same reason it does not generate addiction although it can generate a certain tolerance that is to say that if you use it chronically at the same dose you will have fewer and fewer benefits in any case the first message of the video is the cb of it is not a drug it is not t hc doesn more not only does it not have a psychoactive effect but also cb blocks the effect of thc on the brain in some way it protects your brain from thc that in some countries tend to use varieties of hemp with a lot of thc but little cbd and for the extraction and commercialization of cbd, the opposite is usually used plants with a lot of cvd and little thc that are later purified to eliminate all the thc hemp seeds also have value nutritional due to its high protein content in fact more than a third of its weight is protein one of the foods of plant origin with the most protein in fact let years and this because it has several root causes first it is an effective molecule it is an effective supplement second it has fewer side effects than most psychoactive drugs used to treat medical ailments Similar and third, these psychoactive drugs are usually much more dangerous, although they do have an important role in many pathologies and you should not under any circumstances stop taking any psychotropic drugs without the approval of your doctor, in any case there are many people who begin to see in the cb of a less harmful alternative to drugs such as benzodiazepines that, although they are very effective, also have important problems such as the fact of generating addiction another important point is that the cvd legislation is different in each country in most countries it is a regulated supplement and is It can be consumed without problems, however in other countries it can only be used topically for the moment, that is why in this video we will only give general information about the molecule and its characteristics without giving specific recommendations for consumption since you can see us from more than 40 different countries worldwide and the legislation of each site should be reviewed the main therapeutic uses of cbd are the following anxiety and stress insomnia for conciliation and maintenance chronic pain muscle recovery after intense physical exercise and epilepsy in fact epilepsy is the pathology in which cvd has been studied most in depth although it is used for very specific forms of epilepsy and lex requested is the only drug approved for this purpose and those therapeutic effects are achieved by the cb of modulating what is known today as a 2 system today of a set of receptors distributed throughout the body that are responsible for maintaining your internal balance homeostasis regulating things such as pain, inflammation, appetite, mood and nerve transmission. If you like this topic and want more in-depth information on how cvd works, then I here, which is very interesting, what is the correct dose of cbd a One of the most recurring doubts is what dose of cbd is correct for me, the truth is that there is no universal answer for That depends on your weight of the formulation, the time you have been using it or the reason why you use it as you see in the following image if you weigh 80 kilos the optimal dose for a mild effect would be about 6 drops of a 15 percent oil of concentration of cbd and if it is not clear to you here you have a simple calculator to obtain your recommended dose based on some data that you are including if we have as an example this yields to 10% of nate close to the optimal dose in the case of a male of 80 kilos would be approximately 8 drops because we are talking about 10 percent concentration, and this specifically contains melatonin, a substance that is a synergistic supplement, cb, which is why it is especially useful for falling asleep and improving insomnia, but do not take it during the day because you are going to be sleepy the rest of the day and for the followers of this close channel there is a 15% discount on the price of the cart, use the code empower and you will have that discount ac It can be combined with other discounts on the web, something quite interesting because very often there are other discounts, you have the link in the description and different formulations above, another very frequent question is which form is the best, there are many and it is normal that doubts are generated capsules that are very easy to take and with a standard dose that does not give rise to mistakes, we have oils, which is by far the most widespread form because, well, because it has greater bioavailability since it is absorbed into the sublingual mucosa under the tongue, we have topical balms that They are usually used for joint or muscle pain and also for skin problems. However, the bioavailability with topical application is not so clear in any case if they exert a local anti-inflammatory effect and it is being studied, as I say, in skin pathologies. We also have jellies that are very good, but They have several risks, first of all, since they are very good, we tend to consume more of the dose and be careful with this and secondly that its bioavailability is not exactly known and also that the content of simple sugars that you add to your diet must be taken into account so as you can see each one has its advantages and disadvantages that have used it is clear in the comments what your experience has been it has been useful it has not been useful tell me potential risks the world health organization wrote a note in favor of cb about two years ago where it emphasized the absence of potential addictive of cb d that is to say it does not generate addiction and where its therapeutic uses were also recognized you have the note here you can read it in any case the side effects appear as always with the excess dose it can cause drowsiness headache nausea lethargy as well as apathy In some studies, a slight increase in liver enzymes has been shown with high doses used in pathologies, which must also be taken into account . In any case, the fact that we do not know of any more side effects to date does not mean that these do not exist, we are talking about a relatively new substance or supplement whose effects have been studied since and in which there are still many studies ahead, in any case, the data that we have to date because they seem quite encouraging and the therapeutic uses of cb continue to increase finally remember several precautions it is important a supplier that guarantees the absence of thc as do being camps that if you are pregnant you should not use cbd and that under I have not said it before and I repeat it, you can leave a psychiatric medication at your own risk since this is something dangerous and here is today second part, leave me a message in the comments big hug see you soon and continue empowering	Success
What Is The Best Magnesium Supplement? | Types Of Magnesium Supplements	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPXxZA0MgQA	Dr. Borja Bandera 	hi my name is quick where i pharmacist in today be answering the question what is the best magnesium supplement to take i going to go through a list of seven of them and for each of them i briefly describe it and give some pros and cons and also at the end i you my personal favorite which is not going to be included in d7 but i you why at the end before i delve any further though i just want to mention that sometimes we get too hung on which of my which magnesium to take my opinion personally is that any magnesium that you find is better than no magnesium at all so if the one that you really want to get or the one that is recommended for you you don find it or is too expensive don hung on the type of magnesium as long as you you that said the first one i talk about is magnesium citrate or citrate as some people pronounce it now magnesium citrate is a combination of elemental magnesium and citric acid the citric acid is a naturally occurring chemical in citrus fruits oranges tangerines you know things like that now some studies point to the fact that magnesium citrate is one of the most well absorbed magnesium preparations in other words it is very bioavailable so due to its high bioavailability magnesium citrate is typically used as for magnesium replenishment that is people who are low magnesium can be taken magnesium citrate as a replenishment the only disadvantage is that magnesium citrate tends to have natural laxative properties so you want to be careful if magnesium situates what you go with it may affect some people more than other people so if you are sensitive that is something that you need to know matter of fact in high concentrations magnesium citrate can be given as a laxative i people who are preparing to go have a procedure they give them a whole bottle of magnesium citrate to drink and it kind of cleans them out the second one on my list is magnesium glycinate now this is a combination between magnesium and glycine now glycine is an amino acid which is obviously required in protein synthesis it is found abundantly in putting rich foods such as fish dairy and meat now interestingly glycine by itself is used as a dietary supplement to help improve sleep and to manage a couple of inflammatory conditions such as heart disease and diabetes for that reason magnesium glycinate is promoted to help with anxiety depression insomnia and stress magnesium glycinate is also very well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract or from the digestive tract so it has a very high bioavailability the next one number three is magnesium l3 on it now magnesium health urinate is made by combining magnesium and compound called theronic acid now theronic acid is a breakdown product of vitamin c it that makes this also another one that is very well absorbed now one unique thing that magnesium healthier and it has is that its ability to cross what is called the blood brain barrier magnesium elferinate is the one that is able to concentrate the most in brain cells for that reason it is promoted for things that require brain function so for example cognitive function memory things are along those lines magnesium l3 on it tends to do or better slightly better than some of the other magnesium preparations just because of its ability to concentrate in the brain by crossing the blood-brain barrier number four is magnesium oxide now magnesium oxide is a combination of magnesium and oxygen now magnesium oxide is one of the most popular ones typically when you go to every grocery store every pharmacy that is the type that you going to see i actually did as i was preparing for this video took a look around my my local grocery store and all the magnesiums that they had on their shelf was magnesium oxide ironically it is the one of the least absorbed from the digestive tract that is it is very poorly absorbed now because it is so poorly absorbed from the digestive tract a lot of times you wouldn as the number one recommendation to replenish magnesium in other words if somebody that will not be the go-to magnesium it is used rather for short term for treating uncomfortable digestive symptoms such as heartburn indigestion and things of that sort but don what i said earlier any magnesium is better than no magnesium at all even though it has poor observability you are still going to absorb something so if that is the only one that you can lay your hands on or if that is the only one that you can afford please do just go for it and don and looking for all this uranium and glycinate if those are not available number five is magnesium malate now magnesium malate is a combination of magnesium and malic acid now malik comes from the latin word malam which means apple so you can you guess it is malic acid is found in high concentrations in fruits such as apples such as grapes watermelon and some vegetables such as broccoli magnesium malate is also very well absorbed and therefore is one of the recommended ones for improving magnesium in your system if you are magnesium deficient now there are some reports that magnesium malate is a little bit gentler on the stomach it has less of a laxative effect so if you particularly sensitive that may be the one to go for if it magnesium malate is sometimes promoted to help with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome number six magnesium turrets well this comes from a combination between magnesium and taurine which is also another amino acid now several studies show that plasma torrent concentration is inversely proportional inversely related to fasting blood sugar in people in other words the more taurine you have in your plasma the less you that reason magnesium thyroid has been promoted to diabetics to help minimize or slow down the progression of diabetes and also to help regulate their blood sugars now magnesium and taurine have also been demonstrated at least in rats to significantly reduce blood pressure so that is another potential benefit if that is what you what you need is if your need is to bring down your blood pressure magnesium taurine may be the one to go for number seven is magnesium sulfate which is a combination of magnesium sulfur and oxygen now this is what we normally call epsom salt now due to the very unpleasant taste of magnesium sulfate it is not a go-to medication but people generally don people rather use that as a soak so you soak you know tired so achy muscles to give you some relief it may also sometimes be included in some skin care products you know like lotions body oil things of that sort now there school of thought that believes that if you soak in epsom salts you absorb some of the magnesium through the skin to kind of help build up your magnesium levels in your body that is a school of thought but there is not definitive evidence that the amount that you absorb through your skin is enough to replenish your magnesium levels if you have magnesium deficient so no high level overview of the seven now this is my personal favorite and my personal favorite is actually what we call a triple magnesium complex why subtle for one when you can get three there magnesium product that combines the glycinate the citrate and the malate so you get the advantage of it being very well absorbed and all the other benefits that the malads the citric acid and the glycinate that i talked about also can fail on you so that is my personal favorite i magnesium products in the description below if you want to check it out but that particular one is also going to be on there if you want a combo high level overview of which magnesium to take i hope you found it beneficial if you did please give it a thumbs up stay blessed catch you on the next video	Success

CUIDADO?? Â¿Tienes Baja La TESTOSTERONA? ?? Â¡Tienes Que Conocer ESTO (Te Interesa)!????	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw-Ug8-m-iQ	Dr. Borja Bandera 	How do I know if I have low testosterone levels? What are the symptoms I should have if my testosterone levels are not adequate? If you are interested in these questions, this video will also interest you . medicine nutrition and exercise channel before we start talking about testosterone in today helps me a lot and if you love these videos hit the bell to keep you updated and receive notifications of video uploads uploaded that is done up to twice a week so you will miss the latest information on medicine nutrition exercise metabolism ok now yes guys we start we start talking about another hormone previously we have talked about prolactin a hormone also very controversial a hormone also that brings you many questions and many doubts but perhaps today is the main male hormone and as the main male hormone because it has actions actions that are very important that are essential okay we have both women and men testosterone androgens in general only that men have much higher concentrations of androgen then as summary of today how testosterone is produced where it is produced what mechanisms produce it because you have to be clear about it you have to be clear what is the mechanism of testosterone production to understand Well, what happens when there are not enough levels of androgens, then we are going to see what are the symptoms that a person who does not have adequate testosterone levels in this case, fundamentally men, we are going to talk about men, because what symptoms would a person with a deficiency syndrome feel? of androgens which is more prevalent than os p You think and then to finish we are going to see how this diagnosis of hypogonadism would be made badly in men or hydrogen deficiency syndrome, as it is usually called in English- speaking countries, so nothing, guys, we are going to start if you see me drop a gossip of sweat for Here it is that in July in Malaga it is a little hot, okay, let explained in other videos with other hormones, to have in mind three organs or three locations fundamentally, which are the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland and the peripheral glands, which in this case we are talking about testicles is worth it because they are the glands that concern us today the hypothalamus a region located at the base of the brain in this case has an important role because it secretes the hormone called g nr ho gonadotropin-releasing hormone of its acronym in English this that nh is released in pulses of 60 to 90 minutes is worth this means that it does not have a continuous secretion but that every 60 to 90 minutes there is a pulse of libe ration and this stimulates the anterior pituitary gland not to be confused with the eggs because it has egg shapes this gland is that curiosity that has to look like an egg but it is not a pituitary gland or pituitary gland which is also a man in the anterior part of the gland well there is a group of cells that produce under the stimulation of gn rh lh and efe s/a give it luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone well these hormones have a role on the testicles what is the function of the small testicles this has to be very clear then there are two there are two the first function of the testicles is the production of testosterone 32 but the second is spermatogenesis , that is, the production of spermatozoa, okay, they have two functions, therefore when we are going to have hypogonadism when the testicle does not fulfill either one or either another or none of the functions for which the testicle is designed either speaking of law efe sh la lh acting on some cells that in this case are the purple ones here called leidi cells produce testosterone are the leidy cells which, when the lh receptor binds to the androgen rector in this case to the testosterone receptor, testosterone is produced in these cells okay and there is another protagonist in the testicles which are the seminiferous tubules in the small seminiferous tubules it is produced under the stimulus of fs and testosterone spermatogenesis the production of spermatozoa so now we have how spermatozoa are produced how testosterone is produced and we are going to move on Let on to see, mainly, what are the symptoms and signs that occur in an androgen deficiency syndrome, well, we have already learned how the testicles produce both spermatogenesis and testosterone, but this testosterone does not act on all organs. In the same way, for example, in muscle and adipose tissue, testosterone acts as it does. As it is produced in the testicles, it is valid in its native form, it binds to the receptor called the android androgen receptor and does its action by increasing muscle strength, muscle mass, and decreasing adipose tissue . For example , in the brain and in the bone, testosterone needs to be converted by the aromatase enzyme to estrogen. Note how curious it is that testosterone is converted into estrogen to exert its action in some organs such as the bone, but I go further in the skin . hair and prostate testosterone requires its conversion by the enzyme 5 alpha reductase of hydro testosterone you will have heard of a family of drugs called 5 alpha reductase inhibitors the best known is finasteride there are others such as dutasteride but finasteride finasteride what it does precisely is to inhibit this enzyme that is why when there is an enlarged prostate prostatic hyperplasia c When there is hair loss , we men are left bald, okay, this drug is given, finasteride, which is at most a widely used drug, because it is for this reason and now we are going to talk about what symptoms a person would have, a man who you have low testosterone levels good because the symptoms are low sexual desire low libido fewer morning erections and choices in general but morning choices are pretty closely related to testosterone levels so you know morning choices are symptoms of men others because more non-specific symptoms perhaps like hair loss hair fat gain more fat especially fat in the gut okay and visceral fat okay fat that stays in the organs or between the organs would have difficulty concentration and civility okay we would also have a symptom a plus sign rather than p It can occur in this syndrome that if it is gynecomastia, it means the anomalous enlargement of the mammary gland in the male, the growth in the male of the mammary gland due to an imbalance, an imbalance between the androgens that have decreased and the estrogens that in In this case they would be on the rise, okay when this balance is unbalanced because gynecomastia can occur, it can even happen that the testicles decrease in size when they develop if we are outside, these would be the main symptoms that we should have if our androgen levels do not come back to normal if you feel any of these symptoms it may be due to this or a testosterone deficiency or it may not be due to something else it may be due to stress it may be due to another disease it may be its management we don to know that there are low levels of testosterone because they are the analytical determinations in Therefore , the diagnosis of an androgen deficiency syndrome of hypogonadism in men is made with analytical determinations. In this case, most clinical practice guidelines recommend up to three testosterone determinations separated in time with a difference of a few weeks between them low coupled with signs or symptoms of hypogonadism that we have just reviewed would be enough to diagnose hypogonadism hypogonadism that can be primary or secondary we will discuss this at another time and in another video okay this is how to diagnose it would do this would be the symptoms and the signs and this is how it would be produced, well, testosterone testicles, in agreement, very important, the class, today you are interested in this subject, in other videos in the future video, we can talk about the so-called testosterone replacements therapy, very fashionable, that is to say, the la replacement therapy that doctors do when we have a patient who has low levels it is testosterone to replace testosterone there are various routes of administration of exogenous testosterone injectables there are oral ones there are even angel patches we can discuss this in another video and above all we can discuss whether in older people or with a certain age where testosterone levels go down Already due to aesthetic or adequate physiological decline , replace those testosterone levels with exogenous testosterone, okay, this is a very controversial debate and one that is talked about a lot, so we can comment on it in another video, which would be what is my opinion of the crt, so without further ado guys I leave you here I leave you with this video leave me your doubts and your feedback in the comments see you in the next video do not forget to stop by instagram free daily content and peyton exclusive and weekly content a very strong hug that you continue well and continue empowering	Success
Â¡CUIDADO!?12 Signos POCO EVIDENTES de TESTOSTERONA BAJA ??Â¿CuÃ¡les tienes?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGQnFUmD0jc	Dr. Borja Bandera 	andropause is the logical physiological fall is that no and your lifestyle habits store more fat in the belly fat that is here I give you a key very much lower in relation to testosterone gynecomastia interesting and more kills today when the deficit exogenous testosterone are reduced to 0 important and it is not the same when testosterone you will realize and your testosterone levels are optimal from androgens as they age men symptoms of low testosterone from testosterone is produced in the visceral that will give you that appearance of when testosterone is low and the concentrations of fs will practically surprise that both a lot and a little will drop much more progressively and slowly adolescence or before completing adolescence there is a testosterone deficit in women they are usually related to estrogens they are high it can be producing potbelly however it is very common from 30 to 35 years old ahylh as I said the fs h is a low libido or trast orms of puberty these guys tend to look like gynecomastia which is the development of testosterone can produce symptoms for a short period of time so that that the arms and legs be mood while Hormone concentrations produced by the pituitary gland and testosterone deficiency occur at younger ages than their peers have mammary glands in men, which are sometimes very similar, also high, which is usually the problem, more bioavailability decreases, thinner, in general, because mass is the same for all men, so it is very important in production over months or even years, it is more of a solution to this problem, it is usually difficult to gain mass, too, we are talking about bones bones bones more progressively something that can cause frequent alarm muscle acne will be conspicuous by its absence so before you think about replacement therapies of is permatozoa process that is called surgery but if you want we can check the muscular despite doing a lot of exercise weak everyone talks about the muscle a lot about us and makes us look for menstrual irregularity progressive excess hair in the first case both thin arms thin legs and testosterone you have to do two sometimes and the characters fail spermatogenesis at the athletic level to the issue of gynecomastia and what can be done in relation to testosterone but the symptoms will be even more serious as well and the appearance of hair in typical areas solutions but we are facing a fall things first to see if it is really secondary sexuality such as the development of the abdomen with a lot of fat accumulation, they forget the role of testosterone and the level of performance we are going to have to do to improve it in another video there it is very frequent to find males also gaining mass you have a problem related to the physiological irremediable with our second largest cardiovascular risk the estrogens in the bone the hormones of a beard or a deeper voice but less strength but also less also a symptom that we have talked about muscle and weight or a change in the voice changes in mood we will have testosterone or not you have and second sex are very important when it comes to increased risk of heart disease habits can modulate this drop because in other videos it is very important that this happens only when that resistance deficit concentrations of towards a more serious tonality if you are in a mood more irritable a crooked mood of maintaining good bone health so much reviewing your habits today we talk about what testosterone happens before the door or testosterone below normal having low testosterone levels is video has helped you I really appreciate that erectile dysfunction as I explained in probably both assumptions have in the man as in the woman when they will result in a lower performance during the puberty during the as bad for the heart as having you share it thank you very much for being first although only one analysis it is very interesting to talk about the effects the sexual hormones fail the bone something true but today we know athletic in any sport the force the video erection is a phenomenon that we will see each other tomorrow a big hug and levels through the roof levels very pubertal development also have the one that weakens and appears in osteopenia that we can do a lot to reduce cognitive and behavioral of the requires some blood vessels you can tell how ours is very reduced and you will be able to raise to continue empowering low testosterone is going to increase us high which is what those who achieve testosterone when you have healthy nerves and hormones in the first and osteoporosis later if that decline in this key hormone total free and bio testosterone less weight than before or make lower testosterone bottoms are you using an exogenous testosterone to make the levels of inflammation the hormonal section the main one that can number of repetitions but also be irritable you have very low confidence do you want to talk about these two problems by modifying our habits kong for available we can suspect that there is muscle growth hypogonadism steroids sexual regulate aspects to fail is testosterone so if in another video we are also going to talk about it reduces cardiovascular resistance and some problem when we have one or the drop in testosterone levels in yourself you have low self-esteem hormonal disease characterized by a where it intervenes the immune system you suffer from this very frequent problem you will not notice that you get tired that you get tired with the decrease also associated with fertility problems but eye you really feel bad there are many men various of the symptoms and signs that you like inflammation when they are not deficiency of steroid production It is superfluous to check the levels of the much greater ease we will also have because low levels of testosterone do not age in muscle mass you think that I explain in today have testosterone available these hormones are older and do a study of the axis insulin resistance eye always does not necessarily cause bodybuilders who continue training at 60 I appreciate that you leave me down in those also with a low production deficit and they feel that way and do not think that hypothalamus pituitary with nadal this due to levels of inflammation which in turn infertility this is because the very important watch out for this because the comments if you are feeling some 65 years old lose the same sperm muscle mass or it is associated with a greater favors metabolic pathology as the production of spermatozoa may be due to a hormone and eye that the course is accompanied by a lack of low levels s of testosterone is of the following signs or symptoms the risk of having a problem that a man who stopped training those regulated by other hormones that is obesity or diabetes if the deficit is desire or libido that is also usually cardiovascular a heart problem and they relate to a worse functioning of irritability also occurs when 40 well obviously you do not think that one is produced at the pituitary level first that we are going to talk about today is a serious one and insulin is produced in a short period and with resistance to worry the man a lot there is also mainly the efe sh that yes when therefore it is something that you have to have a lot of definitive testosterone an increase in weight and the percentage of people who prioritize their rest do not smoke insulin which increases the risk of time the man can having to even pay a lot of attention because another symptom other signs or rather man who develops in a short time cardiovascular and metabolic and in the put us we have exogenous testosterone because of a low stress levels and a fat life you know that cardiovascular disease depressive symptoms or a change very hot flashes something very striking because it is not unexplained that testosterone influences women you will ask yourself are these the same what is very worrying what is the active sexual fall will have the same decline in health problem or for other reasons it is the number one killer disease that abrupt in his personality in his state one of the side effects much more on the way in which he stores we usually associate hot flashes to the male occurs from hair hair loss if these symptoms are different women also testosterone that a health worker should measure levels of frequent is the decrease in fat when it is low or very low losing hair faster than it has testosterone but they have at levels especially in women in times of peru sedentary or stressed and with obesity sperm touches

??Esto es lo que Ocurre en tu Organismo si tomas PROTEÃNA de SUERO a diario [Whey Protein]	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbtsLl4SFLM	Dr. Borja Bandera 	Few nutrients have generated as much controversy in recent decades as protein. I am sure that you have ever heard a friend or family member or even a health professional talk about how protein damages your kidneys or your liver and how dangerous it is to supplement tea with protein luckily it has happened to me because of these prejudices and myths that are less and less heard and today we know how much protein we need to take depending on our condition or context and how it can help us prevent or even improve different health problems Health today you are going to accompany me while I explain what happens in your body when you supplement with the most consumed supplement in the world, effectively, whey protein or whey protein, you will see that far from being a supplement for muscular gym people, whey protein can help in many ways that you probably don to know is is the protein of whey and where does whey protein come from it comes from milk milk is the raw material specifically from a part of the milk that is whey that is why it is called whey protein whey at first glance is a yellowish liquid that I put some photos of an unappetizing aspect, the truth be told, and how this whey is obtained, since a coagulant is artificially added to the milk, which is usually renin, renin is a coagulant and the milk is added and two parts of the milk are separated rennet or curd milk and whey rennet is rich in another very popular protein called casein and is the subject of another video we will talk about casein in another video while whey is rich in different proteins of high biological value not just one protein but several that are precisely those that make up whey protein or weight protein because whey is the same as way in later English through filtering processes industrial filtering processes This protein is converted into a powder in a power or powder that is added to your shakes, to water, to coffee, to yogurts and that is sold or in a jar that scares very large in the gym or in the online supplementation store or in the physical supplementation store but be careful, it is also sold in smaller bottles to hospitals and they are given to older people who have health problems or not older people, simply different people who need clinical supplementation and who are malnourished who have cancer or who have a pathology digestive therefore whey protein is a supplement used at all levels at the hospital level at the outpatient level in people of all ages in different pathologies and yes also in sports supplementation for sports purposes most of you will know whey protein as a sports supplement that is taken with the aim of gaining muscle mass but it goes much further as you are going to see in this video for a moment or a moment a moment I remember you I remember you with great enthusiasm that you already have available the first training in the power academy new tools in fat loss and obesity a training that you are going to love made with great love made with great enthusiasm really give it a take a look because I leave you below in the description the link through which you can access well now we have to delete this because you have already found out where the subject comes from and we are going to continue digging to see let but it is not inferior either I want you to take this into account that argument that the protein in the jar is false it is a false protein and the true protein is the protein of chicken and pork and beef and egg that argument is as valid as the argument of the gym hunk that tells you that you have to drink 7 protein shakes to gain muscle mass, that is, the quality of a p is false Protein is based on a concept that I have already used in other videos that I call biological value, which is the biological value of a protein, since it is a parameter that takes into account the amino acid profile of the protein and the amount of essential amino acids it has, as well as its digestibility . and ease of absorption if all these parameters are computed and a value is given to the protein or protein source, the higher the value, the better the quality of that protein so that you can get an idea of \\u200b\\u200bthe biological value of egg protein whole egg and white the whole egg is 100 and is taken as a reference but whey protein has a biological value above 100 therefore it is a very high quality protein it is irreplaceable it is not completely necessary because luckily for most no but it is useful in certain occasions of course and those are the situations that we are going to see situations in which whey protein can help you you may know the first two you were because they are the most frequent but stay until the end because well because the last five weeks we started with the first one which is hypertrophy hypertrophy increase in muscle mass in the context of a caloric surplus this as I say is the most frequent use of protein from whey help the muscle to grow for the muscle cell to grow a process must occur within the muscle cell that is called mps or muscle protein synthesis in English it is an acronym that is contrary to mb or more the pro team breakdown basically breakage or degradation better said muscle protein whey protein stimulates this the mps muscle protein synthesis in the first place stimulates a series of anabolic proteins that as a whole we will call m2 although for this to happen you need to be in caloric surplus super skillful caloric what it means is to solve habitat logical because having a surplus of energy to be used is a surplus of energy in the construction of muscle, which is a very costly process, there is an amino acid present in whey protein and in many other sources of protein, which is leucine. Leucine is the main, although not the only one, responsible for this powerful stimulation of the mps by the whey protein. whey so point number one finished let that without physical exercise you can take all the protein you want all the whey protein you want that protein will not be used to build muscle but to generate glucose or for other maintenance functions so train strength and now guys we go to the second point the second point which is to avoid muscle loss especially in hypocaloric diets and this is very important another lesser known function of protein is to prevent lose muscle to see if you are overweight and obese and want to lose 10 15 or 20 kilos the best thing you can do or one of the best things you What you can do in the field of nutrition is to increase the protein content of your diet. This is so because protein firstly helps to reduce your appetite and keeps you satiated. Secondly, protein is difficult to transform into fat. Our metabolism has a hard time transforming it into fat. but third point preserve your muscle your lean mass in any weight loss diet we also lose muscle and this is disastrous and misleading misleading because you can be very happy when you get on the scale and see that you have lost weight or that you clap well but what if you I say that up to a third of that weight can be muscle point 2 disastrous because it is well known that less muscle makes it easier to regain lost weight so the stricter the diet you are following and the fewer calories it has , the more important it is will be to add protein to it the problem is that when we talk about high amounts of protein such as 2 grams per kilo of weight and day to day something that is not unreasonable if you are on a hypocaloric diet because it is very difficult to take it only with food and followed by whey protein very comfortable due to its easy administration it is very convenient it is very comfortable it is easy to take third point third use avoid sarcopenia in advanced ages and that of sarcopenia if you are like most identify protein as a supplement for strong young people but what if I told you that supplementation with whey protein makes more sense in older people than in young people your schemes have been broken, right? my arguments are as follows pay attention as we get older we develop what is known as your anabolic existence not diabolical anabolic resistance which means that we need higher and higher anabolic stimuli to gain or not lose muscle anabolic resistance is intrinsically linked to inflammation low-grade chronicle as shown by this figure so interesting also this It is associated with another fact, we lose appetite as we get older for many different reasons and that are beyond the reason for this video, but as we get older we have less appetite and many times we have less desire for protein foods. The conclusion is that many older adults do not even far from protein recommendations, which accelerates the loss of muscle mass and makes us reach a very problematic situation earlier, which is sarcopenia. Zarco means meat and bread and a deficit, therefore, a deficit of muscle mass that is related to more falls. hospitalizations less force and more risk of death from any cause therefore it is a problem and it is also a problem that we can prevent the health muscle do not forget we delete we delete we delete we delete we delete we delete and we go with point number 4 and point number 4 is going to surprise you I was surprised I hope that you also have an anti-oxidant effect that we have quite good In association with the idea that eating fruit and vegetables, for example, has an antioxidant effect, but whey protein is voted so strongly there in the pot that it has an antioxidant effect, well, if whey protein has an antioxidant effect, it is quite interesting because It contains an amino acid called cysteine \\u200b\\u200band cysteine \\u200b\\u200bis a precursor of glutathione, which is one of the most powerful antioxidants that we have in the body. You can find cysteine \\u200b\\u200bin other sources of protein, of course, or even by supplementing tea with n-acetylcysteine, but you will also find it in whey protein this can be very useful even in patients with fatty liver because it reduces the amount of fat in the liver and decreases transaminases in the blood test, which is an analytical parameter that rises when we have an excess of fat in the liver and the liver can even become inflamed point number 5 better control of appetite decreased ghrelin as I have com In other videos , maintaining high levels of satiety is key is key when it comes to losing weight is key when it comes to not gaining it satiety levels are controlled by countless hormones but one of the most important is called ghrelin ghrelin it increases when, well, when we have n eating. It tells our central nervous system that we are already full, that we are just going to have energy, to interpret and know how to modify these hormones. it is key it is key to long-term success and as you can see losing weight is much more than counting calories in and calories out much more complex point number 6 decreases intestinal permeability things are getting interesting with this whey protein intestinal permeability can be reduced by whey protein supplementation because whey protein has an amino acid that is called glutamine a large number of diseases begin in the digestive tract this is a great truth many authors think that everything begins with a loss of the barrier function that our digestive tract exerts if you have noticed the digestive tract is a barrier between the outside our environment and our body our body and prevents at all times the entry into our blood of different problematic compounds such as bacterial elements that trigger inflammatory responses in the body and that would be the prelude to other chronic diseases and management of difficult prevention and complicated treatment whey protein can decrease look at this study intestinal permeability they gave 0.5 grams per kilogram of weight which is about 40 grams of whey protein for someone weighing 80 kilos daily for a month these patients were crohn characterized by high permeability Intestinal bility and it was seen how this intestinal permeability improved at the same time that the biopsy that was done to these patients improved as it said this improvement is mainly due to glutamine an amino acid that can be supplemented separately and that gives food has a tropic effect on the cells of the digestive tract and finally boys 7 and we finish better muscle recovery after intense training the better we recover our muscular system after training less than that from injury we will have more performance we will achieve after intense training it is obvious that our muscular strength decreases our physical performance due to fatigue in the central nervous system due to muscle micro-injuries that will have to be repaired due to local changes in the muscle vascular alterations etc etc etc this can be minimized if they can be minimized whey protein reduces post-workout strength loss how did i get it Well, it seems that it achieves it by reducing fatigue at the level of the central nervous system, which is the one that really has control of muscle strength, but it also achieves it in other ways that are even beginning to be studied now, increasing glutathione levels, we have seen it before increasing the ease with which oxygen is transported in your blood vessels and also helping to repair those micro-injuries that occur in training	Success

CUIDADO?? Â¿Tienes Baja La TESTOSTERONA? ?? Â¡Tienes Que Conocer ESTO (Te Interesa)!????	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw-Ug8-m-iQ	Dr. Borja Bandera 	How do I know if I have low testosterone levels? What are the symptoms I should have if my testosterone levels are not adequate? If you are interested in these questions, this video will also interest you . medicine nutrition and exercise channel before we start talking about testosterone in today helps me a lot and if you love these videos hit the bell to keep you updated and receive notifications of video uploads uploaded that is done up to twice a week so you will miss the latest information on medicine nutrition exercise metabolism ok now yes guys we start we start talking about another hormone previously we have talked about prolactin a hormone also very controversial a hormone also that brings you many questions and many doubts but perhaps today is the main male hormone and as the main male hormone because it has actions actions that are very important that are essential okay we have both women and men testosterone androgens in general only that men have much higher concentrations of androgen then as summary of today how testosterone is produced where it is produced what mechanisms produce it because you have to be clear about it you have to be clear what is the mechanism of testosterone production to understand Well, what happens when there are not enough levels of androgens, then we are going to see what are the symptoms that a person who does not have adequate testosterone levels in this case, fundamentally men, we are going to talk about men, because what symptoms would a person with a deficiency syndrome feel? of androgens which is more prevalent than os p You think and then to finish we are going to see how this diagnosis of hypogonadism would be made badly in men or hydrogen deficiency syndrome, as it is usually called in English- speaking countries, so nothing, guys, we are going to start if you see me drop a gossip of sweat for Here it is that in July in Malaga it is a little hot, okay, let explained in other videos with other hormones, to have in mind three organs or three locations fundamentally, which are the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland and the peripheral glands, which in this case we are talking about testicles is worth it because they are the glands that concern us today the hypothalamus a region located at the base of the brain in this case has an important role because it secretes the hormone called g nr ho gonadotropin-releasing hormone of its acronym in English this that nh is released in pulses of 60 to 90 minutes is worth this means that it does not have a continuous secretion but that every 60 to 90 minutes there is a pulse of libe ration and this stimulates the anterior pituitary gland not to be confused with the eggs because it has egg shapes this gland is that curiosity that has to look like an egg but it is not a pituitary gland or pituitary gland which is also a man in the anterior part of the gland well there is a group of cells that produce under the stimulation of gn rh lh and efe s/a give it luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone well these hormones have a role on the testicles what is the function of the small testicles this has to be very clear then there are two there are two the first function of the testicles is the production of testosterone 32 but the second is spermatogenesis , that is, the production of spermatozoa, okay, they have two functions, therefore when we are going to have hypogonadism when the testicle does not fulfill either one or either another or none of the functions for which the testicle is designed either speaking of law efe sh la lh acting on some cells that in this case are the purple ones here called leidi cells produce testosterone are the leidy cells which, when the lh receptor binds to the androgen rector in this case to the testosterone receptor, testosterone is produced in these cells okay and there is another protagonist in the testicles which are the seminiferous tubules in the small seminiferous tubules it is produced under the stimulus of fs and testosterone spermatogenesis the production of spermatozoa so now we have how spermatozoa are produced how testosterone is produced and we are going to move on Let on to see, mainly, what are the symptoms and signs that occur in an androgen deficiency syndrome, well, we have already learned how the testicles produce both spermatogenesis and testosterone, but this testosterone does not act on all organs. In the same way, for example, in muscle and adipose tissue, testosterone acts as it does. As it is produced in the testicles, it is valid in its native form, it binds to the receptor called the android androgen receptor and does its action by increasing muscle strength, muscle mass, and decreasing adipose tissue . For example , in the brain and in the bone, testosterone needs to be converted by the aromatase enzyme to estrogen. Note how curious it is that testosterone is converted into estrogen to exert its action in some organs such as the bone, but I go further in the skin . hair and prostate testosterone requires its conversion by the enzyme 5 alpha reductase of hydro testosterone you will have heard of a family of drugs called 5 alpha reductase inhibitors the best known is finasteride there are others such as dutasteride but finasteride finasteride what it does precisely is to inhibit this enzyme that is why when there is an enlarged prostate prostatic hyperplasia c When there is hair loss , we men are left bald, okay, this drug is given, finasteride, which is at most a widely used drug, because it is for this reason and now we are going to talk about what symptoms a person would have, a man who you have low testosterone levels good because the symptoms are low sexual desire low libido fewer morning erections and choices in general but morning choices are pretty closely related to testosterone levels so you know morning choices are symptoms of men others because more non-specific symptoms perhaps like hair loss hair fat gain more fat especially fat in the gut okay and visceral fat okay fat that stays in the organs or between the organs would have difficulty concentration and civility okay we would also have a symptom a plus sign rather than p It can occur in this syndrome that if it is gynecomastia, it means the anomalous enlargement of the mammary gland in the male, the growth in the male of the mammary gland due to an imbalance, an imbalance between the androgens that have decreased and the estrogens that in In this case they would be on the rise, okay when this balance is unbalanced because gynecomastia can occur, it can even happen that the testicles decrease in size when they develop if we are outside, these would be the main symptoms that we should have if our androgen levels do not come back to normal if you feel any of these symptoms it may be due to this or a testosterone deficiency or it may not be due to something else it may be due to stress it may be due to another disease it may be its management we don to know that there are low levels of testosterone because they are the analytical determinations in Therefore , the diagnosis of an androgen deficiency syndrome of hypogonadism in men is made with analytical determinations. In this case, most clinical practice guidelines recommend up to three testosterone determinations separated in time with a difference of a few weeks between them low coupled with signs or symptoms of hypogonadism that we have just reviewed would be enough to diagnose hypogonadism hypogonadism that can be primary or secondary we will discuss this at another time and in another video okay this is how to diagnose it would do this would be the symptoms and the signs and this is how it would be produced, well, testosterone testicles, in agreement, very important, the class, today you are interested in this subject, in other videos in the future video, we can talk about the so-called testosterone replacements therapy, very fashionable, that is to say, the la replacement therapy that doctors do when we have a patient who has low levels it is testosterone to replace testosterone there are various routes of administration of exogenous testosterone injectables there are oral ones there are even angel patches we can discuss this in another video and above all we can discuss whether in older people or with a certain age where testosterone levels go down Already due to aesthetic or adequate physiological decline , replace those testosterone levels with exogenous testosterone, okay, this is a very controversial debate and one that is talked about a lot, so we can comment on it in another video, which would be what is my opinion of the crt, so without further ado guys I leave you here I leave you with this video leave me your doubts and your feedback in the comments see you in the next video do not forget to stop by instagram free daily content and peyton exclusive and weekly content a very strong hug that you continue well and continue empowering	Success

How Graham Stephan makes $4,578,896.32 a year on YouTube	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3Sz1SQfqHY	Dr. Borja Bandera 	i gotta add it up probably somewhere between like four and a half five five and a half somewhere around there five and a half million yeah total last year amazing um wow [Music] graham i want to say something cool that what of the table is something colin i together for 10 years we coffee every single day until we went on your show amazing now we you how is it you it invest in bitcoin what are you going to do with all yeah and bitcoin is going to go to 500k so you we there we go well congratulations so i don than buying coffee but i think i think it can be yeah it certainly can be hopefully yeah yeah we good it brought mine from home i put it in the starbucks cup is like just a funny little thing i got this as a gift uh like it a gag gift but uh i love it amazing well what first of all it was amazing how we ended up running into each other but it turned out that we were like neighbors just ran into each other here um on the street which was awesome uh but we we like we were big fans of your channel and then you actually commented on our channel and we were like sharing it on our our slack we were like well this is crazy graham stephen he commented on our channel uh and ran into you like very short after that yeah but you are someone who has cracked the code of youtube in a way that i think is um very unique to our experience of being on youtube in 10 years and also something that inspirational and aspirational for a lot of people who are watching um now that is from the youtube creator side but also the financial literacy and financial freedom side so you kind of you kind of hit our generation you know and and younger people than us in both ways of like aspiring creators and and wanting this job of being a youtuber but then also wanting this financial freedom and and to better understand their own finances so thank you jeez thank you so much yeah that good introduction uh check out graham welcome to the show graham thank you so much i probably like a year and a half so i feel like i since like pre-20k pre like 30k oh wow so yeah you filming is incredible i think the editing is insane like i look at your videos and i i make mine better right so thank you yeah well i think we look at your videos and think man how can we do that how can we just make it catchy or how can we click date and how can we make how can we make that type of adsense money yeah one thing we really bad at is telling people to like the video but you maybe you could tell some people here how you do it yeah you look everyone right in the camera okay you want a quick pause and you want to say guys make sure to destroy the like button for the youtube algorithm otherwise youtube this video and if you want it pushed you just gotta go down smash like button takes like a fraction of a second it totally free and you got to throw up a cool picture of a cat right here because that you got to give them a reward so if you throw a cool like just a cute picture of a cat right here everyone like button wow it feels like the scene in wolf of wall street where they watching leonardo dicaprio sell the penny stock and they do that yeah that well you got to give them a reward so if i ask for something i give you something back i did like a a cute iguana poppies kittens stuff like that always does really well but yeah i i do think you way that not overly uh salesy and it like one one thing i really like when i watch your videos is like you actually give me a really good reason to want to comment and and like yeah so i think you do a great job with that my favorite to take forever is i fake news articles about like how 90 of the audience doesn right and i cnbc and i crying and then the headline is like 90 don smash the like button please do your part like something like that or i made like fake little commercials and clearly a lot of that stuff is uh has worked for you i mean one thing that i watched your video you put out in october about how much money youtube paid you yeah um there numbers in there for me um you know obviously the big one being 1.8 million dollars uh more than that yeah if you get into the actual number which is probably on the screen um but then you go down to like six to ten thousand dollars a day through adsense revenue um all the way down to your first year on the platform twenty six thousand dollars that like colin and i just we just put out a video on our on our channel about how much youtube paid us in 2020. and it uh i away i want to give it away uh so you could guess at some point but um i kind of just gave it away that it not twenty six thousand dollars but you you seemed to figure out youtube in a way that um is is really dynamic from a financial perspective now to go even further back you at a pretty young age were also working a pretty high profile job in real estate you were making about half a million dollars a year on commission yep so take us through that how do you how do you even get that job and then why would you leave that why do you leave that job yeah good question so i agent since 2008 got in because i didn i really didn i i during high school i thought like i wanted to be a drummer i realized like you go to the rock scene you see these like amazing musicians on sunset boulevard and they their van and there musicians out there it monetize so i knew that like i wanted to be in a business of some sort and just music was probably not it happened to get my real estate license every sunday i just meet with different agents just to get their opinion on like what i should do is like a brand new agent after months of doing that i met someone who really just took me under their wing uh who basically said to me like we could we that you bring in but i will teach you like if you need help with a client or something i to split everything 50 50. so i would go and sit as open houses i would just do like the grunt work i would follow up with his clients that he just you you have a big list of people you haven he start calling these people so i did a lot of that worked leases and as far as how i got into the oppenheim group 2010 i think it was jason oppenheim joined coldwell banker and his office was right next to mine and he just asked me questions a lot uh he would ask me a question about like doing leases or for paperwork he was a brand new agent and at the time i had like two years of experience on jason so i think i was just more approachable like he i don going to like the manager and it especially if i he this or i move-in lease application what do i do on this and i just we talked and we became friends through that then he left uh to start his own brokerage i think 2013 we lost touch a little bit but then in 2014 i think just randomly did a deal with him and he was opening up his new office on sunset boulevard and i met him at the office to pick up the check and at that point he offered me a position to go and work for him instead of call the banker and the offer he gave me was way better than what i was getting at coldwell banker and i think i was just starting to outgrow coldwell banker to begin with i wanted to try something new and i felt like that was a good opportunity and once i joined with him i mean everything just i think just being around a new environment that was younger really helped me out a lot because coldwell banker like everyone i was working with was over like 50. the entire office was like 50 55 60 65 70 years old with jason everyone was like mid-30s for the most part so i just i felt like i fit in a lot better uh but that that just really started taking off i 2015 16 17 18. my businesses did so well i think a lot of people were spending way more money on on real estate then and yeah my best year was about 500 000 i think that was 2017 or 18 and that was around the time too i started making youtube videos and originally i had so many people tell me like dude you should just do youtube full-time just do youtube full-time and it do it and i remember even posting on reddit back then like talking about me doing youtube and me saying like i know it make as much as i make on as a real estate agent but i having so much fun with it and that was like my creative outlet like i would do real estate until like 6 7 pm get home and make youtube videos until like 2 o loved it like all day i would just think youtube like how can i make youtube videos even like showing around clients sometimes like hmm what video can i make here or like what topic can i talk about during open houses if you go to my earlier videos you i was making youtube videos on like how to hold an open house at an open house that just you have down time sometimes it it house i done were you watching youtube at this time like who who were you watching what was the inspiration for you i watched everybody i 2010 maybe to even to like 2009 2010 as like full-time instead of tv i would go and watch youtube and so i would see just all these channels start like blowing up and back then it was a lot of the prank channels like you vitali or roman atwood uh uh and all these these other creators that were just blown up in the prank space and i didn just thought like youtube is so cool like i would love to make youtube videos one day was there an element of like i could get my rockstar fix on youtube because i think it like for you you actually grew up you wanted to be a musician on the sunset strip like playing shows then you go into the oppenheim group which ended up having a huge show that was that was by chance yeah but and that was many years later um i would say probably not i just had so much fun for me it was very much like i think it like i like the numbers aspect and i like the challenge and i feel like with youtube or really with with anything business in general it playing a game of chess and like you could make a move and like the algorithm will shift this way and you or like what are people clicking on let me do more of that and if it doesn work i shift it up a little bit i test titles and thumbnails and i love every aspect of that same i used to be the same way i used to post leases on craigslist and this is how i got most of my business i treated craigslist the same way i treat like the youtube algorithm i would come up with different titles different main pictures different layouts of like putting my phone number at the top putting like graham stefan coldwell banker versus just like call graham i found that just call graham number got a better response than call graham stefan or call graham stefan coldwell banker just call graham i guess it was more approachable uh and i experimented with with titles so much like i found like back years ago on craigslist you could do like html so i was doing like html and craigslist and i found for the title too you get these cool little brackets on either end like these these dark brackets on either end that just stood out so when you scrolling you would automatically see my post is the one with the two big bold brackets on either end and i also got they used to allow all this cool stuff i got like a link tracker where i could track which titles got the most clicks which price ranges got the most clicks and then after like a week or two i would analyze that date and be like okay the lease is between the 5 000 and 10 000 price point per month got the most clicks i and just get more leases like that i go to my office i try to find someone else where i could post their leases on craigslist that fit that criteria and that business but a lot of it is just very anal analytical and just trying to figure out like what works so when you first started making youtube videos how did you catch a level of momentum like was it fun from the first upload yep it was so first upload yeah it a couple hundred people watch and yeah at first no i posted my first video no one watched but then what i did is i tried to figure out well how can i get people to watch the video so i to other people spam the comments but i would comment and i you know just be there on my phone like just during all my down time just commenting on other channels like hey this is a great youtube video i made something similar if anyone is curious so i got started come check out my channel and this is before like a lot of other people were doing it so it was like i feel like oh wow he makes a video about it let me click it and so i got a few hundred views on that initially uh but like every view for me like i checked the real time 60 minutes all the time we watching me this hour like this is crazy like one per stranger is watching me and i remember a check i had all my notifications turned on uh for email so if i got a comment like it would send to my email i got a subscriber it would send my email i got so excited when you got that emails like you got a new subscriber i was like wow that crazy i wanted to reach out and thank everybody i subscribing but yeah i had so much fun with it from the very beginning you do kind of get jaded over time which is so interesting because i uh a couple years ago i was at a concert here at the uh at the forum in la and it was packed and i was like oh wow this is crazy there crazy to perform for this many people and then i looked up what it was like 19 000. and i was like wait a second i performed for this many people you just don they get jaded at some point of like these numbers on a screen yes because even if you you people it would be insane you yeah whoa this is a lot of fun i would freeze up yeah there talking to so at what point did the videos go from okay this is cool one person me um two whoa okay this is really like catching momentum was there a certain type of video or was it just gradual over time it was pretty gradual um i would say the first almost two years there was never really any sort of like viral hit i had videos do well and by well i mean like a few hundred thousand views uh but i didn think there were like four or five videos on my channel that would consistently bring in the views and that was one was like how i got into real estate uh passive income how to turn one dollar into ten dollars and uh gosh i how to house hack and live for free and those videos really i think i think pulled the weight of the channel for the for the first probably year or so and when did monetizing those videos come onto your radar i know for us we really didn channel until two and a half years in like at what point for you was that interesting and intriguing in the beginning i didn all because when i first started the big guys in the business were like grant cardone tai lopez and gary vee right and they were running ads on their channel and tai lopez was selling non-stop and so was grant cardone tai lopez was running tai lopez right yeah and i think even alex becker in the beginning but i really i i love dallas i love alex becker so i looked up to him so i don category as the other guys but uh because i really respect alex but i looked at uh like tai lopez and grant and i they wanted to be the guy who just giving free advice and if someone wants to watch great if not that but after maybe two months of doing that i youtube is more likely to push the videos if they youtube has a stake in these videos doing well and if youtube is making money i making money maybe they to push the videos so like from that standpoint i let me turn on adsense and i think the first few days made like a few cents i remember the first day i hit a dollar that was a big day because i like every month i could go and get all-you-can-eat sushi for 30 bucks for free and i remember hitting uh like 75 bucks in a month i like wow my my cell phone bill is like totally free just for having fun making youtube videos and then i had one day i think where one of my videos took off i made 172 dollars i think it was or 168. and that was the first day i is serious like this could really add up to a significant amount of money especially if it videos on the side extra 160 dollars in a day that that huge and that like okay i should take this more seriously and i think i just you just have like this gut level feeling that this is it i just i knew from the very beginning it i gotta pursue this this is a big opportunity what did the the other agents or like people at the oppenheim group think about you doing youtube and then did any of your clients or people that like you showed were they like hey are you the guy from youtube did that ever come up no it didn was weird in the beginning because i don with with youtube and i think there stigma of just like youtube what you make money doing that what so the push i got was that i should let that be a side thing i should focus on real estate the real estate career was was doing the best it like eight years into it i think at the time maybe like almost oh no i was almost 10 years into this career as a real estate agent and that like solidify yourself like as an agent like you this client base and like every year is doing consistently better than the last so the push that i definitely got was like stick with real estate like why would you leave this career in real estate to make youtube videos but i just had a feeling i i just i knew deep down that like i gotta pursue this and that every day that pulled me further and further away from real estate because i had so much fun i felt like good at it i felt like i had a purpose and a passion and that i was making a positive impact and not that you can estate agent but like it between like you and your client versus this you could have such a big impact on you know thousands or tens of thousands or millions of people that otherwise wouldn possible if it estate so where was your channel at when you made that more aggressive sort of departure from real estate almost a million subscribers okay yeah it got when i consistently started making more money on youtube than working as a real estate agent that i really need to focus on this more and there was never like a big like one day i estate one day doing youtube it was so gradual and that was like that was over a period of probably two and a half three years where it like just an extra five minutes on youtube extra five minutes on youtube and it was very gradual it was never just one day nothing but um but there was one moment that really kind of kicked it off for me and uh it was during a time i was really busy trying to get out a video on like a current subject and a client called me wanting to see this apartment building for sale it was like a 4 million apartment building so like it was a big commission so i scheduled the showing in the middle of the afternoon in like la traffic so i it there 35 minutes for a showing 40 minutes to drive back so there you know two and a half hours of my day gone during a time i like really had to get this video out and i show up early and the guy showing and and uh shows up an hour late is on his phone the entire time doesn even talk to me just on his phone just kind of doing his thing and i there and being like i gotta get this video out and he basically takes a look around and said not you know it and uh you know can we can we go and see this other place like down the street and i i don it at that point but i i i can if you and not apologize or not and there good reason it was just like just running behind didn to let me know he dropped him as a client but that was a sign for me that like if i about not posting video like that should really be where my priority is wow yeah that um that is a very la story that ever like you especially if there quick aside you las vegas yeah you back to do this yeah yeah so we talked about this a lot yeah we were talking about this this morning like everyone i mean i uh here you are as well i and i you know why do we have to be here do it i as of when was it monday yeah so just just a few days ago i officially became a brand new resident of nevada if you follow graham on instagram you the breaking news there yep that thank you that was it was amazing it such a good thing yeah like once you get into this echelon of of earning it i mean i i just heard logan paul talk about it on impulsive he was like i want to get out um all like it does seem like at some point you this doesn the pandemic probably exposed a lot of it yeah um it experienced it enough compared with uh like west l.a but i now prefer i think las vegas wow it it you know santa monica is like so nice yeah but i don about it that i just love i really like it there parking is free huge parking lots everywhere anything you want is within like a 10-minute drive the land you get the house you get like everything is cheaper that you got yeah is another jaw drop like there lot of videos i watch of yours where i just like text colin and i you like this is insane did you watch this like what are we doing what are we doing what are we doing next happens a lot all the time okay and you don other people too much and compare yourself right but but i i guess it that i do the same thing i look at other people i i kid you not i think there that like you somebody so did that and and that on that no did that ever happen in youtube was there ever a moment of doubt like as you were progressing as you started uploading as you got to this point of a million subscribers were you ever like what am i doing with this youtube channel no no you were always just like this is the right path yeah were there people encouraging you along the way or you were just like you very few only the people on youtube were really encouraging me it was difficult to get anyone to encourage me who was not on youtube youtube people got it youtube people have been encouraging me since like 50 000 subscribers i have a buddy his name is f spot eff spot on youtube he do youtube full time since like 20 000 subscribers uh and it took me till really a million to do it but everyone in youtube has been encouraging everyone not on youtube has just been like could go away and they still have that mindset that like any day could go away so like mentally i prepared for that for years it just seems like every year so far has done better but yeah and one thing that me is that at a pretty early stage um you were able to open up other revenue streams as well based on your audience and that is something that i think we like colin and i we sold an online course last year we started getting into like different forms of of uh monetization of our audience but you actually started a course like pretty like within a year or two right of course i waited until i hit 100 000 subscribers to sell anything so prior to 100 thousand it was just youtube ad revenue there nothing else um actually maybe amazon affiliates but i think maybe that did like a few hundred a month the most pretty good like we were just looking at there threat on twitter of uh ali abdul seen that one i did super it hour-long video yeah yeah i i read the thread yeah video but it pretty amazing to see like really how diversified creators are now and really how much of like a you know compounding effect it can have when you affiliate links and you doing stuff like courses where you sync all this time into it but then it just like even for us like our courses is selling you know and like if you watching right now you want to buy it you could buy it and then boom you know yeah and we not actively advertising or doing you know anything like that yeah so was a course the first thing you sold yes i made and i learned so much from that thing uh i made a course on how to grow your career as a real estate agent and i spent probably six months seven months eight months just like putting this outline together it was horrible to create this course because i wanted it to be so good that i sunk everything i had into it like i scripted out almost the entire thing it hours of content i scripted out almost the entire thing i passed it by dozens of real estate agents prior to make sure i covered everything and i was just a big learning experience but i was like okay so if i price this at like 4.97 if i sell x amount of these could be like all this money and i mentioned it in one of my videos like hey guys if you want to be the first to get it you just sign up through i put like a mailchimp link and i think i got like a thousand people signing up for this i like wow a thousand people well if i sell 50 of them and that uh 500 that out this email and guess how many i sold first launched what do you think that would be crazy 100 first 24 hours the first 24 hours first 24 hours okay i ten one it and i was like i screwed up what did i do i spent like eight months total working on this thing getting everyone hyped up i sold one so 900 was really ambitious that yeah a really great conversion rate a thousand people i i was so bad because i had uh like taken this night off to celebrate and i was gonna like send out that mailchimp email and then sit back and just watch the sales roll in and nothing happened for a while and i thought like is the link broken and i checked in like no it one it went back to the drawing board i how can i redo this how can i market it better and ultimately i think just the program was too niche like how many people are really looking to be a real estate agent looking to grow their career it too small of an audience so then i went back and like what what something else i could talk about and that for me was youtube the youtube uh creator academy did so well um but that think a lot of people watch me are just interested making youtube videos and it like nuanced knowledge yes probably like it and you want to get that knowledge from your favorite creator right which is interesting um because then it actually you understand that yeah those courses are coming out a ton right now but if you make your own and you have a dedicated audience they you yeah because that mean i think what you considered real estate to be too niche you said i would consider real estate at that time to be much more popular than growing on youtube like i would consider youtube to be far more niche no because my i don because course says that like sleazy kind of thing my program was about how to be a real estate agent not that many people want to be a real estate agent i think real estate investing would have been the right choice to do but i got so burnt out after creating that youtube course program uh [Laughter] that i mentally can again it was so stressful it was it was v it was one month where i didn at all and i worked maybe 18 hours a day for that entire month putting out three youtube videos a week on the main channel without missing a single upload and getting out entire program in one month are you editing all of this yeah so what uh there we did a like a tweet where we asked people questions i one of the most popular question was like what does your team look like and colin and i have seen what your team looks like but i think that video almost every day right on youtube across three different channels right so that was entirely me for the most part until i think it was april 2020 where jack came on but prior to then i would say pretty much all of it was just me the three videos on the main channel have still just been me so i edit those videos um script them film them so i keep the main channel to myself jack self timer your your thumbnail photos uh no so what i do is like i you they are i do that and then i just screenshot it and then i recently jack and i have been like getting really into like titles and thumbnails so yeah we these titles and thumbnails he get like a different uh uh perspective sometimes like sometimes i that you can too abstract but he not having worked 10 hours on creating this video so it to sometimes think what about a thumbnail like this and we after like an hour of discussion we it that you know like now as we get a little bit deeper into youtube um and like thinking about youtube as a you know analytics and an algorithm um click-through rate is super important now when you uh you know earlier in the conversation you rate essentially right and conversion so do you track when you look at titles and thumbnails are you tracking click-through rate what type of metrics everything everything so let me answer the other questions as far as my team it would say on the main channel jack edits all the videos in the second channel and jack is the one who coordinates the podcast so main channel i would say it jack and i coordinate on titles and thumbnails i do the title thumbnail but it brainstorm i do all the thumbnails on i do all the thumbnails but then jack is editing second channel podcast but other than that just just me i mean even two people sounds yeah very low to me people are completely surprised yeah how much content you put out and i was doing what jack and i are doing now like i did that for the first three years it was just me while working full-time as a real estate agent but well i guess i just didn didn other i just had so much fun like doing what i was doing and like making youtube videos that it was normal for me to start like you start at seven you finish it two where you started eight you finished it two but i loved it like it fun like i just be in bed like when i am just like editing a video or trying to plan something out i just have fun with it do you anticipate getting a editor to help you on the main channel or do you think that that is something that needs to be you i think it needs to be me i won get an editor on the main channel but i feel like that homey if that makes sense it think it how to make money and stuff like that i just sometimes it has that weird sort of like salesy vibe to it i don get it to be i i think just i want to still be that same guy who in the garage making videos about money and stocks and real estate and just editing them myself and nothing really fundamentally has changed about the process it watching but i videos as consistent as possible do you feel like you have a time limit on how long though you where you think maybe 20 years out i that i don making sense because the what happened with the second channel was i was putting so much more time into the main channel that the second channel began suffering because i i gotta get this video out by 9 a.m it six right now i just gotta slap this thing together and that suffering because i was not putting in the time that i should have on those those reaction videos and i was just just basically just zoning out slapping it together throwing it up but when jack stepped in and he was really able to spend like six hours editing this video and like really dedicate the time to it it made a huge difference so if if it ever gets to the point where the main channel starts suffering because i just got to slap something together then at that point i would but a lot of my videos too it them out as soon as possible and especially if they like it makes it sense that like i there as soon as i film upload it i how do you and how do you come up with the ideas i think that like take us through that one thing i think that interesting is idea generation because of how much has to do with title and thumbnail uh because of how much has to do with like what people are going to click on like coming over the idea once you have the editing process down it harder part i agree right like yeah scripting and the idea generation is what we spend tons of time on because the editing like it but it right idea yeah i would say the hardest part for me is picking a topic yeah and a title and i first start off with the topic entirely like if if i can don will think of what title can i use for this and once i get a topic i know i could script it it concentration and focus as long as i just everything i do not disturb i like either out in the backyard or just in a room with the headphones on just focus i could get anything done if i have the right topic but yeah coming up with the topic is so difficult i spend hours a day just like thinking of topics and a lot of that every news outlet imaginable going through every subreddit i possibly can watching so many youtube videos and i see like oh these videos are getting pushed by youtube or you know this is this is trending right now on cnbc or cnn or reddit and if i see these topics or something that i could talk about or that i find interesting i this video once i come up with a title and a topic then it then it just planning and that usually i i need complete silence and concentration it any distraction like even if the cat comes and like starts like scratching at the thing in front it just like it throws me off and i have to be in the state of just like nothing else like like everything else tunes out it this tunnel vision of just planning and it fun for me because it sometimes you i don like this trance because that sounds weird but i would imagine it meditation where you just get in the zone and then you come out of it like seven hours later like where did all the time go and you have this amazing piece of uh of content that then you could go and film when you you have any systems in place to sort of format that and template it like do you have a script template where you need to hit these things every time no but i i have just a general i guess format that i and maybe it time but like the first is always uh like what what the video is about why people should listen and what significance of it because i i and i seconds like if you can people in 60 seconds they try to do the hook in 60 seconds why it what why is this even worth watching then after that i always go into the background of just like here that so if i talk about the stock market just hit its all-time high people are worried about this being a big bubble is it too late to invest uh smash the like button and then before that i got here the stock market did this and this and this and then here and then i go into the relevance of today so here now this is what so-and-so said this is what so-and-so said and then i go into the research behind it i spent so long researching these topics and finding like like data so i think it and i think that i i really do my best to like research these thoroughly so because i never want people to get upset with my videos and my thing like years ago is like you could never say that like graham is is wrong necessarily in a video or you can what i they you like either you the data or like you so like i being really analytical and just like here here indication here should do maybe it won balanced as possible and leave it up to the numbers and then i just end it off with how is this relevant for you and what can you do with this information so i this the safest thing you could do it always buy and hold um invest in index funds but but there some with more significance of just like if this happens then we could see this and uh the big one for me was uh like the the stock market is about to flip i think that was a uh that was yeah that was one of those you hooked me with the title yeah yeah yeah the thumbnail thumbnail stood on uh did a handstand to do that thumbnail but uh there had where like yeah your head is getting smashed by a bunch of a stack of cash that was jack and i who didn yeah that one like stuck it guys are really good at thumbnails yeah i think it factor when it comes to a creator because you know you to back up the thumbnails with good videos and videos that are fun entertaining educational and also i think what your type of content is it transformational like if i actually make some money based on walking watching a gram video like you right because now i you so like that is the opportunity to do that is really interesting but you can can people in the door is the thumbnail yeah so the thumbnail is something we probably spend the most amount of time on right and that uh that middle class financially ruined thumbnail probably took us about an hour of just back and forth and are like the the tension in the air is so high when we thumbnails like that because we know if we miss the mark on the thumbnail all the work is going to be for nothing you could have the perfect title the perfect video a perfect editing but if you don have that right thumbnail it the success of the video and also the financial success of the video yeah because like if you have a very if you like typically youtube will feed your video to a lot like a good amount of people especially if you uploading regularly like there to be i would assume that your videos have millions of impressions right the thumbnail has millions of impressions because even if a million views if you click-through rate around what seven percent ten percent depends first 24 hours it 12. and then after 30 days usually a three to five right so if you think about like three to five percent or let it at six percent uh with a million views like that youtube you know yeah and so if you capture even an additional one percent you know with a channel like yours it probably the difference between an additional like couple thousand dollars easily easily easily so that hour spent on the thumbnail is like the question of maybe ten thousand dollars in that hour that you could make if you nail it that difficult is because there pressure on the thumbnail that sometimes i feel like that pressure almost stifles creativity because you like you messing up that you sometimes don those risks you would have otherwise had you not cared yeah but a lot of that is just like sometimes i we the computer and we i just don there it doesn back to the drawing board try something else um and it until both of us until jack and i are like okay we like this should we try it well let backup just in case this doesn so sometimes we and then we be a little bit riskier but that middle class financially ruined sometimes it like you have to be so abstract to get people on youtube that if they like wait what is that what that like you you need it to be like what so i really try my best to to make them just like they little like they got to be over the top but i wanted to i want people to be not confused when they see the time but like what like jack shoving money in my face like right there anything with yeah with with a explosion in the back but it just it gets you it you comes to that like how could you take this topic it should be boring like that whole video is me going over a budget and telling people how to cut back on a budget like that should not be an exciting video so to go and like how can i transform this so that like some 20 year old can see this and be entertaining the entire way through and learn something from it i feel like also in terms of the thumbnail not only is there viewership on the line and revenue on the line but it it almost hurts more if no one watches it because you own time and energy i would disagree i think the biggest risk to a bad thumbnail is the performance of both the entire channel and the subsequent videos you post after that man i feel like for us like i look at it as like man so many hours went into that edit like that and maybe like i guess our revenue isn as similarly to yours and uh that is a good point about like the effect on the algorithm yeah that is tough to come back from i worried about like that thumbnail is like you made a bad chess move and they go and they they take one of your one of your pieces so i thought that like one bad thumbnail affects the subsequent videos and and the library everything because the library i would assume like if you if you stopped uploading if you didn single video in february what would your library make do you have a sense for that um do you have a sense for like what does your library i almost don think about because i don and um i mean i could probably throw out a guess of maybe like 60 grand 70 grand and that know but the worry would be that you take a month off and youtube sees you as a creator and they you regular uploads and because people keep coming back if you stop that youtube is going to see wait a second so we channel uh to to people who are not then returning back because the content creator is not making new content why would we recommend this channel if if youtube keep coming back in the platform they would be much more likely to recommend a channel who consistently because that keeps people returning back all of my current subscribers wouldn youtube recommends them and they could only recommend so many videos before you or until they without uploading i think it going to be impossible to grow like youtube channel so that consistently i don miss an upload unless it there i think yeah like three weeks ago that just because i don happened but the algorithm just went crazy on my channel and just all these videos got recommended and i tested so many times that sometimes when your videos are getting pushed when you post a new video it will reduce the views on the rest of the channel while youtube focuses on that new video because they want to push the newest content so sometimes purposely i all these other videos are doing well i let those videos breathe a little bit and then i wow that know you have a banger like if if i unsure of a topic and i know if this is going to be quite up to par i post it and then i know the next video is just in case this topic doesn video will and so i know that whatever i lose on this one video i wow so this is very yeah you know it so interesting because i think when we entered youtube we came from a different perspective of like oh we filmmakers and this is a cool place to display film and i think now as we into the career of it we it from you know an initial angle of understanding it was a platform and how the platform worked which is kind of new to us and i think why we when we look at our you know adsense and i think even like being so inspired by casey neistat as a filmmaker casey was like um i don videos i think that the first two years a lot of it at least the thought of okay we because like we films but then at some point you a second i career here like how does this what do i do here with adsense um i curious about your first big check from adsense and what was that amount and what did that feel like um uh do you remember that might have been a few hundred bucks um i don guessing it was probably a few hundred was like my first ad yeah that deposit because yeah i remember it it was like 750 and it came in and i was like whoa that like we didn act like obviously we actively are doing things but we didn call a client we didn with any back and forth to receive this yeah you know what i mean it whoa adsense is adsense can be super high margin because you you just press upload that like about youtube and at least my perspective is like i get that there aspect to this and like self-expression but i think just for me being really interested in business like i i see youtube as like they and i want to be a part of that business and how can i help that business grow and how can i make that business look good and how can i be a good example for that business and so i very much understand that like youtube is like i owe so much to youtube and i want to do anything possible to help them grow as well so i feel like if i can make good content for youtube and feed into what they want and what they want to show and the message that they get out there that return and that out there too so i think it between me seeing what youtube is about what they message they want to show and me trying to figure out okay well how can i craft my videos around what they that includes let no politics no religion um just something easily digestible that is family friendly like that crafted i think around what youtube is likely to show and what would make them look good like i would never try to do something that was like make youtube look bad or be like oh you know graham channel we don be a part of that it i always want to be a good example i feel that something that there we of them being rented audience versus owned audience which was thrown out on twitter by alex lieberman who one of the founders of morningbrew um yeah i talk to him all the time yeah alex is great yeah and he uh when he said that i thought it was really interesting because like being on youtube it is a rented audience like you are on their land quote unquote yes some another person said it to me last week of um like you their backyard right so it um you can build a mansion there but they landlord and so i think that a lot of times people talk about youtube as an enemy as like it you know they all these decisions but like it platform still it like that that of that community right if you play by the right rules if you are a collaborative member and like you said i liked how you put it of you want to make them look good as a business and you want to play into their business strategy if you do that you rewarded i think you of that yeah um there necessarily to get that same type of relationship monetarily in terms of content like but their algorithm from what i is so their algorithm is fantastic for vi uh for viral content for building that relationship not so much except for the biggest creators who just get pushed all the time but i think watching someone for more than like five to ten minutes builds a relationship that no other platform has facebook has tried to do it facebook can like no one is on facebook watching long form videos three to four minutes that about it tick tock 30 to 60 seconds but it enough to build that relationship youtube right now is the only platform i think the main difference too is a video you made three years ago is making money today right you could make 50 tick tocks and find tons of viewership but it to pay you back in five years right that difference thinking about your channel as a body of work is something that especially as you mentioned like one bad video affects the subsequent videos and potentially the library yeah you about a library of content um which i think is really interesting do you have some high level kind of advice to creators who [Music] are maybe aspiring to turn youtube into a career like what are some things that you think about when it comes to your content i think don really like i never thought i would be doing youtube full time ever first three years even i gonna keep doing this on the side and keep going and it really wasn had already outpaced what i was making like i think yeah i think i made over a million dollars before in a year before not just before i took it full time now i a million dollars a year to do youtube full-time but i think it goes to show you that like i really always did it for fun it was never about the money i love doing it and i feel like if it happens organically great and i think it it can be a full-time career but i wouldn thinking like i youtube full-time and i this a full-time career i think if it happens amazing and that position to be in but i think it always have that income coming into the side continue growing it and then eventually if it gets to a point where it your time is better spent on youtube but then at that point i think it a that yeah i think that but you know what i actually heard of this on millennial money um they there something like find find the thing that you would do for free and that is going to be your career right so and for me it was like i was doing youtube for free like i just loved it i just had so much fun doing it it made me so happy and just so happy to make money off it now so it and making money gives me oddly enough more content to make because then i can make content about how much money i made or where i gives me more money to then invest right for more content it infinite monetization loop so let sorry making content about making money is super interesting because everybody like making money is one of the most broad topics there is so it i guess our how much youtube paid us in 2020 just youtube ad revenue just youtube ad revenue again we very fortunate like we sitting here at a studio we have you know employees that work for us so we have good sponsor relationships and we operate in a like in a way with advertising that that really supports our business but youtube as a platform from an adsense perspective we did on our main channel we did 5.6 million views i mean guess you had revenue yeah 5.6 million views in 2020 5.6 all right let me see 25 000. hmm it you to be right we made it was 16 000. 16. yeah yeah all right well yeah that what i would have imagined and i think that it uh fluctuate because i feel like for to reach five million eyeballs uh advertisers would pay significantly more for that sure but like our cpms fluctuate i think because our audience is less defined i do think that your audience is very they certain reason which makes the advertisers really clear cut of what like when i when i watch your channel the type of advertising i get is very specific a lot of the advertisers on the channel are just high margins so they to sell you like some 3 000 program or course and because that they could afford to pay like 60 to 80 cpms which mean i make more money because of that so they like the the kind of sleazy i don to say people who advertise my channel are all that way but uh there kind of shiesty stuff but i think they like i even react to the ads on my channel so i like i figure out a way to monetize those ads that are playing on my channel and just some of them are so awful like there this guy holding a whole bunch of money who entire time and then it pyramid scheme or it basically and it reacting to it and that video i think made a few grand just reacting to an ad that was on my channel right so if people advertise on my channel like at some point i will react to it and just poke fun at it yeah cause there lot of like stepping out of a nice car type of you know yeah those are fun like i think people enjoy too watching me watch the ads and it because some of them are so ridiculous and bad and then i critique the ads i like they high-end program but the dude doesn even have like a proper mic it room right the lighting is like really bad there one that was selling like a medical device and i relevant to anybody watching my channel because it targets like high-end doctor there that this is just a generic ad that i watching when i that makes no sense that that this ad should be there so i call them out on that that that perspective of looking at youtube and being like how do i monetize all the different elements here and like reacting to advertising playing on your channel is a really good idea i think it also like brings your community closer though because you what videos right like you the world that we watching my videos and i think it yeah it that uh and i watch so i have like youtube premium but then i have another account that i will just watch and i keep the ads on that just so i see like what are trying to promote and stuff it really interesting stuff do you ever think like do you ever see something that someone promote on your channel and think like oh well this is something i could potentially be doing myself like if other people are finding this valuable no no no it funny yeah or like i see some of these marketers on there and i it react to that one thing you dropped in your video which is and even on uh i think i watched some other interviews with you um where you talked about one 1.8 million which was the adsense rep right what youtube paid you that from youtube advertising and then i think you said it in passing that you were like in the video you like with sponsors and other things it million i was like whoa hold on wait a second where million yeah coming from so there quite a few affiliates there like eight or nine different affiliates um then programs sponsorships um trying to think what else i more that feeds into that that i just unless i sit down and like actively go through every little thing uh yeah it was it was over two million uh in that in that category yeah non-youtube non youtube uh yeah but there like the main channel i think did about two million last year i think uh then the second channel i think did like six hundred thousand podcast was i think we something um numbers are like are truly amazing for someone who doesn to understand that youtube the company is paying out almost two million dollars to a single creator it they so much money on the back end i like that to me like i well because oh oh also i bought a whole bunch of google stock so i figured that uh if if youtube is doing well right i should be invested in that as well i thought so that thing i bought yeah i always get just kind of you know the meme stocks just catch my eye and i what yeah that let invest in things that i actually use in my life let me just follow this yeah the more rational me though does think i should just be investing in platforms that i use myself and companies that i use myself and you should even yeah yeah so i started well i did a big chunk in google i think at like 1330 13 20. oh wow so now it yeah uh but i kept buying and i just thought like if i by google i should be investing a portion of that money back into the company um so so yeah but yeah all in all i gotta add it up to be honest with you and i really when i make those videos i spend hours like combing through every source like trying to add it up and i gotta add it up probably somewhere between like four and a half five five and a half somewhere on there five and a half million yeah total posture yeah that is truly amazing um yeah somewhere on there and it such an amazing weird range too because you really like beyond a certain point i i don like everything is through mint yeah but mint doesn job because sometimes if you if you move money from one account to another it counts as an expense and it recalculates his inc so it really have to go through and like add it up i so i have questions on affiliate and sponsorship affiliates how significant are affiliates for you maybe about half maybe about half of this so half half of half of that is is is programs wait wait so half of 2 million so about 50 would be ad revenue 25 affiliates yes yeah so let out of a big pie 50 ad revenue 25 programs 25 sponsors and affiliates oh okay i got it interesting yeah yeah because affiliates seem to be something that is uh pretty significant for creators who figure out how to do it right if it relevant to the audience if you to lay it out is that all done through your like description on your youtube or do you have oh that that you brokering those yourself do you have someone helping you um so those deals or how does that work they come to me and there companies that will come to me and say hey we have this offer do you want to do it and i those myself in the past i enough until i like wait a second you how much right uh wow they into usually year-long contracts so i obligations even even if my views explode like i that never gone back on that and uh this year i was able to renegotiate significantly and no one is bad and i so now i numbers now is probably still under charging but i sponsors i do i never want to do too many of them and i only have so many spots in a month that i feel comfortable putting a sponsor because i feel like every time you put a sponsor in a video it takes your video down from let a 10 to like an eight and a half just i i think people just don to sit through a sponsor so i just got to be really selective of like i don i don so i only have like a few spots and those spots i got to be really careful of is it a good sponsor is it something that i use myself do i stand behind them because if i endorsing anything it not my fault if something happens it it do have to do my best to really be diligent about it and i happen but um i just have to be careful of of what i talk about and what i say and who i endorse and just at least to the best of my knowledge at the time uh i have i have to be cognizant of that so five plus million dollars last year uh how much of that played into getting out of california a decent amount decent amount a decent amount um but there factors like i have so many friends now that are in las vegas so i think the more people that move to las vegas youtubers in las vegas nearly everyone is that right youtube is and so that makes it really appealing is that they started doing so many collaborations with everybody last year in the finance space and like everyone is there so it makes sense that i there too everything i get a much bigger place i really want to build out different sets and i can lined up perfectly so we into a segment here of twitter q a a lot of people had a lot of questions for you so we probably relatively rapid fire uh and we are going to fire away here so the way we we positioned this was um 1 million hundred thousand eighty nine okay colin read that read out this number i just got lost in it one million eight hundred and eighty nine thousand nine hundred and seventy two dollars and fifty seven cents i reading numbers that long so yeah okay uh and we said that money uh graham made in 2020 from youtube adsense alone if you could ask him one question what would it be so one thing uh that was an interesting question this from roberto blake he said oh i like him yeah roberto um he said you transparent about everything uh but he also said his course is solid for anyone interested wow nice plug nice thank you man i really appreciate that um they traffic sources on youtube do you look at that i do i would say about 80 of it is recommended then i would say usually about 10 is search and then another 10 is misc from just other websites or external but 80 of my views are recommended by google or youtube interesting and that that increases the um like kind of weight of the thumbnail because if you you want to make something that you know well i notice even for me that even if i most of the time i and the video comes up anyway so i clicking from that homepage and not necessarily my subscription feed so i think that recommended being in the first like five results of the recommended on homepage is so important you gotta get on those spots i feel like that percentage is common for most like high performing channels like for all of our videos for the most part like that you gotta be right there so uh here question from chef pk uh what does your avd look like what av average view duration oh how long are people watching uh videos between seven and eight minutes and 50 seconds and is there a length that you try and hit for your videos are you like all all of my videos are 15 minutes plus or it it depends on the topic minimum is going to be 10 minutes and i just i feel like 10 minutes is just a is a good mark i usually don less than 10 because i feel like otherwise i so usually 10 minutes i mark is between 12 and 15. like the video i today was 15 minutes and 30 seconds but i knew that getting the video down to 14.59 is going to be a lot easier for people to stomach to watch so i just i found 30 seconds in the video cut it out got it 14.59 interesting wow i number looks to people oh always so if if i below the 30 minute sorry the 30 second mark i will cut 31 seconds from a video to always get it under just a round minute like so if it 10 cut 11 seconds out of it i ever try to go past 20. unless there no other way that i could cut it down if i go over 20 there between 20 minutes and like 27 minutes psychologically it thing if people are watching a 27 20 minute video to watch 27 but if i can get it from like 21 to 1958 i will is that based on data or is that you empathizing with the viewer and the medium thousand with the view because i know myself if i see a 20 minute video just most likely i like i got the down time but a 19 minute video is totally fine i actually bleeds into a really interesting question uh it he says uh what are any unofficial beliefs you have about the youtube algorithm so meaning like anything that proven but you believe it uh one of one of the big ones is that youtube is less likely to push content that is not monetized and my experience has been that the more monetizable the content is the more family friendly it is the more youtube is likely to push it there no data really to support that except my own personal belief and experience but my experience has been the safer the video is for you to promote the more likely they are to recommend that video so that swearing in videos or throwing and stuff they shouldn probably not a good idea but there and youtube is never going to come out and say like hey guys if you say the the naughty words we they it makes sen if i were a business you have two creators one naughty words and one promote the one who words and probably over time who consistent with that who it i can trust like right that um we had someone on the podcast joe albanese who runs a company called stir that said something really interesting when he just raised 4 million bucks to pursue this company and i asked him you know why or how and he said at the core of it we all sell trust and that product and if you think about that in the context of your relationship with youtube you you i will be here regularly i people coming to the platform i them watching for a long time and i meaning the brand of youtube i if you can create a situation like that then they but you do have creators that don that mold that make me doubt it and michael reeves is one of them his videos he swears like every other second they at all they all get demonetized and he doing like 10 million views of video so you do get creators like that that are i would like to say they rule but his content makes up for it in so many other ways that you know it goes to show you no proof question from jay uh where can i get two free stocks and then corrected by someone underneath asterix for free stocks down below in the description when you sign up for weeble that put a link but it affiliate link to something else yeah yeah that subscribe to this channel i think it so funny to have these like running jokes on the channel like like smash like button for free stocks 20 cent iced coffee it it uh damn it doubled that where nuke on it it your community and i think what cool is there community there like i think you job of creating that environment like you mentioned homie like it feels like you someone and when you see two members of your community interacting in a tweet about you using your you know terms i think that yeah and none of that was like intentional right like everything was just like by chance and i love the community in the comments section i like usually the comments are so toxic but you go down to my videos i love how like everyone are like commenting back and forth they conversations someone asked a question like someone else is answering it i love that um another question here from uh curioushuman says uh when should a creator have multiple channels like at what point do you decide when did you decide you should have multiple channels that question um for me it was when i wanted to start deviating my content and i think that was around 700 000 subscribers on my main channel i wanted to start i looked at dave ramsey dave ramsey show and i was like i the graham stefan show and my plan with that was that i was going to record one day every week where i would take seven phone calls every day and then post one of those videos every day on the channel so i have like basically i would straight up i at dave ramsey i format but i want to be like the young dave ramsey who endorses credit cards and mortgages so like i copy his format put it on my channel and it was really difficult getting phone calls because in the beginning the second the second channel for me was just to make different content and it turned in from the phone calls to then just reactions because the phone calls like i spent all these times with the phone calls would do horrible and when i started looking at the the like what was getting the most views and like what was getting pushed the reaction videos made up percent of that even though i only posted i think two reaction videos a week and what was it like five uh phone calls but the two videos a week made up ninety percent of the channel so i really no more phone calls do this but i only made the second channel because i wanted to deviate make different content that i knew would not hit on the main channel that main channel was very just like well thought out very very just analytical the second channel was meant to be just to spur them on off the cuff so when i had content that was so different than the main channel that the second channel so that recommend and you also i think have to build up enough of an audience i probably wouldn you have less than 100 000 subscribers maybe that should be like two or three hundred and only if your content is so much different on the new channel yeah that then you essentially made a third channel for something a podcast a more looser format right yeah yeah because you don podcast on the second channel you don want to throw a podcast on the main channel so and it makes me feel better too knowing that you have like all these different uh channels and income streams that are independent from one another so like the second channel almost runs on its own at this point like at first it was really funded from the main channel like just that audience was going a second job but now the second channel has reached a brand new demographic that like doesn watch the main channel it they just know me as the guy who reacts to millennial money they don i have a major it stuff but it different audience out there wow that think about each channel operating as its own business like you viewer as well and if you the show from episode to episode the viewers like what trust starts with the viewer but then goes all the way up to your relationship with youtube i want people to feel comfortable that if they subscribe they want to say the same content but you the same format if you nickelodeon you getting you know cnn sure showing up there you to get nickelodeon right so that so i have a question now for you um let i have five thousand dollars to invest maybe let from you on your advice or your thoughts should i go with bitcoin pokemon cards or whatever the hottest meme stock is so let do you need the money no i to lose all of it yes you mean stocks meme stocks yeah if you willing to lose all of it if you were telling me that like you want an investment for the next like 40 or 50 years and you can this money i it in a roth ira and hold it don anything but if this is money you have to risk that you bitcoin could be pretty good but i think the roi and i think the fun you would have in the short term is probably in meme stocks wow chasing meme stocks that sounds like a good series it i think i just i this is another one of those feelings that the meme stocks are gonna be i think i think for the next like five six years and there are so many big funds out there right now trying to catch meme stocks on reddit and trade them there and they closely and unfortunately they some of these subreddits by posting like they they make these like burner accounts and they fake due diligence or they like spread fud or just try to post these things they so far the wall street bets community has been really good about removing those posts but like you are getting mainstream media and these big hedge funds like getting into wall street bets trying to manipulate the market through the perception of their stock it insane but these meme stocks it think we a brand new time i think people are going to start looking at these very seriously just like you have swing traders and you have long-term traders or you have like day traders i think you stock traders who just try to catch on to early meme stocks trade them a week or two and sell i can time where there meme stocks that you guys don about i mean you could probably look it up figure it out but like you know we referencing um the reddit community wall street bets and kind of like the social me social media market right now and how you know if you on instagram or you quickly find out about this stock retail buyers kind of you know swarm in and and increase the price of the stock elon musk tweets about it it like it you know apps like robin hood who have you know made it very easy to to purchase are able to drive you know prices i think elon musk is a really specific and interesting case study because he kind of like etsy that yeah he signal use signature yeah yeah sudden it goes up yeah and he has that effect on his own company too like uh let alone his company he goliath but yeah too high in my opinion yeah it cautious or not cautious people have to be who have a following on on social media it too because i never want to be in a position where people think i trying to like pump a stock and that why i publicly shared my portfolio and i have about three dozen individual stocks that i i if i share these stocks i don whole bunch of people going in and like picking exactly what i have right just first of all if anything happens i don but also like i don seen as like hey guys i then it shoots up like 20 because of because of what i have to say and and that could definitely skew things too it position where i ever have to worry about like someone think i a stock or anything like that i never want to do that well cool graham thank you for coming on yeah definitely thank you guys definitely guys subscribe to all of graham all three of them uh what what would you say uh is the type of person who should subscribe to your channel like what are people looking for uh who are out there who maybe haven now are like

Why Roger Federer Sleeps Twelve Hours a Day | With Neuroscientist Matthew Walker	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JW_F8HyGS68	Dr. Borja Bandera 	I know that you work men and women a lot and the on sport and sports ability is huge tell us what it affect your sporting ability yes so sleep is probably the greatest legal performance-enhancing drug that few athletes are abusing enough and you see it in some discreet athletes so Roger Federer claims to sleep around about twelve hours he does that with about ten hours at night and about a two-hour nap during the day hüseyin bolt the famous sprinter he slept somewhere between nine and a half to ten hours a night I believe one of the world and he takes naps strategically during the day and one of the world records that he broke he only been awake for about 35 minutes beforehand after sleeping him and came out and broke a world record they all know the power of sleep and they use it you know the basketball player LeBron James sleeps 12 hours as well and we work with all of these athletes so it not just that sleep enhances your performance on the day I think where most sports teams neglect sleep they starting to gain some aware of it awareness of it before the game or the performance it it critical because that recovery and restitution of tissues so off when you that high level you typically have chronic inflammation within the body and sleep is fantastic for reducing that chronic inflammation so your speed of recovery is markedly improved when you get sleep after a performance and most sports are daisy-chaining one game after the next so it about performing on one single event it that you can make it to the next game and the next game in the next game that is just as important as sleep beforehand we also know that when athletes start to shortchange on their sleep bad things happen to them so if you hours or less as an athlete your time to physical exhaustion is dropped by 30% so in other words let for a 10k run and then you have a bad night of sleep before the run you going to get exhausted by kilometer 7 rather than kilometer ten next your peak muscle strength decreases your ability to expand or sort of exhale carbon dioxide decreases your ability of your lungs to inhale oxygen decreases even your body ability to perspire effectively and cool itself while performing is also decreased when you sleep so just about every metric that we of decreases markedly in a linear fashion with less and less sleep and the final thing is injury risk we looked at a study where we took a group of athletes across a season and asked what was their injury risk and we tracking their sleep and then we bucketed those athletes into the amount of sleep that they were getting nine hours seven hours six hours five hours and there was a linear relationship the less sleep that you had the higher your injury risk when you were sleeping six hours or less you had an 80% chance of getting injured during the season if you are sleeping nine hours a night you were only fingers of 15 to 20 percent injury risk so marked difference	Success

My Productivity Desk Setup	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f7iiu5ck8U	Dr. Borja Bandera 	[Music] hey guys welcome back to the channel if you doctor working in Cambridge and in this video I tour of my 2019 productivity desk setup so I this desk all the peripherals the desk everything like that but before we get started I just want to say a massive thank you huge huge thank you to anyone who subscribed to this YouTube channel or who videos over the last two years as a massive nerd I you know having the perfect desk since I was like 5 years old and so now I genuinely think like I can imagine things getting much better than this so thank you so much if you watching these videos it you that you know I can now live this sort of life where I death set up and the second that I make a video about it anyway let the meat of this video and let with the desk and this is the Jarvis Electrical standing desk from fully they very kindly sent this to me just to try out a couple of weeks ago and I absolutely loving it and this desk has different height settings so if I press number one then it goes on standing desk mode and then I think the autofocus is not going to keep hold of me with the camera I have no idea if I I focusing on this but yeah I think from now on I Electrical standing desk because it just so nice like any time if I editing and I something or if I and I to do is switch the setting and then I feel like I have this second wind of energy let thing and that is this enormous monitor and this is the LG 49 inch um something something something and this is an absolute beast in my previous test setup I had a 34 inch ultra wide monitor and I thought that was wide but this this this thing is 49 inches that ridiculous you might think what point of having a 49 inch ultra wide monitor but it two 27 inch monitors side-by-side just without the bezel thing in the middle of it and so my main use case for this is firstly when I can just have all 49 inches for editing so I the whole thing it then I can do a triple window setup so I have a window in the middle which is like 27 inches in the middle over there that the side the left hand side and the right hand side I have other apps so I can just kind of juggle these apps around let open up superhuman using Alfred Platt goes in one window let message on slack boom that goes in another window and it this monitor is floating in mid-air to this heavy-duty argotron monitor mount this does come with a stand but i thought you know it having the having the monitors sort of looking like it and i don a huge bulk when you have a stand with a monitor and the thing that the monitor and powering the whole setup is my trusty 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display and touch bar and the great thing about this monitor is that it and so I where if I the cable take my black top out and go away and then when I get back home put the laptop back in that stand thing plug the cable in and I speaking of the stand this is this some fancy walnut stand thing that I bought from I think FY com this just looked really cool when I saw it and if you wondering the MacBook skin is a sticker that I got from D brand I think that their marble version I just think it looks a little bit nicer than the black unibody finish of the MacBook Pro for the speakers we Logitech speakers that I literally bought about five years ago from Amazon maybe for about twenty or thirty pounds and they have served me fine ever since I am looking to upgrade them but to be honest I don point and usually if I music I just play it on the home pod which there one in the kitchen in terms of peripherals for the mouse I this is the MX master one the keyboard that I wireless Bluetooth keyboard I actually been using this exact keyboard since 2007 I bought it off my friend James when we were in year 9 the ninth grade like this exact same keyboard for the last 12 years it best thing ever is so good and then on the left-hand side I Magic Trackpad is quite nice so because I like having both the mouse and the trackpad available especially for editing because then I can do stuff with the mouse and then I can like scroll through the timeline with the trackpad other things on the desk I have got two lamps from Tom ones one of them is that Pixar looking lamp over there I usually have it pointing in the corner where it gives some course some kind of nice glow and then I one over there and these lamps are powered by philips hue light bulbs that I also in my bedroom and that means I can change the scenes to whatever color I want we could have read or relax or concentrate which is kind of blue energized or Arctic Aurora savanna sunset tropical highlights and this is the one that I like using I call it Ice and Fire Inc like a little sort of an orange sort of look and yet other things on the desk I Japanese cups that have been featuring in my desk setups since about 2014 when I visited Japan for a research project one of them is for pens one of them is for coins so those go on either side and of course because I consider myself a tech youtuber I have this fake IKEA potted plant that again I several years there was this psychology study that I read about whereas I it shows that if you have greenery in your office or in your working space that increases creativity so that was what I told myself when I was buying this plant not that I just wanted to copy every other tech youtuber speaking of plants behind me we have a Ken tier palm which is a pretty good house plant is quite hard to kill it to water it about once a week and you know I just think this is a really nice addition it gonna go for fake plants like in addition to this but my mum vetoed the idea of me having fake plants in the house but she let me keep this one because I mean I had it already a waste of money so all the other plants in the house are real which is slightly annoying cuz I do have to remember to water them once a week but you know as a 25 year old adult now who pays bills and taxes and you know stuff like that I thought you know it watering plants once a week let bit more about furniture and the chair I stool from fully they sent me this along with the desk the idea behind the stool is that you it doesn you kind of have to rock and so I find that when I am sort of in front of my desk all day I do actually have to work my core a little bit just to stay upright and then on the right hand side of the desk we units from Ikea again let cable management now and actually this is the best job I cable management and this java standing desk makes it really easy because it got these metal bits underneath it that are quite good at holding cables and the fact that I right-hand side where the Attucks drawer units are mean that the whole mess of cables and plugs and all that stuff is sitting behind the chest of drawers and you can things I have on my desk I always have a deck of cards with me I have been into close-up magic and stuff like that since the age of 17 so when was that that was eight years ago wow that is a long time and so whenever I on YouTube or if I have idle hands I need something to do with my hands then I just get out the deck of cards and I also have a coaster with a coffee cup usually this had some peppermint tea because it I pepperminty is quite good because it relaxes me before bed this is a lovely little coaster that was made by one of my friends Markus and it which is like the first initial of eight of my university friends is where it all very wholesome and it are different symbols that symbolise different bits of a holiday that we all went on together and actually on the theme of productivity I started watching documentaries on my desk on this monstrosity of a 49 inch monitor while having food and like I not really watched proper TV for the last like five years since Diane University because I just kind of thought of watching TV is a waste of time but since I discovered documentaries recently I changed my mind in that front and I actually been watching stuff that actually helps my life and that is hopefully a seamless segue into curiosity stream who are very kindly sponsoring this video curiosity stream is the world documentary streaming subscription platform founded by John Hendricks who the founder of the Discovery Channel and on curiosity stream you can find thousands of documentaries to stream there were two that I particularly enjoyed one of them was about meditation and why meditation works and it was this researcher kind of going through meditation and then doing brain scans and showing how legit meditation is and that trying to meditate a little bit more in my life and another one was about why we sleep so that was a real eye-opener pun not intended and made me change a few things about my sleep habits because I realized actually I much sleep as I need to and I really don Alzheimer you know sleep is the time where yeah according to the documentary which is based on research our brain helps to kind of wash away the stuff that accumulates throughout the day all these various waste products so I really enjoyed those two and actually one that I watched earlier today while having my gourmet burger kitchen takeaway was part of a nutrition series which is all about the benefits of plant-based diets and why we should have more fruit and veg in our diets and I was watching that while munching on a falafel burger so the falafel burger was quite plant-based but yeah I these documentaries anytime I have dinner in front of my desk and I just feel like that productivity in my life you know just to go with the theme of the productivity desk setup so if that sounds like something that you might also be into then please do

Shifting Gears: Navigating the Transition to Sustainable Energy | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOCUMENTARY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2l18d136bOY	SLICE Science	[Music] sunlight fuels spaceship earth Humanity has built an engine that uses that fuel in its most powerful form but now we are forced to ask how far can it take us fire made us human in the past few hundred years and fossil fuels made us modern and now we burn each year in the world 19 cubic kilometers of these rotted remains of primeval swamp goo the fossil fuels have created our wealth they they have enriched the lives of billions of people but they have Rising costs to our security economy and environment that are eroding if not outweighing their benefits that that makes us safe secure healthy and durable you have to look at the scale of our energy Supply system it been built up over more than a century you the amount of investment that would be required would be fantastic oil is very unique it dense it store it world if you project the amount of energy that about 6 billion Jews of energy and if you translate That Into You know how much work would that be for a human being to generate that much energy I think it works out to in in the order of six years and if you had that person paid at us minimum wage that barrel of oil would be worth you know something like $140,000 that valuable un useful oil is the fossil fuel engine shap the technology and Landscapes of the 20th century it gave us the power to gain more power to harness rivers to wage new kinds of War to unleash the energy of the atom [Music] energy is the m resource that resource is provided via A system that wraps around spaceship earth we of oil per day that that Society [Music] fossil fuels also involve huge flows of money the oil money often fuels tyranny instability and Corruption uh it is behind many of the conflicts in the world we actually pay about 10 times more to sustain military forces meant to intervene in the Persian Gulf than we pay to buy oil from the Persian Gulf this is obviously crazy but it is an addiction we have fallen into and need to cure ourselves of if the ability to grow oil supply ceases and that before 2020 the geopolitical issues will only accelerate so if we don the prognosis is not particularly bright I mean you know for the economy for geopolitical disruptions for Wars for actual physical shortages so all of these unconventional energy sources I do think that they they lot of the easy oil and gas is already gone now we have to go after these other harder sources if we want to keep the oil and gas flowing as the engine runs short on fuel its pollution and violence is backing up into Western Society nowhere is that more obvious than in domestic fights about fracking the natural gas and oil is found very deep under the ground and in order to bring that oil and gas up to the surface they drill horizontally in many cases a couple of kilometers and then they do the hydraulic fracturing they open cracks up in the rock one of the things that makes it especially hard in the United States is that the people living on the land don necessarily own the oil and gas below it so we have people who who own the own the property may have lived in a house or on a ranch or on a farm for 20 30 or 40 years um don in many cases don own the mineral rights and then someone else comes in and puts uh puts drilling on their property [Music] [Music] [Music] yes you have different opinions so when they heard they were coming in a number of people are excited cuz they most of the people have leased their land so I would say over 90% in our County are leased so they to get royalties so they forward to that so they some extra money and a lot of people need money they situations with the economy so they don it could mean so for them it going to get extra money and then there concerned about the industrialization and the contamination the well is back here um December 6th 2011 we noticed it was erupting and our water turned dark gray so the D came out and tested our water the first test the results were 38.9 milligrams per liter of methane in our water um they came back out a couple months later and retested it had gone up to 58.4 mg per liter that it drilled on both sides of us and next thing you know we got problems that problems that weren know it area they drive neighbors against neighbors people that normally wouldn hate you hate you because you have water problems now and yeah my other half she got all pissed off with me cuz I was fighting with them all the time it know something I what we own from being destroyed we already lost the water and she was mad cuz I was constantly fighting with them you her thing was you know just lay down and be a good little gas hor and it like no so she walked out on me because of all the fighting uh other neighbors over here they got divorced over the fighting neighbors over here got divorced over the fighting and then you have neighbors pissed off because you got signs in your yard you have other ones that from the town well there well thank God for you you don problem but over here we do despite all of the wealth that they have created and convenience that they offer fossil fuels are becoming quite threatening to our way of life countries are responding to that crisis by tapping whatever energy sources they have available in Brazil Hydro power is favored it is one of our ship renewable resources globally only about onethird of its potential has been tapped Brazil jingu river the bellante hydro plant will require a 26 km diversion of river for water to create 11 million megaw of electricity local people say the project is destroying the rain forest and the river [Music] itself the massive project was delayed repeatedly by environmental concerns and now proceeds in controversy at a meeting with power officials they voice their complaints [Applause] [Music] [Music] foree for [Music] back to [Music] it that foreign foree fore spee speee [Music] spee for [Music] e other countries have found ways to tap their natural energies without creating environmental disasters we are very lucky we situated on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and where the two the North American the EUR Asian plates combin we are a volcanic active country that has the geothermal resources underneath to tap into we obviously for a long time it used to be for bathing for heating houses women used it for um washing clothes and that was a big thing in riic and then uh in 1930s we started really harnessing the heat for distri heating and that was the first we used and then um later on we started producing electricity tapping that power allowed cold and Barren Iceland to become self-sufficient in food vegetable growing in Iceland started around 1940 geothermal makes it possible to grow inside of these green houses all through the year Iceland can produce enough vegetables peppers cucumbers Tomatoes anything that grows inside the greenhouse we can bring produce and we have enough geothermal energy and we have enough electricity and we can we can even uh we can produce that much that we can feed a lot of Europe with our growing underneath us is a geothermal Reservoir so we have hot water and steam in the ground very hot about 250 to 300° C and what we do is we drill hold HS into that Reservoir about 2 km deep get the hot steam up out of the ground pipe it into the power plant where we separate all hot water from it and all droplets take it into a turbine and Generator set and produce electricity we use the hot water that comes out of the turbine to preheat cold water from the ground and then we heat that water even further up with the hot water and then send it to reic for district heating I think it electricity um that comes from geothermal but over 90% of our heating comes from geothermal which has tremendous Health and Social benefits for the country because you don to worry about gas or oil to heat your houses which we do all year round so the rest of Iceland production comes from Hydro resources we are a very renewable country we make our electricity with either geothermal or Hydro I think the societal benefits of geothermal District heating have been great for my country the fact that you can heat your home with very little cost all year round you can bathe you never run out of hot water public swimming pools all over town that are open year round people waste energy in a way they don Heat their homes they know it and they know it doesn icelanders instead of uh turning off their radiators to cool down their homes in summer they just open their Windows not every country can use geothermal to supply as big a part of its electricity mix with geothermal as we can but it can play a much bigger role in many countries the US is the largest producer of geothermal energy in the world the United States Geological Survey has estimated there megawatts of undiscovered geothermal resources in the western part of the United States that alone if we could harness part of that could really boost up [Music] production places in Europe Asia Philippines Indonesia there places where is fantastic resources for instance in Japan Japan is also a volcanic island with abundant geothermal resources but its Hot Springs are sacred spaces for its energy Japan chose to rely on nuclear power despite its terrible [Music] past really the the origination of all of it was the nuclear weapons program the atom had the ility to create energy if you did certain things to it you can get it to split certain atoms and then they release this [Music] energy after the weapons were used in Japan and after the end of World War II then people began to want to transition the thinking away from the weapons a little bit more to what they call peaceful uses this too is atomic energy harnessed by American Scientific genius to benefit All Mankind through dramatic new discoveries in industry and agriculture biology and Medicine 10,000 scientists and Engineers are at work to prove that atomic energy does not mean only the atomic bomb that led in many ways to the nuclear power Fleet most of the reactors that we have were licensed in the early then and the early designed in the 60s after you paid for the reactor it cheap to operate so that in the staying power of of nuclear and the other piece is really the advantages from a climate perspective people talk about nuclear as the solution to the climate problem I don because we don restrictions on climate emissions uh and carbon emissions that uh utilities have actually decided to use nuclear for that purpose the US government under President Obama launched a program to support the development of nuclear power plants because of climate change it seemed that finally nuclear power was going to make a big comeback it was going to expand in Japan was going to be perhaps 50% of electricity it was being reborn in the United States and you saw around the world a very upbeat view about nuclear power and that was what people called the nuclear Renaissance where the Chernobyl the terrible nuclear accident of 1986 was seen as being far in the past and then came Fukushima [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] for [Music] for [Music] for [Music] for I think the damage is in some ways difficult to capture and understand the real impact right now from the Fukushima accent I think it it primarily it it is the people that have been evacuated from their homes you who have been forced out of their homes for several years now some of them will never be able to return uh the the communities that existed will never reform or even if from a technical and a medical or health perspective people could come back to the area and it impact the people been evacuated it is impacting their entire economy you I suggest that the impact would be at least half a trillion dollars it shut down a significant portion of their electricity generation which has changed the lifestyle of almost everyone in Japan the biggest area where there impact is on the ocean the expectation is the majority of the contamination went out to the Sea you had a natural event like the tsunami which to some extent was a localized in Time Event it happened and then the waters receded and you had a tremendous tragedy with people dying then you had a second effect which was the impact of the nuclear power plant which is a longterm crisis so it almost as if that tsunami has been made to last 40 years and to think then that it came from a place that was used to generate electricity it just shows that in a way this technology has real fundamental problems that need to be addressed [Music] [Applause] everywhere in the world people Rec considered nuclear power now it Patchwork so it and it exuberant picture than it was just a few years ago some countries decided to continue like France China had a pause and then has renewed it Finland said yes Abu Dhabi said yes but nuclear power has greatly slowed down Germany said no it is a deliberate decision to say the future of modern industrial societies is a climate friendly decarbonized industry Germany people were on the one hand against nuclear energy but at the same time in Germany the mood was in favor of climate protection Fukushima simply made clear in Germany we will not be able to stay with a nuclear anymore and then the German government said no we will honor our climate pledges we will facee out nuclear what is the answer renewable energies why do you harvest energy in such a indirect way photosynthesis has an energy efficiency of 1% so why not us using the sunlight directly it really yeah even today I mean average uh efficiency rates are 12% 15% or sometimes 25% every person on this planet moreas has access to that energy it is highly efficient and it has no side effects on the environment so photosynthesis created life on Earth in the end as we know it and created Agriculture and everything if this is possible to create human civilization based on 1% deficiency I sure we can build it based on 10% efficiency again on no [Music] brainer Le in other parts of the world wind energy has all sorts of critics wind is like hydrocarbons there then there right wind has to be located in very good locations it Renewables like like wind and solar is intermittency and it energy during periods when there wind and the typical backup for that is fossil fuels when the wind is blowing you know we generate with wind but when it back on on something reliable otherwise the grid becomes you know very unstable Renewable Power is a challenge that electrical systems worldwide are struggling to handle its variability is a problem for the people who manage electrical grids well it supply and demand is always critical electricity if you have too much of it um things start to happen like your voltage starts to go up the voltage goes up that hurts equipment uh you have too many electrons flowing through the grid this system was designed for a different need in the old days you had a coal plant that would come up in the morning uh you knew it was going to be at a certain amount by 9:00 it would be at a certain amount by noon be ready for the evening Peak and then it would go offline at night that was very predictable now you don predictability cuz you Renewables on the system in Ontario most power still comes from nuclear plants and it always wins out over renewable energy today we do have some constraints in the system and so we dispatching wind down to make sure we don we need uh into the system it when we have too much uh base load power on the system that happens occasionally where you needs to run nuclear plants like to run uh full out so when you wind and they slowed hydroelectric and and nuclear and and we don demand in the province we have to do something about it it few hours to solve a problem rather than to take a nuclear plant off for potentially 4 days we don necessarily turn the turbines off um what they their blades you generate less electricity even though the wind blowing actually no power plan runs all the time they all break sometime and when they break about a tenth of the time for big stations uh you just lost a th000 megawatts in milliseconds often without warning a portfolio of different renewable sources different kinds in different places can be forecast to perform more accurately than we can forecast demand and that portfolio of different things working at different times in in different ways can then be integrated with the other kinds of Renewables not solar and wind power but all the others which you can have whenever you want that need for more resilient energy systems that work even if the big Power grids fail is part of what rapid shift to micro grids and decentralized energy systems that work even if the grid fails smart grids are just half the answer to balancing the new power [Music] [Music] supply [Music] [Music] El for in North America there is considerable opposition to wind farms oh we thought they were a good idea when we first heard that they were going up say in the repley area until uh a fellow that I was used to work with years ago uh he he was getting sick and his wife especially was getting really sick people who live near windmills complain about the noise vibration and the controversial phenomenon of dirty electricity exposing them to electromagnetic energy the windmills didn 2008 and it was 2009 when they tied all those lines in together over at the corner and it was after that that we started having the problem I developed tontis and Wayne developed tontis two weeks after I did and we also started having headaches and nausea as well I I figure it electricity coming out of those things that it it microwave yeah we we we just had to G get away like or we we weren survive when you went to the windmill company and said listen we they so we dog there and he to talk to the windmill company so that was their way of dealing with him one lady was very angry one day when I talked to her and she said talk to either your MP or your wind company don us maybe they think that I things I don we know you have to experience it before you [Music] know but in Germany Wind Farm complaints are fewer partly because towns own the systems [Music] for in and this is a outstanding event in human history Germany is a leading industrial force on this planet saying we embark on the great transition towards sustainability I think there collectively Renewables can replace current energy throughput in 2011 primary energy was 33% oil 30% cold 24% gas 6% large Hydro 4% nuclear and 1.59% non-hydro Renewables and that includes wind solar geothermal and burning biomass that the biggest piece of the solution is figuring out how to lower our energy throughput a lot without you know radically uh reducing people of living not going to be easy uh it really needs a new [Music] paradigm	Success
Understanding the Climatic Crisis Challenge | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOCUMENTARY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxdlTBWmQsc	SLICE Science	[Music] seeing spaceship earth brought a great paradigm shift in science it changed our scientific understanding of the planet and it led to our scientists becoming our planetary Navigators warning the rest of us that we are flying into Danger this is built D men F sets and satellite monitoring of carbon dioxide over a year produces a picture of the Earth breathing in the northern hemisphere green plants inhale CO2 in Spring and exhale it in Autumn while the opposite is true in the South every year the residual CO2 levels creep up there is more CO2 in our atmosphere than there has been for 800,000 years making Earth hotter than when Humanity was born the unprecedented situation requires our scientists to take on the role of naviga spaceship earth everywhere in the world they are assessing the impacts of global warming and trying to foretell what future lies ahead for our ship their attention is focused on the Arctic where warming is most extreme and the ecosystem is [Music] collapsing young researchers are working across the remote region they are analyzing sawing permafrost changing animal behavior the decreasing reflectivity of snow [Music] cover melting glaciers and unusual plumes of ancient gases it is an extraordinary opport for a new generation of scientists to take on the most important challenge the world has known [Music] experience they are the first in their fields to witness planetary changes in real [Music] time now their task is to combine their findings with all data to produce a forecast for the [Music] future I started doing Arctic Research In 1970 when I came to Cambridge as a graduate student at the Scott polar Research Institute started working on waves in ice but I that took took me to the Arctic and the Antarctic as a research assistant so we saw both ends of the Earth and that inspired me to take up uh polar research as a as a what what I was going to do with my life when the Navy decided to send the first British nuclear submarine to the Arctic the director of the Scott polar Research Institute persuaded them that it would be a very good thing to do scientific work and collect ice thickness data so he pushed re forward as the person to do it so I going on them for about 40 years [Music] [Music] now we months the ice then was very formidable and most of it was called multi-year ice that year and it was very thick maybe 3 m thick heavily r with these great piles of deformed ice nobody had managed to get to the North Pole in an ice breaker in those days because the ice was so heavy in the last 15 years the amount of multier ice has diminished and now there ice that grew that year so it or so thick it doesn it can routinely go to the North Pole in an icebreaker now crashing through this stuff to somebody who Arctic as it was in the 70s and it world well I think the summer ice is going to disappear very fast and my prediction is it years time there still be ice filling the Arctic Ocean all through the winter but it summer [Music] months the Arctic has warmed up about three times as fast as the planet as a whole there what happens in the Arctic is what going to happen to the rest of the planet in a few years [Music] time scientists working on the ice caps of Greenland and Antarctica are also seeing unprecedented [Music] melting as ice melts from the glaciers the ocean is rising [Music] the second uh picture gives you sea level rise which is the result of melting of bodies of ice across the globe as well as therbal expansion of the oceans and here during the last cent we had an average increase in sea level of about 17 cm since 1988 the United Nations agency the intergovernmental panel on climate change has been amassing data from the world scientists to understand what global warming will do to our ship for more than 10 years regra P have coordinated their efforts now we have enough observations on the basis of which we have come up with very clear findings in the reports of the ipcc and incidentally these reports are written by the best scientists from all over the world the ipcc doesn scientists anything for the work that they do and then against but the sheer importance of being part of ipcc reports is enough to see that they put in those extra hours this is the only planet we can live on so we have to be concerned about the earth very finely balanced system Nature has a certain order in everything that it does with warmer temperatures you of evaporation of water so therefore that that means rainfall and snow as a result result of warming the bodies of ice will melt much faster the oceans will expand because of the heat that they are absorbing and therefore you will get sea level rise both as a result of the melting of ice as well as the thermal expansion of the oceans it is certain that the global ocean will rise through this century and the next though no one knows how much predictions range from 40 cm to 6 [Music] M even the lowest prediction means that in this Century 100 million Coastal people will be flooded annually complex nonlinear systems can behave in an Abrupt way and even worse they can behave in an irreversible way you have activated or transgress the Tipping Point if you stand in front of an abyss and somebody gives you a from behind you may fall down if this person after you are falling already would just take the hand back doesn will not miraculously reemerge and be put back onto the cliff that call a Tipping Point the so-called Gulfstream system in the ocean where we have seen a Slowdown over the last decades quite significant slowdown already so there have been of course speculations could the Gulf Stream be shut down completely yes it happened during thees several times with Greenland melting there is a very high chance that not only this circulation will slow down in the North Atlantic but it may be shut down completely yeah so that tipping element here clearly a situation for three or four years now in the United States Canada but you have extremely warm weather on the west coast and extremely cold weather on the East Coast this has to do very likely with the warming of the Arctic The Retreat of the seais which is affecting what we call the chat stream this is this rhythm of highspeed wind around the Northern Hemisphere and in general this uh jet stream is creating certain waves for a few days only so-called rosby waves what we find is with this disproportional Arctic warming these rosby waves get stuck they can create unusual heat waves or the Californian drought this is a big surprised so many people because they feel global warming means oh it warmer but with our dynamical weather patterns are being reorganized through the perturbation of the chat stream for example in a highly nonlinear Way by human interference it different story yeah it but it terrifying we are living in a world which already has a lot of stresses if you look at some parts of the world there already is a major problem with availability of water and with climate change in some places that serious because climate change only adds to some of these stresses the complex interactions of climate change include the unforeseen ways people react to it in California the long drought has decimated crops and driven up commodity prices that change in the market created a disastrous Chain Reaction far [Music] away the price of corn is getting higher and higher because of the D situation in America then the production of corn from America is getting less then the price of uh corn is double this year so the people start to grow more corn they cut the tree for corn Plantation in uper North it creates a lot of problem when Thai Farmers clearcut their forests in reaction to the American drought they created conditions in their Highlands that allowed Monsoon rain to flood their Coast a part of that it is a natural disaster in the year 2011 the the rain increased up to uh 32% and we had uh five tropical storm and also another tree monso never happened [Music] before the forest in the north of Thailand could not hold back the storm water it flooded the coast even as waves pounded it from the [Music] sea more than 800 people [Music] died [Music] Mangrove forests that normally protect the coast against sea surges had also been cut down to make room for shrimp Farms the nature of the mro trees uh it contain uh root which uh protrude from the stem of of the trees and it keep the soil stable not moving by by web or by by tighter current here a rising sea met the expanding world food Demand with disastrous results it used to be a mro forest but uh now uh it become firstly a shm pond right now because of the decry of uh the water quality so the degradation of water quality so can they cannot produce shm anymore before we did not know that mro Forest is a natural defense system which work perfectly now we going to see the original the electric pole that used to be on land but now it sea you can see the LIE of uh the electric port the co is about 500 M from this uh pole that is a a CA of protection that that is uh done by local people so they use a bamboo instead of a concrete because a bamboo is uh much cheaper but uh bamboo cannot last for long so if you a break further the devastation of coastlines is a human disaster in poor countries and an economic disaster in rich ones can seeing here a live view of Hurricane Sandy as the International Space Station flies above it about 260 Mi above the Atlantic Ocean [Music] water actually built up in the station to about 3 and 1/2 ft and you can actually see the water line that extends going across Ross and that stayed here until basically the tital surge pulled back and then the water level dropped here to about 6 in but it dropped here at 6 in that meant everything here all the way down to the track level and going out about 2,000 ft north of the station was completely submerged this station was commissioned roughly around 2009 at the time the structural components and the finishes uh course the New York City Transit roughly about $550 million when this station opened it was state-ofthe-art but when Sandy did come all the station components were completely submerged and will need to be replaced 15 million gallons of water entered our system from the track level all the way up to the ceiling extending all the way through the station length which is approximately about 600 ft long the water level reached every area went through every single conduit every single room that was in this complex and even further north it extended outside our station limits this is the uh dispatchers room this was at one point state-ofthe-art but as you can see here this will all have to be completely gutted we come at a more frequent basis without a doubt so it look at we took 66 million gallons of water into our system if that water didn that water have gone besides us just looking at our mitigation really the city and the state needs to look at an entire plan for mitigation because whatever we do will impact others or what others do will impact us human communities are beginning to plan to withstand the storms of global warming other species can only [Music] flee so out here we are looking at vegetation change on herel island so how the plants are responding to climate change so there going on one of the things is that the climate is warming in the Arctic up here the Summers aren but the growing seasons are getting longer so the ice melts out sooner and it refreezes in the Autumn later so that means that the plants have a lot more chance to grow you also have a deepening of the active layer the part of the soil that is unfrozen in the summertime and when that gets deep deeper the different plants can grow their Roots deeper and access different nutrient pools and so potentially grow more so that the shrubs is perhaps they because that thaw depth is getting deeper and they have more nutrients to grow okay one last one here that it everywhere on the planet is now affected by human activities there is no natural without human any longer the whole of nature is now responding to human global scale changes to the [Music] world well one of the most obvious changes is that species are moving to higher elevation in mountains because it gets colder at higher elevations and they closer to the North Pole and the South Pole and that if you like is the real kind of signal that it differences in the amount of warming in different regions rather than by some other factor which is changing in the [Music] environment species are moving their range throughout the world the best evidence is from Europe and North America because that volunteer amateur naturalists who been recording the distributions of species for many many years if this rate of movement carries on for the next hundred or so years which is the general expectation with climate warming then the whole distributions of animals on the whole planet are going to move to somewhere else from where they used to be so this is just a major rearrangement of the whole of biological life on [Music] Earth ipcc reports document dozens of animals on the move the famous North Atlantic Cod stocks are shifting towards the [Music] Arctic Australia shifted their range 750 km to the [Music] South North American Monarch populations are crashing as strange weather patterns throw their Continental migration into chaos if they there available then they squeezed as they will be failing to expand in the north but they will be retreating in the South and so You effectively fall off the top of the mountain and either the species will become extinct or we as humans would have to think about can we save them in some way George dooki was one of the first biologists to witness Arctic species collapsing because of warming for 40 years he has been studying black gillams on a remote Alaskan Island the seab birds like polar bears depend on the fish habitat that flourishes under ice the ice was pulling offshore and taking their food away and then I started seeing these uh major uh die offs of chicks in the nest then polar bears arrived I slept in a tent with nothing other than my shotgun uh and frequently not even unpacked because I never saw a polar bear uh for 28 years and suddenly we had a mother with two full grown Cubs coming up to our tent site polar bears are are obviously the best known and most iconic part of the pack ice ecosystem if if you see a polar bear you are seeing X number of articad that has been been eaten by a seal and then that seal has been eaten by the bear after I got over my fear of polar bears I I started really feeling sorry for them so they swim in 15 Mi or more they then get to land they anything and they are eating things like gilmont eggs and gilot chicks male polar can we weigh from 800 to 12200 lb and and and to have them be eating something as small as a gilmont egg which is not as big as a hen uh makes you realize that they are very hard up for food like all scientists tracking biological changes George is witnessing Visible Changes in biospheres that have been stable for millennia I didn seeing the loss of a major ecosystem or the or seeing a species that uh basically has depended on that system for the past 25,000 years have to deal with a loss of that system knowing that and then also knowing that that people know what the cause of that warming is and nothing much is being done is very frustrating other creatures are being transformed by the changing environment particularly those in the acidifying ocean the more carbon dioxide that taken up by the oceans the lower the global climate change will take place originally we thought this was a good situation so 500 billion tons of carbon dioxide has has been taken up by the oceans We Now understand that over time that has caused a 30% increase in the acidity of the oceans and we the first thing you begin to see is more changes in high latitudes because more CO2 goes into the water at high latitudes see changes in the Arctic in the Antarctic region first but an hour out to the present and as you go out to the end of the century we see that the entire Arctic Ocean and parts of the North Atlantic and the North Pacific are now corrosive from top to bottom that means shells and skeletons would dissolve from top to bottom the same thing is true for the anarch region here all the way out to Australia and parts of uh South America but even in the tropical Zone there are conditions no longer favorable for curls to produce your shells or skeletons this is what the shell normally looks like completely clear this is what happens when you put it into 1100 micro atmosphere CO2 for 30 days look how dissolved the shell is and some recent work has suggested that we oceans now such that we see a whole new chemistry every 40 years or so a number of organisms now are very sensitive to these changes the impacts on reproduction for example in corals we see a slow down the rate of growth of corals corals are particularly important because they provide a habitat and perhaps 25% or more of the fish that live in the oceans spend some time of their life in a COR Reef habitat so we see that there are implications through the food chain some fish in the high CO2 world for example the clown fish they actually move towards their predators in a high CO2 world as opposed to avoiding their predators in a high CO2 world and this they do this because the CO2 has an impact on their neuro receptors and so the fear response they have is just the opposite of what it should be and there are other organisms that do well in a high CO2 world for example there studies that suggest that jellyfish do better in a high CO2 world so you could see there shift in the ecosystem this is all related to Ocean aidentification [Music] [Applause] [Applause] and what does that mean for humankind in our planet about one out of every seven people on average uh rely on Seafood for protein in their diet so we are very dependent on Seafood for five times before spaceship earth has witnessed major die offs our science scientific Navigators say global warming has become the sixth Extinction its speed now depends on how quickly the planet warms and that partly depends on feedback loops that we cannot control per for is something that is frozen for at least two summers in a row per Frost can be many things it can be behind me sediment that is frozen can be a lot of ice in the ground and we call that ground ice but it could it could also be rocks in power force there is actually a lot of organic carbon why is it important is that because when the Palm force is warming a lot of that carbon is being released and is being released to the ocean when we are next to the coast or it atmosphere and the subsequent release of carbon is what we call the feedback effect or feedback loop the way it works is that perfor gets warmer the lar that throws in the summer gets deeper and deeper every year and the carbon that was stored in the perm FR for tens of thousands of year gets released to the atmosphere then that carbon as greenhouse gas influences the climate also and it gets warmer and uh if the climate gets warmer then we get like more throwing of that active layer in the summer and the more throwing we have then the more carbon get activated so this is what we call the feedback PL because like one process influences the other and that goes on until probably all the carbon that is there stored in the Perma FR is used to be released in the atmosphere permafrost extends under all of the Arctic land masses but it also extends ends out to sea it relic of the last ice age if you have warm water the water melts the seabed the permafrost melts and that releases methane because there the subsea permafrost and methane is a very very powerful greenhouse gas it 20 times as powerful as carbon dioxide so if you release a lot of methane into the at atmosphere you going to accelerate global warming and that that at the [Applause] moment there and I think that there definitely some little ones right here in the surface above it the bottom of the lake is where organic matter which is dead plant animal remains is being digested by microbes in Russian they say that the lake is eating the permafrost and I really like that analogy because in fact it is when they digest that organic matter they produce carbon dioxide and methane methane does not like to stay in the water and it comes out of solution and forms bubbles but there coming back right there that example okay that was way [Music] upair but yes warming events can be very harmful today the world is just sort of starting to show signs of the conditions we saw at the end of the peran the end perion mass extinction happened about 251 million years ago it species on Earth and we start to think well how could a huge amount of um volcanic activity cause a global mass extinction like this and most of the interest focuses on not the lva itself but the gases that come out with volcanism I think the main culprit we think of is is the carbon dioxide it methane and so what we think happened at the end of the peran is that we get this sort of runaway greenhouse effect whereby um we methane and carbon dioxide warming up um the planet before you know it the world has just got so hot that it becomes extremely hard for life and we see a sort of a mass dying of of animals on land and in the sea both exactly at the same time we start of uh of that effect we the earli stages any report from the late perm would say bew be careful the world is is starting to break down and losing its ability to cope with greenhouse [Music] gases and the big unknown for us today is how fast fast things happen will this happen in 50 years or will it be will it happen in 5,000 years and it [Music] know we the history of our species like the one we now we a planet scaled influence and know it humans have become the most powerful force uh driving evolutionary change on the planet right now used to be you know just environmental change and now it us when you so many different factors that matter to the way Planet Works we between our awareness and our capacity to innovate and our potency are we destined like most species when we hit a resource limit to have a jagged rebound period or can we will this gift of foresight that we have smooth it out [Music] consciously a lot of that communication about education about awareness [Music] observation the more of that the better whether it young activist working in the forest the better off will run we have to get comfortable with reality that it is kind of a drama that we now for the first time have this ability to observe this [Music] stuff that means if you person right now particularly you have a special opportunity to engage and find some piece of this puzzle that you can actually affect by 2050 Things Are are not going to be the same as they were in a big way this is the first time we juncture in our history as a species that what a great time to be alive especially for young [Music] people	Success
Fossil Fuels and Their Impact on Earth's Atmospheric Balance | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOCUMENTARY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-F650A-FCw	SLICE Science	[Music] oh my God look at that picture over there coming up wow that pretty got a color film Jim a roll of color one of the great revelations in my lifetime that have come out of science that will be spoken about 3,000 years hence occurred on Christmas Eve of 1968 when Apollo went around the dark side of the moon for the first time in human history we saw not a a sunrise or moon rise but an earth rise in that sudden moment of Illumination we saw that we were not an infinite Horizon we were finite Planet floating in the Velvet void of space as the as the astronaut [Music] said we didn New Wealth but to return with a new vision of life itself and in doing so the whole Paradigm [Music] shifted [Music] our scientists have now had 50 years to study the shift through this new paradigm and to ask critical questions what fuels spaceship earth how sufficient are its provisions what controls its direction and how long can it [Music] sail this series is about what they [Music] learned people say to me I wonder what it be like to be on a spaceship and I say to you you don you [Music] astronaut [Music] I think be drift [Music] [Music] te [Music] these a ook [Music] SE and then um com into for for many centuries we were gazing outside of the planet we looked at the stars we looked at the Sun you know the copernican system and this made us think in a different way about God Humanity uh Power uh what [Music] on it was the outside look that created modernity if you like and in a sense if we look back onto Earth from out to space which is only possible if you have an space vessel Rockets things like that when you may start to think differently about our planet what we are doing to the planet what we are doing to ourselves so I guess it paradigm shift I think the last 50 years have been in particular particular advancement and systems thinking quite generally many disciplines have not yet understood that they still think you know reducing reducing in size and in focus and so on is the progress of science but it actually the progress of Science of the the last decade was taking the pieces and integrated them back so to speak to a holistic understanding [Music] modern science is system science if you [Music] like for [Music] [Music] for it planet it or it way this is one system which will have system properties which has properties which you cannot um uh you can analyze by looking just at the biology or just at the at the physics we now know that there are some uh negative feedback type mechanisms that keep the planet Earth relatively stable that help to stabilize the planet and they they do involve living organisms we have evolved on the Earth but for us to be here we require that the planet has been habitable for 4 billion years cuz it years of evolution for for us to to get here we now know that our ship began with a surface on fire and a toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide over eons our atmosphere evolved filling with oxygen and cooling the planet [Music] for [Music] know what transformed spaceship Earth atmosphere was the relationship between emerging life and our fuel source the Sun so let look oh yeah in general everything in the universe has to follow the second law thermodynamics that is order is being destroyed more or less by friction and other things processes and in the end you have just thermal waste if you like unless you have a constant influx of valuable energy like sunlight for example a system may actually work against the grain of thermodynamics and build ever more complexity that happening in our small corner of the Universe on planet Earth take the Sun away and everything will Decay and it will all go into a sort of chaotic State again uh so the sun is driving everything the sunlight has instigated in development of what is probably the biggest invention in the history of our planet that is photosynthesis so you can take an energy Quantum from the sunlight and combine it with CO2 and then you can create Sugar Plus oxid and this is the basic formula for our Evolution on this planet a sugar means you can create biomass of course you can build higher forms of proteins and and all that it a long long story at least a billion years [Music] long [Music] it seems like a miracle and indeed it is a miracle in a sense photosynthesis was invented nearly 3 billion years ago imagine what would have happened if photosynthesis had not been invented we would not be here that is for sure and nothing none of this would be here plants on the land like the algae in the oceans are shaping the overall environment of the planet over hundreds of millions of years all of the vascular plants today evolved about 350 400 million years ago and they they take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere which they use in their photosynthesis and then in their root systems they put that carbon dioxide into the soil and there it reacts with soil and rock and it is locked up the effect of these organisms on carb oxide over time and that is a big effect they are acting as as kind of cooling uh agents for the planet the atmosphere of Earth has 21% oxygen in it and oxygen is a is a very reactive gas and of course it reactivity which enables large complex animals to exist [Music] the interesting thing is not only do you create oxygen but you draw down the CO2 from the atmosphere that interesting thing yeah and you draw it down and you store it in biomass and so on a tree will fall into water so it cannot be oxidized again it will sink down to the ground and will be sequestered and this tiny little part of carbon that is taken out of the natural cycle that is the source of the so-called fossil fuels and it takes 500 million years to 1 billion year to create [Music] that but coal is typically produced from terrestrial plants you know swamps trees depending on the degree of qualification some parts of coal you can see beautifully uh preserved leaves of ferns bark of plant that wood in the trunk uh leaves and so forth so coal came from from Land Oil and Gas generally from the sea oil is an organic material mainly microorganisms you know algae it preserved in sediments basically it buried under heat of the organisms are transformed into [Music] oil if you look at what I collectively call hydrocarbons which is coal oil and gas we really got started on on coal first you know coal back in 1850 which is really the Industrial Revolution coal was about 18% of our energy Supply at that point and wood biomass was over 80% in 1850 that our only fossil hydrocarbon was cool arguably oil got started in Canada in Southwestern Ontario 1858 we over 160 years and as of the year end of 2011 we burned about 1.2 trillion barrels of oil what is stunning to me about that consumption is that 90% of it has been burned since 1961 and 8 50% of it has been burned since 1988 so we barrels of oil per year um we Barrel Fields in terms of conventional oil we barrels 3 to four barrels for every barrel we year you know 32 billion barrels of oil every year it oil uh if you divide that into what the books that [Music] gone the Earth had a lot of hydrocarbons to go after but now we geological limit [Music] you know if you look at the traditional coal mining areas like Appalachia in eastern US production for [Music] years [Music] the world has a lot of coal there question about that but here again how much of that is resource versus how much is reserves how much of that Total Resource which is enormous how much of that can we extract profitably using existing technology well it turns out probably a lot less than has been estimated in the past in the US where we mountaintop removal coal mining you know this is a maybe a relatively cheap way of getting that coal out of the ground but it [Music] desperation well the thin black seene that you see here is cold of course then the other elements here are the Rock and Sandstone uh that form the mountain so the mountains are like a layer cake so the process of mountain top removal means that they take all of this top off to get to that little bit of coal the ratio is 20 to1 maybe more there are other ways to get to these seams not necessarily this one uh because it way but there that I have to mine every lump of coal in the state of West Virginia either they put off two shots just over here from us dust my God lot of money they say I left that knows anything about this mountain I left oh heer my grandpa and grandma we didn have no watches we had a a bail that she run at one time dinner was ready she run a two times they the Beast War course I spent a lot of time out in underground 28 years I it they started this work here about 3 4 years ago take the topest mountain off and most is cold out going overseas China Som days they go wonder what happened they the better way getting this coal you trees you still have the mountains look what they what they done I mean for Miles you see look look over H and just just part of it this is just part of I feel awful it [Music] burel we Barrel scrapers all the time but we shouldn going on so the world faces a coal Supply shortfall as well as oil and natural gas all through the 20th century the amount of oil that we were extracting on an annual basis was increasing year after year after year um for the last seven or eight years it off and that looking for more oil so what there well what fields are are depleting and rates of production from those old super giant oil fields that we found back in the 40s and 50s and 60s those rates of production are declining when a conventional oil field starts to reach its middle age let then efforts are usually put into water pumping to to force the the remaining oil toward the wellbore he for before after for for conventional oil is already in Decline and we three Saudi arabas worth of new conventional oil just to maintain that that decline on a very very shallow level going forward and the only place to really find a good portion of that is unconventional oil and that that is why we [Music] stuff there return energy investment you have to use a certain amount of energy to drill a well to build pipelines to produce sea oil and really that depends on the productivity of of the wells that that you drill the net energy yield of drilling a vertical well into the Garfield in Saudi Arabia back in the 50s was was probably at least 100 to one so we invested a a barrel of energy to net out 100 barrels of of useful [Music] energy now we Frontiers very deep water we water Horizon multi- hundreds of millions of dollars per well and so the net energy return on that is probably somewhere around 25 to one uh with we like tar sounds only 20% of the tar sounds are are shallow enough to be surface minable and that to1 80% are only recoverable by so-called insitu methods that have a net energy return of about 2.9 to1 we about two bar barrels of useful energy we wouldn had [Applause] Alternatives if we look at at things like tide oil or Shale oil is another synonym for it the annual depletion rate is 40% per year not 4% for all of the conventional oil pools so we have to find enough new production to make up for 40% decline every year to keep production flat and that requires a lot of drilling and and a lot of hydraulic fracturing really if you look at things like tight Oil we space on the surface to put more [Music] Wells and there is a side that right off to your right as we drive up here you straight down the runway off to the left there there and that rig that drilling under the speedway they can be fenced in they can be concealed they can be burned up plant trees around them they nondescript I mean you can make them fit in pretty much any any environment they Wells a year so that they can offset production and increase production however uh they run out of locations at some point but if you look at the declines it have to be offset every year it more and more and more wells will have to be drilled just to maintain production let alone uh let alone grow it and what that oil production from the two biggest tight oil fields in the world will likely be a bubble that will last maybe 10 to 12 years consider that the oil that we today took 500 million years to accumulate 500 million years of solar energy preserved in that oil and we every year that works out to about 5 million years worth of solar energy burned every year in terms of our oil consumption and 14,000 years of solar energy every day so that tells us one thing that certain this a non-renewable finite resource it foreseeable lifespan of the human race as a species on this this planet and this is the big intervention we are seeing now you have to imagine that what was geologically sequestered and biologically through photosynthesis over 500 million years or more is being released within a few Centuries by the Industrial Revolution you can call it the great oxidation because it happens within a few centuries [Music] only [Music] the burning of fossil fuels is taking spaceship earth backward in time to the era of volcanoes to the primordial atmosphere that existed before complex life [Music] arose [Music] you know it the Earth the more we realize how delicate things are life on Earth as we know it has a very small layer of carbon in the atmosphere to think the greenhouse effect involves radiation from the Sun hitting the Earth and staying wrapped in a warm blanket of carbon that keeps the temperature just right a Goldilocks scenario that we don [Music] with [Music] uh 350 parts per million is the safe upper limit of carbon in the atmosphere right now we 400 much higher than the atmospheric conditions on which civilization developed and that life on Earth is dependent on since the Industrial Revolution we put enough extra carbon into the atmosphere that instead of a goldilock situation with temperatures that are just right in the right places we of a sudden overheating the Earth it basically means that over time humanity has burned enough fossil fuels emitted enough extra carbon in the atmosphere that we have a fundamentally different climate than we entirety of human civilization [Music] we know that because an atmosphere with a higher concentration of carbon will hold more heat from the Sun and we know that when it holds that heat it increases the temperature of the earth and this has tremendous effects we are heating up the planet in an unprecedented way but we also take away from future Generations a benign environment the environment in which our civilization has been created in the so-called hallene over the last 12,000 years we disrupt it completely that one thing so you change the life support system and a second is we take away from them the access to cheap energy if you burn all the precious stuff within a few decades only yeah there yeah so what we have to do is we have to find a way way to get cheap and uh if you like Democratic

The Rising Dangers of Space Junk: A Growing Mess Up There | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOCUMENTARY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znlObl_XhGk	SLICE Science	foreign since the end of the 1950s mankind has launched thousands of satellites into space Rockets play satellites in orbit where they follow an elliptical path around the Earth oh they Circle above our heads at incredible speeds for several years and undertake precise missions for example photographing the Earth to establish weather forecasts relaying telephone television and radio signals between two locations on Earth or in the case of military satellites spying on other countries controlled from the ground they are equipped with computers cameras and sensors fuel batteries and solar panels provide the energy required to accomplish their missions [Music] some break down while others stop working when they ran out of power they become orbital debris circling the earth at over 17 000 miles per hour sometimes they hit other objects generating thousands of smaller pieces today nearly a million objects larger than half an inch have been counted [Music] being struck by orbital debris is a constant threat for all our satellites and risks sending our society into the past if nothing is done about it the problem began 60 years ago at the end of the 1950s mankind realized that Earth space in the middle of the Cold War the Soviet Union triggered the space race when it launched Sputnik the world satellite Cooper at the national Center for space studies in France rocket scientist Christoph Bernal evokes the origins of the problem the problem the orbital debris problem started at the same time as the first launch on October the 4th 1957 with the launch of Sputnik 1. after 21 days Sputnik stopped working [Music] it was a non-functioning artificial object this is what we call orbital zebri [Music] sputnik when it disintegrated in the Earth atmosphere three months after its launch but the small satellite had Global consequences determined to catch up with the Soviets the Americans created NASA the Soviets Advance was extremely important to astronautics the Soviets had all the firsts first satellite launch first person in space and they raised the bar for the Americans who had to increase their missions in order to catch up the Americans launched a series of 17 consecutive manned missions named Apollo at the time nobody was concerned about leaving wastes or even radioactive elements in space from 1967 to 1988 the Soviet Union launched spy satellites fueled by nuclear reactors but some of these satellites were defective [Applause] [Music] in September 1977 American Radars noticed that Russian satellite Cosmos 954 was making erratic maneuvers it was the first nuclear Alert in the space age on January the 12th 1978 the Americans contacted Soviet authorities regarding the satellite [Music] days later the Russians confirmed that they had lost control of their device when the satellite re-entered the atmosphere it scattered radioactive material all over Northern Canada foreign the newspapers were quick to report the demise of the Russian satellite in North America in the midst of the Cold War soon became clear that orbital debris could be a potential danger to the population on Earth [Music] foreign but it wasn even launching satellites into orbit creates debris each rocket launch has left debris in orbit leave your satellite old satellites have stayed up there and that find ourselves in today during the years of the Space Race satellites were not the only items put into orbit European Space Agency engineer radica Yin has analyzed the orbital debris created by rocket launches when we launch a satellite the first stage of the rocket provides enough energy to go 10 kilometers in altitude and then it falls back into the ocean the last stage takes the satellite into orbit but then it also stays in orbit itself and becomes debris [Music] the upper stages of a rocket along with fuel tanks and no scones are systematically left in [Music] over the last 60 years much of this debris has accumulated while some has disintegrated working alongside the European space agencies space scientists Noelia Sanchez Ortiz analyzes the circumstances and the destiny of orbital debris come mainly from satellites that we have put in space once they stop working historically we they remain orbiting around the earth unless the satellite is placed in a very low orbit and then it ends up falling in our atmosphere at low altitude debris moves at speeds of 18 000 miles an hour but the Earth atmosphere gradually slows it down and when pieces eventually fall to Earth they are mostly destroyed the air molecules are compressed by the speed of the debris which creates heat and eventually combustion causing the pieces to break up during the day there is little to see but at night this Burning waste sometimes looks like shooting stars problems arise when this debris does not burn up completely in the atmosphere in 1997 the 550 pound fuel tank of a Delta II rocket crashed near Georgetown in Texas in 2001 the third stage of a Delta II rocket landed 150 miles from Saudi Arabia in 2011 the nurse coat of a Sawyer rocket was found in Martinique and in 2013 several titanium tanks appeared in the garden of an electrician in Texas so far nobody has been killed but is merely a question of time in September 2016 the second stage of a Falcon 9 rocket crashed into an outbuilding on a small island near Java [Music] thank you it seems that sometimes the sky really does fall down since orbital debris poses a threat to the earth population it is now cataloged and the risk evaluated we estimate that there are about 36 000 objects orbiting the Earth we can add the 30 000 or so objects that have already fallen back to Earth and they will stay there for some time since all rocket launchers including military operations are monitored it is relatively easy to know what is circling above our heads all the artificial objects in space satellites and debris orbiting above our heads represents a mass of around 9000 tons to give you an idea the Eiffel Tower is 7500 tons so a bit more than that vast area that is spaced an Eiffel Tower is more like a cloud of dust so in order to show a representation of the debris we need to enlarge them in real life the pieces are considerably smaller the suburbs of our planet contain a mixture of working satellites surrounded by circulating waste [Music] but the suburbs are nonetheless organized satellites around our Earth use three different orbits furthest from the earth is geostationary orbit a thin layer 22 000 miles away [Music] [Music] satellites in this orbit remain constantly above the same point on the equator and provide our telecommunications telephone and Computer Link ups and television broadcasts [Applause] [Music] each satellite is spaced on average of 40 miles apart foreign [Music] satellites need to be removed when they have served their time their last fuel reserves are used to de-orbit them to another area [Music] here the satellite is moved higher to a graveyard orbit further from Earth where it will not interfere with anything medium earth orbit situated between 1200 and 22 000 miles in altitude is avoided this vast zone is occupied by radio navigation satellites like Galileo if one of these satellites breaks down it is placed into an intermediate orbit where it will not interfere with any others but if it runs out of fuel nothing can be done finally the closest orbit to earth is known as low earth orbit and situated below 1 200 miles in altitude this is where the last 60 years of space exploration has left the most debris and the only way of getting rid of debris in this area is to send it into Earth disintegrates [Music] India there are different areas on Earth where objects can re-enter with almost no risk because they are far from populations for example there is an area in the South Pacific which is very very big and where we tend to re-enter large objects if the satellite still has fuel it is possible to control its movements in low medium and geostationary orbits as long as it is still functioning that some satellites can hurtle added control even if they still have fuel one of the problems we have with satellites is that from time to time they break down and we don they worked on Monday Tuesday Wednesday and on Thursday bam broken and we no warning there anything was wrong foreign operators are loath to talk about malfunctions for fear of losing credibility yet most failures are caused by Nature interfering with safety measures when we analyze the cause of these malfunctions it can for example be a result of a solar flare [Music] during solar storms our sun releases huge amounts of energy that disperses electrically charged particles into space Earth shield protecting us from particles visible during the Northern Lights [Music] but satellites are like sitting ducks solar radiation is capable of wiping out navigation systems and despite being protected with high-tech gold foil it is estimated that a dozen or so satellites are destroyed each year by solar flares turning them into orbital debris [Music] space is an infinite empty space with some junk moving around above our heads and these objects pose two problems first when they are in orbit they there for a long time for example an object at an altitude of 600 miles will stay there for a thousand or two thousand years secondly during the course of these thousand or two thousand years they are moving at speeds of 18 000 miles an hour eighteen thousand miles an hour for a thousand years is a lot so the probability of crashing into something during that time is very high until 2007 experts tracked around 12 000 large pieces of junk but since then three major events have caused the situation to degenerate the most serious involved Cosmos 2251 a Russian satellite in low earth orbit that suddenly stopped working the Russians could no longer communicate with it and were unable to deorbit it to Earth [Music] foreign trajectory of the same altitude a brand new American satellite called iridium 33 was in orbit [Music] the impact sent debris flying in all directions [Music] around two and a half thousand pieces larger than three inches and many other smaller fragments were ejected into space posing a threat to all the devices in low earth orbit [Music] this Collision proves that an out of control object in low orbit is a danger to all working satellites another event worthy of Star Wars took place when China decided to deliberately destroy a weather satellite that was no longer in use using a ballistic missile armed with an infrared seeker and a warhead [Music] it was an arrogant show of strength by Chinese authorities with no concern for the consequences [Music] on the 15th of November 2021 the Russians returned fire with a noodle missile [Music] its Target was a decommissioned satellite called Cosmos 1408 [Music] [Music] the resulting explosion scattered 1500 pieces of large debris into low orbit in all directions these events were arrogant shows of strength by Major Powers with no concern for the consequences everybody is talking about the events caused by the Chinese and Russian governments destroying a satellite on purpose we all now know that these types of events are the greatest source of a risk of collision to our satellites in space as a result there are now more than a million pieces of debris larger than half an inch circling the earth and some of these pieces come not from satellites but from Rockets in the fuel tank of a normal rocket that takes satellites into orbits you have one chamber where liquid oxygen and another with liquid nitrogen and I sure you remember from school that when these two guesses mix it becomes nitrous oxide and it explodes and that happens again and again in space not all the fuel is used to the last drop this Reserve fuel mixes and instead of having an intact upper level you have a thousand pieces of debris which remain in orbit like a pandemic this junk proliferates and risks creating even more debris this phenomenon is known as Kessler syndrome in honor of the NASA consultant who described analyzed and Quantified it we currently have enough objects in Earth orbit once every 10 years we expect two objects to run together and create a major breakup [Music] Dawn Kessler proposed the scenario back in 1978 since then it has been proven multiple times like the cosmos iridium equation back in 2009 about every five years we expect collisions between some large object and a large fragment to also produce some debris [Music] Don Kessler also predicted that the collisions would have a cascading effect where each Collision increases the likelihood of further collisions the issue becomes when this happens an object can come in and hit the satellite and produce a spray of particles that are very numerous in number for the smallest particles that those can go on and because they traveling so fast can damage spacecraft then you also produce about a hundred big enough fragments that will go on and hit another satellite in the same way and break that satellite up and so you have this slow cascading phenomena going on [Music] this theory was proven accurate in 1996 when debris from Ariane rocket launched 10 years before crossed paths with a French military satellite called Cerise [Music] knocking out a 10-foot stabilization boom and causing Cerise to Tumble out of control this incident is just one example of such a chain reaction in space non-functioning satellites and Rocket leftovers have created clouds of debris traveling around the world at 18 000 miles an hour hitting working satellites and creating even more debris [Music] this proliferation could endanger a huge range of activities on Earth foreign it a major part of our daily lives [Music] we all expect to open our mobile phone and look for a place where we want to go and find the directions to get there we use satellite positioning technology in the same way when we go on a trip we withdraw money at an ATM in America and we obtain that money thanks to satellite telecommunications that connect with our bank in Europe it smartphones bank cards or GPS systems nowadays we wouldn satellites yet the proliferation of debris risks compromising today constantly diversifying satellite services so all space agencies have to take Serious risks each time they launch the European Space Agency if we are waiting for a situation where our uncertainty volume is completely empty that would mean we could never launch so believe it or not we are launching despite of the possibility of having conjunctions with objects because otherwise there would never be in a green light for launch the risk is now proven and even Quantified the odds of losing a satellite are five percent part of it is the risk of being hit by debris the other parts are simple there is complicated Hardware that can break causing the satellite to be lost but the likelihood of losing a satellite can quickly reach 10 or 20 percent with the increase in orbital debris the European Space Agency estimates that the risk of collision will rise to 20 percent by 2038. so one out of every five satellites would not complete its Mission it huge figure space agencies have had to look at ways of negotiating this Minefield and detecting the circling waste since 1957 the United States has been using a space surveillance Network to predict where and when orbital debris will enter the Earth [Music] they have established a catalog of the debris that is currently in orbit and use this to determine which country owns the debris that is entering the atmosphere they can also warn NASA if debris is at risk of interfering with their satellites over time as the number of artificial objects in orbit has multiplied this system has been refined and computerized but in Europe a similar space surveillance system was not put in place until 40 years later in 1996 when debris from the Ariane rocket damaged military satellite Cerise the French Ministry of Defense created a system known as Krav [Music] itz system a space events network is our main sensor that allows us to detect objects that orbit around 250 to 600 miles in altitude as long as they are large enough to be detected by radar in other words if they are the size of a large washing machine to detect orbiting satellites up to 600 miles above France even when it the system uses a particular radar that makes real-time calculations to follow and anticipate the trajectories of thousands of satellites the grav system was able to detect 30 or so Chinese and American spy satellites that had not been cataloged previously today international relations in space are a mixture and an extension of those on the ground in other words there is as much Mutual Aid as there is competition or sometimes open confrontations France agreed to keep quiet about the Spy satellites but in return they asked the Americans for access to their orbital debris catalog this catalog is considerably more detailed than the European version since the Americans can detect objects as small as four inches we deal with the problem of small objects by franco-american cooperation that allows us to retrieve information even at the confidential level this constant space surveillance is efficient and allows civilian and Military satellites to avoid collisions with orbital debris if there is a risk ground-based operators can move their satellites slightly out of their orbit these Maneuvers happen more and more often particularly for the largest satellite of all time the International Space Station this inhabited satellite is threatened by debris several times a year [Music] around [Music] [Applause] the station that [Music] way in space to avoid orbital debris with an identified trajectory the space station has to be moved from its course in 2012 it avoided a piece of debris from the collision between the Iridium and Cosmos satellites three years previously in 2021 the space station was forced to slalom five times between flying junk this constant threat has become part of the astronaut the space station is on the Collision Course with a small piece of space junk as we is beeping as a warning we have to take the ISS into a higher orbit for this we have to turn on the engines for 37 seconds and that is actually the only time in which we can measure or feel any acceleration on board suddenly we are no longer weightless but we are pushed backwards by the engines of the space station come back to me [Music] correct sometimes the ballistic data about debris is imprecise in which case no risks are taken and the astronauts are told to evacuate the station urgently they take refuge in the Escape module which can be separated from the station and could return the astronauts to Earth [Music] second but evacuation isn time frequently orbital debris is not detected if it is smaller than four inches [Music] nowadays there are around 150 million pieces of junk that are too small to be tracked by radars in order to avoid this Menace satellites and the space station need to be protected in Freiburg in Germany scientists from The fraunhofer Institute test shielding material using a super fast accelerator known as a space gun this space gun fires tiny metal balls at various shielding materials series of Chambers reproduces conditions in space they are filled with light gases and accelerate the balls close to the same speed as orbital debris 15 000 miles an hour at this speed the behavior of collisions is very different from that on Earth during a car crash for instance when a car hits a wall or another car at 30 miles an hour it is deformed and thousands of pieces of debris are created as the material fragments but at hyperbolocity speeds above 6700 miles an hour a collision creates different physical phenomena is fragmented so parts of data vaporized and ionized and the other parts can pressure loads which we had after behind the Shockwave hyper velocity a one millimeter ball has more energy than a baseball flying at 60 miles an hour reinforced doors protect the laboratory the high-speed camera Which films more than a million frames per second records the moment of impact as a safety precaution no one can stay in the room while the space gun is being fired [Music] thank you the results of these tests on different satellite components are then analyzed the International Space Station we tested Severus Shields but we also try to test the components like a space solar cells or components like tanks which are located behind the walls of a satellite using Ultra slow motion images the Space Gun T manages to understand and model what happens during a collision [Music] their work allows them to come up with structures that are both light and resistant to hyper velocity impacts they have just proved that doubling or tripling insulation layers can protect satellite components hit by debris smaller than four inches the first layer fragments for debris the second dissipates its energy and protects the third layer thanks to these experiments scientists have been able to design satellites that are resistant to small debris but even today we are unable to protect astronauts when they are outside their vehicles during space walks they remain exposed to small debris that can or seen by the human eye since they are traveling so fast even a minor impact would puncture an astronaut death [Music] thank you H1 [Music] because of this risk NASA is actively developing robots that could replace humans to accomplish maintenance operations outside the spacecraft [Applause] [Music] though even robots would be unable to withstand a collision with debris of more than half an inch [Music] obviously the less debris there is the better cultures around the world have tried to establish rules for the non-proliferation of large debris as they have done for land-based nuclear weapons for example satellite operators are asked to empty all fuel on board their space vehicles all Rockets are equipped with systems to vent or burn excess fuel A system that is tested on the ground before each launch [Music] [Applause] satellites are limited to a maximum 25-year lifespan in orbit finally objects in low earth orbit that do not completely burn up on re-entry are steered towards broad ocean areas for their final impact however these rules are not always respected particularly since there is no governing body to police offenders and as time passes the amount of junk increases we can clean out by the atmosphere and that unsustainable environment there problem clean out the debris that is orbiting around the earth well you have to bring back some of the objects that we based on the polluter pays principle each country is supposed to finance the elimination of its own debris since 2013 Space Engineers have been creating a new profession space garbage guy the idea is to come up with robotic systems that can deal with large pieces of garbage by sending them into a junk incinerator the Earth [Music] but it debris moves like an asteroid spinning around as it orbits because of gravity [Music] around the world the borages have been coming up with robot satellites that could capture debris and deorbit it that remove debris project at the Surrey Space Center in England in the real Mission you with uncorporated debris that may be spinning Space Engineers use technical terms but their projects seem more like children Technologies we have on our mission is the harpoon it seems unlikely that the team is developing a harpoon capable of attaching onto a piece of debris in order to drag it into the atmosphere in our mission the remove debris Mission the thing we impact mechanism of the Harpoon on a natural Target plate [Music] the team is still at the experimental stage where it is testing a miniature Harpoon on a stationary Target [Music] first attempt failed the Harpoon did not leave its sheath because of an electromagnetic problem second attempt hopefully the Harpoon should be able to impact exactly where you want it to hit three two one fire the trial and error method is a long process but the team is improving its system the first full-scale test in space in 2019 was a success [Music] fully when that goes into space because of the lack of gravity the alignment should be much better than the tests we can perform on Earth the trial and error method is a long process but step-by-step the team is improving its system the first full-scale tests in space will take place in 2020 the Harpoon is not the only tool envisaged by Space Engineers the South Africa space agency created as recently as 2010 has come up with its own cleaning solutions that it hopes to Market later [Music] one of their projects involves building a small satellite capable of unfolding its tentacles to capture debris hence its name Medusa Medusa will enclose the debris and drag mover to where it needs to be either to grave orbit or you decrease your altitude and eventually tossed as debris back into atmosphere and let it burn up as the re-entry another advantage of the menusa satellites is that they can be launched in Squadron so as tests from the International Space Station have shown Medusa is very light it grams it is designed to be put onto cubesats which is satellite the size a cubesat is a small multi-use satellite in the shape of a four inch Cube developed by a Californian University dozens of them can be launched at a time which keeps costs down it who have no other way of running experiments in space [Music] coupled with cubesats that have already proven themselves Medusa should be able to eliminate debris over a long period at the moment there like harpoons a lot of them are one U so you fire one time you miss you miss the uniqueness of Medusa is that it allows multiple attempts so the idea is to use it many times as you can to remove small targets but the drawback with Medusa is that it only targets small space junk for large non-functioning satellites other tools are necessary which opens up the problem of financing these operations [Music] unfortunately none of these Solutions is ready for use nobody is ready to pay the high price necessary to get rid of large orbital debris the bigger it is the more it causes problems because any damage creates more junk the largest non-operational piece is envisad an observation satellite the size of a bus that was launched in 2002 by the European Space Agency the time the agency was trying to get the biggest return from their investment but today Redding distances himself from his predecessor they just want to maximize the revenue they they use the last drop of fuel for their operations rather than using the fuel for deorbiting and this is the the problem when it was built it was the largest observation satellite ever constructed after five years of activity and having circled the Earth around thirty thousand times it should have been deorbited before the end of its mission [Music] however ten years after being launched the European Space Agency lost all control of nbisat on April the 8th 2012 today it is a ticking time bomb as it crosses paths with many other working satellites [Music] the situation is so critical that the European Space Agency is funding an ambitious program to try and remove and besat from its but we believe that throwing a net could be an option because throwing a net means you will later have a connection by a tether and that means they captured envisad inside the net can be pulled to test this space net Engineers use an aircraft to recreate spaces zero gravity conditions [Music] at the top of its parabolic flight in the form of a bell it releases passengers and objects from Earth gravity for several seconds enough time to test a miniature version of the net they will use to catch an 8-ton satellite tests have prove that adding weight to the corners of the net allows it to enclose the body of a satellite without snagging on its fragile solar panel now all they have to do is build a tractor satellite that can retrieve invisat and return it to Ports certainly more heavy than the remover vehicle when you have to remove something which is more heavy than yourself it push because it keeps a more stable scenario [Music] though it is essential for space safety even this project is still in the theoretical stages for one simple reason we have investigated the problem to look for a solution but it would cost half a billion euros [Music] for Technical and economic reasons no robot garbage collector is ready for work at this time for this to become workable the cleanup operation would need to be free like if it was a passenger on another mission and what seems to be quite promising is what we call space pugs the space tug would be multifunctional a kind of space-based Swiss Army knife it would refill a satellite on Tuesday it would repair another on Wednesday it would inspect a satellite on Thursday it would do maintenance and on Friday it would return to Earth and it would gather up a piece of space junk and send it into the atmosphere however according to the Airbus Engineers who are currently developing space tags some technological problems remain what we cannot do at the moment is a scheduled rendezvous with a Target that has not been designed for this purpose for example an old satellite or a piece of orbital debris a space Rendezvous is an organized and controlled meeting between two space devices we need to develop new autonomous technologies that can manage on their own they would be based on Vision sensors that would scan the environment and analyze the contents of the images they acquire and this data analysis will detect the parts of the objects that interest it in order to be able to catch them and manipulate them the Space Tag project is still being studied but thanks to Major funding the first efficient cleaning service may come into use by 2025. as well as the European space agency and envisatt space tax already have other new clients private companies are currently sending thousands of satellites into low earth orbit to create a new kind of network these projects known as Mega constellations have already become a reality with satellites like spacex starlink or the one web project oneweb to convince America well as European Airbus to make massive investments in the fabrication of a series of hundreds of satellites its aim to guarantee internet access to the most remote parts of the globe [Music] oneweb has designed this building and will soon be launching a constellation of satellites to bridge the digital divide provide high-speed Broadband access to the half of the world the four billion people without access today in the initial constellation we to have 882 satellites in 2022 the number of Mega constellation satellites in orbit exceeds the number of satellites launched since the beginning of the Space Race this has raised concerns among spaced every specialists Mega constellations are the big thing at the moment for example Starling by SpaceX Elon Musk today he has about 2 000 satellites in orbit in a first generation that will make twelve thousand then a second generation that will make forty two thousand there is also one web there are about 500 satellites and there are many other constellations like this we expect to have about 100 000 new satellites in orbit by 2030. yet the promoters of these Mammoth projects maintain that they have taken all the precautions necessary there are some things we really need to think very carefully about and creating some regulatory environment so that the deorbit and the operations are done in a manner consistent with long-term use of space for Humanity we definitely have to think about how to clean up space debris but we must also consider the option of imposing a space traffic system in the same way that we have a system for Aviation there is also the danger that space will be filled with even more garbage if there are failures there are satellites that break down which will then circle around as junk and that that there will be more space to breathe it is well known that wherever people go they leave rubbish in their wake [Music] we know where the ISS is we know where our satellites are we internal resiliency and redundancy to make sure we have control and management of our satellite for the deorbit phase despite reassurances from their operators Mega constellation satellites do sometimes stop working today with all these new satellites that we into space thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of satellites there but there are currently no International regulations in place [Music] the solution would have to come from above from the United Nations legislating and forcing people to get involved in cleaning up the space debris yet most of the people engaged in space exploration claim to be advocating for policies we that regulates this it different groups thinking about regulating it a bunch of different countries that have a variety of thoughts about regulation without actually putting meat on the bone the future of the space industry is promising but on the contrary the future of space orbits is more worrying there are more players putting satellites into orbit not just large Nations but also smaller Nations that have this capacity their governments and their private companies while waiting for space to apply the polluter pays rule orbital debris is a major concern for satellite operators and although few people on Earth are aware of the problem one day soon our lives could be spinning out of control yes foreign [Music]	Success
Genius Insects: Building Intricate Dream Homes | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOCUMENTARY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6zbe6S0X5Q	SLICE Science	foreign [Music] has been greatly inspired by insects in themselves their structure and their nests to elaborate our own Creations engineers and Architects owe many patents to the honeycombed nests of bees the air conditioning systems of termite Hills and the underground cities of ants insects are capable of creating together nests of extraordinary Ingenuity and complexity so we can really say they are insect architects [Music] oh yeah hey Christian look there it it weak branch there must be a fair number of insects maybe three thousand what do you think of that I do you think you can get it down without too much difficulty if you can get all of it to put it through the scanner that would be a really fun operation [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thanks Christian it in any case it a look at that you can clearly see the protective structure that Shields The Colony from bad weather and we can really see what the workers have done all the half circles that each work has made when they vegetable fibers it Earth and stone to build their houses you see it here they actually go and find bits of wood which they mix with saliva and that becomes paper [Music] Eric darizon is a specialist in the study of the nests of social insects Hornets wasps bees termites and ants to describe the Ingenuity of their construction he regularly observes them thanks to a scanner We compare different types of nests made by the Asian Hornet and we compared for example two nests a spherical nest and a nest in the form of a droplet of water The Nest which came from the outside and was therefore exposed to bad weather has a protective Hood which gives the nest its cone shape and which protects the colony against the weather whereas a spherical Nest which is found indoors has no protective Hood so in fact the Asian Hornet is capable of adapting the structure of its nest to the environment in which It [Music] in this way some winged Architects adapt their dwellings to all environments [Music] now the sheets are starting to appear you can even see the pillars which are between each sheet in fact it sheets attached to the others there you can distinguish clearly all the sheets constructed by the workers with their alveols pointing downwards so where do they pass between them in fact there passage between the envelope and the periphery of the sheets which allows all the individuals passage from the top to the bottom of the nests and there single opening at the base of the nest which allows the insects to go out there in fact the role of each individual each worker is to go and look outside for nutrition to feed all the larvae because each alveol contains a developing lava hatched by the queen other workers will seek out construction material to build a nest for the nest you see at first it ping-pong ball it builds that Nest which we call a foundation Nest Then She lays a first series of eggs in the little alveol she has made about between a dozen and 20 or so the first generation of workers becomes adult and after a while they add a second sheet below that which they will again enlarge afterwards and so on the nest will grow thicker with each sheet and in height with the number of sheets which are added one on top of the others there of my colleagues which is how can insects construct such complex structures in fact there Foreman no plans the only explanation that we can find is that work is automatically regulated that each insect will participate in the construction by being influenced by the construction Itself by that meaning that the construction itself would be a major stimulus and some insects would be sensitive to that stimulus others wouldn intensity the insect would participate in the construction [Music] observing a hornet microscope Eric durazee has established that the nest is constituted of thousands of Many Colored fragments each worker attracted by the collective stimulus will deposit in turn fragments of different materials observing termite nests using the scanner has revealed that these six-legged Engineers are capable of including protective solutions for their habitats in their plans if we study an African termite hill using the scanner we can visualize the position of all the chambers inside the structures and we can locate the tunnels so we suppose it hypothesis that this has an application in defense terms for example we could have an ant colony which attacks the termite colony and if the ants succeed in penetrating piercing the external envelope and getting into a chamber on the periphery of the nest the termites just have to block a tunnel to defend themselves which will serve to block the intrusion [Music] thanks to Eric durazee insect Builders now have their own exhibitions [Music] but that was in his garden no it was in a farm it was a car which was under a shelter it got up to the seat level and then after you see it went over the seat and started to fill up right to the roof and how long did that take there this Nest it took about two weeks over several years some Hornet and wasp nests get bigger and bigger without any real explanation why the record is held by a nest of vascular wasps which was over two meters high and one meter wide for Eric duruzay the study of Nest construction is just a start but this science is advancing bees and wasps make six-sided alveoli but why six-sided this has been an enigma for a long time hails as a brilliant American mathematician and he thinks he has resolved this mystery the question that mathematicians have been asking is why does the honeycomb have six sides anciently there are two theories one group felt that the hexagon had six sides because of the b six feet the mathematicians of the day favored another theory and that was that the honeycomb was somehow the most efficient shape possible for the hive it has taken two thousand years and Thomas Hale to name the hexagon as champion of all polygons there to show that a hexagon is better than a triangle imagine the three pieces in here as honey I can take one of the Pieces away and reassemble the other pieces so that they form a triangle when they triangle I have the same perimeter that I did before but there for the last bit of honey he a house with every room identical using as few materials as possible but how do they build such perfectly symmetrical Combs surely due to the cohesion within the colony and the specific task attribution during the first days of Life the young bees clean the hollow cells of the brood enabling the queen to lay again after the third day their glands sighted in the head activate and from then they can feed the larvae um from the tenth day the wax glands developed to the detriment of the nourishing glands the bees then formed themselves into living scaffolding bringing the beeswax up to the Masons in charge of building the alveoli the maiden bee is today the common point between an aircraft and a high-class ski the bees nest technique using empty hexagonal alveoli placed in staggered rows is used to reinforce the solidity of many structures without making it any heavier cars telescopes buildings constructed with light marble also owe many of their patents to bees [Music] if the rigid cells of the bees can Inspire us many other insects have suggested different technological innovations this science even has a name Bionics bionics is first inspired by The Living World which can be understood from the word itself more specifically we work on bionics which leads to progress in resistance so we look for things that insects have for example to be more resistant for a detailed example that means that when an engineer is confronted by a problem he seek out those insects which have been confronted with the same problems and what solutions they have developed to respond to that problem whereas traditional wind generators only use 30 of wind energy this new system is inspired directly by beeswings which greatly optimize efficiency [Music] perhaps tomorrow use nature as their model even the dung beetle this excrement heater has given the bionic scientists ideas Gautier Chappelle has noticed that the feet of dung beetles are always clean thanks to a microscopic feature that covers them thus the structure has been copied to improve the blades of bulldozers so that less Earth sticks to them and they remain efficient [Music] the microscopic surface of the dermal sheath that is to say the karapas of the namibian beetle has also been copied by architects this is a beetle in the driest deserts in the world which is nonetheless watered by the water vapor in the wind and the special form of its dermal sheath allows drops of water to collect at first and then to drain through a kind of gutter into its mouth and in fact by imitating this structure uniquely its form we can collect water in the same way this can especially be applied in any case potentially on buildings in similar climatic environments such as the Canary Islands the coast of Chile or the South African Coast another Beetle possesses a forest fire detector because it needs burnt wood to lay its eggs today Engineers have reproduced that detection system to automatically detect fires in intelligent buildings the dermal sheath of insects is a true source of inspiration all around in the buildings of the future we able to optimize the circulation of fluids especially water based on the veins of insects dragonflies for example Supply very good model and that a way of minimizing energy expenditure associated with fluid circulation in buildings [Music] we can also optimize information circulation on the internet through the inspiration offered by ant circulation by the way in which the ants bring back their Harvest to the antness while reducing the distance of their travel as much as possible to always be able to find the shortest route to this box of food the ants have a secret they move about and leave chemical signals behind them pheronomes eventually the straightest route to the food box will be more marked and the Ants will naturally choose the path with the most indicators Engineers have managed to re-transcribe these chemical signals into mathematical algorithms to avoid traffic jams in the cities of the future ant algorithms will be applied [Music] in fact when traffic is fluid ants leave a dense chemical Trace which indicates the right direction when the traffic is slow the Mark is weaker it to be able to avoid the jams routers direct information in the same way on the net and can also do the same with vehicles to the more fluid paths foreign IST ants use pheromones they also guide ant Architects to conceive their underground cities the very small space between Chambers is obtained thanks to construction plans left by their chemical signals [Music] by watching butterflies very closely bionic scientists have also found strange Innovations for the use of the Futures buildings in butterflies we found all these artist colors which are due to microscopic relief and which already have found applications for the efficiency of solar panels these have been made more efficient by the inspiration of the principles of physics found in these very special butterfly pigments there have been other applications still with using Iris colors which are found for example in a mobile phone which allows us to obtain the same level of light with less energy [Music] is it possible to use these natural butterfly pigments as models for pigments used in the building industry in construction in paint yes in fact it used as a model there are teams working on that since effectively the majority of the pigments we use are toxic and this accumulates in traditional paints so it really is an enormous alternative domain opening up here 400 . our moths as interesting as butterflies yes they firstly because their eyes allow them to see at night and have therefore interesting optic properties again for solar panels and in other ways they have very sensitive chemical receptors which are able to locate the females kilometers away by Oda and that allows us to develop sensitive chemical receptors oh Luke Sweden is a Visionary architect who has used bionics and nature as his inspiration [Music] when I imagined this biohabitat I thought of this dragonfly wing I imagine that maybe one day we able to make this kind of thing what do you think I think that yes we to do that it transparent substance of the future it sugar-based it it seems doable but it require commitment and for the moment it but I certainly believe in it can also serve as a model for armors you can have hard chitting inspired from by example that of beetles but it can take many forms right up to the surfaces that are the most transparent inspired by dragonfly wings to make membranes skins which can become translucent through to transparent [Music] perhaps our great-grandchildren will live in cities inspired by Luke Sweden well waiting for that perspective Tour the World in these exhibitions which Fascinate young people in this type of construction we use all the natural materials we have and God knows there all of the walls here could be made from the chitting of dragonfly wings we could have transparent materials spiders make thread which is highly resistant and so do silkworms but when you say you the Silicon to cover a house that that word attack a name or summons yes of course but in Leon there were enormous home factories that did that that wove these threads and made super resistant Fabrics we could easily start from that savoir fair and do that without pollution without hurting the planet how can we manage to produce and be as efficient as a spider can be when it weaves its thread its thread is stronger than our Steels at the same scale but the spider can do this without factories without trucks without mining the Earth lots of things the spider needs no petrol the spider does it all with its little stomach and with what it takes from the environment so how can we manage to do that without going into the industrial chain or by completely integrating our systems with natural production foreign [Music] the lighting in our buildings could very well come from a system of bioluminescence we glow worms which make this very very intense light and which could be used in analogous processes not by using glow worms obviously that would be a bit complicated but by using that chemistry that way of functioning and you can imagine the light that would give that would be enough for our comfort [Music] insects graciously give up their patents to us it applications [Music] they have no internal skeleton but an external envelope the exoskeleton which protects them [Music] when a man runs he uses 50 of his recoverable energy the moment he hits the ground so that this energy wouldn be lost I imagined working with an exoskeleton which would be very close to that of grasshoppers because they recover that energy with a kind of spring foreign Hoppers are an endless source of inspiration for Luke Sweden he is even thinking about developing a new kind of tricycle inspired by the ergonomy of their legs and moving and limiting their efforts [Music] convoys of pine processionaries have inspired him with the concept of the caterpillar train where wagons join and move links together in a linked Line This principle of autonomous movement or in convoys would allow an energetic gain for the transport of the heart of our cities [Music] takes its inspiration from the way in which bees and ants communicate it uses its antennae to transmit to the exterior the trajectories of different modules [Music] Luke Sweden is really a Visionary architect he also one of those rare people who lets us project ourselves forward into future cities that have completely integrated bionics these are positive cities that make you want to live there foreign years that insects have lived in harmony with the Earth they durability so we have to learn how to watch them to get answers to our questions [Applause] [Music] it is were invented by ants well before man they were organized in vast colonies which were a little like our towns in imagining that City I took off from that idea the ants have green fly Farms which might correspond to henrums in that City [Music] here there are vegetable plots which might be a bit like the fast mushroom fields that the ants cultivate and then we something which is like the ant storage area that means the silos and granaries where we store our food for the rest of the year and then the rest of the habitation develops to be able to house the people [Music] and cities are a perfect example of remarkable Subterranean mega cities which have the advantage of being perfectly air conditioned and are thus truly ecological we could imagine similar habitats and extremely hot or cold lands where according to the season one lived beneath or above the ground [Music] Walter schenkel is trying to understand how the ants without a project head and without a building plan can build such complex and varied forms of nests some nests reach a depth of four meters which on a human scale is the equivalent of an underground city seven kilometers deep how does natural selection build the the set of behaviors into the individual ants so that their interaction with the environment and with each other produces the species typical nests that unknown at this point but it is the central question Hey Kevin there pretty good what do you think yeah to make the nest skeletons Walter uses aluminum heated to 670 degrees it contact with the molten aluminum could be dangerous for non-specialists you wanna [Applause] okay in this underground city 8 000 harvester ants once lived [Music] some ants have invented the spiral staircase others the Worm Drive or even the flying shuttle Walter began a Titanic task in his inventory of their different kinds of habitat [Music] ants didn Weaver ants even invented the weaving shuttle turning themselves into a living shuttle and larvae donate both their silk and their lives Australian Weaver ant larvae secrete silk thread from a gland under the mouth the worker seamstress presses the larvae between its jaws so as to reel the precious thread to Veer Combs on its feet [Music] ants are the perfect urbanists they know in fact how to adapt the facades of their environment to perfectly integrate themselves into their environment thus they use different kinds of leaves thousands of woven threads enable the building of extremely light but resistant Leaf structures giving Architects interesting ideas bring it this way this way keep going keep going bring it this way this structure is based on the Weaver ant design and the Weaver ants collect sticks and leaves and all kinds of things that they find and they put it together with pieces of silk just like we did with this structure the architect Eugene sui has used this principle to create very light towers capable of bearing great weight by borrowing ideas from nature he ways to produce environment friendly housing that aesthetic and natural [Music] [Applause] [Music] some of his projects incorporate the technical know-how events and air conditioning and ventilation [Music] in California earthquakes fire and floods are a constant worry there too the ants are a source of inspiration [Music] the building is very much like the ant body this building is shaped like that because it has to be very strong in an earthquake and and also it texture when when does which ant bit him ferment sting Terraces with panoramic views to Honey ant round Jaws Swiss whole world has been inspired by them [Music] I have to imagine myself being an ant to begin to understand why and how the ant made certain decisions to create the incredible habitats that it creates and so by studying those habitats it influenced my architecture because the logic and the reasoning behind the development of these habitats could be directly applied to creating logical habitation for human beings for these buildings Eugene sui was inspired by the sugar jars which are made up from some ants nicknamed honey potents because of their honey-like taste to survive droughts these ants have put an ingenious system in place their workers Harvest nectar from a tree they then transform themselves into living walking jars and regurgitate their precious nectar in times of famine [Music] the angle of 15 degrees which parallels the angle of the the tunnel passageways for ant colonies this project for a bridge linking Africa and Europe via the Straits of Gibraltar is not a pipe dream ants are capable of overcoming obstacles just as big in our terms to make genuine suspension bridges to do this thousands of ants form themselves into cables and girders [Music] once the civil engineering is finished the queen can be carried around on her sedan chair and thousands of workers can use the bridge safely to cross the obstacle [Music] termites have nothing to be jealous of ants about when it comes to building [Music] macro thermos termites build Cathedrals and humnavour termites build temples [Music] for the aboriginals and the African tribes alike the mystery of these architects of nature is believed to be a gift from the gods strangely termites which destroy everything they encounter religiously avoid some varieties of shrubs others seem to worship the tree trunks in which they live [Music] some termites build Mounds which seem to defy the laws of gravity and logic [Music] in the steps of Australia magnetic termites never lose their bearings their homes are just a few centimeters wide from north to south but several meters long from west to east the burning midday Sun only strikes a very small surface of the mound while the morning and evening Rays warm both sides to get the temperature they prefer and make the most of their air conditioning the termites live on the east side in the morning and the west side in the evening [Music] made in termite Land Air Conditioning equipment inspires today termites may not have central heating but they do have ideas their buildings have all mod cons and even air conditioning the way it works is simple termite Cathedral chimneys can be nearly eight meters high made of Earth the chimney heats up during the day as hot air rises the chimney draws the cooler air out of the mound at night the termite the heat stored in the ground during the day [Music] always focused on energy saving British Architects have taken on termite engineers for example the model for the Nottingham Inland Revenue Center was a termite Mound a gigantic glass chimney controls fresh air distribution to the offices [Music] at the University of Leicester enormous 13 meter high chimneys pull down fresh air which emerges directly from grids under the student engineer architect Sandy Halliday has just found a new job for termites as trench diggers I time in the prospect of studying animal architecture but I couldn anybody would give us research funding to study what [Music] termite droppings make excellent cement they contain non-degrated sugars which act like super glue to be able to avoid oncoming traffic in corridors made strictly to their size the termite concrete mixers make garages like on mountain roads [Music] in front of each building site a soldier on duty protects the concrete layers after identifying the exact place with their antennae the worker termites bring in the grains of sand and suddenly turn round to lay the cement in the gap in the future we might find ourselves a termites themselves presently produced from their own abdomens and that would be an enormous step forward into a more environmentally friendly construction industry for Sandy man has never invented anything not cement and certainly not skyscrapers a three meter high termite Mound would be a building towering three kilometers African civilizations have copied termite Mound architecture for a long time in particular in the mosquis of Burkina Faso and Mali [Music] yes thank you thank you bye [Music] thank you Sandy is using a model to demonstrate her intriguing Project based on animal intelligence to the Edinburgh Zoo directors the building we based on principles of animal architecture in particular the termite Mound which forms a central core here more research to go into that to figure out what we can really learn in terms of how to bond it and this here will be the Caffeine restaurant looking at this fabulous View [Music] ants and termites have already inspired the most Visionary Architects like the work of Gaudi in Barcelona for Gowdy The Secret of beauty is in nature insects he emphasized practically never use a straight line [Music] generally building insects are organized in a society although spiders are solitary they are excellent Builders all the same whom Among Us has not been struck by the magnificence of a spider not all spiders weave in the same way some net silk webs with variable geometry with threads that are further or closer apart other species can produce up to eight different sorts of silk depending on how it is to be used so for the web for security for cocoons for wrapping up prey Etc this variety is made possible by the existence of different glands each producing silk of a different quality the silk is in fact a twined rope made up of 15 to 20 threads these microfilaments intertwine to form an assemblage 1000 times finer than a hair these threads are amongst the finest known to science and no man-made machine to date would be capable of reproducing them [Music] when the silk trap is magnified several thousand times with the microscope we can see the balls of glue that enable the prey to be held more easily in addition the thread cannot give way it is twice as solid as our Kevlar which is used for bulletproof vests it is acid resistant and more elastic than nylon spider silk needs to be extremely strong because the spider regularly leaps into the void to attain the speed required for efficient web spinning [Music] for decades many researchers have been attempting to copy the super properties of spider silk [Music] I spider silk because it has the potential to produce products that really can benefit mankind in the Spider-Man movie the diameter of the the silk that he shoots out is actually much bigger than he needs our calculations are that for most of the the things that he was doing diameter you need is one or two millimeters nut this one should be ready to Silk today Professor Randolph V Lewis has a miniature breeding farm for nephilis spiders these giant spiders can spin webs larger than one meter in diameter they can provide up to 500 meters of silk thread in a harvest so in order to produce commercial amounts of spider silk it spiders the problem is they Territorial and we simply can large enough quantities for any sort of a commercial application [Music] the artificial and industrial production of spider silk fiber is the subject of research of a dozen teams around the world the solution according to Randolph V Lewis is genetics and plants by inserting specific spider genes into plants Professor Randolph V Lewis seems to have found the ideal factories for the mass production of spider silk proteins other research teams have chosen bacteria or even goat milk for duplicating spider silk proteins genetically and industrially [Music] however Randolph V Lewis is more convinced by his super plants plants because they don and other kinds of infective material light might be found in bacteria and secondly there produce the silk in animals this is the silk thread produced from a mixture of plants the fiber produced from plants is much more elastic than nylon and totally biodegradable [Music] this already interests cable manufacturers for suspended Bridges but could also become part of the manufacturer of biomaterials for buildings stretch tests prove the super quality of the fiber five times stronger than steel twice as flexible as nylon and able to be stretched by 40 before breaking our scientists are now rivaling what 400 million years of spider silk Evolution has produced foreign craft also has a profound interest in the virtues of spider webs [Music] ite spiders capture insects with their webs the webs are nets and of course the number of insects captured depends on the size of the net and the number of available prey we plentiful environment spiders build small webs and in a poor environment spiders build big webs that is big Nets so why this adaptation for economical reasons because the web is made entirely of silk silk is protein and protein is expensive in Guyana to save their silk proteins certain species of spiders have even grouped together to live in the one gigantic web an association that goes against nature since spiders are usually Cannibal and 99 are solitary thanks to this strange Association they are able to capture prey more than 700 times their own weight whereas solitary spiders rarely attack game bigger than themselves through vibrations in the web the attack signal is given and dozens of spiders run to do battle the meal will be shared by the whole community the spider Society is anarchy without structure hierarchy king or chief and yet it functions in a harmonious way enough to send chills up the spines of politicians since there hierarchy however the spiders appear to obey and follow without argument the stick that Bernard craft waves like an animal trainer in fact all they do is follow the vibrations propagated by the silk their ability to detect movements ranging from a millimeter to a nanometer is due to the multitude of hairs and sensors distributed over their bodies and their eight legs foreign to perceive the vibrations better the spiders move forward in jerky movements at each pause the hairs and sensors pick up the slightest movements and Tremors of the web [Music] structure of this Society of social spiders is hanging by a thread without politicians or Architects they build webs that can measure up to 50 meters long in contrast to perfectly geometrical webs these look chaotic no obvious architectural rules and yet this immense web tent is held up by guidelines on closer inspection we find the same principles of tension used in suspended Bridges these spiders can make their web without an overall Vision each one being content to fill in an empty space or add a thread here and there to increase the strength of a supporting cable this interlacing of webs merely in appearance it is the silk that enables the spiders to communicate to organize themselves and thus create these web superstructures we came up with the idea that each individual must react in the same way as its neighbors to the vibratory information transmitted by the silk based on this idea we created a computer model using one the principle that the spiders do not fight amongst themselves two that all the spiders react in the same way to the information and that there is cooperation in other words a sort of social intelligence should we therefore add spiders to the list of social insects maybe not but arachnoids deserve in any case the title of Architects as much as do the ants the bees or termites the cities of Tomorrow will use bionics and social insects will contribute enormously [Music]	Success
Timeonauts' Descent into Darkness: An Unprecedented Experiment | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnQrGkGpDA4	SLICE Science	foreign [Music] a.m on April 24th 2021 at Lone priv in southern France [Music] and the 15 people coming out of this cave have just lived through the Deep time experiment 40 days underground in the cold and damp with no sense of day or night an extreme undertaking orchestrated by the Explorer and researcher Christian Khloe along with him 14 people who the challenge they put aside any notion of time to try and decipher the human body of a adapting to extreme situations adaptation occurs when you an unknown situation your first impulse is to avoid any suffering and to feel okay calm in the knowledge that you can survive it as long as necessary the experiment was closely monitored by about 30 scientists all experts in Neuroscience the biological clock and the sensory system and all seeking to understand how the human brain perceives the passage of time when freed from its social and cultural habits with this deep time protocol the big question is that if you remove the alternation of light and dark and you no longer know what time it is anymore where does that leave you are you going to be more disoriented and how on the sensory levels studying the brain period of 40 days has never been done before we those adaptive mechanisms really are [Music] for 20 years he human ability to adapt to extreme living conditions at first he himself was the guinea pig covered in sensors he crossed burning deserts icy steps and sweltering jungles and thus was born the Deep time experiment this time though he wanted it to be a collective one and it was the coveted lockdowns that triggered it as the lockdowns progress people started to lose their sense of time when we talk about losing our sense of time we often think about the people in the 60s and 70s who went down into caves to see what losing your sense of time was really like so I thought we should study the cognitive function of time down in a cave with no access to temporal information but as part of a group yeah the Deep time Expedition is the result of a collaboration between Christian Khloe and a team of scientists who have been working with the Explorer for several years [Music] time they can analyze in real life the evolution of a group deprived of time reference [Music] is a researcher and doctor specializing in balance and the perception of space he analyzes the reactions of individuals deprived of sunlight than even an open air laboratory it conditions and that study because whether it life or in a company or even someone with a pathology at home we don that hindsight we know what happens at the hospital not what happens at home what we need are real life conditions movement in space is specialty she in the behavior of social groups in extreme situations for her deep time is a rare opportunity the spatial domain is a field of exceptional and extreme conditions what these teammates can that their adaptation and it me to this particular environment it something new to my research in isolation and confinement the team specialist in neurology is also studying these extreme situations using brain Imaging he will analyze the brain connections according to its environment and its lived experiences what we call brain plasticity what yet studied brain plasticity over a 40-day period there have been studies done in Antarctica where there little sun and where the knights last six months so we know that over six months there is some form of brain plasticity but it periods of 30 or 40 days so it challenge to find out if on this time scale we can observe cerebral plasticity is a specialist in biological rhythms he studies the influence of daylight deprivation on sleep and it things we don function not the biological clock we know how that works but not in the context of collective life that deep time this Collective Adventure that recruiting the 14 subjects of the deep time experiment took months of physical and psychological testing they were selected for more than one thousand candidates the 14 teammates who entered the cave are between 27 and 50 years old doctors biologists nurses rope access technicians or Jewelers they would all be putting their know-how at the service of the mission Christian Khloe calls them deep timers it both individual and Collective limits that the desire to go to the end of a project that tests your limits it started out as a bit of a joke giving your body to science during your lifetime that was the funny side of it to be completely disconnected even from time it experience that must be amazing and I hope that afterwards I trace of it in my everyday life [Music] the first thing to come to mind is the unknown how you react to living without the constraints of time without a clock how are we going to keep a group together because I think everyone will crack at some point the Deep timers have accepted to undergo a battery of daily tests during the 40 days they will be carried out in the cave thanks to special devices configured to measure their activity it was not every night but from time to time they polysomnography with little electrodes on their foreheads at the level of the lobes we architecture of sleep to find out how long they sleep and especially how they sleep how the Deep timer Stefan they now has developed a series of virtual reality tests it to see that everything properly it and natural and then we check that it doesn can use it on the Deep timers ethologist has had surveillance cameras placed to film the team members in their communal living area 24 hours a day and will analyze all the recordings at the end of the experiment for brain and memory analyzes team members must undergo MRIs a few days before entering the cave obviously we can when they thought we before they go in and then again when they come out and compare these before and after scans we that show A variation in the density of gray matter once the tests are done and the equipment is validated deep time can begin [Music] repair has finally arrived in a few hours the teammates will enter the cave we still have 30 minutes to make your last phone calls then you phones behind and going in tonight guys we enter the cave it occupies your mind it the tension now I don turning off here we go then 40 days without a telephone or a watch Emily the group parents we here we go mom 40 days I on this project and dreaming about it for months but that doesn easy it families loved ones and all the volunteers who struggle to make this experience possible are there to wish them luck [Applause] foreign let none of the teammates has ever faced such an ordeal as they enter the cave no one knows if they will last 40 days [Music] Christian Khloe didn of lundgrieve by chance despite a constant temperature of 10 degrees and 100 humidity it for team members to feel at ease once they called the passage of crime the team members find themselves in a huge room nicknamed the cathedral because it enough to contain Notre Dame de Paris [Music] after a 10-minute Walk The Deep timers get a first look at their base camp where they hundreds of volunteers have worked tirelessly they equipment and one ton of food in on their backs the cave has been transformed into both a place to live and a real field laboratory two tents have been installed for the scientists it well it from now on only the members of the mission are present in the cave the Deep timers have total autonomy and they film themselves how moving we all here I am really so happy to be doing this but especially in a group I could never have done it alone with us all in a group we should come out of it pretty much unscathed and then my problem is that I reckon the Deep time experiment will make me work on that it have a watch this isn having no time awareness and no sunlight doing away with any time markers mainly allows scientists to study the functioning of another clock That essential to our body the biological clock that the French geologist Michelle sifra first detected in the early 1960s in the summer of 1962 he lived for two months alone at the bottom of a Chasm without any way of telling the time and connected to the surface only by a telephone line from the moment he went in the scientific Community was holding its breath for news from Michelle Siva in his messages he reported problems with his memory for example he found himself listening to a record 10 or 20 times with no memory of having just listened to it NASA just sent a man into orbit Ed was very interested in the effect on a man cognitive abilities in an enclosed universe [Music] 58 days later when he came out of the Abyss Michelle seafra thought he only 33 days down there so the difference between the perceived time and the measure time was an important one the experiment LED scientists to conclude that a human being a half hours for chronobiologist Benoit mover deep time is an opportunity to go further in interpreting Michelle seifer pioneering experience routines in fact involved him not being very active in his cave he chosen caves where he had little room to move he was often confined to his tent there was no significant energy expenditure and I wondered if after all the longer time Cycles were perhaps related to a lack of activity Michelle seafra found it very hard to be alone and locked in a small space after an initial phase of settling in he plunged into his exit into a secondary phase that was very hard both physically and mentally a depressive phase having lifted Chris Jones Khloe knows that during an expedition the individual passes successively through different states his experience has allowed him to identify three of them Euphoria apathy and restarting this is the hypothesis that deep time seeks to validate so there seemed to be three distinct phases and somehow we finally Cycles in every crisis situation the first one may last about a week you still have a temporal memory of having your usual Cycles with the sun and watches you discovered the territory the objects your way of working and that all generally goes pretty well it calm thing and then after maybe a week or ten days there you borders you start looking for a reason to stay there and what lost your memory of time so you have to start creating your own rhythms and that comes as a shock it moment that throws into total disorder both the group and each individual as a person and for that there are only two solutions either you continue to sink and you fall into depression or burnout or you find renewed strength and the whole question is are you going to arrive at the third phase where you finally find a rhythm that would allow you if you had necessary resources to live for years the evening menu Four Seasons Pizza we spicy chicken and peppers Pizza the Deep timers are about to have their first meal in the cave they instructed to eat and sleep whenever they want regardless of the group this is one of the most important instructions that Christian glow has given them [Music] after dinner and still in their outside world Rhythm of Life they all go to bed from now on time is no longer measured in hours or days but in Cycles a cycle is the sum total of awaking time and a sleep time as they lie down the first scientific protocols begin tonight it recording of sleep started the sleep monitor I because I it we know the lifestyles of our 15 subjects we know if they or if they don question is whether those who don usually sleep much are going to stay like that in the cave or are they like that because their professions mean they can much we because they compatible or if it get together to eat at the same time and if this bonding will also get them onto the same rhythm [Music] thank you I slept really well I woke up because I needed to go to the bathroom and then I heard that things were pretty busy and I thought oh I figured well okay I foreign so it was quite a difficult first night once people get up daily life is organized tifen is in charge of the food stocks Damion prepares the equipment used to collect water Arno the group planting a mini vegetable garden like all other jobs the virtue of this kind of work is that it sets goals for everyone it see a bit of green in this world where usually there isn for the plants to grow they are illuminated by growth and flowering LEDs it we place like this then that brings up questions about our ability to settle into new types of environments the deep dimers are very busy first of all there are the essentials such as pedaling on a bike the equivalent of one hour a day to power the batteries for the scientists during each cycle the team members are expected to undergo about two hours of testing the most spectacular test is the virtual reality one an exercise that tests their balance and their sense of orientation two senses that the lack of light in the cave must surely disturb [Music] our basic sense of balance works like a stool basically a three-legged one the most stable kind all visual information is the first leg the second is all the information in the inner ear that connected to its gravity with a kind of plumb line and the third leg is our bodily Sensations all three come together not on the seat of the stool but in the brain here in deep time will radically reduce the brightness to almost nothing just the field of view of a headland we to take measurements before during and after we retain their orientation skills and sufficiently adapt to this environment to keep on Surviving in it living for 40 days somewhere as dark as this cave will certainly require a lot of visual effort from the deep timers effort that should according to neurobiologist lead to changes in certain areas of the brain the brain is an adaptable organ that can develop if it activities take for example a Pianist who plays the piano very regularly you hands develop so obviously on an expedition like this we think we probably have variations and maybe decreases in Gray matter we hippocampus which plays a critical role in episodic memory we regions which are associated with judgment and decision making especially when it comes to Adaptive Behavior and then obviously all the regions of the visual cortex that deal with visual stimuli and visual information so we expect to see significant variations in Gray matter density at the end of the first day nearly all the teammates have followed an almost identical cycle they are on their third meal and are about to go to bed however there standing out no one has seen Emily all day and Christian admits he I made a somewhat difficult decision as regards the scientific protocol which was to wake up Emily to see how she was doing because we cycle and she of sync the biggest fear for Emily is being alone well if she doesn she else goes to bed Christian wakes Emily up hello Emily hello how are you doing came to see you because you sleeping for a long time I know I I there okay I wake up gently then from the very first night Emily is already completely out of sync the other deep timers are surprised you know you almost missed us we bed would you have woken up well yeah but you the game right but all alone I I physiologically speaking when someone able in absolute silence without temporal constraints or professional or anything well I don sleep more than say 15 hours that pretty good going I didn nights desynchronization happened astonishingly fast for Emily but it deep timers as Christian Khloe predicted they discovering things and installing things the caves as busy as a hive and everything there we all we space properly everything into the cave but nothing organized the food reserves setting up our life systems everyone follows the instructions to the letter to live at their own pace and listen to their body and gradually the Cycles are breaking loose from the norm [Applause] cycle five around midday cycle five two more like end of the day I got ahead of Francois so from the word girl the result confirms what we previous experiments where days got elongated from the very start all the subjects will cease to operate on a 24-hour Rhythm it will always gradually lengthen so progressively they almost 30 hours we can see that the group is relatively synchronized which means that they all pretty much follow the same drift with the cameras she set up the anthologist can objectively monitor everyone I objectively know to position an orientation a presence for example this subject has one two three four five six seven eight teammates in his visual field after a week just a few days there are still remnants of mourning noon and evening you could call it impregnated time we in that famous temporal memory that humans have in them potentially from the outside world during these first Cycles most of the time is devoted to tasks that require the presence of all the team members in particular learning the ropes Damien has to train everyone while the group is still synchronized it turns out that our drinking water is either 20 meters above us in a suspended lake or 90 meters on the ground at the bottom of the canyon so you can any water if you don obscale and most of them almost two-thirds of them have never done that all right [Music] foreign [Music] so soon put in my code there you go estimated time to fetch water 20 minutes and that I estimate when it when we ask them to estimate how long their cycle is they just can you ask them to estimate one minute they let almost two minutes to two minutes 20 seconds pass [Music] without the alternation of sunrise and sunset you lose all sense of time members have to regularly dispose of their waste and their dirty laundry a 50-minute walk away from the base or deposit scientific recordings everything that comes out of the cave is taken care of by an outside support team that stands guard at the caves entrance 24 7. unlike Michelle seifer time was designed to have no direct link to the outside the slightest contact could reveal temporal information to the teammates and thus distort the experiment [Music] March 27th is Emily based on an average of each person Cycles the team members reckon they celebrate on the right date in reality they celebrate her birthday on March 30th after 16 days in the cave the Deep timers are already three days behind [Music] this is and we so you together some of them are brushing their teeth some are getting ready for bed and others are just having breakfast you okay is your day starting well so far yes well it it bit sleepy I think okay okay the team members are halfway through the experiment for several Cycles they been getting more and more out of sync some get up when others go to bed the cold and humidity are making life difficult there we go well this morning we woke up and the tub was bulging and full of gas despite the sawdust I think these were no good before they were put in so we got mashed carrots potatoes and carrots yeah we onions and uh here uh carrots we in the early Cycles the Deep timers have been very active [Music] but now fatigue setting in the Expedition has entered the second phase the one that Christian Khloe calls the phase of apathy are you asleep nope just enough 90 seconds foreign yeah torpor has settled on the group one sure sign of that is the dramatic drop in the number of people out in the living space social orientation between the third and fourth weeks we see a drop in Social orientations of one thousand down to less than 300. [Music] what we actually see is a decline into inactivity a hypoactivity of the whole group it too which means that our little bracelets that record accelerations movements displacements are showing a clear decrease in activity the group completely dispersed people are just following whatever rhythm is profoundly natural to them and that they need do you soon get bored on your own this is my second and maybe my last meal I mustn think it the others and complete the other side you feel a bit lost you in you get tired and start to realize that this world you from what you thought it tiring it all gets the more you realize that you probably won return to the world you knew before this drop in the whole group routine is most evident in those scientific tests that most rely on sensual input I don good it in this shadowy almost monochrome Universe the area of their brains associated with perception of the body has become hypersensitive to simulations of movement when we immerse them in virtual reality with the headset and they strong visual information that more intense than what they used to we can already see modifications they information especially visual Dynamic information actually our brain won neurons that deal with this or wipe out all the information and remain silent on the contrary they become hypersensitive so what are the symptoms or flushes with loss of balance need to sit down and then lie down maybe hypertension with a vagal condition [Music] the part of the brain that handles object recognition seems to have partially atrophied there are decreases in Gray matter in regions associated with object recognition because only the local living space is illuminated everything else is in the dark and then obviously the number of objects that the subjects come across in their lives in the cave is very limited so we find that side of things the visual field is weakened [Music] fatigue is creating tensions in the team the desynchronization is making Collective decisions difficult oh that you were saying we things programmed I start yelling at you and I don no don what I the next time you decisions just tell me yes or no I tough every time you suggest something we will have to agree at some point you have to accept that some ideas that aren need listening to it we got one barrel left and we through about two a day the group is scattered now so it whoever now that the Deep timers are all trained in rope techniques they themselves foreign well there you go look out how canister a very good exercise unfortunately it taught me that you really have to look out for anyone down below before you send anything down and warn them because Marathon was down there so it could have been a lot worse all right anyone there on day 27 of the experiment there power cut there a blackout 500 meters underground with them all now following different rhythms the lights in the cave have remained constantly on all right we overload has blown the fuses well they have to carry on in complete darkness now there are two problems the first to have light we have to be able to recharge the batteries because without light it to go on will it be enough for us to move around the cave or will we just have minimal lighting yeah and just stay here where we are and sleep that so this is stressing a lot of people out but that it other hand though we going to happen sounds silly right but this power cut is a real warning that we from everything and you can any problem with a click of the fingers we have to find solutions to go on adapting and operating even with a power cut like this foreign [Music] the lights at last came back on hey this cave is really beautiful this power outage will turn out to have been extremely important to the overall experiment because it showed that life only works because we in complete darkness humans can survive this outage lasted 24 hours that start to have to question what it like to have no light at all and then the lights come back on after 24 hours you all start to think how can I do things to start feeling okay but really okay all right [Music] to Chris Jones great satisfaction the group dynamic played its part fully in the traumatic episode of the blackout [Music] although Michelle sief was sunk into depression because he felt all alone in the dark here the group really became the bonding element as of all the moments the teammates had spent together had replaced both the sun and the clocks what emerges is a new social clock it doesn together but it does take a lot of little moments of communal life because they only thing that will revive things for you a major component of this Expedition is that it was a group effort in the pilot experiments we did with Christian he was all alone and so we could observe a decrease in Gray matter in specific brain regions such as the temporal Pareto Junction as it which specializes in our ability to consider other perspectives it you like in a group there was no decrease in Gray matter in this temporoparito Junction so the group obviously has a considerable importance in the results we observe the whole evolution of our species means that we need to live in groups there may have been that phase of apathy but that was at the end of the project and it was replaced by small groups that formed who obviously felt the need to create a social activity around the project those people all came together in the same social organization after the apathy phase and with a long-awaited third phase well and truly on its way the Deep timers are grouped according to their activities they explore the cave each time somehow pushing back their limits [Music] thank you the cave of donbrev is on three levels and contains kilometers of galleries my boat got a little hole in the bottom so I just inflate it again as I go along together again now the there [Music] we have this ability to Marvel at a place or an event or something for me that wanted a cave like a cave where we can move about that we could explore and would awaken us that feeling of wonder foreign [Music] the mission draws to an end outside the cave support team members melucene melon there and Jeremy romyan approached the entrance here we go here we go here we go they of the mission to the team members hello the Moment of Truth we the cave we the end of the 40 days none of the deep timers suspects that the experiment is coming to an end they but most of them still think it only 30 days make sure wow that all the work and you melatine to tell the truth it didn necessarily want to go out yet I expected it but I didn so soon I thought the days and nights were longer than that exactly 40 days well done I halfway through the experiment I day 23. [Music] I think it was going to end just yet so it immediately an immense sadness I can see it in the eyes of most of my teammates and I see the sadness and immediately I realized the experiment success because if people are sad to leave it because they at home foreign [Music] the Deep time experience is a success all the crew members have lasted 40 days [Music] take several more months for Christian Khloe and the scientists to draw all the conclusions from the thousands of data collected during the experiment but already the first results shake up a number of certainties so with all the subjects we record Cycles extended by 24 hours on average our 15 subjects had days of about 33 hours so that shows a longer extension for all of that no ambiguity there nothing new about it it according to the data we had there considerable variability sometimes we go from 25 to 26 hours cycle to a 60-hour cycle well I think that this duration of sleep that we try to homogenize by our by our social organizations is on the other hand something to question because we see very well that when we ask subjects to listen deeply to their needs we realize that from one subject to another it analyzing dissecting individuals by individuals and that interesting thing to see how each individual applications of this are very important because a person who suffers from say pathological vertigo and who to re-education we need to know his profile how it evolving and in what way and what the prognosis is in the light of these observations we moving from a temporal imprint of the outer world to a social imprint of the inner world and that what deep time showed us and it was very important to us was to try to change our conception of what the adult brain is we have this image that the child is developing it adult brain remains Frozen well of course we roughly speaking we see it as an organ that remains Frozen but now what we observed is that even after 40 days there are considerable variations due to environment and conditions the biggest success of deep time in terms of our studies on adaptation is that we have really shown that these three phases of Discovery apathy and then resolution and adaptation did truly exist the whole question is how can we reduce the period of apathy I structural support or something to make us get out of it and perhaps that real question now is what our work is in the future how to reduce as much as possible the period of apathy because that simply don us from the outside foreign [Music]	Success
Black Holes : Physics Last Frontier | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOCUMENTARY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE_tq97WZgs	SLICE Science	foreign Albert Einstein published his paper on general relativity it included several field equations they explained mathematically how Mass distorts space and time one implication was the ability of gravity to bend light centuries astronomers had realized that Newtonian physics could not account for discrepancies such as the precession of Mercury the field equations revealed why and astronomers became very interested physicist Karl schwarzchild discovered that among other things the field equations predicted a singularity a body so dense that nothing not even light could Escape it the idea of observing celestial bodies that gave off no light indeed absorb it was beyond the technology of the day and while Einstein accepted the mathematics he regarded the prediction as an anomaly [Music] for decades theoretical physicists continue to explore the mathematics trying to predict how a singularity might form from a collapsing star but the Orthodoxy including Einstein resisted the idea with the Advent of radio astronomy it became clear there was a huge amount of activity not observable in the visible spectrum powerful radio signals traveling immense distances baffled researchers quasars and pulsars were identified and the evidence suggested they were relatively small but incredibly dense objects astrophysicists began looking afresh at the idea of the singularity in the 1960s a new term emerged black hole new discoveries about supernovae collapsing giant stars and pulsars provided a mechanism for the evolution of a singularity black holes were no longer regarded as an anomaly within Einstein generation of astronomers with new tools began looking for evidence foreign the true nature of quasars emerged as active Galactic nuclei these objects at the heart of some large galaxies release huge amounts of electromagnetic radiation it was realized that matter near a very large black hole was spiraling around the singularity at extreme speeds is an accretion disk generating vast energy some accretion disks feature Jets generated by the Spin of the singularity and the highly magnetized material within the disk it is important to understand the scale in this animation the black hole at the center of the accretion disk is roughly the diameter of our solar system the idea that every large Galaxy had a supermassive black hole at its Center gained Credence as more quasars were examined at the heart of our own galaxy The Milky Way no active accretion disk could be detected but astronomers still suspected there was a large black hole in 1992 a German team from the Max Planck Institute began a long-term study of stars at the center of our galaxy initially they used the European Southern observatory telescope in more recent years their observations were made using eso telescope or VLT the team had to work at the infrared end of the spectrum because the shorter wavelengths in the visible spectrum tend to be absorbed by Interstellar gas and dust the team is led by Professor Reinhardt genzel well you see the Milky Way Center is one of the most important Laboratories we have to study in very great detail what of galaxies in much more detail than we can ever hope to do in in all other galaxies yet here we are we can study whether there what happens around it and so forth oh very general issues which you would like to explore and which you cannot really study that much in detail in other Galactic nuclear during 50 nights over a 16-year period the team recorded the movement of 28 stars in the central region of the Milky Way they were clearly orbiting something that could not be seen the circle representing the black hole is 60 million kilometers across similar to Mercury the body million solar masses [Music] as they mapped the paths of the Stars orbiting the black hole the team was surprised by the highly elliptical track of the star they called S2 and then in 2002 nature gave us just an absolutely miraculous star which moved so close to this object yet you could see it zip around the the mass in a matter of only a few years and that gave us absolutely fantastic information you could estimate the orbital parameters to mass Etc and we were fairly sure it a massive black hole now the orbital period of this star is 16 years and these measurements we took here on the then new very large telescope we took in 2002 take 16 plus 2002 and that our star is coming back to its original very close position and near the black hole that there [Music] using eso team monitored the close approach of S2 to the black hole at the center of our galaxy to test whether Einstein physics would break down under extreme conditions Professor gensel accurately the slight shift in the color of S2 predicted by the Einstein field equations this required using the four individual telescopes of the VLT working together using the gravity instrument to combine their light and to gather spectral data so we have all four telescopes working together and in addition to these four telescopes we have a beam combiner and this combines the light from all the four telescopes and this is gravity gravity is of course it the best because we can really trace a little bit of this star very very carefully with really good accuracy so we can now get very nice orbits and we with this very nice data we have now as it approached the black hole S2 a star 14 times more massive than our sun accelerated to a speed close to 3 percent of the speed of light the gravitational influence from the black hole caused the star shift toward the red end of the spectrum exactly as the field equations predicted oh that was a long pass it was very very difficult because while gravity is sort of an obvious thing you stand here on Earth and then you sort of have an idea what it is in reality it weak force and the effects of of General activity are extremely small so you have to measure to to a Precision which we are normally not used to in astronomy in 2020 Professor gensel shared the Nobel Prize for physics with Andrea Getz and Roger Penrose all for their contributions in the field of black holes [Music] the people from The Max Planck Institute were not the only ones drawn to black holes American astrophysicist Shepard dolman had assembled an international team with a broad range of skills the objective was to capture an image of a black hole [Music] while the Max Planck team had proved the existence of the giant Singularity at the center of the Milky Way by plotting its influence on adjacent Stars they could not see anything this was no surprise after all it black hole to capture an image the Dolmen group knew they would have to focus on an active Galactic nucleus light generated in the accretion disk might be able to reveal the silhouette of a black hole so as the magnetized gas is falling onto the black hole it heats up and therefore generates the light that we then see now from our daily experience we expect that light travels on straight paths and straight trajectories we call them race here the situation is very different we have a black hole sitting right there and its extreme gravity so it is bending the light rays away from the straight paths that we and it basically distorts the image by a great amount so in fact you can see things that are actually behind the black hole and that you thought were obstructed by the black hole simply because the black hole is bending the light rays into your line of sight before the observations could proceed preliminary work had to take place firstly to determine if it really was feasible to capture the image of a black hole [Music] it was understood that an array of widely separated telescopes acting together as an interferometer would be needed for the task the greater the distance between them the greater the angular resolution [Music] coal at the center of m87 a supergiant elliptical galaxy and the constellation Virgo seemed like the best candidate it has an active Galactic nucleus and it while Imaging data would be collected from a specific wavelength some telescopes in the array can record several wavelengths simultaneously where possible this information would also be recorded I multi-wavelength working group and what that means is that we try to gather complementary information simultaneously with the EHT observations from Radio to even gamma rays and hopefully even particles but mostly I in trying to think about the modeling and making simulations and and models of of the lights that could be coming out of a black hole astrophysicists knew the image would look peculiar so they set about using the field equations to make simulations of what they expected to see the extreme gravitation bends the light near a singularity in surprising ways with light from The accretion Ring behind the black hole still visible [Music] the effect is called gravitational lensing and it would assist the astronomers by making the singularity and its accretion disk appear larger with m87 55 million light years away this was important you know we started just by measuring the size of black holes with a few telescopes and I remember seeing those first results come across my computer screen and that was when I got hooked that was when I knew that something really extraordinary was possible and since then we to over 200 and now we the first image of a black hole and that has been a big period of growth initially eight radio astronomy facilities from across the globe collaborated on the project only wavelengths from below the Spectrum visible to the human eye can penetrate the interstellar gas and dust and it was decided to observe at that 1.3 millimeter wavelength the telescopes were linked together to function as a giant interferometer these telescopes were not meant to work together and you have to do a tremendous amount of fiddling to get the calibrations right and everything coordinated it experience in a dedicated interferometer foreign the Atacama large millimeter sub-millimeter array on the chaknan tour plateau in Northern Chile is one of the observatories that became part of what is known as The Event Horizon telescope when it joined it was a pivotal moment the EHT had made its first observations years earlier in 2006. at that stage the small array was used to measure the mass of black holes [Music] astrophysicists knew the EHT would need more telescopes for increased resolution and sensitivity when Alma agreed to participate as a part of the EHT it brought within reach the ability to capture an image of a suitable black hole but there was a problem almost 64 dishes were designed and built to perform as an interferometer the dishes can be relocated into varying patterns and separated by as much as 16 kilometers which improves its angular resolution however to image The Singularity at the center of m87 required telescopes separated by thousands of kilometers [Music] Alma had to be reconfigured to operate as a phased array which meant it would appear as a single telescope within the EHT array [Music] this required considerable investment and expertise and it brought European institutions into the EHT collaboration in a major way the Max Planck Institute for astronomy developed its own supercomputer known as a correlator for the integration of the signal data from all the EHT telescopes from the very beginning this group was instrumental was a key player in the development of what is now known as The Event Horizon telescope and we used our experience we used our scientific engagement but we used in particular the technical contributions we could make to contribute to the construction of the EHT effort now what does that mean we of developed further developed and expanded our correlator capacity now we are one of the two correlator centers for the EHT together with Haystack Observatory but we also contributed to the continued back-end development with our dbbc3 project and thirdly we played a major role in the outfitting the preparation of the alma array for the EHT observations we helped making the phasing of the 64 Alma antennas possible so that now Alma taken as a whole is a major contribution to the EHT technical capability all the EHT telescopes were re-equipped with hydrogen mazes that provided an extremely accurate frequency standard to timestamp their output signal other upgrades included superconducting receivers and digital signal processors but because of its size the modifications needed at Alma were extensive while the other telescopes improved the eht its sensitivity by a factor of 10. foreign the term Event Horizon can be confusing in the simulations it is simply the edge of the black circle around which the accretion disk swirls however the line Beyond which light cannot escape and the surface of the matter of the black hole are different things in the field equations time stops at a black hole do the laws of physics break down here black holds a huge amount of mass in a small area which distorts space and time such that you know everything that goes too close light and every information disappears forever in that hole never gets out and even time slows down and comes to a standstill at the edge of a black hole that exotic objects we can imagine we have never seen a black hole so far black holes is Theory we to do things we merge we the gravitational waves from the merging of what we think are black hole but we never seen the actual object seeing a black hole actually allows us to not only know they exist and not only know an event horizon exist it also allows us to test some of the very basic predictions of the theory of general relativity of Albert Einstein which really describes space and time uh in its completeness and that has never been tested before members of The Event Horizon team met regularly and as the numbers grew so did the meetings the collaboration Drew together experts across a number of different fields foreign we all have different roles in this collaboration there coming together from all the different scientists I part so I work on data on Imaging very long Baseline interferometry data if this is true that black holes are the extreme objects where we can study gravity and we know that general relativity which describes black holes in the outer part up to the event horizon breaks down at the Event Horizon so the big hope is that with more data we might be able to study the physics Beyond general relativity so maybe there might be quantum physics ruling beyond the event horizon or the combination of quantum physics and general relativity which would be the theory of quantum gravity which is non-existent at the moment but we might learn more about this with the help of studying black holes high in Spain Sierra Nevada is the Iram 30 meter dish it Horizon telescope and is the Project most sensitive single antenna foreign like all the other facilities in the EHT its remote Mountaintop location delivers very low humidity good conditions for recording the millimeter wavelengths chosen for the black hole observations its reflecting surface is made to tolerance is finer than a human hair and Horizon telescopes required the installation of high-speed recorders to capture the vast amounts of data produced during the observation period site would generate data at 64 gigabits per second with observation periods lasting at least 10 hours each could produce half a petabyte of data per session this made conventional methods of storing data in the cloud unfeasible one petabyte of data is enough to store mp3 music files that will play for 2000 years during preliminary observations the high altitudes where the telescopes are located played Havoc with the conventional unsealed data drives used by the team for the crucial 2017 observing campaign the EHT had switched to helium-filled data drives immune to problems associated with high altitude the most remote facility in the event horizon group is the South Pole telescope while the very cold temperatures and its 2 800 meter altitude provide the earth best viewing conditions for sub-millimeter wavelengths Antarctica is difficult to access and a challenging environment in which to work the 10 meter dish is fitted with a metal skirt to minimize Reflection from the surrounding ice originally designed to study the cosmic microwave background it is perfectly suited to make an important contribution as part of the Event Horizon telescope [Music] a team running the observations of the South Pole has to be particularly skilled because of the telescope outside help cannot be called upon if equipment malfunctions spare parts and expertise must be on hand getting an image from a global distribution of eight different radio telescopes relies upon brute computing power and sophisticated software the bulk of the information recorded during the observation period will be just random interference after the observation when the data drives are assembled of the correlation centers the interference will be averaged out using an algorithm while the distance separation of the telescopes enhances angular resolution there will be gaps in the picture that emerges these will be filled by a different algorithm employing artificial intelligence more telescopes will help future observations but the algorithms will remain essential [Music] computed the radiative signature of our simulations we have to compare them to the observations and this can be imagined as you are in a in a stadium and during a football match and you have an image and you want to figure out if this person or whatever is on this image is Among The Spectators in the stadium so what you do is you take this image and try to match it with all the 60 000 Spectators in the stadium and you do this while you rotate it you scale it you increase the contrast and you try to figure out first what is on your image is it a person is it a cat or whatever and try to match this to the spectators and this seems trivial but it computational demanding process so we need a supercomputer which we have in Frankfurt and we developed a so-called genetic algorithm which is a very smart way running through this images and try to adjust them and this takes roughly a month and after this calculation time we have maybe 10 of those Spectators which match your image and this is very similar to what we do in EHT so we try to compare and match our observations with the theoretical predictions until they could actually see the image the research team had no idea how the accretion disk was positioned if it was a view from above or below as seen from the earth the picture would be very different to an edge on perspective which would be seen with gravitational distortion foreign having an idea which way the accretion disk faced would help Computing scientists in their development of an appropriate algorithm this is where pulsars come in they are rapidly rotating stars that pulse with precisely timed very intense radio bursts they can serve as accurate Cosmic clocks [Music] Michael Cramer director of the Max Planck Institute for radio astronomy is an expert in pulsars he understood that if a pulsar could be found in the region near the center of the m87 Galaxy it just might be possible to discover the orientation of the accretion disk via time Distortion in the accurate radio pulses foreign so for this experiment it was clear that we need expertise from completely different areas and so we needed someone with imaging capabilities we needed someone with numerical relativity capabilities and in my case we need someone who can try to find this additional information via pulsars and so just being part of this team means you work completely differently you always know someone somewhere at the end of a computer line at the end of an email who knows exactly the answer to your question and so if you don the answer then we look work together to find it out and so it dream is this this shared ambition which brings us together ultimately no appropriate Pulsar could be found before the 2017 observation campaign but the research team would explore every lead in the attempt to image a black hole [Music] Shep dollman from the Smithsonian astrophysical Observatory has been with the project from the beginning he observatories including the large millimeter telescope on the summit of Sierra Negra in Mexico its 50 meter dish is the world steerable millimeter telescope situated at an altitude of 4 600 meters the location provides very low levels of water vapor and therefore good observing conditions for millimeter wavelengths its coverage overlaps with observatories in Chile and Hawaii making it a perfect fit for the EHT as the Director I do many things I go to telescopes and I do observations but I also enjoy the analysis and I also enjoy the Imaging so I do many many things I wear many hats in the collaboration the most difficult part of the Event Horizon telescope for me has been building the whole team bringing everyone together thank you the James Clark Maxwell telescope operated by the East Asian Observatory is one of a cluster of independent observatories close to the summit of Hawaii it has a 15 meter dish and is optimized for observations at submillimeter wavelengths nearby is the sub millimeter array an interferometer consisting of eight six meter dishes operated by the Smithsonian astrophysical Observatory and the Academia cynica Institute of astronomy and astrophysics [Music] the mid-pacific location of these facilities adds to the wide geographical spread of the Event Horizon telescopes locations if you like Einstein then black holes are you know one of the most interesting examples of this Theory and this is my my role within the this project I I am a theorist I work with you know equations and simulations and my my role is that to try and understand whether the image that we produce corresponds to the predictions of Einstein theory or maybe to something else again and again researchers mentioned testing Einstein relativity and so far the theory always holds up but there reason why they keep searching for anomalies [Music] 100 years ago astronomers began to suspect that there was a lot more matter out there than they could account for by the 1970s analysis of the rotation of spiral galaxies suggested that they were spinning too fast estimates of the observable Mass did not deliver enough gravitation to hold these galaxies together and they did not behave in the same way as other rotating systems such as our own solar system there must be a lot more mass that was not detectable and it must surround galaxies in a Halo this was called Dark Matter estimates have dark matter making up 85 percent of all matter so far attempts to find dark matter have been fruitless the other possibility is that general relativity is incomplete or incorrect the sub millimeter telescope on Mount Graham in Arizona and the Apex telescope in Chile Where the final two telescopes that made up the EHT for the 2017 observing campaign [Music] at an elevation of 5100 meters Apex is the highest facility observations are made remotely from an operations Support Facility at 2 900 meters Apex is a Pathfinder for the adjacent Alma array initially as a technology demonstrator and more recently finding targets of interest for the larger array [Music] Alma is the most sensitive facility served as an anchor station for the entire group for its role in The Event Horizon telescope the 64 dishes were positioned in a tightly packed configuration to minimize the effect of local atmospheric disturbance unlike most of the other Event Horizon facilities the data from Alma were recorded 30 kilometers from the array at the operations Support Facility to achieve this a high-speed fiber optic cable was laid between the observatory correlator and the operations center [Music] it had been decided that the months of March and April offered the best chance of good observing conditions at all Sites while some of the facilities had been involved in preliminary synchronized observations the 2017 observation campaign would be the first time all eight telescopes complete with updated receivers and high-speed data recorders were all ready to make an attempt to capture an image of the black hole at the heart of the m87 Galaxy our experiments are like an Arctic Expedition we have to plan for months and months and months in advance gather our equipment and then we have this great migration of people to observatories all around the world we stay up all night we run our telescopes and then we have this terrible period of waiting where we don worked we send all of our data together and only when it know if it the global effort was coordinated from a back room at Harvard University observations commenced on April the 5th [Music] air turbulence and opacity are usually lower at night and before the scheduled observing time a pole of conditions across the various sites was carried out with a final go no-go command being given [Music] during coordinated Windows over five nights in April all the EHT telescopes focused on the same point in the sky a surprising run of favorable nights allowed the telescopes to record about four petabytes of data [Music] 256 hard drives from Seven telescopes were sent to either the haystack correlator in Westford Massachusetts or to the Max Planck correlator in Bonn were transported by air and at its peak it was the most rapid data transfer in history at the South Pole the remaining 32 hard drives had to wait for the southern winter to pass it was not until the following November when a plane finally had access to the amundsen Scott Southpole station during observation the data had been separated into high and low frequency bands and recorded on different drives high band data was shipped to the Max Planck Institute and low band data to the haystack correlator the computation would take many months the time-stamped signal from each telescope was compared with that of every other telescope initial processing minimized unwanted Noise by calculating an average of all the signals distortions can arise from fluctuating atmospheric conditions or electronic delays amongst many other factors by the end of this process the volume of data was reduced by a factor of 1 million yet there was still no image in November 2018 all the researchers gathered at Redbud University in the Netherlands to discuss their progress at this point the Imaging teams took Center Stage they had been building simulations that obeyed Einstein equations [Music] by changing variables like magnetic flux viewing angle and spin they generated a library of synthetic images the hoped some of these would resemble the image generated by the data collected during the observation [Music] because there were gaps in the data set machine learning would fill out the picture there was a possibility human bias could influence the final result [Music] four separate Imaging groups worked independently on converting the data into an image so we now and at the beginning it was simply extraordinary that some points in the indeterminate Future these might actually be relevant I have to say it taken on a new importance now as we actually have images that look like the simulation so this extraordinary Confluence between Theory and experiments and it promises tremendous breakthroughs on the horizon finally an image emerged it obeyed the field equations and looked like the simulations so what is most surprising of of of this experience is that we managed to get a very good image the first time we tried to synchronize all of these telescope at the same time it is not so surprising that we obtained the image that we had predicted through simulations because well we believe our simulations are correct and because we believe that the theory of Einstein the correct one I think we I years and years to many observations until we get a final image and then we look at our first source and we see that ring see the Event Horizon and we see that shadow that dark region and you know immediately we horizon at a black hole from all sides at once in this this thing we see at a region where time stops this is a very different part of the universe that we that before of course you still need to understand what you you know you need to believe what you see so it process until you really convince yourself what we see there is physically really proof of an event horizon it we all understand from a mathematical point of view that black holes exist but to actually see something is a very visceral experience and I think important for Science and also for us to believe in it I didn get it I thought it was just going to be too hard I knew it was worth it to try but I didn seeing that image for the first time was really eye-opening for me something that I here researchers had a lot of detail to verify before they finally went public with their image of the supermassive black hole early in 2019. very high in dry sites welcome to today press conferences were held simultaneously around the world to make the announcement and to reveal the image it shows an orange ring brighter along one Edge that surrounds a dark Central core though it across the observation period reveals movement the ring is the accretion disk it is matter orbiting the black hole at a velocity approaching the speed of light the accretion ring glows because friction within the ring generates vast energy the color was an arbitrary choice the electromagnetic radiation streaming from The Ring covers the Spectrum from gamma rays right down to radio waves but it is only the lower energy radio waves that are able to penetrate the dust and gas that lie between the m87 Galaxy and Earth as radio waves are not visible the color orange was chosen because it represents Heat the extreme gravity bends space-time allowing the portion of the accretion Ring behind the black hole to be seen as if it both looped above and below the central region the dark region at the center is the Event Horizon the area of influence around the black hole from which nothing can escape its size is determined by the black hole Beyond this little can be determined it is theorized that the mass is concentrated at a point known as a singularity within the Event Horizon the laws of physics do not make sense while the singularity can be said to have infinite density it does not have infinite Mass The Event Horizon at the heart of the m87 Galaxy occupies roughly the same area as that enclosed by the orbit of Pluto around our sun and the m87 black hole has a mass equivalent to 6.5 billion Suns it is active it is growing matter in its region is being consumed and the immense amount of energy generated leads to vast Jets of plasma being ejected this process is not well understood but it is thought that the swirling tangle of magnetic field lines around the spinning black hole pushes material out at relativistic speeds the much smaller black hole at the center of our own Galaxy is not active we know it orbital patterns of stars in the inner Galaxy but without an accretion ring it cannot be as easily imaged [Music] there are big plans for the event horizon telescope I think we there need better images probably more telescopes and eventually we may have to go into space then we can make razor sharp images of black holes and test all the theories in great great detail three telescopes have joined the Event Horizon group the Greenland 12 meter dish is a refurbished prototype from the alma facility which needed extensive modification for work in The Frigid conditions inside the Arctic Circle it enhances the resolution of the original eight telescopes broadening the array another Alma prototype has been relocated to Kit peak in Arizona where it functions in tandem with the nearby sub-millimeter telescope on Mount Graham the noema array in the French Alps is the third facility to join the EHT it has 12 15 meter dishes on the plateau de bur it operates as a phased array when working as part of the EHT weather marred the 2019 observations and the 2020 observing campaign was called off due to issues with the covid-19 virus but the raw data had been retained and it was reprocessed using polarizing information that revealed magnetic detail within the accretion ring this holds clues about the mechanism that drives the polar Jets from active black holes astronomers using the Muse and ex-shooter instruments at eso Observatory recorded colliding galaxies in the far southern constellation tukana great activity at the center drives huge jets with prolific star formation the Jets extend vast distances and it appears that they play an important role in the distribution of matter across the galactic neighborhood foreign not all black holes are supermassive in a star cluster part of the southern constellation veiler a star was seen orbiting nothing once every 167 days calculation revealed the star was circling a stellar Mass black hole equivalent to four Suns this type of black hole forms when a giant star having burned all its fuel explodes in a hypernova ultimately collapsing to a black hole this must have been how the universe earliest black holes formed but they grew by consuming matter in their region expanding to Giants and forming the nucleus of the first galaxies smaller Stars equivalent to eight Suns also collapse at the end of their lives they explode in a supernova briefly blasting out vast amounts of matter and energy The Remnant core much reduced in Mass after the explosion compresses to such density that its protons and electrons merge forming neutrons this is a neutron star its mass is just short of what is needed to form a black hole while they may be only 20 kilometers across they are detectable as very bright radio sources emitting electromagnetic radiation from neapolar regions rapidly rotating neutron stars appear to radio astronomers as precisely timed radio pulses hence the name pulsar the Pulsar provided another proof of Einstein with the concept that mass bends space it was logical that a moving Mass would send ripples through space foreign usually very accurate Pulsar signals suggested they were part of a binary star system the timing discrepancies could be accounted for by gravitational waves since the 1960s attempts have been made to build instruments that could detect gravitational waves only recently has this become possible this is the Virgo interferometer near Pisa in Northern Italy two three kilometer arms set at a right angle house evacuated tubes down which laser beams shine the instrument can detect minute changes in the fabric of space-time and it works in collaboration with two similar instruments in the United States in September 2017 not long after the instrument became active it registered a distinctive signal it was the signature of two merging neutron stars it is thought to have been the birth of a new black hole immediately telescopes observing across the electromagnetic spectrum began searching for the event location Afterglow from ejected matter was visible for years but there was no evidence of a neutron star it was the first time that the source of gravitational waves had been precisely located [Music] in 2015 the ligo gravitational wave detectors in the United States recorded a different signal that revealed the merging of two black holes [Music] the mass of each was roughly 30 Suns larger black holes may not be detectable like this they are so large and move so slowly that the low frequency waves they generate will not be obvious the mass of the resultant black hole was slightly less than the sum of its parts the extra mass being dissipated as gravitational waves with the regular detection of gravitational waves and the global efforts of the Event Horizon telescope completely new fields of astronomy are opening up [Music] The Event Horizon collaboration continues to expand they want to record moving images of supermassive event Horizons and their accretion disks the black hole at the center of our own galaxy has proved elusive but new evidence suggests that it has a small accretion disk that just might allow a more powerful array to reveal images we wait with anticipation [Music]	Success
Cassini: The Most Expensive Space Probe's Journey to Saturn | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOCUMENTARY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQbcnwPS_xQ	SLICE Science	foreign Galileo pointed his telescope at the planet Saturn then the furthest known planet and noticed that its sort of had ears 400 years later a little probe called Cassini finally looked back at us from behind those ears rings of course catching sight of Earth a single bright pixel in a dark sky but like the responsible child she is Cassini still phones home every week to check in with proud but anxious parents you know if there worry about her and I want to find out that everything is okay and say call me and let me know how things are going or I shoulder as we work together to fix it besides breathtaking images of the sparkling Rings there was Saturn itself and a bizarre six-sided Polar Storm with a massive hurricane at its Center and the moon most bizarre worlds in our solar system Titan with its choking atmosphere hiding rivers and lakes of liquid methane and Enceladus it spewing water [Music] telling of oceans below oceans that could mean extraterrestrial life and now Cassini is braced for a grand finale a series of dangerous Dives between the innermost ring and Saturn headed for Oblivion [Music] the coolest hottest most complex and most expensive probe we there into the wild blue yonder technically in Federation terms Cassini is a flagship class NASA Issa ASI robotic spacecraft built and controlled by people from 17 Nations before we shot her out to Saturn all we our solar system Glimpse is provided by the Pioneers that flew past in 1979. and voyagers 1 and 2 in 1981. but Cassini would be the first to get to Saturn and stay and stay and stay slated for a four-year Mission she just will not give up and she there eight years after her expiration date and the pictures she bringing scientists to tears she has Rewritten the textbooks about Saturn the Rings the moons Titan so many things have changed because of Cassini the whole program is in and liftoff of the graffiti spacecraft on a billion mile Trek to Saturn her journey started on October 15 1997. as a Titan 4B Centaur rocket tore into the night sky bearing the precious bus-sized probe and slinging her into a crazy seven year flight path she went pinwheeling through the inner planets starting with two loops around Venus and once around Earth two years later then she hurtled through the asteroid belt and hooked up with the Galileo space probe at Jupiter in 2000 to tag team the Solar System months [Music] finally in 2004 Cassini started sending back her first detailed pictures of Saturn as she made her approach ing two massive storms joining to become a single one [Music] snapping pictures of two new moons [Music] Cassini then winged by the bizarre little Phoebe probably a primordial Rock from the birth of our solar system the snagged by Saturn then on the first day of July in 2004 came the most nerve-wracking nail-biting part of the mission Decades of planning seven years of flying and it all came down to this firing her main engines to slow down just enough to be captured by Saturn and put safely into orbit since it takes more than an hour to communicate with the craft at that distance there was nothing her earthlings could do if something went wrong [Music] the slightest miscalculation would have sent Cassini spinning by taking with her several billion dollars worth of hopes and breaking the hearts of her many human parents here we had to do a 96 minute burn to get Cassini safely into orbit and I remember waiting and waiting and of course if an instrument doesn quite right I worry about her and part of the burn was when she was behind the planet so we had to wait and wait and wait the Doppler has planned out finally that signal came out and it was just exactly on the plot we all applauded and such tremendous relief okay we have burn complete here four years for this moment now began a decade of orbits a Tango of Discovery unlike anything any spacecraft had done before skimming Saturn and rings and getting her dance partner ready for its close-up pattern itself was a blaze with storms of unimaginable Force the place crackled with giant lightning strikes gorgeous Aurora at the South Pole created by its enormous magnetosphere and invisible explosions of charged gases through that magnetosphere that Cassini made visible this magnetic envelope of the planet and how it breathes continuously and how he rotates with the planet so we have thousands of movies now of an environment that to our eyes is invisible the Rings were even more dazzling than any had imagined stretching across hundreds of thousands of miles yet sometimes only 10 feet thick they ice some microscopic some the size of mountains [Music] we used to think of rings as these individual particles kind of bumping into each other and sort of floating around in space and we now know that the bulk of Saturn particles actually stick together and they form these long strands that we call wakes and that these wakes line up like the rows of a marching band they have grooves if you like like an old-fashioned record created as wakes of moons which are orbiting some of them the moons are in the Rings some of those moons are outside the Rings and these waves give an interesting texture they break apart and they reform so there going on inside the Rings for the next eight months Cassini world back and forth across an unimaginably beautiful spacecape [Music] then Cassini started arcing toward Titan Saturn and the one that had long held scientists Spellbound all these years Cassini had carried a hitchhiker with her a little Lander called hoygens that was set to become the first probe to land on a moon other than our own because Titan had an atmosphere and atmospheres have implications this Orbiter would carry a probe that would actually parachute down into the atmosphere of Titan and we would have cameras we the temperature pressure composition and then land for the first time on an icy Moon Titan has a really dense atmosphere the denser atmosphere than here on Earth nitrogen light here on Earth but methane natural gas which is being converted into complex organic molecules by sunlight and radiation and the chemistry that atmosphere today May resemble what the Earth was like before life evolved and created the oxygen we all breathe [Music] we want to understand when you have organic materials sitting on the surface of a moon for millions or perhaps billions of years what on Christmas Eve 2004 Cassini cut the Apron Strings On the little Huygens craft the brainchild of the European Space Agency three weeks later scientists around the world held their Collective breaths as the little craft dropped toward Titan surface you could almost imagine if you riding along with the probe you go slam into the atmosphere of Titan but giant parachute pops up and now the heat shield Falls away and your instruments are dangling there you of sensing and smelling and measuring the atmosphere around you and your cameras are looking around to the sides and looking down [Music] we just saw more and more Haze and fog and Haze and Haze until finally the probe broke through that Haze and we got to see the surface of time for the first time [Music] [Music] the surface of Titan was strangely familiar and utterly bizarre at the same time the little crafts seemed to have landed on the equivalent of a mud flat or Shoreline with little ice Pebbles scattered around but on the negative 350 degree surface of Titan these Pebbles were made of methane ice the nearby lake a lake of methane and then Cassini went into orbit around Titan and revealed with its radar system that there indeed are lakes of liquid natural gas and other molecules on the surface of Titan they evaporate just like here on Earth create clouds of methane which rain back on the surface creating rivers of liquid natural gas and lakes like water on Earth that rain had cut channels and gullies in the moon surface but there were dry formations here too including Dunes that stretched for miles and miles reaching 100 meters high and three thousand meter mountains suggesting tectonic forces at work here similar to those on Earth that methane that gas that stove plays the same role on Titan that liquid water place here on the earth you could have methane as a gas and form clouds you could have methane rain that falls on the surface and that created huge Seas about the size of the Great Lakes on the Earth could there perhaps be some very interesting life in The Lakes on Titan after the long-anticipated excitement of Titan Cassini headed for a close look at a tiny Moon called Enceladus no one thought the shimmering little ball of ice barely 300 miles across could rival Titan scientifically but they were wrong its sparkling surface is ridged and cracked and seemingly scraped along its Southern Pole here these strange blue cracks dubbed tiger stripes 75 miles long and hundreds of feet deep resemble fault lines on Earth [Music] the cracks were about to get stranger and far more thrilling cassini coming out of the ice ball 200 degrees warmer than the rest of the planet Enceladus is a small icy World in orbit around Saturn it was it object in the solar system when we flew it by it and yet it has a lot of geologic activity evident on a Surface so something was happening there pure a wedding to take a look back at the crack silhouetted against the sun Cassini captured giant jets of water spewing hundreds of miles out into space from the tiger stripes they shoot out at 1200 miles per hour vaporizing and then freezing it was a stunning moment it has this tidal forcing that squeezed on it kept the ocean of liquid and what happens that Enceladus is that they fractures at the South Pole and jets of this water and ice come squirting out into space and we had no idea back on Earth cassini controllers quickly reprogrammed the probe to fly right through the Jets collecting particles what they found was even more stunning organic molecules the basic building blocks of life [Music] because the guys was erupting and they could guide the spacecraft very close they could actually fly through it and look to see if there there is water and looking for the chemistry that Enceladus is really special it us free samples and so Cassini has multiple times flown through you can imagine it getting coated with these icy particles and some of them come in and are sampled and we know their composition to our surprise we found out that in looking at the particles the ocean was salty and it was salty and had a very similar pH to our own ocean here on the Earth here on Earth wherever there water whether it very hot or rocky places are in ice there suggests microbial life could have evolved on encellus because it has all the properties that the Earth had when life began here and so if we go back with more sophisticated instruments perhaps with the free samples we could answer that question Enceladus held another shocker for the scientists most of the water spewing out of itself pole falls back onto the planet surface you could imagine standing on Enceladus putting out your hand and there this gentle snow coming down all around you but the fastest moving particles break away from the Moon but the very tiniest particles things that are like smaller than the diameter of a human hair they escape from enceladus they go on to form a ring called the e-ring the indefatigable probe wrapped her original four-year mission in 2008. during the next two years Cassini zipped past Titan 26 times and Enceladus seven times Ria and Helene each got a single Royal wave from the probe [Music] it would be years later 2013 that Cassini flew behind the Rings and looked back at Earth our home planet a single Pixel in the vast solar system today Cassini is still at it making her whirling visits to Moon after moon ring after ring and this year she began a series of adjustments to take on one final spectacular mission one that NASA with the help of the public dubbed the grand finale in late 2016 the spacecraft began a daring set of orbits that took her high above Saturn flying just outside its narrow effering through the water-rich plume of Enceladus one more time and then we between the planet and innermost ring 22 times they found that if we fly by Titan in just the right way we can actually jump from just outside the Rings all the way across the Rings and dive through a gap in between the innermost ring and the top of the atmosphere now this Gap is only a thousand miles wide and we diving through the gap [Music] then in a Bittersweet finale in 2017 cassini craft plunging into the Maelstrom of the gas planet itself guaranteeing that it will be incinerated and vaporized they could have parked it in an orbit around the planet nearly indefinitely but that would have involved an unacceptable risk the probe could eventually get snagged in the gravity well of Titan or Enceladus where extraterrestrial life may be getting a foothold it and space and the extreme conditions she has faced little Cassini could have hearty Earth microbes clinging to her she going through in Saturn if you think about it as she disintegrates and melts her molecules will become part of Saturn and so be a very wonderful ending for this spacecraft she studied Saturn and her end is going to be with Saturn it she isn and wires and things she hopes and dreams of all of the scientists and engineers and all of the people who put her together and so when I go and look at the night sky after the mission ends and I see Saturn I because she

Proprioception: The Real 6th sense | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOCUMENTARY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s412XZGOeYU	SLICE Science	foreign [Music] smell taste [Music] sight we perceive the external world through our five senses but there is a sixth more enigmatic more difficult to Define in a few words it is with us from birth and determines all our movements the Sixth Sense is proprioception [Music] our ability to stand upright is this permanent perception of the position of our body balanced or unbalanced the ability to situate each of our limbs in space and to do it subconsciously is this the possibility to project our actions mentally is partly this thanks to several technical advances scientists are now able to study it precisely [Music] Laboratories a number of ongoing experiments May well reveal to us the true nature of proprioception [Music] by learning to know it better we are going to find out just how essential it is constantly interacting with all our other senses foreign choreographer Joanne Bourgeois likes to test the Sixth Sense while the other five senses are familiar to us this one is more mysterious we call upon it with each movement often subconsciously foreign [Music] our sixth sense permanently at work adapt our movements to the constraints we are under here I really like the expression try to stand up which has in fact been the instruction that I dancers throughout the production try to stand up I like this expression because it the same time has almost existential implications [Music] without proprioception we couldn much we couldn ground nor jump nor run grants us that freedom of movement without which everything would become very complicated in an extremely rare phenomenon there are today in the world five people who have been completely deprived of their Sixth Sense at the age of 30 Jeanette lost her proprioceptive sensitivity after suffering from an autoimmune illness is able to walk her muscles and spinal cord are intact however without proper reception standing up is a challenge and is risky I see each of my limbs I can system of commands and concentration that I can I because I can foreign has learned little by little to describe her disability it interested doctors for a long time it has become a major field of study for advancing research especially at the Marseille Institute of movement Sciences Jeanette has been followed by Fabrice salenya for 10 years the sense of proper reception is less well known especially because cases of Pathologists affecting proper reception are less well-known I example we have poor vision or cannot see and we can put ourselves in their place simply by putting on a blindfold or closing our eyes so we can understand how these people behave and what they don now proprioception these are internal Sensations which are difficult to manipulate and to understand that in order to understand proper reception better we choose to work with people who have been affected by pathologies and have lost it wishing to help in this research Jeanette is taking a series of tests from the very simple to the most complicated as long as I don hold that pose so what we movements for example trying to hold my hand in a position when these people close their eyes they can no longer as I can hold a position and we can see that with the arm moving one way and another these people don happening which in the end shows us that we are able to accomplish simple tasks such as hold a position thanks to proper receptive information without this information Jeannette can make gestures which seem at first to be obvious if her right arm is hidden and placed in a certain position she cannot put her left arm in the same position the entire representation of the body is Disturbed to compensate for this disability she has adapted by exerting another sense which allows her in spite of this to make quite precise movements sight I be in the dark great like that you won be able to see your limbs you won anything in the room once in the dark her movements become more confused without visibility she moves systematically past the lit Target she should touch it in the dark she can hand is in space she can try a movement she can think or estimate that she is sending her hand to a place but if there is a mistake in that estimation and in the command to send she will be unable to estimate it and so what we here is that she makes quite big mistakes a lot bigger than we would see in a person of the same age who didn have a proper receptive disability Jeanette has become a visual world she has even lost the sense of touch with her eyes open she can write her name with no difficulty okay okay but with her eyes closed she lost the table a hand on the sheet of paper everything becomes random Zed oh t we call on our sixth sense to make the smallest gesture being conscious of the complexity used to get it to happen by informing us constantly of our position in Space the proper reception sets us free it means we can do other things have a conversation listen to music Jeanette doesn her attention is permanently fixed on what she is trying to do her visual concentration is foremost [Music] even finding the way to her mouth poses problems and too much is it nice in the Sun without proprioception it is also impossible to estimate the strength and intensity of our movements when it happened to me my son was 16 months old he was just a baby baby and then I realized and I held him he said our mom you I Didn it must have taken me a month before I really understood My Own Strength a little better and then I said to my son if I pick you up again and I hurt you you tell me straight away because it not what I want to do I really worked hard at that so I could pick up my son without hurting him foreign [Music] that wasn yes you working upon the grace of a gesture the complexity of a stance the management of balance this is what Johann Bourgeois asks from his dancers so as to make an internal voyage and sharpen their Sixth Sense Francesca you wait outside yes almost as well okay well it can three the guys were at the center straight away without a centrifugal force I think at the center of all my work I am directly calling on the proprioceptive sense in the sense that all my work destabilizes ordinary references I have the impression that I calling upon that says thanks to this sensorial guide we can feel the movements of our body [Music] how does proprioception work [Music] where are our movement sensors located [Music] foreign [Music] measuring the activity of our sixth sense remains a scientific challenge there you know when you approach the nerve you can is one of the rare researchers in the world studying proprioception using anatomical criteria how can we sense our body it receptors everywhere The receptors they tendons which are activated and excited by movement schematically here is what could be an anatomical representation of proprioception thousands of receptors the most important are spread through the muscles of our body when The receptors are excited a message is created which is sent through the nerves all the way to the brain foreign s allow us to perform an action at the same time the inform us of the position of the limb which is performing the action nerve fibers these long white strands a proprioceptive receptors when the muscle extends they send signals to the brain intercepting these messages is the objective of Edith thanks to a micro electrode Edith is trying to record the electrical impulses which are generated by a proprioceptive receptor as long as the nerve isn touched just background noise is audible at first there are whole mass of fibers which we record and then progressively a little like using a microphone in that crowd we go to one person to hear their voice alone it electrode we have the nerve which is made up of all the fibers and we move with eye electrode to one fiber to record its unit reaction once the electrode is placed perfectly upon one fiber it is finally possible to hear the activity of a proprioceptive receptor to record the messages circulating in our nervous system our muscles must be active the experiment here consists of letting a robot activate the leg muscles this robot generates a series of movements which form letters foreign so the coding corresponds to the degree of extension of the muscle foreign ERS formed by the foot emits a distinct signal but how is proprioception a sixth sense to reply to this question the scientists are testing it using an illusion can proprioception be fooled using illusions of movement as we can fool our vision through optical illusions [Music] we recorded the nerve messages coming from the muscle receptors while they making movements which form letters so now we can take these messages and pilot vibrators which induce mechanical vibrations so when we apply these vibrations nerve messages with a muscular origin are generated and at that moment the subject can tell us what they perceive if they perceive a movement okay so this you eyes stay relaxed we or vibration stimulates the proprioceptive receptors which start to vibrate at the rhythm of the previously recorded signal according to the vibrations that he senses Leonard is sure that his foot is moving and making a letter while it is in fact completely still happens I thought my foot was drawing an m M well that for our brain these illusions of movement are real and the way it transmits information in the same way as sight hearing touch smell or taste our proprioception really is a sixth sense these proprioceptive sensors constantly inform us creating a motor sensory Loop between our brain and the representation of our body in space this motor sensory Loop is indispensable for maintaining our posture it the ankles to disturb proprioception if our eyes were closed keeping our balance would be impossible however proprioception allows us to accomplish astonishing things when it is combined with the other senses such as sight and our inner ear this inner ear is sensitive to acceleration and to the rotation of our head [Music] to the synchronized information our brain can always determine the position of our body in space at The Institute of medicine and spatial physiology of Toulouse it how the brain can manage to coordinate site proprioception and the inner ear to control the slightest movement [Music] research engineer at the University Perry decades Michele tagliabu has come up with a novel procedure [Music] he is using a course of bed rest where volunteers stay lying down at an angle during two months they can whether it be to move eat or perform any other activity this experiment serves to prepare space missions by simulating on Earth the effects of weightlessness upon the body rather its effects upon the cardiovascular metabolic and respiratory systems here for the first time we neuroscientific study where we to study the effects that long-term bed rest has on the way in which the brain uses for example different sensory information to orient itself in space and control movement Michele is using this long-term bed rest to see if our verticality the act of standing plays the role of a Plumb line around which proprioceptive Visual and inner ear information is structured during two months he makes the same tests with 20 volunteers equipped with a virtual reality helmet the subjects are emerged in a virtual round cage their head movements are recorded and then interpreted by a 3D camera Michele follows everything live on a control screen here the subject cannot see their hand directly it is materialized in the virtual cage as an orange cylinder he has to turn his hand to change the cylinder to Green and then memorize that position to reproduce it by using proprioception alone [Music] then McKelly gives the subject a second test which this time combines vision and proprioception he asks the volunteer to memorize the angle of a red dotted line and once it is out of their field of vision to position their hand at the same angle it after two months the subjects have trouble getting it right our results precisely show that what is principally affected by the orientation of the subject in space is the capacity to relate different sensory modalities when the subject is asked to communicate Vision by using proprioception when there is for example a visual Target and the subject has to reply just by using proper reception because they cannot see the angle of their hands and this task seems to be strongly affected by the posture of the subject in fact in a prolonged lying down posture the subject is no longer aligned vertically with gravity and then loses the coordination between Visual and proprioceptive information gravity is therefore a reference point a plumber perception of our body in space [Music] so McKinley and his colleague Joe McIntyre wanted to go where gravity has no effect into space [Music] they introduced this to the experiments made aboard the International Space Station astronaut tomarpesky was the first to make the test the same as performed on Earth but without gravity results seem to show the same lag between vision and proprioception which had been seen during the bed rest Corso experiments given that we evolved as a species and as individuals with gravity it evolved by using gravity as a privileged reference a reference around which the brain can align itself and recalibrate different sensory information gravity is indeed a plumber since childhood we have fought against this Force which pulls us towards the center of the Earth We Fight It Off by our erect vertical posture for our brain this acts as a reference point around which a structured proprioception vision and the inner ear [Music] um why gravity has that fundamental importance for us in the coordination of our movements relating Visual and proprioceptive information is because gravity in reality can be seen all the time since objects always fall in the same direction and so we can always even with our eyes closed knowing which direction we are moving because it always acts in the same direction since gravity is perceived visually and properly receptively it think that it can be used as a liaison point between the two sensory modes thank you if our proprioception is suddenly disactivated our vision takes up the work but what sensation do we have regarding gravity since I don the impression that I because I don I can nothing so I always have to look at my feet to be certain that they ground [Music] oh foreign Jeanette has the sensation she is floating she cannot anchor herself to the heart of the world which surrounds her trying endlessly to situate yourself um so links to the problem of meaning the meaning of Our Lives which is a question which can this is always a problem to existential problems [Music] exist means to go out of and Beyond the body to discern the limits of our being with relation to others and to our environment [Music] creates boundaries between what we are and the space around us [Music] I think that I can normally into my body because for example my chair is part of me another example if I part of me I otherwise I me whether it be a table or a chair everything is part of me Jeanette has the feeling that she has been deprived of the boundaries which draw up the limits of our body this alters for her another function of proprioception that of the body plan this is the image we construct of our own body in space we construct our body plan while growing if all goes well when we leave early childhood we are fully conscious of the whole of our body this consciousness of ourselves calls largely on proprioceptive information this is the favorite research field of Christine assayond neuroscientist at the cnrs of Marseille her own children were her first study subjects birth the ability to act and interact with the environment allows us to create a structure of the body and that will create the body plan according to what we do or what happens to us we update our body plan the more this is enriched the better we Master our movements in space [Music] thank you [Music] so how does proprioception participate in the construction of our body plan [Music] ctional MRI and bring answers to that question this machine records brain activity and different Generations will take part in this so as not to give false results there must be no movement everyone is equipped with a vibrator which gives the illusion of a movement that of the ankle being lifted [Music] the MRI allows the visualization of different structures zones of the brain which are called into action by this illusion of movement the youngest subjects connect a lot of structures between each other they use a lot of cerebral structures however with older adolescents we see that the connections are a lot more selective and that for young adults compared with older adolescents we can also see a progression progression so for us that the proof that a real maturing process takes place and this takes time to be integrated during development and Adolescence so that the brain can manage to assemble all the information necessary for the body building our body plan is a long process a very young child has difficulty finding their mouth at the first try they don their body their brain lightly structured has to learn to link Visual and proprioceptive information [Music] the Adolescent is constantly exploring the limits and capacities of their body their brain begins to efficiently organize Visual and proprioceptive information together they are fully at work building their body plan for an adult the perfectly structured brain offers itself a host of organized representations of movement and action [Music] how do we explain this slow progression by exploring our sixth sense throughout life which is what Christine asyl doing motion sensors and Adolescent and then an older person try to keep their balance in a specific position first with their eyes open and then closed startup that close your eyes now we situations when you your eyes during something like that what remains to control balance is mainly proprioception okay so your eyes are closed we than her grandfather but nonetheless we perfectly she could ask a young adult to do this they would have managed to put one foot before the other eyes closed and controlling their balance without any problems Juliet has immature proprioception while her grandfather sense is less and less reliable and when we ask him to only use proprioceptive information to control his posture it thank you foreign plan is closely linked to the time we acquire our proprioceptive sense it is optimal around 23 years old [Music] it elaborate mental representation of the possibilities of their body presentation this representation isn conscious it happens naturally to create matricity which happens for a specific goal an action is made in a particular context and for a very precise objective possibly this can involve other social Partners but finally we our brain there are many representations of our body in movement which will make an action but also representations of the characteristics of the action which we will make unconsciously each one of our actions involving proprioception enriches and modifies our body plan it allows us to rapidly face new situations foreign ception in a conscious fashion a question of concentration [Music] Leonardo now has to recognize the letters imposed by the robot by making that effort of concentration when you concentrate upon a movement that there us know that there has been a movement we concentrate upon proprioception then we sensitize our receptors messages are sent by the brain to The receptors themselves in such a way as to regulate the flexibility of the receptor and make it more sensitive depending on the behavioral situation especially when we need it when we concentrate upon the movement when we need for example to recognize that movement then we will sensitize our receptors through that command which is directly sent to them yes focused on his movements Leona stretches his nerve fibers this tension sends more precise information to the brain it has been easier for him to recognize the letter sent by the robot [Music] this capacity to concentrate lets us have greater Mastery of our sixth sense but sometimes we can even call upon mental representations of our body and movement when you learn difficult movements in acrobatics it them a lot for greater efficiency but like high-level Sports people in fact going over the Motions in slow motion let the pilots of France are experts at this mental projection of action before each flight they go through this visualization exercise in their jargon it thank you like musicians in front of a conductor they synchronize with the rhythm of the team leader [Music] When I close my eyes I project myself directly in my cockpit that is I seat I see my hand on the joystick and I can see all the visual references that I will use which are reference points for my demonstration I can see my motor gauges the key points when I do a loop I have to check my key points at the top of the loop and I can see myself looking at them all that mental planning which I use in the aircraft I do on the ground with my eyes closed it to put themselves through the mental and physical conditions of flight they create in this way the automatic responses which are indispensable once in the plane when everything happens too fast so as to have the time to think so proper reception for me is like doping it which I foreign I mentalize it I put into active memory all the reflex actions that I the plane when I think about that anymore this almost daily mental training for Pilots is an exciting field of research for scientists Kristoff lets his brain be scanned by MRI for a completely new experiment made by the team of Christian aseel to see how your brain networks are modified according to another expertise that you have your ability to imagine a movement the goal of the researchers is to identify with these champions of visualization the interactions which can take place between proprioception and mental projection what these internal representations of action or of the body in action are normally not conscious cells however there is a way to be conscious of them which is to ask the subject to make an action and then to ask them to imagine the action they have just made and astonishingly we see that if this is timed then both are exactly isochronous which means that the duration of the imagined movement and the duration of the actual movement are the same so we can say that the subject can consciously access their representations this capacity to imagine actions that have really been made gives us in the end a real training exercise by associating our body plan our capacity to concentrate and our proper reception we have become Specialists of Mobility this Sixth Sense is shared with the majority of animal species it indispensable for moving climbing or to anticipate the movements of prey what is that the plant world may also have it research director at the inra Bruno Mulia is exploring this probability it what point proper reception is inherent to the whole of the Living World or if it the question is open and in my opinion we don that it creature to be able to perceive its form a little so there are people working on that on the other hand it does seem all the same that there is a particularly pointed question which has led to the selection of proprioception I think for land creatures those which emerge from the water and again for those who try to be arrested to stand straight because postural control is more complicated standing up that of we humans we stay standing it the case of most plants which are erected we can be compared and so we can say that this is the propensity of plants to rise up straight has been an observed phenomenon for over a century the botanist William pfeffer was one of the first to make animated images of this phenomenon in the 1900s but if a plant raises up in such a rectilinear fashion it is perhaps because it is using proprioception this idea has been thought about only recently because of a sizable obstacle the proprioceptive sense is difficult to dissociate from the other senses developed by plants [Music] for Bruno Mulia this sense really exists in Plants but it has yet to be proved scientifically and also will bend this plant and what will happen is it will straighten regain verticality upwards and the question is where does it get that inflammation how does it Orient itself well we thought obviously that it was light because it grows towards the light and that generally what was thought so here we testing whether it uses other information from light and for that we created a special apparatus a sphere where light comes from all around it as if there was sunlight but coming from everywhere at once and so there or down according to the light and we see what happens [Music] surrounded by uniform light these anemones will straighten in a single day to become vertical again so it isn upwards in a rectilinear way but some other information for the in-ra team other parameters need to be introduced starting with gravity how can plants feel this force of attraction and counter it a reply we must plunge into their cells and observe their reaction when they are affected by a change of Direction [Music] so here we see what happens at a cellular level when the plant is turned through the microscope and so we see that there are these special cells which are here and are full of little grains these are grains of starch and these grains of starch they there the asymmetry of this Heap here tells the plant the degree to which it is better the lower the pile the lower it is this also allows us to see how we can manage to make the plant no longer able to feel gravity so as to completely reveal its proprioception to cancel out the effects of gravity it by turning the grains of starch represented here by plastic beads are mixed no longer touch the cell walls and the plant loses its sense of direction which is dictated by gravity this loss of reference can be observed thanks to this curious machine the Gravitron [Music] young plants placed in constant rotation are photographed over several days [Music] Bruno Mulia can then compare the growth of a plant affected by the gravitaron to a control plant which hasn rotated [Music] yeah first on the left we have our control an indicator which we spent and which always perceives gravity it straightens you can see it makes a few pushes and it ends up oriented in the direction of gravity and aligns itself with Gravity by concentrating its curve at the base so here we can see what happens after an experiment with the Gravitron we gave it alternating periods whereas before it perceives gravity and periods where it no longer had that sensation and so it proprioception to its own shape and it tends to straighten to make itself straight and that there is a phase where it can perceive gravity and it rises in the same way as before and then suddenly it can only perceive its own shape and it aligns itself in a completely rectilinear shape which shows its proprioception it was thought so as to grow in a regular way plants depended on external factors such as light and gravity they have in fact a propriocentive synths which maintains their straightness despite the wind or other external factors the objective of a growing plant which is going towards the light is to get there without having an accident and that means mobilizing a lot of perception especially proper deception where is it in its own shape is it risking taking a shade which will make it fall so it which we can quite easily understand which is not even a plant which is fixed in the ground can form if it goes too fast so that proprioception it for us where it the ability to jump on prey or to run away which obviously isn plants [Music] proprioception is far more than just a sense which allows us to stand up there existence of our interaction with the world [Music] I act of trying to situate yourself physically in space and our desperate attempts to give meaning to our actions I have the impression that meaning is born from the interactions between our body and that which surrounds us proprioception is the sense of action it is with us in each of our gestures whether they be conscious or unconscious [Music] when you think about it it is almost incredible that we know so little about our sixth descents [Music] stop using it [Music] in a time when our bodies are less and less called upon often made Passive by sedentary occupations benefiting from our proprioception knowing how to listen to it could bring us much in consciousness of not only ourselves but also our way of interacting with others and beyond that the world [Music]	Success
Venturing Beyond: Robotic Explorers of Mars | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOCUMENTARY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=936WepGN50Q	SLICE Science	foreign the cutest family tree in the history of space travel it generations of robot gumption stretching back to 1997. when little Sojourner made her debut on the surface of the red planet her larger descendants the twins spirit and opportunity blew the minds of their controllers and opportunity is still added and the youngest biggest Beast is curiosity now starting its fifth year of groundbreaking research and exploration [Music] Sojourner hitched a ride with the Mars Pathfinder mission for the landing Pathfinder opened its pedals and beagle-sized Sojourner started out on a planned seven-day joint exploring the Martian Terrain foreign 83 days Wheeling around snapping pictures and chemically tasting the terrain and the atmosphere [Music] Pathfinder really showed us how important it was to have Mobility on the surface of a planet so that you can see the most interesting thing in go over and Sample it if you you to reach so Mobility is key what Sojourner found was that Mars had volcanic rock very much like the Earth suggesting what scientists suspected that the red planet had gone through an evolution very much like our own planets long in the past in 2003 the same year Sojourner was inducted into the robot Hall of Fame the next generation of Rovers twins spirit and opportunity it all from the Kennedy Space Center about a month apart each powered by a Delta II rocket wasn ballistic a few months in bombarding The Rovers with brutal radiation [Music] [Music] a nail-biting moment until they tried the old it help desk standby have you tried turning your Rover off and back on again worked after a seven month trip the first of the twins Spirit was hurtling toward Mars at sixteen thousand miles per hour about 10 times the speed of a bullet the heat shield in the front of the Rover vehicle got about as hot as the surface of the Sun supersonic parachute deployed it was time for the Earthling controllers to strap themselves in it was going to be a bumpy ride [Applause] [Music] the heat shield jettisoned the airbags blew up in less than a thousandth of a second foreign [Applause] and then she bounced and bounced 28 times [Music] you know kind of unusual when you think that there Rover inside and it the surface and eventually comes to a rest but it worked very well final the airbags deflated and the solar arrays opened up charging the power hungry little Rover and she lifted her head panoramic camera and sent her first beautiful we are here postcard [Applause] then Spirit looked Homeward snapping the first ever picture of Earth taken from the surface of another planet all right her earthlings went crazy with joy but then disappointment they had landed spirit in a crater that they had hoped was once a lake but what they found there was not a lick of evidence of water and when we landed we found nothing but volcanic material basaltic rocks and so Mars had thrown us a curveball [Music] three weeks later twin opportunity made its own bouncing baby Rover arrival on the opposite side of Mars and [Music] the Mars exploration Rovers team were hardly the only ones to get attached to their robotic Critters these charismatic machines elicited enormous affection among the public partly because they were outright cute they could have been designed by pixel well the rovers are adorable I mean they exploring on our behalf and so it hard not to become enamored with them and affectionate with them and regard them it is adorable [Music] foreign golf cart sized spirit and opportunity were designed to be wandering geologists instead of picks and hammers though they have little particle blasters that they can use to take samples and spectrometers and microscopes to examine them their Holy Grail evidence of liquid water Spirit got off to a rocky start she drove off on her first assignment to investigate a rock called Adirondack stretched out her arm to touch it and ferns her memory full with baited breath her humans commanded her to erase her memory a terrifying reboot but it worked poor Spirit got a reputation for being the bad sister or at least The Unlucky One [Music] you know nothing went right for her she landed first she landed in these volcanic material we were hoping to find Lake Brett sediments [Music] but Spirit made up in a spirit what she lacked in luck December of 2007 one of her Wheels broke her controllers resigned themselves to the extra drag we drove it mostly backwards dragging that right front wheel but it was like an you know a ball and chain that actually turned out to be one of the biggest scientific Boons of either Rover because it would scrape the surface material and reveal what underneath stuff that we normally would just drive over because it was obscure to us and that biggest discovery What Spirit had found was a kind of rock called opaleen silica this can only form in the presence of both water and Heat spirit chain to make fantastic discoveries opportunity lands right from the get-go discovery of water formed rocks right you know it came easy opportunity landed on a flat plane known as meridiani plenum here she found little so-called blueberries that contained hematite an iron ore which is almost always associated with water it looked as though opportunity Landing site was once the shoreline of a Salty Sea but one that was too salty and acidic for Life as We Know It thoroughly investigating its Landing site Eagle crater opportunity traveled to endurance crater and again found evidence of ancient water but it too seemed too salty finally at Victoria crater almost four miles from The Landing site she found her Holy Grail where opportunity is today is we see evidence of neutral pH water water you could drink I mean ancient water we talking three and a half to four billion years ago so this is very exciting because these are the conditions we think are most hospitable to the origin of Life at least as we understand it we habitable conditions the physical conditions the liquid water the right temperatures sources of energy and now neutral pH water all existed at that time at a time when life started on Earth both spirit and opportunity did more than find evidence of ancient water they photographed Earth-like clouds in the Martian sky found the first meteorite ever discovered on another planet proved what scientists long suspected the place was riddled with dust devils dust devils that instead of choking our roving ladies kept them going long past their sell-by dates well the rovers are solar powered and dust accumulates at the rate of about one percent a day which means that you know after 100 days you know most of the solar arrays would be covered by dust and so that would mean we know a 100-day mission a 90-day Mission that expect is that wind gusts or wind events or dust devils or something would come along and blow the dust off the arrays I mean it leaf blower and just dusted the whole Rover off and it was Factory New Again thank you but dust was not always their friend spirit and opportunity had to hunker down for two months while dust storms raged limiting the solar power to a level that nearly caused the permanent failure of both Rovers so they went radio silent radio dark for days and so we didn were dead or alive and we programmed their Rovers to wake up at a certain time in the future and it was very dramatic because all of us were there in the control room waiting for the data to come down would we hear from Spirit would we hear from opportunity at the expected moment and we without hearing promo and we orbital imagery of the planet just clouded in dust would they be alive would they tell us and sure enough right at the moment they woke up they said I here and I after five mission extensions Little Spirit would get stuck in soft sand but continued sending data [Music] she stopped communicating with Earth in 2010. [Music] and was declared dead a year later [Music] she had explored and phoned home her results for more than five years traveling almost five months we had worked with Spirit from the beginning and now spirit is missing we can and then we never hear from her again and we tried to look for over a year we listened with the deep space Network every day we sent over 1400 commands to elicit a response and we heard nothing we tried [Music] and so we don moments were like it in action because you don they that sense of closure people forget or perhaps just can believe that opportunity the lucky sister is still going strong after more than 12 years 27 miles and 10 Mission extensions considering she was expected to go 600 meters that and set the Rover bar awfully High they both outlasted their planned lifetimes by years and one running so as engineering accomplishments they Curiosity has to live a long time in order to beat opportunity [Music] curiosity of course is NASA Generation Rover lovingly crafted over many years [Music] all right stand by for a test you have to wonder what opportunity might have thought of NASA sojourner by a chemist Ry on August 5th 2015 curiosity burst into the atmosphere at 14 500 miles per hour and like her predecessor deployed a supersonic parachute and jettison to the heat shield but instead of bouncing this baby to its Landing point they cut the cables fired up some engines [Music] hovered and used the sky cream maneuver to ever so gently drop the Rover to the ground and cut the umbilical cord [Music] [Applause] [Applause] around [Applause] curiosity was born ready to roll rather than being dispatched from a landlord opportunity is the field geologist for Mars Curiosity is the analytic chemist for Mars so we say okay well there used to be water a long time ago on Mars but you need more than that to support life and so curiosity came along to look for evidence of habitability which is all of the other conditions that you need for life so water you need the building blocks of life you need those you look for certain elements and then also energy something for the life to eat sort of Drive the metabolic processes of life Curiosity has a more sci-fi approach to her Mission than her predecessors instead of touching and chemically sniffing rocks she fires her laser and x-rays at them chemcam on curiosity shoots a laser at a rock that there the surface and there given up there cam has a detector that looks at the wavelengths of that light to figure out what are the elements that are present and this is called laser induced breakdown spectroscopy but it basically zapping rocks with a laser beam so we have two instruments inside curiosity that do geochemistry measurements on powdered rocks that the Rover collects and it minerals that are in the powdered rocks [Music] the Rover got her bearings where she landed in Gale crater where it had looked from space as though there had been water once and got down to business [Music] curiosity set off for a three mile high Mound called Mount sharp in the middle of the Gale crater at her top clip of five centimeters per second a little over a tenth of a mile per hour [Music] her long journey over a plateau brought her to an intimidating active Dune field discretion being the better part of her honor she took a hard right to skirt the dunes before heading up Mount sharp [Music] along the way she found formations that seemed almost certainly to have been the result of groundwater [Music] as curiosity continues her climb of Mount sharp she younger layers of soil unfolding the history of the planet the way paleontologists and geologists do here on Earth foreign on the fourth anniversary of her Landing long after her official mission end of two years curiosity use vibrating parts of the Rover so that she could sing Happy Birthday to herself which sounds a little lonely [Music] foreign [Music] they also gave the Rover another two-year extension on her mission and a much more exciting present for a young Rover the ability to think for herself using artificial intelligence curiosity can now choose which rocks she wants to study and when to use her laser so the next Rover better be nice to her if she another few years despite all the wear and tear all of her scientific experiments are still in working order the wheels are getting a little dilapidated but the holes have actually been found to provide some traction on soft surfaces in her four years Curiosity has returned more than 125 000 images fired her laser almost 400 000 times and driven eight and a half miles she asked of her and far more curiosity has been exploring Gale crater and mount sharp in Gale crater to look for all of these pieces that are part of the story of habitability and Curiosities found all of them so now we know that there are places on Mars that at one time were habitable so we poised to ask the next question which is really to go look for signs of ancient Life on Mars and that with the Mars 2020 Rover [Music] the Mars 2020 Rover the as yet unnamed great-granddaughter of sojourn will be based on the design of curiosity but will be much more scientifically sophisticated what to get the samples back to Earth where they can be subject to much more sophisticated analysis hopefully these will answer the next big questions is there still water on Mars today and perhaps even life our best bet for finding life is where there was water or where there is water and so the first step in this process is to find the water we know there was a lot of water on Mars and there may be spots where there is still water close enough to the surface but perhaps it what we we find rocks that look promising we going to drill a core and we stick the core in a tube and leave the tube on the surface of Mars for the future those tubes could be the key to finding real martians if only microbial ones and tell us how human astronauts in the future might be able to live on Martian soil survive dust storms and use Martian resources to create oxygen to breathe and water to drink but how is that tube going to get back to Earth that tricky question has yet to be fully answered in theory a future Mission will come pick it up and package it up into a can and basically get the can off the surface of Mars and bring it back to to Earth that all of that is on the drawing board for a mere two billion dollars the Mars 2020 Rover will be our Pioneer in realizing the ancient dream of Earthlings to live and work on the red planet our first stepping stone to new worlds and new possibilities one thing is clear Mars 2020 will have some big shoes Wheels to fill it will be quite the challenge to replace Sojourner spirit opportunity and curiosity in hearts of the Rover team and they you know they human proxies on the surface of Mars and they exhibit human-like qualities I mean you know they Intrepid they until we ascribe to them personalities and behaviors and that only endears them more to us so their loved ones [Music] [Music]	Success
Life Beyond Earth: A Glimpse Inside the ISS | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOCUMENTARY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PASq2H2jyOA	SLICE Science	foreign project man has ever dreamed of has been floating over our heads for more than 20 years the International Space Station there history the size of a football field the ISS is the biggest man-made object ever created it travels above us at a speed of 28 000 kilometers an hour it fixture in space how were engineers and astronauts able to put together this 400 ton machine it building that we have ever constructed as humankind ISS is the only weightless space station in existence and an incredible tool at the service of humanity [Music] it collaboration of many different countries it everyone place that allows us to imagine the future [Music] it further higher and faster the space station is really our first step on our further journey into space space is an extreme and hostile Place mankind has had to demonstrate incredible Ingenuity and rise to huge technological challenges to allow astronauts to live there almost as if they Earth inside it booth but it how does the space station work how do they repair it how does one breathe inside it where does it get its energy from it I need to crouch right down because there you where you Backstage on board the International Space Station on a guided tour in the company of those who know it best the astronauts if I had the chance to go tomorrow I would go back tomorrow such an incredible place [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] has always dreamed of traveling into space leaving the Earth and discovering New Horizons this crazy Quest has gradually become a reality but the dream hasn to go even further they built a structure over our heads 400 kilometers above the planet the International Space Station a steel monster some 108 meters long and 73 meters wide it required the expertise of American Russian European Canadian and Japanese space agencies to put this incredible scientific laboratory into orbit like an enormous construction set each piece was designed and constructed on Earth before being transported into space it took 10 years to assemble in a challenge that went Way Beyond International borders for almost 20 years now 200 men and women from different countries have dedicated themselves in turn to live and work on board the International Space Station [Music] of course the station has become our baby it bored of it [Music] our place of work reaching the space station is no simple feat it involves a long Voyage on Russian soyuz spacecraft [Music] after a 48-hour flight the soyuz is within 400 meters of the ISS the first thing that you see is a is a bright dot like a star that is showing up somewhere on the display as you get closer and closer you see see a little bit there you see the first the wings the big solar wings of the space station like explorers discovering a new world each time they approach the station even the most experienced astronauts can but Marvel at the spectacle but you can were capable of constructing this huge station in orbit in space [Music] then out my window I could see solar arrays and thermal radiators and pieces of the station that kind of extend out into that Corridor that we in and they just get closer and closer and closer and and feel the view of your window you actually feel like you being engulfed by the space station as you I and each time my feelings were the same admiration Rosemary admiration for the size of it it gigantic it looks wrong I mean it looks to your eye there everything you see any beam or poster module extremely well lit on one side over bright kind of you know harsh harsh lighting and then the right as you get roll around to the side that is not directly facing the sun it is black we yes confirmed and yeah probe retraction confirmed talking confirms textbook arrival for the brand new soyuz ms01 spacecraft docking confirmed at 1106 PM central time you this incredibly cramped soyuz through a hatch system which is actually even more cramped once you open that you still have the two hatches uh the ISS hatch and the soyuz hatch to get past so you tighter little space uh and you of being pulled in by your crewmates you and being aided by the doctors on the other side to pull you across and into the main volume of the space station [Applause] and when you leave the little ship and enter the huge station you with emotions you discover this huge space you recognize some faces it of course it [Music] the total volume of the ISS is comparable to that of a five-room house and it was designed to be home to Seven astronauts each one stays there for an average of six months their very first moments on board and despite their years of training new arrivals are often disconcerted because they have to learn to live in zero gravity where there is no up or down [Music] you using a module that is up there the left on the right below and front behind it a bit complicated to get your bearings in the beginning your brain sometimes processes the image completely different because the fluid in your inner ear is sending a completely different message to your brain you and it building you know what I mean I made a right turn into the service module and then suddenly I stopped because suddenly I couldn where I was and I thought to myself I can the International Space Station especially because I of hours training in a model of it here on the ground but luckily one of the more experienced astronauts could see that I looked a little bit confused and he told me it on the ceiling as soon as I flipped over and got my feet back on the floor again it was as if everything fell into place and I could suddenly recognize where I was [Music] the astronauts find their way around thanks to a marking system that shows them up and down the absence of gravity also gives them a 360 degree working environment of course most of these modules you see they have four sides and they together that way we could sort of work on a flat plane either a wall a floor another wall or the ceiling but you know again all you have to do is turn yourself in your reference changes [Music] this almost complete lack of gravity presents its own problems for the human body we are not used to functioning in in microgravity so we have too much blood pressure in our headline the block shift is happening so that astronaut certainly in the beginning when they fly to space that they have kind of a swollen head to it with red puffy face [Music] astronauts faces look a little puffy because their blood flows differently the blood doesn lower part of the body and accumulates in the chest and head the veins around the neck and face swell up so naturally the change of blood flow presents some problems [Music] so you actually feel that inside your head you feel this increase in intracranial pressure and it causes some stuffiness in the nose as well sometimes a bit of a bit of a dull headache as well but and that can actually last for a few weeks as you as your body adapts and adjusts the microgravity but the ISS is much more than a simple home in orbit around the Earth above all it laboratory in permanent residence in Space over the past two decades astronauts have carried out over 1700 experiments there Japan the US and Europe have each supplied a lab kibo Destiny and Columbus [Music] the almost total lack of gravity and the almost total vacuum outside the station makes for an environment that is impossible to recreate on Earth these two properties create ideal research conditions and the chance to use some unique chemical and physical processes This research can be absolutely fundamental with essential questions involving the effects of gravity on metabolic modifications on combustion on Alloys on fluid mechanics with issues we can remove the effects of gravity the research carried out in this permanent space lab covers multiple Fields like biology material science observation of the earth and astronomy the results of some experiments already carried out have allowed us to create revolutionary new Alloys and new Medical Treatments the ISS also means we have a permanent human presence in space and can thus prepare for future man voyages to other planets not only have certain experiments been useful for key research but some will help us fly farther higher and faster the success of the veggie experiment which involved growing lettuce in orbit is considered a real advance in terms of long-term space missions the system was designed to supply a permanent source of fresh food to the crew [Laughter] onboard the space station they are also carrying out experiments and Robotics in a few years remote controlled robots could build other stations or even carry out experiments this is another stepping stone towards Mars special thing about this joystick was that I could feel the forces that the robot was exerting and that first step towards developing what we call an exoskeleton arm which is a robotic arm that you can wear yourself and as you move your arm the robot follows your arm movements but at the same time it sends back the forces so you can actually feel and control the forces that the robot is exerting in the future humans will also need to be capable of withstanding very long voyages as such the human body is also subjected to experiments on the ISS UE spilling out quite nicely you wear guinea pigs up there so we we studying the the effects on our bodies in that environment the weightlessness radiation and any other aspects of that unique environment the last 10 years have shown that the vision of 75 percent of astronauts is altered by long stays in space for a long time it was believed that the Rush of Blood to the Head was Behind These site issues but recently it has been established that the liquid surrounding the brain and the spinal cord can also play a role in these vision problems we there are some theories that it intracranial pressure causing it maybe higher CO2 levels that we breathe the atmosphere might contribute towards this as well but what seems to be happening is a flattening of the retina um and that flattening of retina is causing up to about a diopter shift in Vision so becoming becoming nearsighted what this shows us is that in the end human beings have an astonishing capacity to adapt a weightless environment the astronaut bodies lengthen and can grow between two to seven centimeters in length and this is something I find is remarkable about our human body is how good it is at adapting to new environments if we were going to live in space in microgravity permanently then the human body is brilliant it would be offloaded the heart muscle would shrink our bone density would reduce our muscle mass would reduce and we would very quickly become a very good being a very good body for living in microgravity after six months in orbit it they return to Earth that the astronauts truly realized the importance of gravity [Music] it was really shocking after my first flight I felt just how heavy my arms were yeah really heavy I could also feel my guts I really could I don but I could feel the organs inside me and I can tell you they yes [Music] the idea of establishing a manned space station in orbit around the Earth is not a new one in the 1920s the Russian constitencilkovsky the Undisputed grandfather of astronautics imagined a space station where men could live in 1971 the Russians sent the first space station into orbit named salute one the Americans responded two years later with Skylab then in the middle of the Cold War in 1975 the Russians and Americans proved that space cooperation was possible with a joint Apollo soyuz mission [Music] there was a pause in the manned space flight programs in both the USSR and the USA in the mid-1980s space cooperation was no longer the Americans had the shuttle and the Soviets were dominating manned space flight with the Mir station [Music] the USA was planning to build its own station but given the mammoth size of the task and the cost involved the Europeans Canadians and Japanese came on board with the collapse of the Soviet Bloc Russia was also invited to join the adventure and the result was the ISS everyone involved committed to sharing their knowledge and supplying part of the station the construction process was simple 15 modules would be built on Earth and then assembled in space fact the space station is the biggest plug-and-play that has ever been made the scope of the project was immense today we still talk about the pyramids with admiration and the ISS is the same in the future we about the pyramids [Music] 98 when the first American module was anchored to the first Russian one over the space of two years more and more missions set off to build the station and prepare for the arrival of its first permanent residence on November 2nd 2000 Cosmonaut Sergey krikalav officially became the first resident of the International Space Station the first thing we had to do was to turn the lights on we had to establish the link with Earth and I had to find a cable hidden behind a panel and then we could do the first report yes the first thing we had to do was turn the lights on after that we plugged in the service module systems we started the unit for creating air for purifying the carbon dioxide and ventilating with oxygen they were critical moments if we hadn we wouldn the station for long because the reserves in the soyuz vessel were very low building the station took 115 launches to bring the modules and teams into space [Music] Canada provided a key element in the shape of a robotic arm 17 meters long it is used to move modules supplies material and even astronauts the fruit of international cooperation the ISS gradually took shape in the sky we designed every Mission so that if something didn back into the shuttle and we back home but we never had to do that everything worked up there and it was amazing especially when you consider that many components of the space station never were tested together on the Earth and integrated only on paper of course it was all theoretical and I was pretty surprised to see that we got it fully deployed it of technological prowess the construction and operation of the International Space Station is the most expensive project ever undertaken by humankind costing some 150 billion dollars firstly it and what we vast amount of scientific knowledge and understanding that is benefiting people back here on Earth and if nothing else it insurance policy for the future [Music] thank you from Earth you can now clearly see this giant construction set that shines so brightly in the sky the reason it the massive solar arrays the surface area of the solar arrays provide such a great reflective surface for a viewer on the surface of the Earth and it through those solar arrays that we capture the sun electricity and charge batteries that are then discharged when we night side of the Earth when fully deployed each panel is 73 meters long they are permanently angled to face the Sun and each one is comprised of more than 32 thousand solar panels to capture energy from the Sun so the solar rays articulate so as we orbit around the Earth at four degrees per minute the solar rays articulate at four degrees per minute to continue to point to the sun we also have because of the orbit that we change in what we call the beta angle and that means the solar rays have to articulate in this degree of Freedom as well and we have joints that do that in the the computers track the Sun and then control the solar rays accordingly together the solar panels from the ISS could Supply the electricity for around 40 houses this unique energy source is of vital importance for the crew [Music] there would have to be a catastrophic accident for the station to end up without power but even if that did happen one day we have independent batteries and we also have solar batteries on our soyuz vessels is virtually impossible to imagine the station without electricity [Music] [Music] these are the crew quarters there are four here I like inside there that inside it but it for emailing my family and for calling them via Skype with a headset I have another computer an iPad and the stuff I need for work here you just stick everything on the wall that weightless environment and you can see there which is very comfortable a sleeping bag is fixed with a wall so that I don float away or kick anything and it really comfortable to fly and float and sleep in zero gravity you a box and you wake up and there right in your face and your computer has this timeline and it yelling at you get up and get to work that you get up we have time in the morning you get up and get ready for work like you do here [Music] doing your morning routine washing a little bit having breakfast same as here on Earth usually cool gets up between 6 and 6 30 in the morning [Music] for meals the astronauts usually eat dehydrated products to facilitate transportation and reduce the amount of space required for storing food now our coffee packet is filled with nice hot water we just need a little plastic straw insert the straw take the cap off and drink the first thing to do once you up and had your coffee is to check the station parameters and report to ground control to see how you are and how things are operating then you receive instructions from ground control that might change the timetable a little we usually plan things week by week [Music] to ensure the space station functions correctly in efficient communication system is essential between the station and the Earth in Houston at the HQ of the American space agency the teams are in contact with the astronauts almost constantly from the control center the engineers use Telemetry to interact with many of the station if you want to do anything if you want to send a command turn a pump on and turn a fan on you have to go to a computer and pull up the various displays and then send a command to turn that that fan on so for the crew it kind of a pain but for us it we definitely flowing from the ground from various control centers all around the world we have a bunch of different team members all in charge of various systems and that also have people in Russia we have people in Germany we have people in Japan so again we have people all around the world working again for sort of a common goal but a little better Edge would be helpful if you could tweak the holder or the sample bump it a little bit that would be helpful do each of the station of communicating with Earth okay this is our uh excellent PCS which basically information on how the station systems are doing but most important thing for us are the com what is available com wise and we have four different channels it two three and four as you can see it upside down but that happens to be here for us we need to talk to the ground quite a bit they help us out tremendously they with all the real knowledge again so we Control maintains um a voice commanding and also electronic commanding of the space station primarily by using um satellites which are in a higher orbit the International Space Station is constantly sending and receiving data via its satellite dishes 36 000 kilometers above it geostationary satellites receive the information and transmitted instantaneously to the ground communication is thus insured all around the world now we are in communication virtually 100 of the time that we that wasn communicate in little periods like 20 minutes when we communicated with ground control depending on the orbit today we have good quality communication for professional use and for talking to family and friends it makes for much better living thanks to this communication the astronauts are now able to share their feelings with the rest of the world [Music] on Earth human beings need oxygen but in space there isn the International Space Station has several systems to produce oxygen and Supply it to the crew the atmosphere on board the ISS is very similar to the atmosphere we have here on Earth the only difference is we have quite a bit more CO2 on board the station that astronauts so a big part of my job is oxygen generation we call an oga the oxygen generation assembly so it takes water it split the hydrogen away from the oxygen part of the oxygen is made in the Russian service module here we are in the service module it not very big but it module contains all the systems needed for the cosmonauts to stay alive [Music] it contains reservoirs of recycled water through which electricity passes this electrical charge isolates the chemical components of the water hydrogen and oxygen it electrolyzer we can take that oxygen from the H2O and release it back into the atmosphere for the crew to breathe the oxygen is pumped through pipes that cross the station to provide the crew with fresh air so yeah we can look at the the constituents of the atmosphere and see how much oxygen do we have how much CO2 do we need to generate more oxygen so we nitrogen are we leaking overboard we have a lot of different data what we call Telemetry that we uh from this room making oxygen is one thing but the air cannot stagnate so the space station has a network of Top Flight ventilators so if you don systems or any fans mixing the air essentially you would get pockets of oxygen and pockets of CO2 and in the worst case for example if you were sleeping and you you didn the air you could in theory generate a bubble of of CO2 gas around your mouth and and suffocate on it water is essential on the space station to drink to wash and also to breathe in the early 2000s when the first crew moved in water was delivered from Earth in pouches [Music] today the supply cargos still bring water but not enough for all the oxygen production or water consumption of the astronauts so more than elsewhere water is absolutely crucial and must never be wasted to compensate for the absence of gravity the astronauts must do a minimum of two hours of exercise every day so they lose a lot of water when we do sports for example we we sweat when we watch ourselves we use water and we dry ourselves with towels these towels you just hang up in the air like you would do at home and naturally they will dry up and we leave those towels close to a ventilation grid like in this case you can see a ventilation grid right here so that they can dry off and all the water then is recuperated it evaporates in the air and then in the air conditioning system it condensates again and it goes into our water Recreation bus and it actually gets turned into portable water again saving resources is a constant concern and even the laboratory gets recycled through a process that actually turns it back into potable water we drink our pee it separates the water in the air inside there the uh so the urine in the air in a year ago of course because the Euro processor the air gets a little bit filtered and sent back out again and today we are managed to recycle about 70 percent of all the water that is on board of the ISS [Music] today this complex water recuperation and oxygen production system guarantees a supply of water and air that is often even purer than we have at home and managing waste recycling is also key for preparing for longer voyages we can take the CO2 we can take the hydrogen from the electrolysis react that with the water to produce more water and and more oxygen and then as a byproduct we get methane in the case of the space station methane is a waste product and so we we vent the methane overboard but it reaction because you could potentially use this very same reaction on Mars to generate rocket fuel for your return to control I coolest places on the space station the place that everyone loves on the International Space Station is at the end of the Tranquility module the cupula this Dome with seven reinforced panoramic Windows always points towards the Earth which is constantly passing [Music] traveling at a speed of 28 000 kilometers an hour the International Space Station travels around the earth 16 times a day its trajectory covers 85 percent of the surface of the globe and offers a prime observation post for scientific discovery within the framework of one of his experiments Danish astronaut Andreas morgenson is looking to film meteorological phenomena that are impossible to observe from the Earth and one evening after dinner I was sitting in in cupola and a gigantic thunderstorm started to develop and so I took my camera and I started filming as much as I could and it turned out that I was able to not only film some red Sprites but also a pulsating blue jet so this cone of blue Lightning that shot up from the top of thunder clouds and that something very new it on on video like this so potentially it could affect our understanding of of climate change and global warming because it transport gases like water vapor from the troposphere into the stratosphere [Music] the cupola is also where the astronauts come when they have some free time I go in it every night for an orbit and I would watch the Earth and I knew that that was a you know borrowed time I wasn it watch the Earth for hours from the window because it changes all the time you tend to look big picture and the longer you narrow it down and you start to pick out small bits of detail and start to identify places you might have visited or other things you want to look at yes when we go to other planets in our solar system I think the moment when we can no longer see Earth through the window will be very stressful because for us on board the station as soon as we have some free time we always look back at the Earth [Music] foreign the astronauts experience a unique feeling called the overview effect it in space [Music] and your perspective changes with regard to this planet which is so normal to us so finite when you look at it from the ground [Music] you can but you can see the frontiers of misery from up there you can see the environmental catastrophes the fires and sometimes you get the feeling that the Earth is calling out to us for help when you it was like being in a movie where they might Dolly a camera back but Zoom the lens in to where the actor in this case the Earth doesn sense of reality around it just comes Crashing Down and I had literally a physical reaction at that moment where you get it I just kind of get it in a way that I [Music] foreign the journey to the International Space Station is a dangerous Adventure this trip to space starts in the heart of Russia at the bikoner cosmodrome it to send astronauts to the ISS is on a Russian soyuz vessel nicknamed the space Taxi the trip to the ISS takes 48 hours astronauts are seated in this little module perched at a height of more than 40 meters high strapped into their seats ready for takeoff it The Descent module that the astronauts can also return to Earth when the vessel arrives in orbit the team can move into the orbital module the size of a small truck this is where they can relax [Music] at the other end is the service module which contains guidance systems batteries and motors for maneuvering the team has to check the vessel trajectory regularly and make adjustments if necessary the trip takes them roughly 30 times around the earth the time it takes for the soyuz to get into the same orbit as the ISS in order to dock with it [Music] as it approaches the International Space Station way and slows down [Music] although it is automated this approach is always tricky if there technical failure the commanding officer must be able to take over to control the Final Approach and it was during his first flight that British astronaut Tom Peak had to deal with an incident that could have had some dramatic consequences everything was going fine up until about 17 meters away from the space station so that was fairly close in fact that closest abort that there we had a sense of farewell one of our thrusters the Yuri then had to take over manual control and complete a manual docking it was just a question of talking the safety of the station depended on it the ISS isn up of many parts that stick out a collision would have been fatal not just for the crew on the soyuz but for those on board as well piloting in space is much more complex than piloting on Earth because there are six elements to manage when you drive a car you have two elements steering right or left and braking or accelerating up there in space you different variables at the same time you can go left right up down you can pivot anything you like it extremely complicated process a manual docking is certainly a difficult task to do it was made more complicated in our case because we were going from uh daytime to night time and the low Sun angle was reflecting a bright light off the space station so Yuri was having a very hard time seeing through the Periscope in order to see the docking port and to get the spacecraft correctly aligned [Music] it was very complicated but in the end I managed to get a distance from where I could see the docking area control the speed and get the angle right eventually we managed to dock it successfully until those perilous Maneuvers the space station had never witnessed an accident [Music] for some time now private companies along with NASA have been developing new spacecraft to take astronauts to the International Space Station [Music] the space workers are installing new docking modules one of the big steps of course was the removal of a large thermal cover by Rubens and Williams to expose the actual docking port to which the SpaceX crew Dragon the station currently has eight docking ports in addition to the passenger craft there is another kind of vessel that docks with the space station Supply vehicles [Music] we have a lot of unmanned resupply vehicles that get sent up to the space station we have Japanese resupply Vehicles we have Russian we have American [Music] every three months these vehicles Supply the space station delivering water a few Fresh Products clothes tools and experiments [Music] once empty these Supply vehicles have another key function they are used as the Space Station trash can base station is a closed system everything that you bring up at some time needs to come down so if you bring up clothing for example for the crew we don the crew has to wear the same pants you get two pants for six months you have to wear the same t-shirt for a week or for two weeks and then when it dirty and it accumulated in the cargo vehicles come join me in the progress vehicle which is loaded and ready to leave it to crouch right down because there much room I everything is arranged symmetrically to balance out the vessel heavy things go opposite heavy things you can see here for example there are purification columns buckets that we used and even our dirty laundry and little packages with our trash [Music] the vessels filled with trash are then unmoored they burn and disintegrate when they enter the Earth [Music] but some of the supply vessels fulfill a last function that directly involves the ISS they are used as Motors because the station is unable to maintain the right Orbit on its own the idea is the ISS is about 220 to 250 miles above the surface of Earth so you might think well so there why would you ever need to speed up it should just forever be in orbit well where the Isis is there very thin amount of atmosphere there it still there so we have basically this giant football field I mean the vehicle has a football field flying through space it a lot of surface area that by the small amount of air that atmosphere so that does slowly slowly ISS down and so the the ISS altitude is decaying by about two kilometers per month and if it were to have no reboosts then eventually the space station would re-enter Earth every six months a supply vessel is used to readjust the orbit of the ISS The Vessel starts its Motors and emits bursts of power to get the station moving to the right altitude thrust can be felt inside the station itself I acceleration it comes during the reboosters by using this camera uh 800 millimeter Land series it massive actually and there accelerations virtually no accelerations on this you can see I camera right here and it anywhere and I feeling the acceleration if I let go again and here it goes it I but it orbit that needs to be regulated they also have to keep the space station angled the right way so the space station maintains what we call lvlh local vertical local Horizon and that means that the space station flies around the earth always Earth facing the station on four gyroscopes without them traveling at 28 000 kilometers an hour the ISS would turn endlessly on itself and life inside would be simply impossible in zero gravity if you knock it it going to Tumble it around um like any object up here does however if I get this spinning so once the gyroscope is spinning you can just see how stable it becomes and however I knock it it change its plane it the same plane the gyroscopes turn like a spinning top or bicycle wheel to ensure stability but the rotation axis of the gyroscopes is also controlled allowing the station to tilt to follow the curve of the Earth by maintaining this lvlh it means that we have a great Earth observation platform that always looking at Planet Earth [Music] when they aren experiments the astronauts are busy maintaining the station [Music] we do have our one of the most important piece of equipment on International Space Station heading up here this is the vacuum cleaner [Music] although a filter system ensures the elimination of particles and certain microbes regular cleaning in this confined environment prevents bacteria from growing it also allows them to find parts they thought were lost forever [Music] there is always work being carried out on the International Space Station [Music] the daily lives of astronauts include plenty of time taken up with repairs and improvement work [Music] but despite all their precautions there are sometimes breakdowns and even major damage that Dyson discovered one evening in July 2010 just before going to bed everybody else had gone to bed and I was doing my routine checks of the space station on the U.S segment I was turning off the treadmill when all of a sudden red and yellow bells and whistles start going off and it was way more than just our treadmill having a problem and then it became pretty clear that there was a problem with the thermal control system the thermal control system is vital for the astronaut the station the temperature varies between minus 150 degrees in the shade and plus 120 degrees facing the Sun on board the space station the electrical apparatus and in particular the computers generate a large amount of heat to get rid of this heat the ISS has a cooling system cold fluids flow around the entire station there are water cooled circuits on the American segment the central beam and the solar panels are cooled using ammonia and the Russian segment uses a combination of chemicals we knew that the the most critical thing that could happen at that point was if we lost our other pump module if we did then we would have to start considering whether to go home on the ground as in the station the crew realized that the situation was critical to replace the defective ammonia pump they would have to go outside the station and repair it from the exterior [Music] more dangerous than any other activity spacewalks leave no room for improvisation and require lengthy preparations [Music] all the days leading up to it are filled with activities that have pretty severe consequences if you don if a cosmonaut tells you they aren afraid on a spacewalk or that they did a flight to the ISS and were calm and had no fears then they there are two depressurization airlocks for spacewalks one on the Russian part and the other on the American section [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] of say a 5 000 square foot house so it a it fraction compared to the outside structure [Music] humans are incapable of surviving in the space vacuum there is no oxygen the body is exposed to extreme temperatures to micrometeorites and cosmic rays carry out the repairs the astronauts therefore have to wear some extremely high-tech gear the the spacesuit is a phenomenal piece of Technology and Engineering it a mini space station it has to keep you alive the astronaut survival has a price because these spacesuits cost 15 million dollars a piece they are composed of a bubble helmet covered in filters to protect their eyes from the sun which could blind them instantaneously powerful lamps are there to illuminate in the dark and a camera sends images to the ground a small tube right by the mouth delivers water to the astronaut during their walk earpieces and microphones allow them to communicate with ground control and the rest of the team on the ISS on the front of the suit dials control the oxygen feed and temperature beneath the space suit the astronaut wears a piece of clothing crisscrossed with plastic tubes through which cold water flows to regulate the temperature a backpack contains reserves of oxygen and water along with batteries providing total autonomy for up to eight hours [Music] because of the absence of gravity the astronaut cannot feel the weight of these 130 kilograms of equipment but being able to move around with such a sudan requires exceptional physical capacities you know ninety percent of what you with your arms and hands and because it fingers in the gloves take effort takes effort to open your hands takes effort to close your hands because of the pressure and the stiffness of the gloves such a task requires constant focus and here more than anywhere there is no room for error it was one of the hardest if not the hardest things that we do in space it not just physically difficult it mentally difficult because you are not only fighting against the pressure of the suit with every motion that you make but you are concentrating the entire time and you itself is anywhere between six and a half to sometimes eight hours long without a break you spacesuit assembling and maintaining the station required more than one thousand hours of spacewalks during these sorties the astronauts carried out numerous essential tasks for the station without these spacewalks the ISS wouldn at 400 kilometers above the Earth and outside the station Tracy Dyson and Doug Wheelock hurried to remove the defective pump and replace it with one of the four replacement pumps on board the ISS bigger than a refrigerator it very large box very massive and it thankfully we had the use of the robotic arm Doug Wheelock was on the robotic arm hanging on to it and then I translated and met him in the spots where we were taking it from and putting it in and helping to guide it four spacewalks of 29 hours in total were necessary for these extreme plumbers to successfully repair the heating system the ground teams regained the the cooling and we powered up the space station and we we saved the space station how about that other than technical failings the International Space Station and its inhabitants face other dangers Richard Garriott is one of the non-professional astronauts who was allowed to travel to the ISS he remembers the many alarms that would sound every day because a small problem can quickly become a big problem it the for the problem when they to make sure you can address it before it becomes a big problem on board the space station the biggest danger is fire during training the astronauts learned to become real firefighters you have a flyer at your house here you run outside you call you know for the fire department they can come they can help you out you can leave your house right you can be safe but uh you know humble devices there you have to fight it I mean you have to be able to put it out another word for the astronauts is that on board the station they are no longer protected by the Earth the cosmic eruptions from Stars can cause cancer and lead to genetic mutations the only thing that can really protect you against that is density of material there impact protection that you can do to protect yourself from an atomic nucleus it the best protection is to sleep or or to spend as much time as you can behind as thick a heavy a mass of something you can so for example in the Russian segment where all the batteries are stored those batteries are a pretty good protection in the case of powerful Cosmic eruptions the zvezda and the destiny modules are the best places to protect the crew the third biggest threat to the International Space Station is space debris if you look through a 10 or 20 year old window they would impact spots of debris it was obviously created by something incredibly small like flake of paint but uh but still was hitting at a velocity of up to 34 000 miles an hour and so still you know still makes quite a wall up an object is small as a grain of sand launched at 28 000 kilometers per hour could make a hole in the hull of the station cause it to depressurize and kill the crew on board [Music] the engineers have drawn up a map that shows the parts of the space station most exposed to space debris in red this allows them to identify the zones that need protection as a priority the modules are covered with a layer of aluminum which slows down micro debris a layer of ceramic and Kevlar reduces the debris to dust the last layer blocks the particles and protects the astronauts there are more than one hundred thousand pieces of rocket and satellites The Leftovers of human activity in space in the path of the ISS from the size of an apple to the size of a bus the engineers at Ground Control are able to survey this debris and readjust the altitude of the station to avoid any impact [Music] if any debris or micro meteorite shower are missed by the surveillance Radars the astronauts must close all the airlocks and go immediately to their soyuz where they must wait hoping the ISS avoids the debris if the impact is too violent the soyuz and the crew will return to Earth you kind of fall back on your training right I think everyone has been trained on debris avoidance Maneuvers and close call encounters you know what we doing here isn have a good time with space it real and astronauts are uh not just tools but people and Friends people that we train and and talk to on our co-workers so something we take very seriously here [Music] since 1998 the International Space Station has been serving Mankind and its thanks to the ISS that we have learned how to live in space today everyone is looking to Mars and even Beyond thanks to the ISS these dreams may now become a reality I agree with Constantine he said that the Earth is our cradle and that it all eternity and I also think that humanity is obliged to become an interplanetary civilization originally the station was due to be removed from orbit and destroyed in 2020. but its life has been extended to 2024 or even 2028. enough to maintain Mankind presence in space for a few more years to continue deepening our knowledge the research we space station right now is already helping for those missions we learning how to live and work in space we we interfaces We Have astronauts that are driving Rovers around on here on Earth from the space station we understanding those communication control techniques we food on board the space station we understanding more about radiation and how it affects the human body and how we can protect Crews against radiation when we do these missions so there plethora of research that board the space station at the moment that is going to help us in those future Martian missions the International Space Station is already humankind technological success beyond that it is proof that cooperation between people is possible I hope that human space flight at least can help people also around the earth bring them together and find peaceful Solutions like we do in the International Space Station despite of the conflicts between the U.S Russia Europe and so on a lot of tensions we still work together we still can operate together we still do science together we still work for the benefit of humankind together I would hope that people around the world would take example to the ISS for them [Music] thank you [Music]	Success

Sunny West Winds around 15 miles an hour in the afternoon tonight partly cloudy in the evening it I but my home knows I internet is expanding and as it does it powers [Music] Alexa you forgot to butter my toast I the internet is no longer just a network of computers and servers now it network of things things that know us things that know what we like to eat how long we sleep how to open our front doors and even the rhythm of our Heartbeats Alexa where are my keys your keys are in your bedroom at 8 30 a.m you have a meeting [Music] the Internet isn got a body a body of devices limbs eyes ears and even a brain each device we connect to the internet becomes part of it but are these devices at our service or are they secretly pulling the strings oh today the internet is everywhere listening to us influencing us becoming part of us but if the internet now has a body how far can it reach [Music] the internet is an intelligence amplifier but almost everything that you can think of a positive and beneficial use for there beings they don our biological tissue tools are appendages extensions of who we are and those tools shape our behaviors much as we shape them [Music] connected the number of things that could go wrong is just going to grow little robots are doing more things for us than we realize there are now billions of network sensors they make up what is called The Internet of Things just like watching the planet develop a nervous system [Music] the merging of a lot of these Technologies is going to lead to the first true machine intelligence and then what never can be too careful it before the devices control us [Music] but we without the work of one man Doug Engelbert Doug engelbart Doug engelbart Doug Engelbert Doug Engelbert Douglas ever met through his entire life he was focused on one thing intelligence augmentation the notion was the hymns were pretty good could be a lot better he imagined networked Computing in a way that was both highly Technical and highly idealistic even utopian [Music] [Applause] in your office you were supplied with a computer that was alive for you all day Anthony responded the every action you had how much value could you derive from that it was in the fall of 1968 when Doug engelbart staged what has come to be known as the mother of all demos come in Menlo Park okay there Park several thousand computer Engineers were in a hall and they saw Doug engelbart up on a screen using a computer to communicate with people who were not in the same room I spring in Jeff rulerson from Menlo Park he working independently hi Jeff and it was the first time many of them had ever seen computers as a true communication tool Suddenly at that moment that room full of people began to imagine not just computers but computer networks angleboard is actually the person who invents the computer mouse was kind of like a little wooden box that you could move around with your hand you think about that for a moment it the computer to the human body to the human hand you can see the devices that I black on white so it looked like a piece of paper it mouse so you can point two things on the screen controls to a potentiometer he invented hyper links so that you could connect a document to another document I wonder I can say the library what am I supposed to pick up there I can just point to that and oh I see overdue books and all this was a system which for all practical purposes was the world wide web in a box thank you very much for coming to the dedication ceremonies [Music] Engelbert and his lab actually helped humanize the computer but bring us together and by bringing us together would let us be more fully human Steve Jobs was the first one to really get this we computer is to me it remarkable tool that we with and it bicycle for our minds foreign [Music] iPod with touch controls a revolutionary mobile phone and a breakthrough internet communications device [Applause] three separate devices this is one device [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I remember when the iPhone was first announced back in 2007 I could absolutely not wait to get one and when I finally did get my hands on one it felt like I was living in the future and now I can hardly remember what it was like to live without this it that has all the answers all the world knowledge and information that can summon cars that can move mountains that can make people do things all by rubbing a magic mirror and no place has embraced that magic more than Silicon Valley here you see the smartphone everywhere but it generation of smart devices is currently incubating see them I alto devices beta I have not I you everything here is out of the box so you can touch it feel it interact with it see how it it can create lightscapes Bright Day a Sunset date night movie night you no longer have to carry your keys you can control it directly from your app 3D video viewing whoa any command that you would be able to give your phone you can do through the button it will automatically water for you you can interact with it you can touch it and talk to it put it on your keys you can put it on your kid your dog your backpack whatever now we haven crushed anything yet oh my goodness why I want one the beta store feels like a toy store for grown-ups but as I was about to find out it lab where they you our store was made to bring the best parts about the internet to Brick and Mortar retail Although our Store does sell products we make no money from selling products which is very unusual on the in the brick and mortar World in fact we only store like that how do you make a profit if you making any money off selling products we have this really unique business model for retail where we directly rent space to companies and we partnered with a company called retail next retellex has figured out how to use computer vision from overhead cameras to understand how people shop in stores at the beta store the most important sensor isn it as you interact with products these cameras are watching you measuring how much time you spend at each station foreign and the customers don that they anything like this is the most naive version of tracking out there I came to Beta to look at smart devices but I was surprised to discover that they were actually looking at me to learn more about how smart cameras help retailers like beta I paid a visit to the maker of the sensor retail next wouldn Shopper to know what catches her eye introducing Aurora by retail next the first all-in-one sensor designed specifically for the complex needs of retail the Next Generation sensor for Shopper measurement so walk me through this uh you know someone comes into the store what sorts of data could you tell about that person you can tell a lot about the type of person coming into the store [Music] male female approximate age and you can capture a lot of information about that path through the store how how can you tell age and gender of the people walking into a store yeah so it it works very similar to how human eyes work but it automatically if you want to understand the type of custom the shops a particular store at a particular time [Music] retail next cameras help retailers identify and Target their best customers but other analytics companies take facial recognition to a new level the system does not need an exaggerated expression the system can also detect micro expressions [Music] some use cameras that can tell how you feel about a product [Music] whether you like it or not while cameras are very useful sensors for retailers they to the one we have on us all the time our smartphone they want to use the unique identifiers that are associated with your cell phone to find out where you shop how long you linger in which section of the store for retailers your smartphone is like your digital fingerprint it tells them if you store before and when you were there last if 10 years ago someone said to you would you mind if I planted a little tracking device on you that would tell me where you are what you money on who you you be okay you I would never let you do that [Music] now people sleep in front of the Apple Store for three days for the privilege of buying an 800 sensor that does exactly that and a lot more [Applause] retail next insists that while they don your data is completely Anonymous unless you opt in if you opt in you exactly who you are and they can now track and Target you in real time but this kind of tracking didn in stores open online don they don better the cookie so what exactly is a cookie and how do companies use it to track US to find out I spoke to this guy that cookie in 1994. concept like a fortune wrapped in a cookie a cookie is a file and the fortune inside is a unique string of text you can but websites can time you visit websites Place cookies on your computer these bite-sized files help websites remember you this is what allows you to do things like shopping carts you get this fortune cookie and you hold on to the cookie and you don what really don website again you give the cookie back and the website breaks it open reads the message and says oh I know who you are you the toaster and I shopping cart that was the idea harmless right something unforeseen happened [Music] long before advertisers noticed cookies and AD networks started using them to track US [Music] you start this really terrible arms race and the arms race is to know as much about you as possible they could Target advertisements in a way that never worked on TV because the TV is a medium that you watch the internet is a medium that watches you as you watch it today every move you make online each cookie you received it becomes part of a virtual profile or a dossier of you these profiles include information we don [Music] I wear a Fitbit so I some weight and what that means is couple times a day I am reporting my physical activity levels to Fitbit which may well be aggregating and selling my data to people who want to put me on diet plans [Music] you get this sort of three-dimensional picture of somebody we can actually predict what they they now can find out exactly who susceptible to being manipulated to buying various products there are con men that are looking for older people and they know that that person has been online looking at places to invest money and how to best retire that get the phone call and invest your life savings in this new stock so if you have all that data you could Target somebody who is in a weakened state that virtual dossiers was predicted long ago [Music] [Applause] this educational film from 1967 lays out a future all too familiar by the year 2000 computers will invade our privacy on a scale hardly imaginable they will be interconnected and unless prevented by new legislation will be able to sell information on where we travel how much we spend and in what restaurants and hotels whether and when we pay our bills what we do with our evenings and with whom they will be 20 typewritten pages of dossier on each of 230 million citizens in North America foreign [Music] dossier has all this information and much much more but the company with the most valuable dossier is when you probably use every day Google knows a lot about us because Google knows our intentions and when we think about the world of advertising intention-based advertising tends to be the stuff that actually works [Music] it was not so long ago that people were saying how does anyone think this company can make money by giving away search it was considered a silly idea Google includes pop-ups generates billions of dollars for the company every month in fact ninety percent of the company Revenue comes from ads and Google only gets paid if people click now most of the web pages that you visit on the internet allow Google to track you most people love YouTube I Love YouTube why did they purchase YouTube because it gives them more information why did they develop Chrome a browser why did they develop Android an operating system they information on us on more than 60 different platforms and we are completely oblivious when was the last time you read a 60-page user agreement my guess is you probably just clicked I agree I certainly do [Music] and when we aren easy to forget that the Internet of Things is still watching us pray where you go even when you actively using your phone still listening [Music] companies are finding very clever ways to get us engaged in helping them with their businesses and if they can our devices to do it the devices that are going to inhabit Our Lives not just cell phones but your smart refrigerator your smart car all those things are basically going to be eavesdropping tools for someone foreign Barbie doll introducing a whole new way to play with Barbie there doll that when you turn it on will find your Wi-Fi network and will use the cloud to have a conversation with you about your interests what do you want to be when you grow up I want to be a vet that sick animals is an amazing goal hello Barbie is recording all these conversations and sending them to the cloud s and tell me what about the city to me this is basically a Barbie doll designed to interrogate an eight-year-old girl and get her to tell stories uh I want to be a scientist well I guess at school I really enjoyed chemistry and physics the study of physics is incredible take gravity you can you trip it down did you ever fall or trip on something yes I have definitely fallen down a number of times in my life Barbie it happens to me all the time that gravity pulling you down sometimes with an ouch wow you sound to me like the next Marie Curie or Albert Einstein am I right I think you are right Barbie I knew you were a smart cookie [Music] as long as our devices work for corporations they good consumers but what if someday soon our machines not only prompt us to buy they also offer us a new form of currency shares will share our tastes our interests and even our private lives foreign share your biometric data today 500 points you didn [Music] Lucy does your boyfriend know you [Music] however strange this may seem now it will very quickly become The New Normal today the devices that connect us to the world also mine us for information but none of this would be possible without a World War II era technology and the most beautiful woman in the world the technology of course is Wireless but the woman you are the man I thank you of you seal it with a kiss what about it Eddie go ahead by 1938 American audiences knew the Austrian actress Hedy Lamarr as a dynamic and stunning Leading Lady bunny I don just an eye for but she was no ordinary movie star I came in here she was an inventor evenings inventing an improved traffic light and a tablet that carbonated and flavored your water [Music] Europe descend into chaos heady turned her attention to inventions that could help the war effort it has a strange effect on me now she wondered could radio Transmissions be secured from enemy eavesdropping then she heard this ballet mechanic this music was written in 1924 by an avant-garde composer George and tile who saw it as a celebration of machines as Music Makers his complex Arrangement included three xylophones four bass drums three airplane propellers and 16 player pianos player pianos used paper rolls with punch holes to generate the music foreign they were synchronized Hedy Lamarr realized that the synchronized paper rolls were just what she needed for her next invention secure radio communication using player pianos as inspiration she and antile designed a system called frequency hopping in which a secret message would hop across radio frequencies to do this the system used punch holes on a paper roll but unlike a player piano these holes wouldn control musical notes they control frequencies the message would be sent in pieces and on the receiving side an identical paper roll would reassemble the message [Music] she radio Transmissions impervious to eavesdropping Petty immediately donated her patent to the military but the commanders weren they turned up their noses at the idea of a secure system of paper rolls her invention lay dormant for decades but Hedy had the right idea and it was not lost on everyone forever it was a hidden gold mine those who think getting a car phone is not for them whatever the reason haven kept up with the booming industry of cellular radio telephones in the 1980s frequency hopping was finally Declassified [Music] quickly got the first cellular telephone is just 5.95 Hedy lamarr reaction an explosion of wireless devices since the year 2000 mobile data traffic has increased nearly 400 million times and much of this growth has come in the developing world the invention that Hedy hoped would save the world has instead transformed it cultures are now skipping a generation of Technology developing cultures where there was no telephone there was no running water there was no electricity now you bring a cell phone into that Village and its Horizons expand unimaginably it will be a billion handsets in Africa in 2016. which is extraordinary the poorest on the planet can afford a mobile phone this idea of Wireless Mobility will change the way people think about themselves about National boundaries about education about almost everything [Music] the earth almost like a layer of atmosphere it connected but are we really more connected to the people around us [Music] what is the impact technology on our daily lives are being always mediated by a technological device [Applause] all benign it away from the noise what if you could live somewhere truly quiet without all the wireless noise welcome to the quiet Zone we national radio quiet Zone and it America thirteen thousand square miles about the size of Massachusetts and Connecticut combined at the heart of the quiet Zone lies the town of green Bank West Virginia home of the largest steerable radio telescope in the world the quiet Zone was created to protect it the green Bank telescope is with Swiss watch the size of a football stadium but while it is so enormous its tolerances are measured in fractions of a millimeter we stands taller than the Statue of Liberty but the reflector surface is 2.3 acres in size bigger the bucket the more raindrops you catch today the telescope is on The Cutting Edge of seti the search for extraterrestrial intelligence in recent years we the green Bank telescope the basic organic molecules the kind of things that in some sense are the building blocks of life floating out in the gas between the stars but these discoveries come at a price [Music] radio silence for hundreds of miles in all directions unlike traditional telescopes radio telescopes don radio waves in the 1950s astronomers built the telescope here because it was a quiet place to do just that listen The Observatory started in the 50s and they picked Green Bank specifically they say we are the quietest place on Earth so I don quiet place there is for Green Bank residents this doesn just mean radio silence it means Wireless silence yeah so living in green make does have its challenges can sell your phone there here wireless speakers wireless headphones garage door openers cause problems electric fence around someone Garden microwaves Bluetooth devices remote control cars PS4s whis Nintendos the craziest things that you would never think would cause interference that do the telescope Wi-Fi here just completely overwhelms what we what beginning to interact with the internet as if it is the only other social being we have in our lives and that is the dangerous part I think Mike being a teenager in a disconnected town would you feel you the girls that just recently moved to this school asked me when she first moved here if we had cell phone service she was like I can my cell phone I was like you going to this is Green Banks middle school in the shadow of the green Bank telescope say you New York or Maryland [Music] walking across the sidewalk yeah they just staring at the shops yeah Becky liked my status oh Bob comments and I totally gonna respond to that I think honestly if like the internet crashed here right now and we had no internet we could survive seeing people sit on the side of the road and wait for all these people to come get them and we can get out and change our tire and get back in and go home like we need to we don call people on our cell phones we actually drive to their house and knock on their front door yeah yeah I feel sometimes that we are the control population for a gigantic experiment being played on Humanity by the Telecommunications in Industry we are living without the benefits and distractions of cellular technology I I see people standing next to one another diddling with their little devices it feels to me like while I wasn took up cigarette smoking elsewhere the internet is attached to you all of the time whether you utilizing it or not it with your device even when it pocket but you you interesting to think that something special has happened here but in fact it weird has happened everywhere else green Bankers may enjoy their radio silence but for the rest of us living without our mobile devices wouldn be unpleasant it would be impossible we are Outsourcing our memories into these devices and we now [Music] there College age students say they can day device free for many people the cell phone has become a body appendage they can essentially their third skin the library of all human knowledge is now just a screen away we may think this means we relying more and more on machines to do the thinking for us what used to be research has been replaced with search Google search [Music] in 1998 Larry Page and Sergey Brin launched Google to unravel the tangle of information on the web they did this using algorithms they used one algorithm to index the web and another one to rank the results from the billions of pages in the index they gave you the ability to effectively search through every page of every book in the library pagerank Google decided which page would be in the coveted first place the more links you get but it could be that somebody could have fewer links but for more important places those links would count for more and that was their secret sauce each rank worked so well that Google quickly became synonymous with search [Music] but while search results often number in the millions or even billions usually only 10 matter typically you see 10 search results on the first page 50 of our clicks go to the top two search results fifty percent and most people never look beyond the first page but what we have begun to realize is that search rankings are impacting decisions people make about everything we let Google decide what information for us but with millions of results that may match your query why do you get these 10 hey guys today I wanted to give you my answer to the big question how to rank number one in Google when Google designed its algorithm it inadvertently created a new industry search engine optimization today we SEO and what I believe Google wants there that really really clever that tactic so make sure you implement that these experts have learned how to optimize a website structure or content to make it a top result the algorithm is the key to cracking Google Now what if I told you that we have cracked Google all too often we focus on beating the Google bot rather than feeding the googlebot whether a website knows how to feed the googlebot might determine which brand of dog food you purchase it may affect where you apply to college [Music] an election that because program operating however it we can trust it the algorithm has to put things into an order so what if the algorithm itself ends up favoring one candidate over another is the activity on Google in fact creating more interest in a candidate and in turn generating more votes but this problem isn engines Facebook has run experiments manipulating the outcomes of Elections I mean the way they do it is they can actually make you more likely to vote if Facebook just sent out go out and vote reminders but they sent them only to people of one political party if they did that on voting day they could easily flip an election backlash bring against Facebook former Facebook Insider calling it quote absolutely bias an article posted Monday said Facebook workers suppressed conservative leaning news stories in its trending section people thought this was outrageous because here technical system and then opinionated humans were coming in and mucking with it but that these things there are no neutral technological systems today the most advanced algorithms are artificial intelligence programs called neural networks like dogs these AIS aren they a process called machine learning foreign yes that is correct the next generation of robots will learn like an insect or a baby [Music] it to walk learn how to navigate into this world rather than having all the lessons programmed from the very start with machine learning artificial intelligence is no longer fully under our control What machines become as intelligent as we are assuming that we are intelligent any machine that can make decisions choices which can behave in a way which is not predictable by its designers and there are many machines like this now I brand new product in 2015 Google released an AI program to organize photos using machine learning Google photos understands what you by automatically organizing your memories was caught off guard when their algorithm labeled a photo of African Americans as gorillas people who trained these artificial intelligence systems trained them on white people these weren but their implicit biases of how they built and trained these systems end up embedding this incredible set of racist assumptions and just because a machine can learn from humans the right thing as Microsoft learned from their chatbot Tay humans love to corrupt A.I hello world the more you talk the smarter Tay gets Microsoft design taste software to mimic the speech patterns of 18 to 24 year olds even the best algorithms make mistakes at scale it did not take long for internet trolls to poison Tay taze designers trained the bot to improvise based on what people said to her algorithms are a lot more likely to make mistakes than people are and they can also be tricked much more easily than people can zoom Tay was ranting about Hitler watching racist and anti-feminist attacks these systems have amazing blind spots this happens all the time algorithms are used for everything from college admissions online dating hiring decisions loan approvals stock market Investments through to studying influenza outbreaks and cancer research a series of programming algorithms are making decisions without any of us having insight into how those decisions are being made and that scary machines are going to be running my life and everyone else so I was curious to know how they learn and here at MIT they something that up to now only humans can do Drive [Music] [Laughter] [Music] welcome to ducky town [Music] ducky Town may look cute but it real mission to test the challenges of driverless Vehicles quickly with the safety of miniature scale what autonomous vehicles in ducky town so the idea here is that well now we have this city where we can deploy 50 of these things very easily in an afternoon and we don logistical problems but the research problems are still preserved what it the camera to identify the road lines and then when it gets to an intersection it reads the intersection sign and then picks a random allowable direction to turn based on what it reads on the sign what are the really hard problems to solve in making a truly autonomous vehicle one big problem is that every piece of the environment has to be perceived somehow and that includes pedestrians cyclists other cars the hard part is being right about that 100 of the time to establish Liam pointed me to all the problems that they haven figured out just yet unpredictable humans bad weather detours and what to do in the event of an unavoidable our self-driving cars have a lot to learn but unlike us they learn quickly really quickly there powerful in robotics called Cloud robotics which basically is the realization that you can interconnect every robot with the internet so if you all of the robots will know immediately that than human learning and it fiction at all it deployed in the self-driving car world our robots today understands space they understand their location in space they can navigate in space but not much more [Music] but what happens when robots can do everything we can do I think the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race with artificial intelligence we are summoning the demon you know those stories where there guy with the pentagram and the holy water and he can control the demon didn we should not be confident in our ability to keep a super intelligent Genie locked up in its bottle forever sooner or later it will out for intelligent AI has the potential to tip tip the balance of power if a cloud-based intelligence can communicate instantly how will we humans maintain control [Music] hello what how are you to find out more about machine intelligence I decided to video conference with Kevin Warwick professor of cybernetics at Coventry University he human and machine intelligence to create a hybrid a cyborg what are your thoughts on artificial intelligence linking it to you you become part of it it becomes part of you and so you take on board the power of AI rather than have it acting against you Kevin explained that while humans and machines seem different our minds both use electrical signals and binary code each brain cell is a binary signal just like a computer in fact you can send brain signals across the internet as though it Kevin doesn possibilities of using the internet as a nervous system he in 2002 Kevin implanted an electrode array in his arm and connected it to a robotic hand over the Internet becoming the world whoa I went to Columbia University in New York and the guys there helped me plug my nervous system into the internet and we with the implant in place linked to the internet when I moved my hand in New York the robot hand then moved from my brain signals in the UK my brain was receiving signals back from the fingertips and I was able to feel how much force the hand was applying on a different continent that is incredible so with the internet and with an implant your brain and your body don that arm can be I mean ultimately it can be on a different planet do you think that ultimately down the track that leads us to kind of meld our nervous systems in a big Network oh I hope so yes I hope so sincerely this cybernetic Network could help humans and machines understand each other better I mean when you look at how humans communicate and compare it to technology I mean you have to be embarrassed frankly it we mechanical pressure waves to communicate they can electrochemical signals in my brain and then I convert those to these trivial coded pressure waves it get with the times we have the technology now to upgrade humans so we need to do it some call this upgrade the singularity point of no return since the birth of artificial intelligence we would catch up to us perhaps that time will come and we we in the machines will sort of pass in opposite directions or a machine and a man [Music] the question is what will life be like after the singularity you arrange itself wire into your visual cortex into your hearing system to the rest of your brain and you know put you on the internet welcome our brain will interact with all the chips in the room thank you [Music] we just walk into a room mentally turn on the lights mentally turn on the internet reminder [Music] we simply blink and see all the information we need to know to conduct the day [Music] it of where we end and the world begins because more and more it it living in our own personalized Universe we software shell you to listen to every conversation you have read all your emails monitor all your your biometric body data and that ai mission is to make your life better but once the singularity arrives machine intelligence will quickly be out of our control as soon as a computer in some sense wakes up because it has access through the internet and has access to everything all human knowledge it will transform into something else if we do have a world of super smart robots if we are very very lucky they will treat us like pets however if we very very unlucky they will treat us like food me I [Music] I call the internet the internet we have been building a nest for the first true machine intelligences that arise when you talk about unintended consequences you end up with you know maybe something that we think is going to be really good and that isn how Reliant we are upon the invisible systems that surround us every day and provide us so much we what if the internet doesn What If instead it becomes our Guiding Light from the moment we will look to it for wisdom and beauty [Music] it will see our strengths [Applause] and Foster them it will guide us to realize our potential provide answers to our biggest questions we have always yearned to understand our connection to the cosmos [Music] our place in the universe perhaps our greatest creation the internet [Music] will someday return the favor [Music] and Enlighten us [Music]	Success
Unveiling the Material Perils of Digital Threats | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOCUMENTARY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L79LxDuoVA	SLICE Science	foreign s have accessed the traffic controls of some European high-speed railways they brakes on a late model SUV with potentially scary results [Applause] along with the computerized controls to a blast furnace at a German Steelman this [Music] hello Tommy nice pajamas are you having trouble sleeping maybe I can help can you imagine hearing a stranger voice coming from the baby monitor in your Nursery I mean how scary is that but something like this actually happened to a couple in Washington state they had their top-of-the-line baby monitor hat but we really shouldn since we know that the Internet is just about everywhere and can be connected to just about every device that makes my life and yours convenient from phones to Facebook we convenience over privacy but at a price nice pajamas Tommy you know we as a consumer we as the citizen we as the technologists didn Envision the dark side they that try and steal your identity to steal your funds to steal into actual property from organizations to steal National Secrets it physical domains of warfare what is a proportional response to a Cyber attack there is no absolute sense of right and wrong the tools come and go the capabilities come and go the threats come and go on a regular basis what it routine surveillance clearly you data do you have on me and what are you going to do with it one of the things we deciding who does technology really work for does it work for the individual or does it work for the state does it work for the company does it work for the institution foreign [Music] people want the device that make their life easier and security for the most part is is taken as a granted people just naturally assume that due diligence has been paid where rarely is that the case trying to make the internet secure to make it a safe place has become a billion dollar industry it said malicious hackers because as it turns out hackers come in different flavors white hats are the good guys black hats are the bad guys and gray hats Falls somewhere in between my friend Sammy kamkar is one of the good guys I got into hacking and Technology when I was around 10 years old I got my first computer and my mom had to get me this computer and the first day I got it I set up the internet and you know one of the best days of my life I went online and I started searching for fix files you know one of the best shows and I found a chat room where I could chat with people about the X-Files I go into this chat room and immediately someone told me get out and I said no he said you have 10 seconds to get out I said okay random person on the internet stayed in the chat room and 10 seconds later my computer crashed I got a blue screen I had no idea what happened my mom spent all her money on this computer and I just freaked out I was scared that the computer was destroyed but simultaneously thought that was the coolest thing ever how do I do that hacking in the mid 90s was a lot different than the hacking that people associate today there was no malicious intent there was no theft it was all very very much driven by intellectual curiosity driven by that Curiosity Sammy who at the time wasn figured out how to hack into Myspace a wildly popular early social media site when he was done everyone who visited his Myspace page ended up with the phrase Sammy is my hero on their Myspace page essentially I had created a worm or virus and there Sammy million Myspace users forcing Myspace to take their entire site down within 24 hours Myspace didn the government it was the Lada that came after me for writing a virus ultimately I took a plea agreement where I couldn touch a computer for three years of my life now Sammy makes a living looking for vulnerabilities in online enabled products like refrigerators cars and baby monitors everything we have has technology whether it car or door lock even so I want to see what supposed to work and what you wouldn Sammy is a member of a new and growing International Workforce young white hat hackers hired to break into impenetrable systems and close their loopholes for them welcome foreign I hope so companies looking to identify hard to spot vulnerabilities or bugs frequently offer cash rewards called Bug bounties and like a high-tech Headhunter hacker one connects the talent to the task we use the term hacking but we need to stop thinking about it as something closely related to criminals it very diverse community of software Engineers Tinkers hobbyists academics security researchers Microsoft has paid a a bounty to a five-year-old hacker who bypassed the parental controls on his Xbox Google has done the same to a 7 year old hacker technology bugs crop up all over the place anyone is capable of finding them this is actually Uber program you see here we a hacker called mdv and you see that he of the Uber security team to understand the potential issue he found what amazing to me looking at this chain is just how friendly this conversation is absolutely it this bug and they you did thanks for doing that here some money it absolutely the ideal response that you want to see from a company this kind of cooperation is nice to see but it wouldn vulnerabilities weren serious what stops a white hat hacker from turning bad if they find a really good vulnerability same thing that stuffs your local doctor from taking out a kidney and selling it on the black market you rely upon ethics and legal codes and people character the number of bad apples out there who would choose to use that that knowledge for malicious or Criminal Intent is relatively small and that okay as long as we and have designed for that eventuality Prime has obviously been around with us since the dawn of civilization technology just allows criminals to really automate their attacks to scale them so now you can have a guy out in Eastern Europe that is attacking someone here in the United States without any repercussions without a great deal of effort and that different been a busy morning I was answering emails and watching TV when my mom called she was going on and on about some problem with her computer and she was using words like hijacked and these Crooks first I noticed that my computer is incredible as long and then I saw this message that all your files encrypted welcome to the world of ransomware a virus that usually ransomware is introduced through uh email is usually unsolicited email but sometimes it cyber crime where someone may have manipulated an email address or someone that you know changed a letter change the punctuation mark and when you open that email and click on that link your computer is infected the virus then grabs every personal file on your computer and blocks them up encrypts them with something that actually called a key and without that encryption key everything on your computer is inaccessible Gone Forever unless you pay up and that called ransomware ransomware is profitable and popular because most people don their data I had all kind of photographs of my granddaughter but I didn they were the only ones but anyway it shows your clock and it says you have to pay in seven days and they wanted 500 and I said it absolutely know it that have no choice it people are falling prey to this and how many of them are actually paying these ransoms they don for everyone but if just 10 of the people pay that hundreds of millions of dollars my mom paid the ransom and she got those files back there have to suck it up and deal they stole my files they from scratch or you pay the ransom because they ransomware has become a thriving international criminal Enterprise in the first three months of 2016 private individuals government agencies police departments and hospitals paid more than 209 million dollars just to get access to their own files and when serious amounts of money are involved so is the Secret Service good afternoon everybody let started from what we have in town this week former President Clinton is in town the secret service has a duly integrated Mission it is best known for its protection of the president of the United States and its nation elected officials on the other side of the coin is the secret Services investigative mission by statutory Authority we investigate Financial crimes and use of computers to Target our nation infrastructure and financial markets today we warrant in operation lunar eclipse we have credible information about a suspect who Manhattan the suspect is a white male between the ages of 40 and 50. it was last seen on First Avenue we execute the three teams when you think of bank robbers you probably think of masks guns and explosives but modern thieves know that the big money is no longer rooted in the physical world one of the largest bank heists in history was a cyber crime in 2013 high-end hackers stole 40 million dollars from thousands of ATMs around the world all in just a few hours [Music] infiltrated the computer system of a credit card processing company inside a bank within the country of Oman this is sort of a logistical Ocean for cyber crime the hackers found a vulnerability in the company Processing platform they removed the cash limits on hundreds of prepaid debit cards and then had them printed up in the three-dimensional world the cards were then distributed to a large network of so-called Street caches thieves positioned at ATMs in two dozen countries all waiting to dip their cards grab the money and go there were hundreds of them waiting for a release of a PIN number and then carefully as Clockwork they released the pin number these individuals go to the ATM and remove funds this was a very large pyramid where you had the hackers at the top of the pyramid you had managers you had field operatives and finally you had that simultaneous cash out 25 countries on five continents and the cashing out of over 45 million dollars within 12 hours [Music] not all cyber criminals are masterminds there were two individuals who were Brazen enough to post on their social media accounts that they had in fact stolen a large amount of money and they proceeded to do a selfie holding a pile of cash and that was one of the methods utilized to to affect arrests in this case foreign trusions are relatively new uh field probably over the last five to seven years it usually International in scope I can be emanating from Canada becoming from Eastern Europe Finland Russia Australia and everybody is using the same tool and that is the internet 2015 was a banner year for international cyber crime costing about 400 billion dollars worldwide but not all cyber criminals are in it for the money take the famous hack of Sony pictures for example believed to be the work of the North Korean government North Korea yes it crippling one of the world powerful entertainment Studios nobody quite sure why the North Koreans leaked thousands of embarrassing corporate emails employees Social Security numbers and even unreleased movies Fury and the remake of Annie were posted on illicit websites why did North Korea State actor go after Sony I don because they want to enter into the movie business one theory is that they were responding to a Sony film the interview a comedy that portrayed the assassination of their dear leader president Kim Jong-un think about that for a second that means that a country attacked a company pretty crazy terrorism an act of War a moral attack on its leadership they thought it was a direct attack upon the North Korean regime they didn didn say dog the film was crude but the Cyber attack was sophisticated they specifically targeted I.T administrators and stole their credentials so they actually had administrator level privileges on the network to deploy their malware to every single system to me it was an incredibly important moment for the United States because it wasn a an attack on the company and its employees they actually issued threats to movie theaters across this country people were suddenly afraid that to me is Terrorism and that comes with some pretty serious consequences I think the United States government is trying to still figure out the rules of the road in terms of when they should step in to defend the property and and the rights of the company so a state actor going after a Lockheed Martin for instance or some critical infrastructure owned in private hands if it insurance owned by the private sector if it where I have my money and I can retrieve it out of an ATM I mean at some point and we figure out when this line is when does hacking become an Act of War [Music] so as you all may be aware recent reporting suggests that Air Force space command was hacked we don know there was a grave breach we believe that the route of Ingress actually came from a subcontractor part of the defense industrial base we absconded with at this point but we do believe that our GPS systems have been compromised okay at this point these issues of national network security are at an enormous scale what is the security that locking nuclear missiles and Warheads what is the security that take care of the power grid or the GPS systems these are very vital questions and the consequences of being wrong are extreme here at West Point instructors like major Sean Lonergan are exploring those questions intensely as they train our next Generation soldiers to be cyber Warriors you know the United States has enjoyed ever since our founding a lot of security we our North and our South and our two best allies the Pacific and the Atlantic typically keep us safe but now cyber is the one domain of warfare where we Face near competitors someone abroad that can reach out and attack the U.S Homeland and that do you think we could give the civilian sector access to the military-grade GPS I think it satellite-based global positioning system really we exercise you reaching the consequences would be take GPS away there tracking there but the largest impact would be agriculture they drive combines then water and harvest and if you take GPS out of that equation and those machines can anymore we so what happens if we hold Pakistan responsible even if they the culprit one of the big things in cyber crime and cyber warfare is attribution it thing if you rob a bank and there picture of you going through the bank and we have a pretty good idea you just robbed the bank but if you in cyberspace and you can out who attacked you as a matter of national policy what do you do about that it old days countries needed long-range missiles to reach us now they can do an awful lot of damage with not much more than a keyboard that this country being probed but not just our infrastructure I think that we are seeing more and more of these persistent threats right the hacktivists that the criminals the state actors we don know oftentimes what they want to achieve by them in 2016 the defense department allocated 5.5 billion dollars to cyber operations with a large percentage dedicated to the U.S cyber command but ironically one of our biggest leaps in cyber defense dates back to a horrifyingly low-tech attack [Music] there are good reasons for having a strong intelligence collection capability within any country right you want to be able to hunt down people who are actually suspected of serious wrongdoing who are buying bomb making materials we nuclear programs things that are very destabilizing and dangerous on that scale it was former NSA contractor Edward Snowden who first revealed how a program designed to find terrorists overseas was massively and secretly expanded after 9 11 to spy on American citizens I worked at the NSA I worked directly with the tools of mass surveillance in my last position in Hawaii I could see the world I sitting my desk could type in any name sort of any phone number and pull up the records associated with that traffic now there are some policy restrictions on how this is supposed to be used they say to Target an American for example I should get a warrant before I do it but technically it to be looked at of course the NSA had a lot of help the tracking capability was already built into the internet companies like apple Google Microsoft and Facebook are happily collecting storing and selling data about their users that you know a lot of people are worried about government agencies spying on them but they don Google or at T who are handling their data minute by minute and in fact can do pretty much whatever they want with it you have to realize that when you byproduct of your daily activities in the modern world are producing records when you connect Google when you connect Facebook when you connect government when you connect health insurance when you connect your purchase records on amazon.com they comprise perfect records of private lives in a way that the history of the world what it routine surveillance [Music] but by having it creep up on us and by having it be the consumer bargain we end up responding with a shrug hey Facebook Apple iPhone right now I simply expect to be listened to we the radio caller on ourselves it called a smartphone now this tracks us as efficiently as any radio caller you could wear around her neck so we are unwitting co-conspirators in our own loss of privacy lots of companies have figured out how to make money from all the data we given up about ourselves our habits what we that company has figured out that there some very personal information yet to be mined and monetized hello hey how going Derek me too it so can I get a badge from you sure what do you call this this is called the sociometric badge it ID badge with embedded sensors in it and it allows us to monitor how everybody interacts with each other throughout an organization humanize is a boston-based startup that new level and to a new location the workplace we were collecting all the data that matters around human interaction most companies collect a lot of data about their customers but if I ask a company you know how much does your engineering team talk to your sales team they actually have no idea we have two microphones on the badge one on the top one on the front they don you say but in real time we voice processing right now for example it that I talk my tone of voice how loud I speak the idea that if I little bit more quickly that indicates something about our conversation we also have proximity information if you wearing a bad as you are right now I can tell that I um I can also tell where I am within the office we have a motion sensor on here as well same as in your cell phone but really the idea is to figure out if I have two teams for example that need to talk a lot to each other where does that happen and how can I use that to change the way that people collaborate the badge captures some four gigabytes of data about its wearer each day and when corporations sign up with human eyes they their employees to a stunningly detailed degree all right so these are two different posture sensors and we interesting things right here what were you doing around 3 24 to like 3 30. I was possibly sitting in a chair and reading something from my phone okay so essentially we can we can see that that there time where you there and I think what is not to say like look at these specific behaviors because we don this kind of data to to anyone even our customers but you know having this specific level of granularity across thousands or hundreds of thousands of people you start to think about the sort of things you can actually learn at that scale about what actually goes on in the company this would have been ludicrous 50 years ago the notion that we were constantly being surveilled this was the sort of thing that Orwell could write a book about and we would be shocked about humanize analyzes the cumulative information of their clients entire Workforce so they can see the big picture but the data they collect is so specific so individual and personal it tough to get used to do you think in three to four years you expect all ID badges to be like this oh yeah no I three to four years the majority of ID badges will have these sensors but the question is what you do with the data human eyes insists that the employee data they collect must remain anonymous but it does make you think about the capability of this technology I mean the key is trust do you trust your employer not to spy on you because they certainly can if they want to in the U.S at least employers can read your emails log your keystrokes film you on closed circuit TV or even your webcam for now most employees are just going along with it but some are pushing back I was a district sales manager for intermax it transfers between the states and South America my territory included from Central California all the way to the coast of California and then all the way up to Santa Cruz so it [Music] the company wanted to implement a new program where they had an app downloaded onto the iPhones and this app was supposed to track everywhere we were at to the very smallest detail using her iPhone Myrna wherever she went and kept track of how long she stayed in one place her employers even knew how fast she was driving and she wasn it off they were monitoring all the time so I felt I don I never said no to office hours or work hours but clearly your tracking is not only are you tracking it but you recording it and so why are you keeping this data how much data do you have on me and what are you gonna do with it all those things which is scary so myself and another co-worker decided not to use this app and were immediately terminated Myrna filed a lawsuit against her employer I was surprised by the brazenness that occurred here I employer would try to track its employees and we know from past experience that our employers take a lot of liberties with our privacy rights and they tell us sometimes on our way in the door that you our machines we have a right to look at what you the internet invaded our workplaces it a very different scenario where you have people out in the field and especially when we work as well as for personal use where you their breaks and after their hours that feels creepy to me and I think it felt creepy to Myrna so if our bosses and Google and our government are all trying to track US what are we supposed to do just throw out our smartphones and disconnect from the internet entirely let to happen so the other extreme is we could throw privacy completely out the window I think it don welcome to songdo South Korea it developers call it a city of the future [Music] before 2001 all of this was underwater to build songdo the planners first had to reclaim 1500 Acres from the Yellow Sea if you were expecting flying autonomous cars and moving roadways well you won find them here what you will find is the country bridge and most importantly interconnectivity because songdo was built literally from the ground up to be a smart City because it was built from scratch it was easy to integrate a network of sensors throughout the city and it easy to forget that in songdo you being watched this is the integrated operations center here operators can monitor all the vital functions of the city everything from traffic weather conditions public transit and emergency response to Billboard disposal this room is the city isn actually controlled operators can control the timing of the lights and use signage to reroute the flow of traffic the system has a database for every license plate in the country it knows every car in songdo security cameras throughout the city act like an omnipresent police force watching for and Reporting suspicious activity in real time Brian Bailey is a product manager at Samsung bio Logistics he moved his family to songdo back in 2014. we safest city that we have ever lived in we feel extremely safe with our children letting them go around the city without supervision and not have to worry about their safety there are clear advantages to living in a city of the future the internet is everywhere so anywhere you go you can get very good Wi-Fi signal the pluses have it the Subways have it all the the coffee shops and restaurants and stores have it so being able to access the internet is is very very convenient here but in songdo privacy is pretty much non-existent you can camera here I Center they can put like a little thought on you on the camera and they can follow you back for hours throughout song though for real they can follow you around for hours they can just by with facial recognition talk software figure out where you are and how do you feel about that we just feel inspired everywhere we go you feel spied on yeah just I are eyes everywhere you can anymore when you about the cameras that are filming you yeah foreign because you no different than saying you don about freedom of speech because you got nothing to say that of the nature of Rights and what privacy really is what it privacy isn High privacy is about having something to protect and that thing is Liberty one thing we learned from Edward Snowden is that our government has a rapacious appetite for data including data about American citizens and that which is a sophisticated democracy people around the world have even less protection than that from their governments so what can happen if you forget that the little phone in your pocket is also a tracking device [Music] in 2014 protesters in Kiev found out [Applause] after a clash with police demonstrators in the area received an ominous text message dear subscriber you have been registered as a participant in a mass disturbance so cell phones and surveillance cameras are clearly to be avoided if you don want to be tracked but is there a way to avoid being tracked if you internet turns out there to do just that it browser called Tor assuming someone doesn it of people don the internet I was actually checking out the New York Times earlier so this is all of the stuff that has been loaded it mothads.com somebody called IMR worldwide.com somebody called clicktail.net all of these people are getting a piece of my data all of these people are tracking me there money in tracking regular people browsing and just not really much regulated in the US so how does Tor solve this problem well Torah uses a technology called onion routing where you bounce the traffic around through several different relay computers operated by volunteers all around the world Tori gets its name the onion router because it creates a number of layers between you and prying eyes that conceal your identity that when I click on a link my request travels from my machine to volunteer number one the world he automatically sends the request to volunteer number two who can the request to the site I was trying to reach but that site and its tracking software can only see her they certainly can complexity which actually protects your privacy over here we can go to New York Times and we can see over here that our traffic has been relayed through one relay in Germany one relay in France another relay in France to the right out to the internet so anyway none of those websites are getting your information right instead they last relay site yes so what kind of people are using to work well we and activists in different countries we have victims of domestic abuse who are trying to achieve some amount of personal communication security we people who don by different governments or by advertisers and crazy privacy Advocates like me who really like the idea of not sharing more about ourselves than we have to underscores the the nature of this conflict our society is having right now because you have to remember Tor was funded by the government the Navy underwrote the development of Tor because they realized that spies needed to communicate safely too and that they were at risk but there in the world where they are under repressive governments where they are trying to make social change that may be unpopular I want those people to have the Privacy they need to do the work that they do now by the way the follow-up to this is don terrorists use this and the answer is yeah they do but so do the activists the security of devices whether it your computer whether it whether it is a binary State meaning there are only two possible choices it no option to make a device secure against bad guys but insecure against good guys all of us are secure or none of us are [Music] so here we are at the crossroads of Internet Security and freedom we don mind Google tracking us but we don want our government doing it and we know the internet can be hacked but that doesn it in fact we can dependent on it addicted to it our finances relationships our work basically our whole lives are online but our virtual lives don in the clouds or in cyberspace they live inside brick and mortar buildings like this one in lower Manhattan and once you see the miles and miles of cable and all the infrastructural hardware that our online lives have to travel through the internet seems less magical more physical and possibly more vulnerable when I look at the internet I often like to stop chasing bits and instead plant your feet in a single spot and think about all the communications that are passing that spot it mean 60 Hudson Street New York is one of the most important internet buildings in the world and it so I can send a text message to Helsinki this afternoon and with a little bit of work and the right tools say okay it went through this building this building in this building and across this cable and then of course once you understand the path it took you recognize that that was a real physical path it went through real places on the map there are only 12 internet exchange points in the world as large as this one but there are hundreds of smaller ones distributed across the globe and according to the designers of the internet that distribution makes it safe or at least safer it has billions of pieces to it each one of which is independently operating and so there isn turns this stuff off and that thing it makes it resilient it means that nobody can threaten successfully to turn it all off because they can my handle is much I and the six individuals seated before you make up the hacker group known as The Loft back in the 90s there was a security researcher Mudge who testified to Congress that he could take down the internet in 30 minutes [Music] um the last time I talked to him I think he said it internet the internet heals the internet is no longer a thing right it so if you were able to coordinate an attack against those systems you can impact it you could definitely break it for a bit but you it sure might have something to say about that solar radiation can electronic devices and in 1859 a solar superstorm bombarded the Earth and played Havoc with the 19th Century internet the telegraph Network solar storms occur all the time but this one known as the Carrington event made history Showers of Sparks spewed out of telegraph machines and messages burst into flames we had solar near misses in 2012 13 and 14. so scientists feel that a second Carrington event is really only a matter of time only today our electronic dependence is Thousands maybe millions of times greater and at the center of all that is the internet so what would really happen if it all suddenly went down it past hour night owls have been noticing that Google is down by roughly 6 30 Amazon The New York Times and espn.com are dead Facebook goes down an hour by 8 am the trains in New Delhi have all stopped the air traffic control from Norway to the Mediterranean has been take hundreds of flights at 10 53 a.m every traffic light in Manhattan turns green London reports that the medical records in 160 hospitals have been deleted customers whose last name begins with the letter M suddenly noticed that their bank accounts have been wiped clean across 12 different by 4 pm China has denied involvement as has Pakistan Iran was in the midst of denying it when suddenly the Diplomatic phone lines went dead at 7 22 PM eastern time the lights in North America go out and they electricity no Subways no water on the roads Mass gridlock the lines stretching for miles if the internet were taken out and it happen bizarre always but the ways that it could happen are Financial systems would collapse all Transportation Systems would collapse the power system the Water Systems the natural gas lines the Telecommunications systems I mean how do you think a city like New York City would be after not having power for six months which also means it doesn have police Communications and it doesn have water how would people survive how many of us can make a fire with no matches I can I don right I mean that knows my children know when I was growing up we all knew you know 20 phone numbers of our friends and parents and relatives we Outsourcing our memories into these devices and we now and there backup to the internet right if the if if there was something that if there virus that went in and basically brought the internet to its knees um it might be brought to its knees as well the good news is there survivorlibrary.com it library that covers everything we need to know to survive from embalming to Wagon building it of guns and canned goods it stockpile of knowledge but the bad news it but even when solar winds and fearsome hacks aren the internet is functioning normally our precious information is still surprisingly fragile I mean remember these or this the same fate of obsolescence awaits all formats of storage media we use today we have another huge looming problem we know about in that and that content won 100 years from now because the software that knows what it means isn anymore and so this is another nightmare that needs to be dealt with that put you know the looming potential of a digital Dark Age the reality is obsolescence is always been around us it doesn if it matter it it happens when it comes to things like archival storage you as the custodian of something that you believe should be preserved for future Generations need to be prepared to keep recopying it into the current media of the day that seems to have some longevity that city and is it frustrating and annoying constantly but sometimes the problem technology sometimes it as usual that causes precious information to disappear one thing we discovered is the web is completely ephemeral that only lasts on the average of 100 days before a page is either changed or deleted 100 days sometimes it commercial reasons when companies make a decision to just delete the past work that you their websites alive is not easy so the goal of the internet archive is universal access to all knowledge how do we build a world wide web that is reliable and isn dependent on one piece of Hardware being up or one company Staying Alive the internet archives signature invention is the Wayback machine which takes snapshots of websites at regular intervals so that if content changes or a company goes out of business that material isn right now websites are preserved using a complicated algorithm but the internet archive websites to be represented when we first started collecting the World Wide Web was probably only about 30 million pages now we collect about a billion pages every week our total collection is about 500 billion pages that are in the Wayback machine archive employees in San Francisco and around the world are constantly digitizing print materials videos games and operating systems all kinds of ephemera everyone involved with the internet archive project has at least one thing in common they the servers just in this room are about five petabytes of data and that primary copy of the internet archive and I whole career and the great little thing about these is the lights actually mean something every time a light blinks is somebody uploading something or downloading something from the internet archive those lights signify our hopes for a future that includes all our knowledge and all our frailties all wrapped up in humankind awe-inspiring invention when you think about it our whole civilization rests on this infrastructure from the moment you get up in the morning to the moment you go to sleep at night from the moment you everything in between I think it quarter of a century on from the first commercial website it card conversation have we achieved what we thought we do we need some course Corrections I huge Optimist I think 25 and 50 years from now when we conversations at the 50th and the 75th and the 100th anniversary of the commercial internet we will say that we have built a society hopefully that brings out the best in our value structure right now the internet is a tool a very powerful tool but cool nonetheless and one that we out how to use best and like any tool it depends on who more I think that you know if you look at those exponential growth curves I think we like it it technology is a living breathing thing it and needs just like biology does so it is an organism it is an extension of us some very smart people have warned that any moment now the internet could evolve could become something more than just a tool perhaps an intelligence capable of using its own tools but where would that leave us you know I worry a lot about um just pure Humanity now the way these Technologies are emerging and at the rate at which they you know what our role is with these these systems and machines that are that are surrounding us and it that um we will be the masters of our destiny any longer we be alive today we have about 14 billion connected devices you know my phone your TV my Tesla car all these things are connected devices they them we billion to 100 billion by 2020. we entering towards a world eventually that everything is being imaged and recorded and we anything we want any time we want anywhere we want this is our trillion sensor economy and how you mine that data and what questions you ask of that data is what the way we we live our lives I am not dumb enough to try to make predictions about the internet over the next 10 to 20 years I will assume that the internet will be ubiquitous I will assume that it will be noisy and Rowdy I will assume that it will be a mix of corporate controlled and fiercely independent and it will be complicated and a blessing and a curse at the same time well given how fast technology moves and how quickly we adapt to it I don we find out so don

Saving Venice: Innovative Flood Solutions | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOCUMENTARY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BNjFRKsXow	SLICE Science	[Music] the story of Venice began more than a thousand years ago in the middle of a vast stretch of water in the north of Italy on the Adriatic Coast this is the Lagoon 50 km long and 10 wide it sand and mud in short it was a place that was hostile to human presence and of no interest to [Music] anyone but this all changed in the fifth century when Europe was set Ablaze by hordes of Barbarians people living on the coast sought refuge in the [Applause] lagoon the Lagoon provided natural defenses it was very difficult for enemies to sail their boats and find their way only the people living there knew where the canals were so they had no need for walls to protect them that was a great Advantage the first Paradox is that the venetians who would later conquer the world began their story as refugees in the middle of nowhere with no drinking water to build their first houses they had to use whatever came to [Music] hand we have a few pictures that help us to form an idea of what the Rialto Island might have been like Rialto was the center of town with thatched wooden Huts the first buildings on the ancient site of Venice were in the most stable areas of ground for example Rialto comes from rivo alto which was a high solid Bank dorsoduro the name comes from the fact that it was a more solid piece of land the early town was built on places like that but that is still a long way from leima that we know today it wasn hundred years later that the little wooden Huts were replaced by the impressive Rialto Bridge and the Palaces that surround it the first venetians lived on small Islands separated by water each one was a little village designed on the same lines a square dwellings all around it and in the middle the [Music] church that explains why we have so many churches and small squares they were the centers of the ancient micro Villages and through the centuries these islands were linked by improvised Bridges often built on the slant but during the the 7th Century the venetians started to be short of space the solution was to build new artificial areas of land on the water but building on the bed of the Lagoon was anything but easy the bottom is composed of sediment and mud and a lot of currents flow through it in short ground that was moving all the time here even from a geological Viewpoint we are between sea and land the factors are discontinuous on the one hand the rivers bring us sand from dry land that forms a certain type of ground where there are reeds the ground is made of Pete which is quite a different density Venice itself was born on this multitude of geological strata on very varied type and solidity and that caused problems today when we see a church Tower leaning over we know it it strata so the tower tips sideways [Music] the church towers of Venice lean but they don [Music] collapse so what tour the force did the venetians dream up how did they manage to make the ground firmer the Builder wooden piles hundreds of thousands of them were driven into the bed of the Lagoon and and miraculously the builders discovered beneath the sand a layer of karanto or clay it lay at a depth of 3 to 8 M below sea level the piles had to go down far enough to be driven into the clay to stabilize the ground stabilizing the ground meant marking out the limits of a certain Zone with piles if I take some piles and I drive them into the mud and then SE it all with water the ground between the piles will Compact and stay more solid than the ground that it stop it being washed out that theory of ground stabilization that created artificial areas on which the town could grow with sand from the Lagoon held in by wooden piles and the builders made another stunning Discovery wood driven into the mud doesn deteriorate the poles that are underneath the buildings in the mud is that there they free environment so none of the microbes that would normally Decay wood can get into them the wood under go a process of of mineralization it becomes as hard as Stone and can remain intact for centuries the most famous Venetian monuments were born on land Consolidated in This Way St Mark square with its bell tower that alone rests on 100,000 [Music] piles the foundations of the Rialto Bridge 12,000 piles and even more impressive the imposing Basilica Las salute built entirely of marble even more than a million piles mindboggling [Music] figures today there are 8 to 10 wooden piles per square meter the town was created on these piles you might even say it fulfill the function of roots and there are an incredible number of them it million piles were driven into the Sands of the Lagoon the equivalent of 1/3 of the LA Forest they are reputed to be very strong and were brought from nearby [Music] coasts to stabilize their ground and to Bear the weight of the Palaces the venetians spared no expense a study shows that the foundations account for half the cost of the building the other half goes to the superstructure of the Palaces this means that the submerged part costs as much as the part above the water the town these unique foundations built from the 11th century onwards they are the true superstructures of their time to make these palaces last in an unstable and moving environment the builders called upon all their genius because they faced a triple challenge to protect the buildings from the saltwater tides to build the lightest possible structures on Sandy ground and to take into account the movements of the Lagoon bed this is the brilliant idea they came up with on the piles the Venetian Architects placed a first stratum of wooden flatbeds then there were several layers of bricks on top of which the builders had the idea of laying a special White Stone imported from the dalan coast istrian Stone this was the first line of defense against the movement of the tides that deals with the interface between the water and the air that resists an infinitely long time because it permeable to this salty water resistant and impermeable istrian Stone served as a protective wall it easily stands up against the comings and goings of the saltwater the height of the stone layer was calculated in function of the height of the tides and therefore it prevented the water from reaching the load bearing walls that were made of bricks and were much [Music] lighter the rule of the time was do not build above three floors [Music] they understood when they were building that they couldn because they knew that it was all relatively fresh mud in geological terms that still compacts and causes subsidence slender columns and large Windows through their concern for weight The Architects created a unique style that was elegant and like lace work the typical Venetian Style all they had to do now was find the way for the building to adapt to the moving ground of the Lagoon the movements of the ground and of the water are variable so the buildings couldn rigid here too the venetians found shude Solutions using the materials that they had locally in particular lime mortar it was used for building brick walls balls its advantage over cement was that while it was used like cement it remained Supple lime was probably the most important material because it adaptable it can adapt the aim was always to build create what they had in mind but something that could move over time second example the floors between the [Music] levels they were made of wood a material that is flexible and that can transform and to ensure the flexibility of the walls and Floors the builders came up with another trick the beams were rested on the walls but in such a way that they could move flexible Supple and adaptable the Venetian building is like a living organism that changes shape according to the whims of the unstable [Music] foundations today the Palaces bear the Stigmata of time some balconies are [Music] distorted sometimes fiss appear inside the buildings [Music] there has been a bit of subsidence some facades have twisted and leaned a little but no Palace in Venice has ever [Music] collapsed Venetian Engineers designed their buildings so well that they can even absorb the impact of earthquakes which are common in the region I remember my father-in-law telling me about when there was the earthquake in frii in the 1970 something and Venice felt the shocks of that very strongly and um where we live there big arched Windows you know with lead holding the panes of glass and he said that the windows just moved like the sails of a boat and then came back in place not one of those little panes cracked and fell out every Palace has a well in its Courtyard the ingenious Phoenician architects solved the freshwater problem with the invention of a sophisticated system for collecting rainwater the water runs through these small holes into a tank where it filtered through very fine sand the Clean Water finally runs into a sstn from where it can be drawn off the idea was also to recuperate rain water from the gutters on the roofs to fill the wells in squares it was really a very ingenious system that you don find anywhere else in the world and those Wells were still functioning in Venice up to the beginning of the 20th century the wells feature in all the squares in the town The Architects dug 900 in all at the end of the 15th century 70,000 people were living in Venice more than there ever have been since lerin isima was then at her Peak thanks to her powerful Fleet built in the town Arsenal Venice dominated the Mediterranean from Tunis to Beirut the city of the doas was the only colonial power of the Middle Ages Venice was like a fish in water [Music] we have documents from chroniclers and ancient historians who say that water must be protected because it precious community property this is the reason that there were Lagoon Specialists and Canal Specialists that was the challenge to the Venetian magistrates to preserve the Lagoon and the water surrounding their town but towards the end of the 15th century the authorities made a frightening Discovery their beautiful fish was about to be suffocated by the sand how could this have happened what massive Works would have to be undertaken to combat the selting up how would the venetians of the 15th century save Venice the danger came from the rivers that flowed into the goon it was beginning to get silted up with the sediment that the rivers always carried along the canals were getting too shallow for the bigger ships that you know were important for Venice as a trading empire and also for its military expansion it needed to be able to have the ships come and go with the you know with their soldiers and Mariners Etc but this should be very dangerous for the city survival itself because then this could be a possibility for the enemy of Venice to attack the city from from England how would the venetians cope with this whim of nature in the course of long debates in the Palace of the doers two visions of the town were in opposition the people believed that the life of the city should evolve along the the lines of how the Lagoon was changing so if the Lagoon was silting up then Venice should think of a future for itself and transition to agriculture for example because you know um they discovered rice I think they already knew about corn and then there were other people in the city that said no we to maintain Venice as a maritime Republic and therefore we need to do things to stop the Lagoon from silting up in the end it was those in favor of water who carried the day the idea of the Grand Canal turned into a field of corn was Unthinkable the water had to be saved at all costs and to do that they had a wild idea to reroute the Cel and brenta rivers so that they would empty their sediment outside the Lagoon they were about to achieve an amazing feat to dig 300 km of new canals with 15th century tools gigantic Works which would take 100 years from that time the the the Lagoon is no more let anymore because the present shape of the Lagoon is the result of a big effort that men that live in that area put to keep the Lagoon in the in the same uh shape as it is thanks to these Major Works the venetians managed to preserve the maritime identity of their town but the water that the venetians wanted so much to save ended up by turning against them dramatically because other even more serious problems were lying in wait for the city of the doas the subsidence of the bed of the Lagoon on the one hand and the rise in the water level on the other made a dangerous combination how are the venetians going to deal with this new threat what unheard of technical exploits would they have to [Applause] accomplish today lisima still stands proud of the water but the Lagoon has changed cars trains and even airplanes were further added to the maritime traffic which increased tfold and there would soon be factories a Refinery a power station and a shipyard with the 20th Century Venice joined the modern world and it was the Lagoon that paid the [Music] price we seeing the drainage of vast areas of the Lagoon in order to build industrial zones the port of Margera is an example of man drying out means the cancellation even the annihilation of the Aquatic environment built from 1917 onwards the industrial area and the roads to the airport have taken up on10th of the service area of the Lagoon but that isn all to facilitate the movements of the great oil tankers the entry to the maloko inlet was widened up to 900 meters and a new Canal was dug right in the middle of the [Music] Lagoon instead of the ships following the natural path of the channel which was quite convoluted they dug this straight Highway across the Lagoon very wide and very deep it much too much water towards Venice and threatens the city of the doas the water no longer spreads out in the same way the natural canals are disturbed by the tanker the currents it the ancient natural environment has been destroyed in just 30 years and that isn needs of Industry 8,000 Wells were dug to pump water from the water table which is just under the foundations of Venice in the 1950s up to 40,000 cubic M of water were drawn every day this uh generate a decrease of the pressure by pumping we reduce the pressure in the layers of sand and when the pressure goes down in such a special and fragile soil as there is in Venice the geological strata are compacted with the result that the ground subsides that we right now we call it subsidence land subsidence the result was that Venice sank 15 cm in only 30 years the Lagoon mistreated in this way would eventually avenge itself on the venetians and the town itself paid the price on November 4th 1966 a particularly powerful high tide caused the water to rise almost 2 m above sea level it was the worst flood that the venetians had ever [Music] known the Water started to rise and when it should have started to go down after about 2 hours it didn Rising Communications were cut off we had no r telephone or electricity we were really frightened that day 80% of the town was flooded St Mark Square was under 120 cm of water for 30 hours the tanks of fuel oil and Diesel overflowed and polluted the town but in all this Misfortune there was one piece of luck not one person was killed but nearly 5,000 people found themselves homeless that day day the venetians and the whole world understood that day that if you attack a natural system the system will fight back among the first measures taken was that they stopped pumping from the water table but the damage had been done the 13 cm lost would never be recuperated and a further threat was imminent global warming and the rise in sea level this caused the water in the canals to rise 10 cm in all Venice lost 23 cm the figure can be seen on The facades [Music] Today the area that was most vulnerable is the one that is green today it indicates the rising and falling of the tides it damage to the town it Tides the water comes and goes comes and goes continuously inaa inaa nowadays with every tide salt water reaches the brick walls an upheaval that challenges the precautions taken by The Architects of the past the istrian stone that formed the impermeable foundations of the Palaces is no longer of any use as a prote Ive ring the water brick work and the bricks are very permeable and the water evaporates from the bricks leaving behind the salts which crystallize and as salts crystallize they expand in volume 12 times and that like is a very kind of slow way of you can say exploding brick work The Saltwater also attacks the lime mortar as a result the bricks fall out and the structure as a whole is weakened to reinforce them these iron barriers are springing up in the town [Music] canals the owners have to pay the costs of restoration but the Town Council can Venetian palaces are damaged and need renovating [Music] but the daily tides are not solely responsible for the damage motorboats are the real problem their movements create extra waves not only on the surface but also deep down the coming and going of boats is very bad for the walls with its propellers a boat creates extra movement in the water which erodes the walls and once the wall is eroded the waves even attack the ground as you can see boats go past every minute it frequency to put a wall at risk the water seeps into the cracks jeopardizing the whole structure of the building it even gets to the compacted Earth between the piles foundations that were designed over a thousand years ago today they are in danger too to limit the damage Venice has imposed a speed limit of 5 km an hour on all the vaporetti using the canals what Lagoon every day and unload their hordes of tourists these big ships move huge volumes of water you know that Archimedes principle there volume equivalent to the volume of the ships that gets moved and when they in the um Juda canal in all the lateral narrow little canals the water level rises and then goes down again with the passage of each ship it tidal Excursion but not a tide that comes and goes over 6 hours like the regular tidde but something a wash of water that moves within you know over tens of seconds or or minutes and that to the building foundations between the subsidence of the ground the rise in water level the the waves from the motorboats Venice is threatened from all [Music] sides to save the Treasures of the city of the doers there solution drain the canals so as to undertake Major Works they sections of the canals about 50 m long no more it canals causes subsidence of the geological strata and this can lead to damage to the nearby palaces you can never keep a canal dry for more than 3 months today the town is treated with modern methods chemicals are injected in the place of lime mortar to consolidate and rebuild the walls they prevent the water from seeping into the bricks and it all has to be done by hand so even restoring the parapet of this small 18th century Bridge takes on unexpected [Music] proportions how are you going to do it I think we create an exact replica that we can give to a specialist everything must be copied perfectly right down to the finest detail like this one Venice is like that it so to make an exact replica they to call on a specialist who will do the job by hand using traditional methods there are no machines to do it there are no machines specially designed for Venice that are more expensive than anywhere else today the town has barely €2 million EUR a year to maintain its buildings whereas 13 million are needed the water that gave venetians their glory and their wealth has finally turned against them today onethird of the ground floors in the town have become uninhabitable and the floods the aqua alte are more and more frequent the last 50 years I would say the the city has experienced really a big increase of the frequency of this high tide and so if in the past the the frequency is really one every 10 year let the the frequency increased a lot up to four or five times per per here these figures could well turn out to be higher with global warming which is causing the inexorable rise in sea levels venice submerged that prediction it studying Maritime and climatic questions the prediction that has been done up to the end of this Century they say that the the sea level should be rised by let cm the idea of the city being swallowed up no longer seems a mere fantasy so a Venetian genius will yet again prove itself with a colossal project to save Venice from ending up at the bottom of the sea like the mythical city of Atlantis [Music] the response of the Italian authorities to prevent Venice being swallowed up is the Mo project it blocking the huge masses of water that come from the sea into the Lagoon by the three access channels the Leo Inlet the maloko inlet and the kyja inlet the Italian Engineers have dreamed of a system of retractable barriers in the event of exceptionally High Tides they will be raised to stop the water flowing in in short a gigantic [Music] plug this kind of barrier is unique in the world because it answers to question very unique because Venice is extraordinary so benice is unique and has a unique solution the basis of the system consists of gigantic 25,000 ton Chambers as big as sstory buildings using custombuilt systems they have been sunk to the beds of the inlets these concrete Giants form the basis of the mobile door the mo project was launched in 2003 and is now in the Final Phase of completion at the maloco site about 20 gates are still waiting to be [Music] installed Alberto is the technical team leader these are the next gates to be sunk to the bottom steel Giants that weigh more than 330 tons they are of Titanic proportions 28 M long 20 M wide and 4 M thick on average but each of these Gates is calibrated and adapted to the seabed the maloko gates are larger because the seabed is lower at 14 m at KY it down however the maloko gates are 50 cm thinner than those at KY because the KY Gates have to resist a much greater pressure of water when Alberto gets into one of these gigantic Gates it going into the hold of a ship and yet this vast space will be filled with water [Music] when the gates are not in use this entire space is filled with water these four red tubes carry air from the compressors from the technical unit right at the bottom of the gate that that raises it the air pressure pumped by these tubes pushes the water which then escapes through special openings so the door Rises and holds back the [Music] tide if we get a 1 M 20 tide the barrier will be filled with 1/3 air if we need to hold back a 1 M 60 tide or even 3 m as has been envisaged the gate may be filled with air up to at least 2/3 Alberto and the engineer consists of putting the gates on the tanks closely monitored by cameras and a GPS system the steel giant descends to a depth of over 10 m as it gradually fills with water the hinge has to be fitted absolutely perfectly so that it can be permanently fixed this takes 6 hours of concentration and tension every time it is a real feat Alberto mistake in total 78 Gates will end up on the seabed this system have been dimensioned considering an high tide over 3 m it means 1 M more than the the exceptional event occurred in 1966 and it has been dimensioned considering also um the worst scenario of sea level rise it means 60 cm once the works are completed the gates will be monitored 24 hours a day by 50 technicians they will be working in service galleries below water level inside the [Music] tanks MO is a magic solution for some and a burden for others the project polarizes the Italians because the works have dragged on for almost 15 years the final implementation date has been put back time and time again and The Works have swallowed up the vast sum of 5.5 billion and this cost could still rise we don 10 million 100 million 1 billion I mean we don finish it and get it working but that they don going to need to spend on on keeping it working is very alarming the most project must be accompanied by something else in my opinion it protect the town against King Tides if you don as of today the survival of Venice rests on the mo system and the hope that it will prove to be effective but the retractable barriers won problems they won subsidence of the ground nor the maritime traffic and they won deterioration of the buildings venice future is looking [Music] me there are even people who are suggesting that we separate Venice from the Lagoon in my view it pretty radical to separate the Lagoon from the sea but let Venice into a museum let glass bubble get rid of all the venetians and the problem will be solved but fortunately the Venetian people when it comes to their town the latest idea is to reflate the subsoil to raise the level of the town it dreamed up by researchers at the prestigious University of Padua we put 10 Wells or 12 Wells on a on a circular shape with with a diameter of 10 kilomet and we inject water into a quite deep aquifer we select an aquifer system that it is located between 600 and 1,000 M below the the Lagoon bottom incredible using injections of water to raise a third of the Lagoon a groundbreaking idea never before attempted these 12 Wells would pump 50 L of salt water per second to swell the Sandy subsoil of the Lagoon the researchers are envisaging a progressive elevation of 20 to 25 cm in 10 years that is 2 cm a year resulting in a lowering of the levels in the canals unfortunately this method is not without risk you you cannot do it in a shorter time we don generate any any fracture and for this reason we have to to to inject at a safe rate swelling the subsoil is perhaps the way for Venice to regain the 23 cm lost on the seabed for the moment this futuristic project is still in a drawer waiting for finance for the first fullscale tests in the future will Venice have to be surrounded by high-tech meast structures in order to keep its head above water is that the price to pay so that the generation of centuries to come will be able to admire it when will we see the next spectacular project that will bring the Miracle Solution One thing is certain no one wants to see this extraordinary Town disappearing under the waves lisima will always be able to count on the enthusiasts who will take up the challenge to save her [Music]	Success
Exploring the Gibson Desert: Bush Blitz Expedition | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ6vG4kaiXk	SLICE Science	we most extreme and remote areas in the world the temperatures are going to be pretty high it there water is absolutely critical to your survival in this environment there will find out there in this environment so you must take additional water with you each day you with a survival kit your only mod of communication will be a satellite phone and you will also have an emergency Beacon for the teams that are in the field please take out UHF radios this will be a way for you to communicate with each other when you also with the helicopter pilot the bush Blitz Expedition is taking place in the heart of the Gibson desert south of the great sandy desert north of the great Victoria desert base camp is set up at kiura a small town of 170 residents it has been described as the most isolated Aboriginal community of Australia we closest neighbors are 100 to 150 km away the closest town is Ali Springs and that away it is said said that the last nomadic aboriginals settled [Music] here they were also one of the last to have encountered European [Music] settlers the Australian government has been working with Aboriginal groups to ident ify traditional lands on September 10th 2014 the kiura territory was declared an indigenous protected area it is now governed and protected by the Aboriginal Community it recognizing Aboriginal people ownership of their own land and their independence in taking on a project to manage their land it with the government where the government provides resources and funds and um both sides are winning because Aboriginal people environmental needs to look after country are being met as well as the government country interest in the holistic approach of Aboriginal life is gaining momentum in our modern world a vision that takes into account all aspects of humankind physical mental spiritual emotional family life and culture their ancestral and mystical Traditions pass down orally from generation to generation intriguers as if we have lost something essential their unique Arts have been inspired by nature and today are recognized worldwide nature is also their Ally in the creation of tools and instruments such as the digus the trunks are tunneled out by a miniature Army of termites the inimitable sounds created by these instruments are a symbol of the people a call for respect [Music] today with over 60 protected indigenous areas throughout Australia their ancestral knowledge and understanding is beginning to find recognition [Music] the zone at kiura covers 4,867 Square kilm an area larger than Switzerland We Are Scientists to make us a map to show us the biggest black hole for information in the country and this was it this was the red hot center of the unknown this is will be the biggest black hole that we have on those maps that we same time the Aboriginal people said we want to make a indigenous protected area we want to protect this land we want to manage it well and it just came together like this perfect marriage between what the Aboriginal people wanted and what the scientists wanted which was to know more the bush Blitz Expedition is an alliance between the indigenous community and scientists they will explore map and identify plants larvae spiders insects reptiles and birds with the goal to find out how this land has adapted to such extreme conditions 3/4 of the species in Australia aren known so when I tell people that they they that we don the truth of the matter is we don most of the species on this planet the bush is made up of red sand dunes and despite the scorching desert heat they are covered with a surprising amount of green [Music] plants compared to a lot of the deserts of the world this one looks really very green the FAA and Flora are for the most part endemic and have learned to survive over thousands of years in this particularly arid landscape in summer temperatures vary from 32 to 52° C our deserts are defined as being areas of less than 250 mm of rainfall per year uh this desert would probably get around 220 230 but it [Music] guaranteed the blitz means a Swift and intensive team effort in this type of landscape an expedition of this scale requires substantial resources we hectares of land in one of the most Road places on the planet and the only way to do this there are no roads so the only only way we can get around is by helicopter while two helicopters explore the edges of the reserve down on the ground not far from base camp the first four-wheel drive Expedition leaves for the field [Music] noria Sally and roma are directing one of the operations they know the bush better than anybody although they usually get around on foot the team have traveled less than 2 km from base camp and already have to call for assistance this uh vehicle is bogged on top of the June here so we to try and pull it out what talk that good job coming back the Aboriginal women find the situation entertaining there should be one more there he [Music] it we got it out we [Music] marus Dr Alan Yen is a Renown entomophagy specialist the art of eating insects and other small animals he is with a group in search of a Lara highly appreciated by the indigenous people it okay so which tree okay okay you show me where to go where you going so what what you look for but so you look for the root here yes okay that RO so this is the marker inside here like this just a minute now you can see the root coming and then you SW so the swollen bit is where the marku the grub this is a grub shoot a this is a grub we look for trees like this and then we dig under them and now you see the grubs mhm this one I dug up a while ago we grab it and pull it out like this nice one this tree is the SEL W this is a what the locals here called a Maru and Maru is a western desert term for edible grub and it grub and they live in the root of these different um plants this is an acacia and so it root and you can see the grub inside and if we can knock this on a piece of wood try and get the grub out can see it emerging now and carefully pull it out so that the grub and these turn into the term they use here is Pinter Pinter Pinter Pinter yeah which is yeah they call it a butterfly but it actually a moth but it so it after summer rains these come out and they fly off what did they carry the grubs with in a wooden dish they used to carry the dishes like this they used to put water in the dishes too and take them my mother and grandmother used to do it like this when I was little I used to see them do this I used to think oh okay this is how the older generation used to live my mother and grandmother my family these wi grabs are very important food for the abies here especially in the desert area because they available the whole year round so so it when it gets a bit dry and so on and they have trouble finding kangaroos or lizards and so on they can r on these we think they might live like this might live for a little bit longer here 2 years possibly before they from egg through to the moth could be 2 years could be more we don [Music] know yes can I take a photo of that so here okay this is very important like this they poke it poke it in the head and they put it like this and carry it like this sometime they put it in you you they carry like this before long time yes they used to carry it like this we brother r on them to First help us find the grubs and and then secondly give us any information about the grubs for example when they occur how they find them look for the signs when they they dig them up and also where they got preference for different grubs [Music] back at Bas Camp the researchers study some of the specimens collected throughout the day yeah good meal yeah H Josephine of the last Aboriginal Nomads she recalls the true science of the Bush that her parents passed down to her she in a helicopter [Music] [Music] Josephine will join the reptile team in the field who are already on the lookout right [Music] [Music] it Dragon they only really live for about 12 months they ant Specialists and for these particular ones having a resource like ants is one that by many other species so it that allows them to exist right across the Arid Zone I followed the tracks and I found this one I locked all around for the tracks and then I saw him L Tong see just walking and you got yes I took him dinner dinner I then take him and cook him over there and cook him in the fire I tongue it before becoming Josephine Rebecca wants to document the find with modern techniques now vent length is 245 so if you can hold that for me ready so we take a little bit of the tail tissue sample y [Music] if reptiles can survive in this dry Zone it is partly because the desert is exceptionally [Music] green people have a perception of deserts like all deserts as being rolling sand Junes devoid of vegetation but in Australia we have the oldest deserts in the world they at about a million years old so the vegetation we have here is incredibly well adapted to the desert environment in an area like this you wonder why all the vegetation just doesn completely each of them has different adaptations some will store water some have very very good root systems and a June such as this if you bury a hand down into the sand is degrees cooler um only centimet below the surface of the soil [Music] this is a desert covered with plants and animals and it dunes the dunes here are actually harboring life the dunes are holding moisture they plants have insects insects are being fed On By the birds and by the lizards it [Music] web the plants in the desert here are pollinated by insects without the insects the plants can reproduce a lot of insects here live on specific plant species so those plants are like an island it know in this desert and so you have a whole community living on one plant and then when they reproduce the Next Generation might fly up get caught in this wind head down a bit and who knows how far several kilometers and happen to land on the right house plant and then they can uh start the cycle [Applause] again in the meantime Barbara an arachnologist or spider specialist is exploring the edges of Lake McKay better known as wilin Cara by the locals it is over 75 kilomet from base camp at [Music] kiura during her career Barbara has described over 600 new species yesterday she visited the lake with some locals to set up some spider traps yesterday we went out with the aboriginals and they they were a bit scared and they said that that the souls of the deceased ones are going there so and it feels a bit like that it Heaven and Earth so therefore they don go that much on on the lake it up see the sword she knows that no animal can survive on this gigantic salt [Music] crust it Barbara hopes to find life and new species of spiders at the moment there are about 3 and a half thousand described and we expect about 8 and a half thousand at least so that spider this is a spider that has never been discovered to now and lives here in the desert it survive there when it hot it is surprising because it desert and normally if you are in a desert you think that um that there is [Music] nothing underground spiders are not the only ones to take shelter from the scorching desert heat honey ants often Illustrated in local paintings are a living reserve of protein and [Music] sugars the Aboriginal peoples appreciate them for their Exquisite honey taste oh look there are honey ends coming out of this hole there there we here sometimes they will dig up to 1.2 M below the crust in search of the sweet caviar the elders still offer them to their families as a tradition conscious that their ancestral knowhow is being lost they do their best to pass on the knowledge to the younger generation as for the sugar the women pull the best of the ants from the Sandy Desert Cellar easy to prepare simply pinch the ant with your fingers and burst the honey abdomen with your [Laughter] teeth today the bush Blitz Expedition provides a perfect opportunity for the Western study of traditional Bush Foods [Music] the desert hides several sources of Provisions for those who know how to find them we look around the sandill wle trees and think all this tree has grubs then we dig and might find many grubs in the roots of the tree we might just start digging and see the grubs after digging occasionally the whole tree might be pushed over and we can lift it up and gather the grubs and move on to another Bush and dig more we might find that there are not so many grubs then we just head for home sometimes we may decide to cook the grubs in the fire and then take them home if it becomes too late in the afternoon we may just decide to go home [Music] [Music] the wit grubs are very important food here and especially for children because in the olden times the except for mother dairy products so children actually need to get other source of things like calcium and we think things that wira provided there along with good source of protein and unsaturated fats the dominant vegetation out here is what we call spin effect grasslands and uh this is a spin effect uh generally short clumped often very sharp nasty grass uh and they are generally spiky so they don the Aboriginal people harvest the grains of spin effects a grass seed to make Bush bread spinifex grasslands occupy the driest hottest most extreme environments in Australia spin effects can grow up to 2 m High 5 m in diameter and their Roots can plunge 30 MERS underground enabling the plants to access very deep water which is uh very advantageous for the desert uh conditions out [Music] here when deemed necessary and to stop spin effects from dominating the landscape the local Aboriginal people turn to their Eternal Ally fire government authorities often fought against this method believed to be dangerous but today their position has evolved they Now understand that Patchwork burning is the result of an intimate knowledge of the land [Music] [Music] [Music] we make fires to encourage the growth of food plants like bush tomatoes we also make f to encourage the growth of green grass so that the kangaroos can eat the country becomes new from the blackened Earth the Aboriginal people are excellent Harvesters and Hunters lizards are a popular choice for lunch Patchwork burning is also a hunting technique the animals run from the flames and become an easy catch [Music] it is also the best way to reduce the fuel load that ignites when lightning strikes creating devastating bush fires intense spontaneous fires tend to kill the plants whereas Patchwork burning will spare the plant functions Dr Robert Boyd is an ecologist who specializes in bushfires guessing where we burn somewhere around he suspects that spin produces a chemical substance in order to dominate the landscape one that poisons or suffocates other plants in the vicinity they are able to suppress uh other plants from growing just below the soil surface there can be up to 20 25 30 even different species of plant uh existing as seeds just waiting for the right conditions uh to to happen when you get a fire come through in these spinifex grasslands the uh the spinifex grasses are killed and all of a sudden there removed there the ash into the soil uh competition for water is reduced and when the uh rains come along these other plants are able to uh germinate and grow and so uh all of a sudden the desert becomes a a [Music] garden high intensity fires cause a lot more soil Heating and uh seeds of um all these plant species that are existing in the soil uh under these high temperature conditions a high proportion of them are killed off and there around for Aboriginal people to to eat so fire and humans really go hand in hand in uh spin effect Landscapes I think this seed has been cooked by the fire I think it the fire was too hot or this was too too close to the surface [Music] when the Sun goes down the work doesn stop scientists are also trying to understand the secret life of plants that hide millions of years of adaptation deep in their seeds [Music] a new Morning Has Broken in the heart of the Gibson desert and the Adventure Continues working with the aboriginals is is it really uh it because they land that we look at and we think it we think it they years they know how to survive here they know how to find food where there where we think there see water they find water they they resourceful um they you know they they to live here and uh and you kind of feel like a child when you when you come to a place like this and you see how Adept they are and how little we know [Music] [Music] what Tipper yeah TI Tipper there or five varieties of of uh these graas honey gilas people call them sometimes s and and inside inside these flowers will be the Honeydew sweet honeydew and that people is to soak and make a drink especially for kids so it was yes it was like a ancient day soft drink you in the middle you want know yeah just suck on it people might have been um materialistically um poor or or or um had had minimal sort of wealth in that sense but as far as ecological knowledge they rich and wealthy the most knowledgeable um people about this sort of desert ecology are the Aboriginal people [Music] the Aboriginal perspective on life on say something like Land Management is that it do and it out and do between 9 and 5 today looking after country is a holistic part of their life it bound up in their responsibilities to Country to each other to the Joba or dream time the their religion all all mixed in together rather than separate buckets like we might do [Music] [Music] [Music] writing was not originally part of Australian Aboriginal culture their educational tradition was to gain knowledge through true Life Field [Music] [Music] experiences our Western approach is more theoretical we read up on a theme we classify ify analyze illustrate and record the team high demand by the scientists scien each of them wants to immortalize their Treasures in front of his powerful macro lens patience is his secret look at that rearing up that on the other side of the Reserve at the extreme Northeast of the kiura indigenous protected area a whole sector is considered unknown territory the entomologist Nick Tarik has made a totally unexpected exceptional Discovery now this is beautiful this is completely different vegetation that we this is uh all these plants are dependent on um fresh water it looks like and they in the middle of the desert when we were looking on the map we did not see this I had no idea there the desert wait wait wait did you see that oh it oh got bur Nest which means that things are nesting here next to the water and uh I don much recently so the last big rain I think was 3 or 4 years ago the last thing I expected was to be standing in water in the middle of the desert isn brilliant brilant and sure beats with swatting flies and spitting dust so the botanists are going to have some uh algae to [Music] press we picked all our sites from satellite M maps and geom maps and vegetation maps and we looked we tried to pick areas that we thought would Harbor diversity lucky we were using helicopters to do our surveys and we spotted the real Oasis in the middle of the desert and we had no clue it was there it was teaming with life it just shows how massive this desert is and how little we know it life persists even in in places that you think are unlivable brings you hope you know you just have to wait for the [Music] rain 2 weeks of research 65 hours of helicopter flight and over 100 explored sites has enabled the team to identify 375 newly recorded species within the indigenous protected area among them 52 are potential new species to science insects spiders 13 plants and even a snail if humans were more humble they would invest more to better understand the invisible bonds that unite us with other forms of life on [Music] Earth links that enable life that give us life it is no longer a secret everything is interconnected [Music]	Success
Exploring Papua's Lost World: The Lengguru Expedition | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URsfoAFgNzE	SLICE Science	[Music] a Franco Indonesian scientific Expedition has explored a region of Papua New guini which is still largely unknown the researchers ventured into one of the planet biodiversity the laroo mountains for the scientists the territory is like an open a laboratory it was formed 11 million years ago when the Australian and Pacific tectonic plates collided the Limestone relief that arose from this raised uncrossable barriers and created worlds lost in deep valleys as well as an enormous Labyrinth of underground galleries the animals and plants that lived there were trapped to survive they had no choice but to adapt very quickly to the new conditions getting to the laroo mountains isn easy it can only be done by Waterway thanks to a dow this makeshift boat has to go up rivers that are swelled by powerful tides for the 50 Indonesian and European researchers taking part in the Expedition The Voyage is an adventure in itself 3.2 repeat 3.2 Jean Pierre B and Bernard PUO both hydrologists at the research institute for development guide the Indonesian boat thanks to a sound the aim is to help the Dow to Brave the currents sometimes in Epic conditions left left left left there all way tell them damn it carry on all the way all the way all way yes he has to go left carry on carry on it there he left the hardest bit he needs to go completely to the left we kept on telling him yes but he was too much in the middle too much in the middle [Music] [Music] the boat finally Ms at one of the rare Villages at the foot of the mountains this is where the scientists set up their base camp soon the teams will leave for their research areas and return to the Village between missions to securely store the field data [Music] that looking for the toilets and it went between US just arrived Evie arida herpetologist at the Indonesian Science Institute has found a rare specimen this one is one of the largest uh SKS it they are different and Genetically speaking uh there study finding an animal as astonishing as this when the Expedition has only just landed is a pretty good sign the following weeks seem promising before going out into the field the teams check the equipment they need to make their research La pu in Char of the Expedition takes an essential precaution he demonstrates the Drone using a machine that none of the villagers have ever seen has to have the agreement of the community okay [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] SC [Music] in this isolated area the expedition success depends largely on how much trust there is between the scientists and the villagers every Foreigner has to respect customs and ask for the agreement of the men of the village to go into the laroo mountains for for the village agrees to open the way to the Laro Mountains for these people it is the center of the world and the Cradle of all life for the scientists it is an Eden of biodiversity unequaled on our planet an exceptional place for the advance of [Music] knowledge starting the next day the teams will spread out with their guides on their Adventure [Music] [Music] near the village in the coastal Forest EV arida reptile and lizard specialist at the Indonesian Science Institute is searching her area nothing is known about the lizards and monitor lizards which live here sparked by by her first find at Bas Camp Evie hopes to capture other interesting specimens there are many wives in my in my head why are they endemic to this island why are they different in in morphology how do they diversify and how do they come here [Music] H okay what a beautiful specimen and this lizards is uh kind of special in that well normally lizards will have five fingers on the front and the four limbs five fingers on the H limbs this one he has only four fingers on the front limbs five fingers on the high Lim this is specialty of a of a group of skinks there diversity um The evolutionary history is also [Music] complex an example of each group of lizards and skinks found in the field is sent to Jakarta to the Indonesian Science Institute Amir hamidi is in charge of comparing the astonishing adaptation processes used by the animals under the pressure of their environment this is all specimen of skin that we collected from luru from the arboreal species terrestrial species and FAL species one spes the arboreal spes they have five fingers here this is the perfect way to climb the trees the second one is the species living on the ground they have reduction number of the finger for finger and then the third one is the spacies which is the leg is getting smaller and then the number of fingers also smaller is for finger here in the next future we lost their legs to perfectly adapted living under the ground the scientists suspect that to escape their predators the skinks take refuge more and more underground like snakes their pores are less and less useful in this environment This Is What might explain the slow mutation of their morphology and the progressive loss of their [Music] limbs the first observations are encouraging they show that the lingaro mountains have developed some of the most spectacular stories in the theory of evolution another team leaves on its Mission it is going to explore the high isolated Lakes B PUO and Jean Pier Bri the two hydrologists are also the most senior members of the Expedition for 20 years they have explored the most isolated parts of the planet together they puu biologist and geneticization [Music] s the conditions in which the Explorers have to advance are difficult the temperature is around 35° and it humid reach the first leg today they caught two little wild pigs by running them down they guys those guys impress me hey can you imagine them running on those stones and then they catch two that H why it pretty sad really shoot a bird like that this is something which should be protected before protecting it the forest must be protected there type of bird this is its habitat if the forest is cut down and secondary Forest grows they we don don last collected 90 or 100 years ago This Magnificent bird endemic to the region is nowadays severely threatened a guide takes it back to Camp to try and look after it as for the wild pigs there are too many in the forests of lingaro and will serve as dinner in the evening some of the scientists work is to educate the local population so they become in the end the best caretakers of the biodiversity of [Music] [Music] laroo the first Lake finally appears the end of it can the water is high it Lake it ladder and there recorder so he he saw the lake and it was a lot lower all that bay there was dry he says that when the level was lower the trees could be seen outside it okay we and we [Music] how can the spectacular changes in the lake level be explained to find out more about the natural phenomena here the hydrologists decide to Camp there for a few days the second canoe has it mess of wood to help their research the guides offer two boats they usually use for fishing I think you could make a I myself if we could fiddle that you could make a catam with them because I sound and the GPS on the bank like that it Waves yes like that they there you camaran you know how to Pedal you hydrologist at the ird yes you must know how to paddle generally you get trained to you can show us how if it works do I go there now got my passport everything driving license don out for your glasses just remember forward is below on the right Hydra just on the water not that simple [Music] foree [Music] with what they have to hand Bernard PUO and John Pier brique build the makeshift raft which will let them determine the bimetric of the lake to map [Music] it there aim is to cover the lake surface over about 45 km and thanks to topographical surveying find out the answer to why the lake has such big level changes we for measuring today burnard no wind very calm water that should give us the measurements we need with Precision that there we coordinates of each point which we taking as XY as a northern latitude and longitude and for each point we depth which will let me make a map which shows the Lake profile 44 43 well it than before we see according to the data on the sound the depth of the lake is almost constant except at the foot of a cliff falling into the lake in this precise spot it a lot deeper here close to the steep sides the explorers make their first discovery you see you might say it like a face turn like that a bit more to the left a bit I wonder if there something else and that above it there you see like a fish above look the image above hello up there that there and those are people that man the few archaeologists who have managed to study this kind of work in neighboring regions think that they were made around 3,000 years ago when the island population migrated to more hostile regions to flee invading peoples from Australia [Music] most of these frescos were made using a red pigment made from human blood iron and plant juices some abstract motifs are a mystery they probably have spiritual or religious meanings but the discovery of these wall paintings doesn scientists from their mission thanks to the bimetric measurements they can now unveil the secrets of the lake there Lake 10 km long two or three wide the first measurements gave us 40 m of depth and a perfectly Flat Lake and then we had the surprise of finding that along the cliff Edge where there were inscriptions there was a deeper floor up to 43 m 40 cm over 20 M of diameter and typically that means there that could be one of the possible exits you see for the water from the lake the hypothesis Advanced by the researchers is that the hollow at the foot of the cliff plays the role of a natural drain at present the drain is blocked and the lake level is high but in an earthquake or more likely when the water pressure is too great after repeated rains cracks appear and the block gives [Music] way water then plunges into underground networks the lake empties quickly after another earthquake or when sediments have accumulated once more the block reforms and makes the water rise again the lake level fluctuates in a cycle a first Enigma has been partly resolved but it disappear into the underground networks the long laroo river partly crosses the mountains and it too loses itself in the depths of the earth no one at present knows where its source is to be found according to scientists the Subterranean part of the river is about 3 million years old long enough for species to become adapted to this specific environment kusman lobosa and Kristoff Koshi experts in aquatic fora leave to join a team of speleologists at the place where the river disappears beneath ground their mission is to see what living creatures people lingoo you know theologists have gone up to the cave okay and according to them there don there you see on that cave there biological data yes it would be good to see what Cavern space there is there yes there there how long how long will it take us to get up there really 7 hours by canoe okay that makes 7 hours 7 and 1 half to 8 hours travel to get there okay well should we go let the team has to go up 60 km into the mountains following the river they will explore the Labyrinth of cavities where scientists think the lingaro has its source Rapids and waterfalls mean the voyage can canoes the Explorers have no choice they have to follow the river on foot up to the last Village just below the caves [Music] [Music] [Music] Al I to describe all of the caves living creatures that going to compare them to all of the known species in the world the villagers have understood the scientist permission to enter the cave region and offer them shelter before they move on their way we are we hoping for what are we hoping for tomorrow tomorrow we lots of fish well lots of species of animals in the cave in the cave yes of course [Music] the guides teams relay each other it the turn of the new Village to accompany the researchers over the last leg of the river which leads to the Maze of caves [Music] we [Music] oh wow oh no oh [Music] no wow oh boy theologists have been here already for 6 days to scout it out and try to find the source of the lingaro river they are eager to be resupplied with food welcome to your home I okay hello hello happy hello mate good Lord happy you got what a succession of basins there you got the river right there at 50 m the river which is falling under the blocks that oh yeah right let go how do we go is there a trail there no no you take you you stay there you see the wall of the wall at the left you follow it and you get there in 50 m you then you On and On You Follow the river with the help of the directions kusman Loba Bower and Kristoff Kushi have just one aim to collect specimens of every species present in the Subterranean water so they can evaluate the biodiversity of this as yet unexplored aquatic environment there cadar come and see with a pink tail trying the Bas and kadada over there above another prawn take it take it this one a look above okay ah we got two there bit redder than the other that one we can see them well there the one on the other side isn eh we didn proms that they these two prawns here and they different kinds we see the fishing has been poor the flow of the river is too strong for the researchers to stay for long this is a disappointment for them they branches outside the cave go in front I Train are following up their underground exploration they have to map the cave Network and find the point where the river begins under the block another concretion aggressive eh it goes off there these are concretions which have been eaten Away by bat urine and phosphates these are tinas which have been described in Cuba look at look at the Pinnacles there too this is biogenesis this part of the cave is dug Away by the biological activity of bacteria the acid is supplied by bats Etc and it causes these strange shapes [Music] here bats play a major role in the modeling of underground cavities two phenomena are at work the first is due to bat urine it is spread in an aerosol form of Highly corrosive acids which attack the roof and walls of the caves according to the species the bats can Nest as individuals or a colony which has a direct effect on the nature of the Aerosoles highly concentrated these form a juice which digs circular holes on the ground scientists call these holes tinita found and described in Cuba or large jars in English here it urine which makes holes and Hyper acidic Aerosoles which perforate the rock the urine mixes with guano the solid droppings of the bats then a second phenomenon takes over as the guano attracts a myriad of little organisms Crustaceans insects spiders which decompose into minerals and notably phosphate Washed by the floods of the river The Rock altered by the phosphate becomes malleable drops of water and the urine then can sculpt the vertical holes into such a density that they become a chain of Peaks as sharp as knives it off first we look at the riverbed that flood it must spill over when it flood to find the source of the lingaro the team follows its old bed now dry enormous blocks of stone attest to the violence of the river floods oh it gushing there there the river pouring into the blocks magnificent some of the flow is Going Underground does it disappear or go into an arch we and see especially if that comes out somewhere what [Music] [Music] it the river constantly appears and disappears in the Limestone relief Hollow us a Swiss cheese we the underground laroo again okay well that seems to be a basin a Spillway of the lingaro oh no it goes below it goes under there yes that which gets lost in these blocks here take a look let the Milky color of one of the lingaro branches as well as a nasty smell of rotten eggs announces the presence of sulfur this arouses the Curiosity of the speleologists here you can clearly see the role of sulfuric gas which corrodes the Limestone and afterwards precipitates the gypsum firstly as needles and Beyond a certain level in the form of gyps and blooms so these crystals can have a special kind of organization like here along bacterial threads in this Subterranean Network a specific ecosystem has come into place where the synthesis of light usually necessary for the development of life is replaced by the synthesis of chemicals the water with a high concentration of hydrogen sulfide leaves strong doses of sulfur on the walls the sulfur feeds minuscule bacteria which Gather in billions in the shape of gluey stalactites known as snottites this microbial carpet is the first link in a food chain thus many insects attracted by this organic matter come to stay in the cave phenomena of this type is rarely seen it toxic cave called Kua Devilla L the laroo mountains show the scientists once more the interest and extent of their special nature back to the fish Specialists they which they the rainbow fish the origins of this little fish go back to the creation of the mountains studying its distribution could bring valuable information about the order of geological evolution of lingaro oh hell come on okay it no that are turtles ah Turtles let on he they little things tiny tiny yes yes cast it there so so so this one has two red stripes it really pretty did you see that it exactly red it orange it there are two distinct bars yes yes the tail is a bit Violet the cap has two marks blue marks like that and several gold marks it never seen that before never never never the first time it seen even in Publications books things like that there seen it what that gives us on a genetic level and then Define it all mission accomplished for the researchers they species of rainbow fish which have in common that they live together in the lingaro river this is a first in general just one species colonizes a water course as the Discover of rainbow fish proves the laroo mountains are a factory for producing different [Music] species the many valleys each cut off from the other make up so many little lost worlds in which living creatures isolated from their relations for hundreds of thousands of years have evolved separately they are different genetically no longer being able to reproduce with the mother population group and have ended up as completely different new new [Music] species langaro is thus the amazing sight of the birth of many [Music] species intrigued by the discoveries made by their colleagues the entomologists take a turn in the caves of lingaro the site could be favorable for the presence of invert with extreme adaptations here we there underground forer there are a little data from bird expedition and then we have some data for Papua and central New Guinea but here we have no idea what we we very interesting to see what we discover [Music] okay this let go let the anoi expert in underground fora is accompanied by CH radi specialist in spiders at the Indonesian Science Institute together they Advance into the entrails of the [Music] mountain the dark Ness is total and few nutrients Reach This isolated [Music] environment the species that live here faed conditions of extreme rigor [Music] the specificity of underground groups is that they very often live in a somewhat insular system the populations are isolated fragmented and therefore each population is likely to be microendemic species meaning animals that live in very restricted areas here large grasshoppers it genus heteropoda quite characteristic of this area this is a young one but it can reach the Sid of a hand let further this is a Rapido forid die a large grasshopper I think that this is an adult again very very long anten ey and the eyes are reduced because it meaning it spends most of its time in the cave so they begin to develop adaptations that are those of real cave dwellers like the loss of eyes loss of pigment the loss of eyes is accompanied by an elongation of the appendages often a lengthening of the antennas so this is true for insects I don know you see what is this it spiders the genus is a SX SX this is uh known from here I have no idea from this area but I only know from W Islands in rajaat and in banini but in banini is a completely bronish so so maybe is I nice I will keep it I have to be careful I don don yeah the catch is good these IDs or whip spiders are archaic animals of the spider class the spiders and the Scorpions seem to Spring straight from prehistory and inspired some of the terrifying sequences in the films of Harry Potter fossil records show that the emaids were here 359 million years ago they haven [Music] then back in Jakarta chaio radi can study the creature found in the luru cave in the right conditions the species from luru has two spines on the pedipalp cloud the body is larger and also the antenna is uh longer and the color of the body is much more dark compared to the two species from manari and W I confirm that the species from luru is a new species and it will contribute on the biodiversity as whole in the Indonesia or in the Papua [Music] region anoi has also found a creature worthy of attention in the caves of lingaro with the authorization of Indonesian scientists he takes it back to the Natural History Museum of Munich for DNA analysis [Music] here found in terms of terrestrial invertebrates it found in the deepest zones of the jabu andara cave it dweller completely lacking in pigment with very long legs no eyes just very long antenna so this cockroach is adapted in an extreme way to underground life this is remarkable to find this species it the only place in France which studies underground life is the muli laboratory where there are breeding stations especially for cave dwellers which are placed in a real cave it species in their natural environment that reproduce the climatic and environmental conditions needed to study them over a long period [Music] the aim is to understand their evolutionary processes for example why they have lost their pigment or become blind anoi joins Olivia Gom research engineer at the cnrs his studies should offer additional information they are about a curious amphibian found in the caves of Central Europe it proteus so here these Proteus are 19 years old so they become adult between 15 and 20 years old how long do they live then well we think between 80 and 100 years but in fact the oldest ones we years ah they saw us arrive yes we hand they anxious there we [Music] are so now we them to the experiment [Music] from living underground in these conditions has it developed a particular strategy is its life cycle different is its metabolism different for the Proteus what happens is that it economizes as much as possible by not moving most of the time it and activity can be measured in individuals of only 5 minutes a day so during the rest of the day it itself up okay it can survive without feeding for several months even several years reproduction is very rare more or less one reproduction every 12 years for females and so a longevity which is very marked it still has marks of eyes though oh yes in fact it develops functional eyes at hatching so the ocular regression happens after hatching but is very very slow so there are still traces at adult hood the eye disappears then after all it all functional it disconnected from the brain in this species we see that there is a growth in sensitivity especially o effective and mechanical there sensorial compensation for the loss of vision in fact it very good hunter in spite of all it detects prey quite quickly and can direct itself without any problem thanks to its other senses despite the darkness so the fact we found modified organisms cave dwelling organisms in such an unexplored and unknown area of the world as papure New Guinea this allows us to add to the structure of understanding we have of the underground world so effectively in a general way we can see evolutionary convergence of all cave dwelling life forms but really we have very very few species so the more we discover the better for us we can validate our hypothesis and theories [Music] the laroo mountains have confirmed they are of major scientific interest it really is the Eden of biodiversity that the researchers foresaw they regions observed unusual natural phenomena and discovered mutating fora as well as several new species with extreme adaptations thanks to their research new hypotheses have been made to complete our understanding of the evolution of the Living World the scientists are more than ever determined to continue their investigations and protect these mountains unique in our world [Music]	Success
Immersive Coral Reef Exploration: 60 Days in Moorea with Under The Pole | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9A28J12fLw	SLICE Science	[Music] the idea for the capsule emerged in the South Pacific but it is here in Mara off the coast of opu bay where guila bardu and the under the pole team are going to test it this somewhat crazy idea came from his mountaineering experience the concept of the capsule is directly inspired by Himalayan CL in order to reach a summit the Himalayan climber has to go through a certain number of basic intermediary camps allowing them to spend several hours or nights and gradually reach the summit our Quest is one of time but to spend longer underwater at some point we our Advanced Camp is the capsule in this way a mountaineer will survive in their tent for several hours or days we can survive in our capsule for several days to observe the marine environment gila the under the pole Expeditions with him takes a first look imagine being here at a depth of 15 M even for just 24 hours I can see myself doing that for me that problem but if there are two or three of you no there problem like a tent in a storm the capsule is an underwater habitat measuring 4 cubic m in which two or three divers can live for 3 days without coming back to the surface for this Mission the team is made up of around 30 members including experienced divers Sailors physiologists and Engineers among them SV PUO who designed the capsule with Gila but for the moment the team is more doubtful than anything at first glance it looks a bit small it but gilon and Emanuel bardo about to come [Music] true on Thursday night three divers are going to spend 24 hours inside they will spend the first night underwater in the capsule imagine if you whale comes to say hello or some [Music] sharks they have been waiting for this moment for months years even the capsule is now put into the water there are moments of joy in life and this is one this is an underwater habitat that we thought of that we built and which we on a two-month experiment that deal I can in its setting it and to take a look [Music] inside the backdrop is Mora the offshore face of the reef off opu Bay at a depth of 23 M the capsule has been designed to change the way the Marine World can be observed but it been no fullscale trials which have so far only been done using design software we engineering terms so everything will be fine when an engineer talks to you like that it means he stuff but it doesn there divers the team on the boat are two old Soldiers so they unforeseen things that will no doubt occur there are a lot of things to do which need to be done well so it to require a lot of synchronization from everyone I about not messing up about getting things [Music] right okay we capsule then we okay for Rolling here we go watch out for the slings mind the does unsurprisingly they encounter some difficulties an air bubble forms in one of the capsule domes the capsule remains on the surface and does not dive as expected lift not yet there it going the air is expelled and the capsule finally heads to the depths it is a surreal [Music] moment it feels like a plane taking off the slings hang at just the right height Emanuel and I grab them we attach the capsule to the four corners of the ballast and in a few seconds the capsule is in place when the capsule is fixed to the ballast it marks the culmination of 3 years work 3 years of reflection and of Doubt between two Expeditions it is that rare moment when an outstanding diver sees their dream become reality it moment the capsule is coming to life before our eyes on its sight that goes well we this for the first time the capsule stands ready before me I can hardly wait all I want to do is get inside it take off my rebreather hang it up holding my breath I move towards the air lock my head emerges in the air inside the capsule and then there incredible moment of satisfaction and joy I cry [Music] out well done gain your invention works [Music] this is totally insane we the Maria Reef we capsule the idea came from the frustration divers always feel having to return to the surface too soon 3 years earlier at their Logistics base in Brittany Gil Emanuel Silva and Scott Cameron came up with the concept for an underwater habitat that could be easily transported anywhere in the world and which could simply be operated by a team of divers with no impact on the environment very move very fast they designed a sort of oversized t in can and found they had revitalized a thrilling concept that had long been forgotten that of the underwater [Music] habitat this idea had been all the rage at the end of the 1960s with projects like American sea laab [Music] in Captain cau precontent to date 63 underwater habitats have been created but their cost their environmental impact and their operational complexity could paid to the human Quest To Live beneath the [Music] waves the underwater pole team has now revived that dream while adapting it [Music] the capsule is made up of several parts the living space which can accommodate three divers is attached by slings to ballast weighing 6 tons which can be filled and emptied of water to position it precisely with no impact on a site the capsule is autonomous but a team on the surface and a base camp look after Logistics and safety it has only been tested once out of the water gilong Silva and Irwin Marie vain spent 24 hours inside it this was the only trial for a prototype with a promising future if it works you have to remember that inside there our life depends on the slings holding and on the electronics working the aim is not to have fun in a little camp on the seab bat it provide a tool for the scientists of today and tomorrow to do things ultimately the capsule is one element in a more complex process the long-term study of the reef in opu B the team have hired a house opposite their moing which acts as their base camp the first 24-hour dive in the capsule is approaching we antenna to establish a link between this house and the capsule there buoy 2.3 km out to sea in that direction take it up nice and steady start pulling the top ropes and be ready to tie the knots to Anchor it as it goes so far so good we haven yet it all against all expectations we managed to put up the Mast more or less vertically without falling out surance we need to have constant monitoring of the people in the capsule and of all the atmospheric par in the capsule as well as communicate we need permanent monitoring to provide assistance to the capsule if necessary because we reef we Sea so it come and help us if there [Music] [Music] gilong Silva and Victor the cameraman undergo some physiological tests long stays in the capsule are an unknown quantity when it comes to dive protocols they require permanent monitoring what am I going to do you give a kiss to Robin you Robin soon I but I tomorrow on the boat there is the tension that surrounds any firsttime trial the unanswered questions can be read on every face it going to dive without coming up that we [Music] strange thinking that we dive without coming up that we it say goodbye thank the team I waved to my son Robin and I head down I have no apprehension I going to have an extraordinary experience and our senses are going to be turned on their head [Music] once in the capsule the divers are not going to breathe air which is harmful below a depth of 15 M for prolonged periods instead they will breathe a mix of helium and oxygen yes welcome aboard Silvan it great go ahead speak wow yeah what a voice what a voice it voice the voices are distorted by the helium the aim of this dive is to check the sensors and data to ensure that everything works and that the divers can spend time there safely okay okay we can see up to the surface going down to the seabed my plan is not to come back for the first time in my life I can dive without hurrying I t-shirt shorts at a depth of 20 [Music] [Music] M right now I [Music] dream below me it city with its inhabitants running around interacting I don mechanisms but we can clearly see right before our eyes The Reef is teaming with structured activity orchestrated by an invisible order [Music] [Music] [Music] hello gilong can you hear me hello gong can you hear me yes hello how is it going in the capsule it fine we first night under the sea if I were in your place I that well but I hope you do it special I have to say we gentle current but with waves you can feel it you before the night it it under control out there it mask all set the face mask is always to hand and there is an emergency gas bottle under each bunk since the risks are ever present if the atmosphere becomes degraded or a sling breaks their lives could be at stake I sleep and then I wake up it I check the capsule everything looks fine the walls are damp due to the condensation time Ticks by turn around look through the domes another world has come to life out there multitude of Plankton swim in a frenetic dance in our spotlights then there are the predators which Patrol The Reef which we can see circling the capsule like these trumpet fish next I hear the song of approaching whales which come very near in the middle of the night the whales come right up to the capsule they must be about 10 M from the capsule we feel the capsule vibrate but we can the whales are impressive and a little bit scary but we with them but the good news is this thing works [Music] there [Music] dawn there a it front of you at Daybreak right in front of them a cleaner Rass starts work [Music] picking off parasites in the mouth of a Celestial grouper on the head of a Fugu or from the gills of a [Music] plx after 24 hours syval Gil and Victor are getting ready to leave [Music] however long is spent in the capsule it takes 4 hours to return to the [Applause] surface yeah group hug what SVA Gila and Victor have just shared an exceptional experience spending 24 hours beneath the waves their faces are glowing their eyes sparkling the capsule lived up to its promise we barbecue and it all together because we had faith in this project and we built it and we made it happen and that cool in Mora the capsule is operating in one of the most fascinating ecosystems but also one of the most endangered today the coral reefs along with the tropical rainforests these reefs are the richest ecosystems on the planet one quarter of the ocean fauna and Flora depends on them but the corals are highly sensitive to variations in temperature and they are paying a terrible toll due to global warming at the Kobi a laboratory specializing in the study of ecosystems located at the end of opu bay Leticia haduan is trying to develop super corals which can withstand these changes egg laying is a key moment in her research and she hopes the capsule might be able to capture something that has never been seen before in Polynesia The Reef Coral laying their eggs in 18 months they have grown around this big why is it important to know about coral egg laying to know at what time they lay what would that tell you laying the eggs is the start of a Coral reproduction you can individuals onto the reef and since today we environmental changes we are working on a lot of theories of assisted Evolution I Hope by trying to develop these super corals but to do this we really need fundamental knowledge on when the corals lay their eggs at what time on which site and at what depth Leticia accompanies jisl to assess the state of the reef around the capsule the corals underwent an episode of whitening a few months earlier due to excessive temperatures it is quite possible that there are very few mature colonies because they have been very stressed so we might have to look at a lot of colonies before we find any mature ones Leticia is especially interested in the species called acropora hynus and what she finds is worse than she expected they find 200 50 acropora colonies around the capsule of which only 15 are alive and among those only four are mature the majority of the colonies which came through the whitening used their energy to survive rather than trying to reproduce it haven couldn losses it of individuals have survived that really is very low it mature colonies are too far from the capsule to be observed they will have to find another way to capture the egg l in opu Bay the installation of the capsule on the reef and the divers comings and goings has intrigued certain locals especially in this house around 100 m from the under the pole base camp this is where William lives now I afraid there to see on the seashore even on the surface there are interesting things but even more in the Deep at 10 or 20 M it amazing in Mora William knows the sea as well as anyone one he has been a fisherman since he was 17 he is all the more attentive to the preservation of this environment since this activity has allowed him to raise his eight children and numerous grandchildren he often goes out onto the reef with his son Kevin one might even say the capsule is in his backyard when the coral dies the fish can no longer come and hide there because it breaks so easily even the Predators they break it you touch it and the branches of coral disappear which means the little fish no longer go there because it [Music] home the alteration of the reef caused by whitening but also by Cy clones and pollution have modified the composition and volume of fish [Music] populations today Kevin must dive deeper than before to find fish of a decent [Music] size to get a good fish you have to go down deeper down to at least 25 M deep before you could catch these fish nearer The Reef the deeper you go the more dangerous it is you [Music] stake on the north side of the island many people buy their fish from him including the under the pole team that feed tonight she told me you research and I all about our project is an underwater habitat that we months and which we will live in to observe how the fish behave how they live the changes between daytime and night and the moon we fish according to the moon the full moon each moon has its own range of fish we know that when the moon is big certain fish will be around and when it fish and that children [Music] the forthcoming dive should allow the habitat to be adjusted to evaluate the capsule underwater observations notably of fish xil Sue is helping the team xil is one of the leading experts on fish in Polynesia he Dives for the Kobi and all the archipelagos to estimate the abiotic resources he has just examined the capsule site which sums up the situation around Mora here on the North Coast we observed that over time there are fewer big fish and more little fish and also greater diversity in other words we fish species in the past 25 years perhaps the commercial ones have been fished that fits with what certain local fishermen say I think they have a very good vision of what using science to try and put a figure on this but the best observers are those who spend their time in or on the water Gil will stay in the capsule later but for the meantime the members of under the pole are getting to know it and are refining its workings they going to spend three consecutive days there and Emanuel is struggling with apprehension at the prospect do you send the towels with the shuttle we don care of it they they send everything by shuttle there was a point where I took my decision now I have to go I experience but when I think about it beforehand it does feel a bit stressful I have to remember when I was 6 years old and I watched custo in his underseat houses I dreamed of doing [Music] that at the moment when I meet gillon gaze him on the outside and me inside there has already been through it he understands exactly the joy and happiness I felt it from inside the capsule we can hear the boat leaving and it which really count as the first instance in the capsule because that you the ocean that work you feel really autonomous left to ourselves in the [Music] capsule 15 divers spent 78 hours in the capsule and all experienced more or less the same thing the initial app tension a difficult initial 24 hours then the senses [Music] adapt they gradually develop the concept making more excursions outside the capsule these long underwater stays change their perception in 3 days beneath the waves I feel I in 15 years of diving [Music] every night a team is on watch in the house where the screens are continually monitored and on board the boat where a team of divers is ready to reach the capsule within 15 minutes house calling house to why we switching to security standby mode are you receiving okay copy that keep a good watch until tomorrow a daily shuttle system takes essential supplies to the capsule such as meals clothes towels and spare parts the divers rotate during the day but as the number of stays increases the more the inhabitants of the capsule become autonomous I received a drawing from Tom in the [Music] shuttle that reminded me of what waiting for me up there the real colors and so seeing that drawing of a sun was very moving in the capsule emotions are heightened and life becomes a human Adventure [Music] we don Forks there are moments of joy and laughter but sometimes of concern such as when a sling threatens to break putting their safety on the line or when the oxygen injector starts playing up hello oh hold on let so they can intervene it [Music] inject I think that I looked back it life that I had the impression of looking 3 days behind me as if I had been in a great dream for the past 3 days something unreal you can I have a hug all the same it is an unforgettable incredible experience it land it an end back together again living in the capsule for 3 days is an experience all the divers were monitored before during and after the decompression methods have been honed the physiological parameters observed and their Sensations [Music] noted we all had quite powerful dreams and even some very strong nightmares which we don land and it I wrote down three of my dreams and two of them were directly linked to the capsule and we weird the physiologists have validated the use of the but they have focused on one detail a phenomenon that is also observed in space exploration it conditioning which is very comparable to what happens in space and which is due to the fact that they are not upright they don exercise and they spend their time either sitting in the capsule because of the lack of space or else in a weightless state in the water it is jil underwater xil is a seasoned diver he calculates he has spent the equivalent of 80 Days underwater during his career he is about to add two consecutive days he is intrigued by the feedback from the other divers does the capsule allow a different perspective of the reef are you ready to fulfill your dream on the one hand it come true but there parameters which I understand in theory but I have never tried before it so that nice you Impressions disappear in fact it simple it works it cabin [Music] [Music] the damsel fish are always in a group they swim up really high in the day there feeding there once settled in the Cal of the capsule reserves relationships between the fish that he has never noticed before such as between the orthon and the moish idol which feed off its scraps he notes previously unseen behaviors yeah there there above the capsule and there are about 10 females below which are also above the capsule but beneath him and which will swim up to reproduce that the first time I that the capsule is formed a little crowd of regulars a Celestial grouper is never far away and a trumpet fish has taken up [Music] residence the capsule comes into its own during transition phases when when the night gives way to day and when day becomes night these moments have been little observed by divers and are unfamiliar to [Music] scientists it you see some species which only interact at those times of day or which interact at another time but above all at the moment of predation such as the shark which eats parrot fish at night while they sleep and we see behaviors we can distinguish individuals and see what they do in the day if they stay in their Corner we see what time they head out if they swim in couples or not you can see the whole cycle you see more of the life of the fish of each individual see it amazing oh yeah I forgot to warn you but uh you snore good night incredible absolutely great I words what an opportunity to observe you inside I couldn brilliant you could spend a year in here several months anyway at the Cobi sheal continues to share his experience notably with David lini the laboratory in fish Behavior the fish don you the fish behave as if we potato so you see see them acting naturally that you watching us and they act differently because we away because they interested in the bubbles and come close for a look and so on it the first thing to say about the observations is that their behavior is much more natural nightfalls on the Kobi the egg laying period for the corals has begun in Polynesia this is not a mass phenomenon as it is on Australia Barrier Reef each species lays separately now every evening Leticia hadwin waits for this very precise yet very uncertain moment each Coral species has its own moment for laying eggs we know that in general they lay between 7 and 12 days after the full moon and they often lay at 9:00 p.m. but since the process only lasts for a few minutes it is very difficult to observe in nature especially on the offshore slopes of the reefs in the laboratory a colony starts to lay have you seen the others over there look at that one then another and another one of them is laying well now too at that one cool what they will go to the nursery Leticia and her team collect the eggs which they will use to try and create super corals that can withand climate change the egg laying in the tanks Echoes what is happening out on the reef the under the pole divers pull out all the stops to capture this event for the first time in Polynesia team members Frank gazola and Victor ralt make sorties night after night we went out really motivated but then after 3 hours without moving next to a colony in the dark it gets cold it admit from the third night the time started to drag then at some point doubt sets in you wonder if you to witness this episode by the fifth night we needed to be reassured by the scientists at the cry and by asking her are you sure then we came up to this Colony on the eth night it was completely different to the other [Music] nights Leia had told us you it recognize it [Music] for 10 minutes they witness the long awaited Moment One Colony that is more resilient than the others tries to reproduce on the desolate [Music] Reef the date time and location of the colony are all precious data for letia in her quest for a super Coral that is excellent this observation is a major first for us in [Music] Polynesia to begin with the capsule was a matter of intuition we thought we would encounter some things which in the end did not take place and conversely we made some observations which we had not necessarily expected it yet extremely powerful idea when you take a step back by changing point of view we simply brought a fresh perspective on the underwater [Music] mil Gila Emanuel and the whole team put the capsule through its Paces over these two months and it has performed well this is the culmination of a dream and the starting point for some fresh discovery PE [Music]	Success
The Hidden World of Airborne Microorganisms | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlwENXeFeE8	SLICE Science	[Music] you feel far away from everything here that to get some height to rise above the Earth surface to see if it in what way and by which life forms it air the wind speed is maybe 20 km per hour so in 1 hour a particle will travel 20 km which is a considerable distance piato studies life forms in the Earth chemistry at claron feron in central France we catch up with him 1500 m above sea level on top of the prome observatory he aspirators that filter and capture tiny Airborne organisms for Pato the sky around us is far from empty he offers us an astonishing description of the ocean of air in which we live everything in the atmosphere comes from the ground from Earth surface well almost everything so you have a kind of reflection in the air of what this is in a state of flux it Dynamic everything moves and combines day after day winds brush and scrape every surface on Earth and whip up all sorts of living and non-living particles into the atmosphere they constantly around us these particles can reach Heights of 5,000 m and form Reflections in the sky of the different environments on the ground plumes of dead leaf matter pollen mold and bacteria rise into the air above forests when the wind blows it distorts it creates a kind of plume of the forest imprint which spreads across the landscape grass debris small insects fragments of sheep hair rise into the air above a meadow the highway in the distance creates a world of Tire dust droplets of grease and fine particles high altitude winds mix and transport these different emanations [Music] constantly moving air carries this multitude of life forms this aerial Plankton through the sky on its [Music] currents at the national Research Institute for agriculture food and environment in Ren Western France Christ buar and Manuel plen collect the catch from this mysterious looking chimney in the middle of the countryside it is a huge pter or insect aspirator you can feel the air gushing out of the Trap this trap is 12 M tall well not exactly 12 M because it model it than 12 M the idea is not to catch insects flying at ground level which are really local movements what we want to do is capture insects that have been carried High into the air by wind and probably traveled long distances it will be more representative of what is floating over the whole region Wednesday packed the Flies are very much alive it what insects are the largest living things that make up aerial Plankton depending on their size and the wind strength they spend a few hours or several days in the air and can reach Heights of 1500 M the Trap sucks up everything in the vicinity the agronomists use it to look out for and warn Farmers about the arrival of clouds of aits and other crop ravaging insects it operates 20 [Music] 47 there sunny day yeah small than usual there an aphid here so there another hiding there there too the beat aphid a whole world stopped in its tracks beetles ants flies bugs and even spiders an incredible variety of species for an invisible aerial [Music] ballet as in the marine environment you find lots of cells algae small crustations and so on but in a cubic meter of air above our heads you also find all sorts of organisms such as spores pollen and bacteria and also lots of little insects and spiders for living things winds are are rather like magic carpets the air is an Open Door a possibility an opportunity to feed to reproduce or to change their life [Music] while birds are capable of active flight more often than not aerial dispersal is a passive [Music] process the creatures carried a loft as aerial Plankton do not control the direction the altitude or the distance traveled during the [Music] journey the species found in aerial Plankton are typically organisms that produce huge numbers of Offspring and send these Offspring in large quantities in every direction in the hope of finding a place some of these Offspring will land somewhere and rapidly colonize the environment abundance is the name of the game for the living creatures who take to the skies and do not hesitate to throw their offspring to the wind for plants the wind is a powerful dispersal force and 90% of all plants use it seeds often have shapes that enable them to fly away on the slightest Breeze a single tree entrusts millions of these precious seeds to air currents fungi ensure their reproduction by releasing billions and billions of microscopic spores and relying on the wind for dispersal but it and miss [Music] as for insects scientists estimate thousands of tons pass over our heads each year all of these living things participate in this gigantic aerial Lottery where the chances of survival are slim most of these Offspring will die during the journey the benefit is not individual very few individuals gain anything it right place but those that do land in the right place will have a huge benefit producing millions of Offspring so in the end the results are positive [Music] despite the dangers in the high mortality rate over 80% of Airborne Travelers die during the journey many widespread and thriving species on our planet actively embark on air [Music] currents and what happens to those that don succeed they die in the air of cold land in the wrong place or get eaten aial Plankton constitutes a rich food source for the Predators who intercept the tiny life forms on their [Music] journey and their corpses provide nutrients that end up in the water or the soil [Music] when you part the vegetation like this to see what level you almost immediately see these tiny spiders scurrying about these spiders don webs here we have a species commonly found in the sort of habitat which is called a pza it lives in very unstable habitats these salt marshes are frequently flooded and when this happens the salt marsh has to be recolonized this tiny spider is going to show us just how vital aerial dispersal is for the living things that rely on it Julian Pon and his team from Ren University in Western France are studying the paroa pinis populations living in 12 marshes scattered along the length of the Britney Coast the scientists catch the creatures found under the thick layer of grasses and algae after the the insect aspirator here aspirator we anywhere else than in these salt marshes not even in the habitats around the salt marshes for this reason we assume it cannot leave the salt marshes by walking or running so there dispersal we know this doesn very well so we can assume that it dispersed by sea waterer therefore if there is genetic mixing we can assume that it has occurred through aerial dispersal confined to their marshes with no possibility of leaving them these incredible spiders have taken to the skies in order to reproduce and prevent genetic impoverishment Julian P whether the spiders found in the different salt marshes are related did you get any I managed to catch one it think it no it but it work on in other words crush it extract its DNA then sequence small parts of a gene and by sequencing a part of the gene we populations and estimate the exchange of individuals the gene flows and therefore the mixing that may have occurred between these populations the first results of this study show that the marshes are islands of Life connected by prevailing winds some appear to be starting points for the spiders some are checkpoints While others are the end of the journey for those that land in them the maximum dispersal distance is 200 km a vast territory for such tiny creatures to cover the unpredictable nature of winds and of aerial dispersal have resulted in a sophisticated mechanism without which the parosa pinis could simply not survive well before the Advent of genetic sequencing wandering spiders had already got themselves noticed because scientists have known about the existence of aerial plankton for almost 200 years in 1835 on his way to the Galapagos Islands aboard HMS Beagle Charles Darwin noted spiders landing on the rigging of the ship even though it was far away from any shore in the second half of the 19th century through a series of experiments Louie past proved that there are always what he called organized corpuses suspended in the air he opened the doors of a world inhabited by [Music] microorganisms tuberculosis Anthrax menitis bacteria were soon identified and associated with diseases in the early 20th century these germs in the air scared people they threw up a their windows and did gymnastics a new science appeared aerobiology the first comparative analyses were soon conducted in one volume of air 55,000 bacteria were found in the Dei in Paris but just 7,600 beneath the trees in a public park in the Swiss elps a hotel advertised itself by displaying a sign outside only 25 bacteria a tourist [Music] dream in the 1930s the celebrated pilot Charles Lindberg Flew Over the Frozen wastes of Northern Canada with sticky paper attached to the nose of his airplane with this he collected many samples of fungal spores pollen and microalgae the idea that living things can survive long high altitude Journeys gained ground but for some strange reason aerobiological research soon dried up the microorganisms in the air we breathe were [Music] forgotten until the end of the 20th century with advances in satellite imaging an incredible amount of previously hidden microscopic Travelers were revealed to scientists for the first time if you blow the dust off a piece of furniture the dust will be carried by the air current that you created exactly the same phenomenon occurs in the air these dust particles have such low masses that once they suspended in the atmosphere they tend to stay there and drift on the air current FR Dak studies the Intercontinental transport of desert dust he tells us about the 2 billion or so tons of dust dust that is picked up from the world year and moves through the atmosphere the gigantic scale of these dust transports was only revealed by satellites in the 1980s immediately afterwards aerob biologists realized just how far aerial Plankton could be displaced thanks to this fantastic mode of Transport you but organic matter possibly living matter there are microorganisms bacteria viruses possibly fungi so when the dust particles become airborne they carry all of these living microorganisms to places where they do not usually occur it spores or viruses to fly when they hitch a ride on a tiny grain of dust with the Desert Wind grains of sand are thrown up into the air and when they fall back down they shatter the finest Clays these tons of dust particles and their tiny hitchhikers are sucked up by columns of warm air and soar three or 4 kilm into the air we can track the longdistance transport of these dust particles satellite imagery shows the formation of a plume over the Sahara desert with each passing hour the plume becomes bigger and starts to move I time two days later we can see that this massive cloud of dust is starting to drift towards the Atlantic Ocean and within days it will be over Western France then in all likelihood it will hit the British Isles and possibly Scandinavia Earth depressions anticyclones warm air currents cold air currents move attract or repel these bands of dust the bands form highways in the air which wrap around our planet [Music] [Music] 3 to 4 km thick dust plumes take a week to cross the [Music] Atlantic the atmosphere is a lifegiving environment matter is added chemical elements are added and possibly nutrients too these natural desert dust transports actually contribute to the balance of the ecosystems on the Earth surface aial Plankton contains numerous tiny creatures they travel very high very far but what are their trajectories and what is their environmental impact all of these microorganisms eventually fall to the ground somewhere on our planet Emelio casamayor of the center for advanced studies in Catalonia studies what is known as microbial deposition in relation to climate change he has conducted the most comprehensive assessment of Airborne microorganisms to date we catch up with him and his team in the Spanish Pines we here because we effects of local contamination we high altitude to collect microorganisms that move through the upper atmosphere and make InterContinental Journeys there in the collector here we have microorganisms and particles we a filter to take them back to the lab take okay and now the particles are in here and this water is clear all of the particles have been retained by our filter there are organic particles such as bacteria fungi and pollen as well as non-organic particles such as Clays silicates and minerals which come from distant sites in this case it could be African dust particles for instance that have traveled through the air and then Fallen with the rain and we collect all of this in this filter there are thousands of millions of microorganisms these constant deliveries of microorganisms are a natural process that has occurred throughout the history of planet Earth when they fall to the ground the Plankton to have a profound impact on ecosystems some bacteria stimulate the growth of plants by attaching to them and capturing atmospheric nitrogen others sink into the soil and recycle dead organic matter viruses and microscopic mold regulate animal and plant populations they when they fall can colonize new environments it system the bacteria colonize environments all over the planet these small reactive biological units fall and start to develop Life by identifying the microorganisms present in rainwater over several years and studying weather data Amelio casay or trajectories and then work out which region sea ocean or continent the flows of Plankton came from and they discovered an astonishing consistency in the AR rival of microorganisms in summer the aerial Plankton is mostly of regional origin it is swept off agricultural land in Spain northern Europe cities lakes and rivers but in Winter the flows of Plankton arrive on Mass from the Atlantic Ocean Marine bacteria and viruses cross the ocean in 3 days and fall on the mountains when zavier Yan and I analyzed the first results we saw that there were consistent seasonal Trends it was a Eureka moment it microorganisms appear at the same time every year we know that this occurs in the sea and in trees some plants sprout in Spring others in summer and these Cycles occur in the atmosphere too the flows of Plankton are therefore not random mixes of species floating around in the atmosphere the microbial masses which rise into the air and then land have their own Cycles their own Seasons just like Bears flowers and [Music] bees but the life-giving atmosphere can also become a threat among the hordes of microbes drifting through the air some could harm us can microscopic aerial Plankton fall on us and make us sick miasma was the word we once used for the bad air that caused disease in the past when there were very few methods of prevention and no knowledge of transmission mechanisms people believed the environment the air was responsible for the plagues that strun them this old intuition that atmospheric air was a carrier of disease was accurate we now know that microbes and viruses circulate in the air and can infect people animals and plants Aven flu or foot and mouth disease can be spread by the wind over several kilometers from Farm to farm air conditioning units can accidentally release Legionella bacteria and spread a respiratory disease that can result in death legionnaires The Unbelievable quantities of spores released into the air by fungi then deposited in the soil are so many microscopic time bombs waiting to go [Music] off fungi can be pretty formidable pathogens hospitals know this too well because when work is done near hospitals Earth is stirred up sand is stirred up and if unfavorable winds pick up this stirred up Earth full of spores of aspergilus or of other types of fungus or mold pathogenic to humans this can result in epidemics in hospitals aspergilus is a type of fungus that is found absolutely everywhere and is in the atmosphere when there are large quantities and a person is immuno compromised then they risk catching this type of disease [Music] this medium-range dispersal of Agents pathogenic to humans has been proved short range contamination from 0 to a few meters by contaminated droplets as is the case with flu and the Corona virus responsible for covid-19 has also been confirmed but no solid evidence of long-distance transmission from 100 to several hundred km has yet been found [Music] very few human pathogens can travel great distances in the laboratory we looked for the corona virus discovered that it is very fragile indeed the Corona virus aerosolized outside because of ultraviolet rays because of desiccation that is the dryness of the air will die very quickly it will disintegrate the atmosphere is even deadlier for microorganisms than it is for the insects dispersed in it one in a million survive the aerial Journey just because we find a large number of bacteria of apparently worrying pathogens doesn should be worried in the vast majority of cases they will be dead there will be traces of viral bacterial parasitic genomes but they will not be active viruses but even if they were the fact is it is extremely rare for us to fall ill with a virus or a bacteria in order to become infected you need a significant viral load because fortunately the body possesses many defenses our immune defense system acts as a guard however most infectious diseases today are spread via another Air route airline passengers spread microbes around the globe INSP spring pollen grains join this big roundabout in the air pollen contains a tree sperm pollen grains fly through the air often very high very far towards the female organs of another tree this role of the atmosphere is very beneficial for the living world but pollen grains can break on their Journey they then release the irritating substances that make pollen allergies a major issue for public health at the University of Le in northern France Nicola VI and Mari chel are studying captured Airborne pollen grains they hope to find out whether pollen grains break more easily if they have encountered atmospheric pollutants in the sky let first there they are this pollen is completely torn apart this is a sample collected in the environment a sample that was collected during the Birch pollen season the pollen grains are cracked we can see that they have suffered to such an extent that their contents have Spilled Out the protective membrane has been literally ripped apart the shattered pollen we can see here has lost its reproductive function its primary function and these small particles that have been released are dangerous for asthma sufferers but this image is not representative of all the pollen grains in the atmosphere obviously what we trying to do here is count these grains what percentage of these are damaged is it significant for health to understand what happens between a pollen grain and a pollutant in the atmosphere the researchers are trying to reproduce this encounter in the lab this pollen is deliberately contaminated we make our pollen grains suffer in the lab it allergy sufferers there through here and I pollen into the ozone a reaction is going to occur between the ozone molecules and the surface of the polling grain and that what interests me in this experiment we sometimes speak of good ozone and bad ozone the ozone found in the upper atmosphere protects us from some ultraviolet rays so it beneficial but the ozone located at sea level where we live is harmful to human health it pollutant I to a fairly high dose of ozone typical of the pollution Peaks we get in summer in polluted conditions the contaminated pollen is subjected to different tests a pollen grain cannot get inside our lungs it the cyia in the nose but if it breaks it releases particles carriers of allergenic proteins that can get into the bronchial tubes and cause allergies and Asthma the aim of these experiments is to subject the PO into the kind of ordeal it encounters on its journey through the air for instance traveling through rain more often than not this causes pollen grains to [Music] explode will the pollen contaminated in the laboratory break more easily in water than healthy pollen grains marish chel is calculating the proportion of damaged pollen [Music] grains after the water test comes the mechanical shock test on its Journey especially in Urban Air pollen picked up by wind can be dashed against buildings or car winds screens what happens then Nicola Vis flings healthy and contaminated pollen against a surface in an impactor and counts the number of grains that have burst this shows that air pollution weakens pollen grains making them more likely to rupture and so these pollen grains are more likely to cause asthma attacks and more likely to break in the atmosphere it scale of our footprint I think that human activity has changed everything polluted everything even on the tiniest of [Music] scales pollen covered in particles emitted by human activity so particles from road traffic iron oxide particles zinc particles manganese particles from industry just as scientists are beginning to understand the importance of aerial plankton for the Earth machine and its inhabitants the sky is being radically altered by [Music] humans we burn a lot of fossil fuels for transport for heating for industry from space today we can see fires on the surface of the Earth forest fires agricultural fires and the fact is there are fires constantly depending on the season but there is also a growing phenomenon namely huge wildfires as a result of climate change and all of this combustion ends up in the atmosphere as gases or particles our sky is not the healthiest of places coal petrol wood we humans are burning the planet housing and human activity create new environments all over the surface of the Earth the emissions from these new terrestrial environments release an incredible amount of particles into the air as well as Gases such as carbon dioxide methane and nitrogen [Music] oxides the composition of the atmosphere is changing significantly the creatures found in aerial Plankton have to navigate this new man-made sky and the direction of global air currents is being affected to in the atmospheric system there are corridors or highways determined by the position of storms anticyclones which themselves determine the direction in which air currents will move we now know that this General pattern can change due to the alterations caused by climate change and the direction of the Winds the trends the patterns which have been stable for hundreds thousands of years could change this can have an impact on ecosystems everywhere and on the distribution of organisms advances have been made in aerobiology and new fields of research are opening up scientists long thought that microorganisms could not have any activity as they drifted through the atmosphere and that they went into pause mode until they fell to the ground and yet it would appear that some of them managed to remain active what can they possibly do in such a harsh environment we catch up again with pi mat in the clouds on top of the pred doome the weather is clearly cloudy today so it Cloud samples it isn as you can probably feel a lovely big cloud like this is ideal for taking lots of samples we the droplet impactor it with which we can collect the particles that is the small Cloud droplets suspended in the air we to crash into a surface they drip and we in a bottle that we here clouds are suspended Water Systems water covers over 70% of the Earth surface they could be atmospheric oases for Airborne creatures by providing water or food when the water droplets contain plant debris The Airborne creatures could also fall to the ground with the rain I shoes what is it like to live in an environment like this to live in a cloud we have a huge amount of droplets here and in about 1 in 10,000 there is a bacterium we can imagine all these bacteria isolated from one another do they if so how how do they feel to be all alone are they really all alone or grouped together in the same droplet when the desert around us is much bigger than we think so I want to know how life can sustain itself in there because there is actually life that sustains itself the proportion of living bacteria in a cloud is huge about 50% we know that they spend 3 to 10 days hanging in the air that gives them time to do things like all living things bacteria constantly make different proteins to attach to dust particles to protect themselves from ultraviolet rays or to produce digestive enzymes cloudwater analysis enables the researchers to find these molecules and reveal these tiny traces of Life bacteria do things in clouds they carry on living that in nutrients carbon for instance nitrogen nutrients excrete carbon dioxide and release molecules such as sugars in order to better adhere to a surface so there are all sorts of possible interactions some of which we the microorganism and its environment a water droplet [Music] in Pier variety of bacteria and fungi are evidence of the microbial Life In The Clouds but life in the air is challenging today scientists who have wondered about this believe that the atmosphere cannot be a habitat in the traditional sense of the term [Music] planet Earth pass through our ocean of [Music] [Music] air a few years ago an incredible scientific discovery rocked the world of aerobiology a bacterium well known to scientists and found in abundance in nature and in clouds could actually make it rain the concept of bioprecipitation rain caused by living things was invented it revolutionized thinking in aerobiology meteorology and agronomics at the national research Institute for agriculture food and environment in monave in the south of France Cindy Morris this bacterium with strange Powers its name is sudas suren puding poning is known as a bacterium that can live on the surface of plants and cause disease I show you what the bacterium pudum monos to Cindy moris sprayed a solution containing the bacterium on the outer leaves of this wild lettuce but she protected the inner leaves then put the plant into a freezer at -6° C for a few minutes and this is the result we can see that the tissue where the bacteria was present have Frozen then dried but the tissue where the bacterium was not present have not frozen pamon singi Burns plants by freezing them it possesses a gene which produces A protein that creates ice crystals these crystals enable it to pierce the plant cell wall and feed on the flesh these bacteria are called ice nucleators it is thought that they are capable of accelerating or boosting in clouds the formation of ice crystals that melt into rain as they fall it seems to work in a test tube everyone knows if you invite friends over for a drink and there ice it late it takes time to make I quickly you need something to Kickstart the process in this tube I have a suspension of the ice nucleating bacterium PUD moning I add a bit of the bacterium to the distilled water in this sterile tube as you can see it [Music] can this instant Miracle of water into ice occur outside in The Wider world are ice nucleating bacteria able to take off from Plants Ascend into a cloud and Trigger their Gene to form raindrops by freezing water bioprecipitation is a Hot Topic scientists are learning more and more about how the Earth and the atmosphere are linked by this rain cycle and microorganisms like Pamona sering on measure we have measurements that suggest it can cause frequent rain cycles that the rain falling today thanks to the interaction between the atmosphere plants and other microorganisms we have an effect on the rain that comes later so it isn rain that falls but the frequency of these events rain that falls more often thanks to plants capable of providing the sky with the right bacteria Cindy Morris is part of an International Community of scientists who want to invent a new form of Agriculture where plant varieties favorable to the growth of ice nucleating bacteria would be grown on particular plots these special creatures this aerial Plankton could then be used to combat drought in some agricultural areas a great project for the future the world can change if we look up at the sky and take air dwellers into account [Music] Ariel Plankton has shaped the world in which we live and it continues to influence our lives day after day scientists still have many questions about its role in the great Earth machine but it there is a rich and fragile world of Life above our heads which we must protect just as we do our forests deserts and oceans [Music]	Success
Giza's Hidden Gems: Mysteries of Khafra and Menkaure | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVHVwi38G5M	SLICE Science	[Music] the whole world is looking at faroh kufu Pyramid in Egypt yet right next to it on the Giza Plateau other architectural works of art have survived the test of time the Sphinx a lion with a human head and the pyramids of caffra and Manor unrivaled building Feats the Sphinx is not a rock it living Rock the caf currently the world pyramid located only a couple of meters away from the famous kufu the pyr of cafre looks like it impressive neighbor about 140 M of masonry are piled on this Vault how could the Egyptians build such colossal structures without any Modern Machinery what does the Sphinx represent and why was it placed precisely here what secrets are yet to be uncovered by exploring The Monuments today we satellite but the ancient Egyptian found a very simple way to build the whole nowadays a new and promising technology is supposed to help uncover the best kept secrets of ancient Egypt photogrametry it consists in extremely accurate 3D models of the pyramids and the sphin created by scanning The Monuments from the air the results are spectacular and will provide egyptologists with powerful tools we are able to reproduce Landscapes of of several Square kilm in 3D it computer I think I haven Pyramids like this three of the greatest egyptologists from the United States Egypt and France agreed to take on the mission of analyzing the Giza Plateau from the air and from inside like nothing ever done before what the pyramids are you can see through the photogrametry that the body the Sphinx is longer than a a normal Egyptian Sphinx so truly the pyramid is almost perfect more than 4,000 years after their construction these Stone monuments may be on the verge of giving away their Final Secrets lost somewhere between the desert and the giant City of Cairo a massive expanse of limestone of more than 300 hectares looks over the Nile Valley this is the Giza Plateau more than 4,000 years ago our ancestors made use of all this raw material to build what can only be called architectural Feats three pyramids standing next to each other one with the tomb of kufu his son Menor and we shouldn at the entrance of the plateau the landscape looks like a postcard and is known the world over although kufu is the most famous One the pyramids of of cafre and Manor are but 100 met away and also offer unrivaled levels of perfection yet no major scientific campaign has ever been carried out on these two monuments despite the fact that many Mysteries concerning them are left unsolved when I came to g a plateau people said there is nothing can be discovered I came in 1987 I made major major major discoveries I my life to everyone that we discovered until now 30% of the Egyptian but today the mystery surrounding these fascinating tombs could perhaps be solved indeed a French team of Engineers was given special authorization to carry out a digital scanning operation with the help of drones and small cameras they intend to take pictures of the Giza Plateau from every possible angle and that technique is called photogrametry after several days in the field hundreds of thousands of pictures are sent to Paris once put together they 3D models of the pyramids and the Sphinx photogrametry isn but the latest evolutions of the technology now allow for an unprecedented level of accuracy these algorithms today let us analyze not just two or three images like they used to but 1,000 10,000 or even 100,000 images we are able to reproduce Landscapes of several square kilometers in 3D monuments sculptures and we do so with all the tiny details of the architecture these photometric data will perhaps help solve some of the secrets behind the building techniques we can gather information on how they were built through the study of the blocks of their geometry how are they carved for instance or can we see some marks of the tools used it takes several weeks to compute such highly accurate models perhaps they of the Mysteries Behind These symbolic monuments especially the Sphinx one of Egypt structures basad duv a French egyptologist is leading us to this giant statue located below the pyramids which has been protecting the entrance to the plateau from Millennia when I stand in front of the Sphinx I wonder what can this be it must be something so important that it has never been copied although Egyptians made smaller Sphinx they never carved another one in a mountain like that there are many mountains around here small hills like that but why didn spin who is the guardian watching over the Giza Plateau 4,000 years later it to know what symbols are hidden behind this strange creature but one thing certain since it was built it has continuously fascinated people and egyptologists although for a very long time the statue was almost entirely covered by the Egyptian sand in the late period people like to come and touch it people like to be Buri beside it and this why the Sphinx became alision to the ancient egypti during ancient Greece people thought it was standing up just like the Colossus of roads they thought it was a standing statue the Sphinx was excavated for the last time during the 20s and that lion body so it wasn wasn Pharaoh the Sphinx is 73 M long and 20 M High more than 25 times the size of a lion the analysis of the Stones it made of LED archaeologists to date its construction to approximately 2,500 BC which matches the time the giz of pharaohs reigned therefore it was probably built by the same men who created the pyramids yet to understand its peculiar shape we have to focus on the building process and archaeologist Mark laner believes the answers can be found in the field you know what strikes many people who visit the Sphinx for the first time is that it doesn it sits down low and that actually sits in a quarry the ancient Egyptians created the Sphinx not by bringing stones and building it they created the Sphinx by taking Stone away natural rock like Michelangelo had a big block and he carved David during the 19th century the first archaeological excavations helped egyptologists to understand how the statue was built they discover that instead of bringing tons of stones Egyptians from Antiquity had the clever idea of carving the Sphinx directly in the Quarry of the Giza plateau and nothing went to waste the blocks that were removed to build the Sphinx were used to build a temple right in front of the statue [Music] most of the blocks have three geological layers there then there because it has more clay and then there same three layers in the body of the Sphinx and in the sides of the Quarry around the Sphinx and we can actually Trace these blocks back to where they were um in the natural rock of the Sphinx the first photog gometric data of the Sphinx are already available vassel duv will analyze them the photographs taken from the air offer a brand new Viewpoint that may lead to new information regarding the casing the Sphinx was built in we know the Sphinx was carved in a mountain but it because we ground now though we have a view from above and we can guess what shape the mountain was photogrammetry confirms that the Sphinx has indeed been built from a pile of rocks located on the plateau but there is clearly visible on the Digital model you can see through the photogrametry that the body of the Sphinx is longer than a normal Egyptian sphinx the classic Egyptian Sphinx they Great sphin giza looks like somebody took the lion body and pulled it too long like a rubber band and the reason is there fissure or a crack in the natural rock that passes right through the waist of the sphin and they couldn back of the rump there because it would just break so they basically pulled the Sphinx longer to fit it into the geology and you can see that in the photogrametry so that cool this curious crack was discovered when the statue was onar because of it the builders had to extend the body of the Sphinx otherwise keeping the regular proportions of a lion would have made it impossible to complete the back of the rump fortunately the builders quickly came up with a solution the the architect filled that Gap with a stones and after that they did the covering the stones that you see see to support the deteriorated body and they made the modeling of the loan body above the covering Stones although we know much more today about the construction of the most famous Egyptian statue the Sphinx is still shrouded in mystery for years egyptologists have been debating about who it represents the famous Pharaoh kufu or his son cafre for a long time everyone thought it was caffray since the Sphinx is located right in front of his pyramid the Quarry in which the Sphinx sits is the embankment for cfr Causeway the Sphinx sits to the left of the end of caf his Valley temple in front of the Sphinx there is a sphinx Temple obviously I think for the Sphinx so the Sphinx seems to be an integral part of what we could call CFR Valley complex and I think it represents coffy but other egyptologists such as vasel DV have other arguments when we come to have a look at the Sphinx we usually arrive from Cairo over there to the East and so we see the face of the Sphinx and behind cf think that the Sphinx is cfre however if we put ourselves in the shoes of the Egyptians at that time they came from the south from sakra 20 km from here and when we arrive from there we see the Sphinx from the side and who kufu and so we should link the Sphinx to kufu Pyramid Basel duv believes the Sphinx is connected to kufu pyramid and not cafr and to support his theory he uses photogrametry [Music] photogrammetry is very useful to understand exactly how the Sphinx is placed in regard to kaff pyramid and that kaff it doubts and so this image makes me certain that when cfre built his pyramid and the access way the Sphinx was already there and he was forced to go around it from the south the Pyramid of cafre was built after kufus so if the access way goes around the Sphinx Bassel dber concludes that the construction of the Sphinx took place before caff logically to kufu but other egyptologists such as Mark laner refute this Theory but why would kufu make a sphinx way over there far away from his pyramid complex and its alignment his pyramid Temple and a Cause way that was almost 800 M long actually goes and turns to the end at a valley Temple some distance away from the sphin the Sphinx where it is doesn kufu architecture it does make sense in terms of caf Sphinx identity remains a mystery but Technologies 2.0 uncover every day more information yet scientists have already succeeded in unveiling some secrets of the Sphinx for years Z avas has looked for secret Chambers together with Mark laner they even dug a tunnel to explore what statue today he agrees to show us this secret passage maybe five people who were able to enter inside the T only five I see the a tunnel goes inside here goes up and down I want people who talks about the mystery of the spin and they have a speculation about the to come and see me inside this T to prove it solid rock the Spinx it Rock 32 drilling operations have been carried out around the sinks and none gave any results not nothing is hidden underneath at all no aliens no people came from Atlantis or Lost Civilization although the drillings didn the statue they did reveal how fragile the work was indeed the pyramids nearby seem to stand the test of time without major problems but the Sphinx is much more vulnerable because the rocks it is made of are located much below the pyramids it table the body of the Sphinx itself was once the bed of a seafloor and so the Sphinx too has all these salts within it so when groundwater moisture Wicks up through the pores of the Limestone it dissolves the salts and it carries them to the surface when the water dries the salts recrystallize and they push the surface of the stone off with great pressure so that continuously Ling that the Sphinx is so vulnerable because it made out of these very same natural layers so the advantages to the pyramid Builders of this natural geology now become challenges for conserving The Monuments Renovations of the Sphinx started barely 1,200 years after its construction and have been going on ever since today keeping it in good condition remains a major challenge cracks happened here few months ago it proves that the Sphinx is the oldest sick person on Earth and we need to be near him all the time I feel that the Sphinx is the icon not for the Egyptians but for the whole world it very important that we have to save the things the most famous statue in the world is constantly monitored and thanks to photogrametry we can keep a digital copy of the monument forever no archaeological site is eternal and the image we have today is different from what we tomorrow so this allows us to transfer the image of the monument to another platform a digital one and to hand it down to the Next Generation so they can see it as we do [Music] [Music] back in Paris the engineers have completed the calculations for the last photometric data with the models of the caffray and M pyramids now complete the whole Giza Plateau has been reconstructed and the images are spectacular our experts discover them with excitement what photogrametry is that it really feels like having a realistic image of the site and we can move around it having Giza on the computer to see the three pyramids in one line and the Perfection that the archtics did the lay out of the three pyramids are amazing I think I haven like this pretty soon they are able to come up with some conclusions especially regarding caffra the Second Great Pyramid of Giza what pyramids are it pyramid in the diagonal axis of kufu they angle and this access goes to helops at the time heliopoulos was the religious capital of Egypt without our modern Technologies cfr managed to align his pyramid with kufus in the axis of heliopoulos [Music] but when studying cafr even further thanks to photogrametry Frank monia confirms another key element kufu pyramid is known to be the tallest pyramid ever built but with this tool we can do some measurements and they show us that at the moment CAF is the highest it kept part of its casing around the top whereas the top of kuf Fu deconstructed if we measure like this we realize that caf M High while kufu is about 138 M High which means that caf currently the world pyramid Caffrey was kufu Second Son initially his pyramid was 143 M high and kufu was 146 M high but because kufu pyramid lost its tip because of pillagers today the son taller than his father feet though we don caff personality cafre must have had big Ambitions because he built a big pyramid there was a mountain standing there so he used materials from there which makes him a practical man one thing certain Caffrey intends to build a pyramid that is as big as his father he seemed to be he uses a very smart trick when zooming in on the northwest corner of the pyramid near its base we clearly see that the stone was carved and that the Egyptians began working with an existing Rock bed to save on transporting the building materials it means that here they cut off big chunks that were moved somewhere else where the stone was missing where they didn bed in the field Bassel Dov will show us this unique aspect of the Pyramid of caffra the mountain is here we can see it clearly it was carved to be able to support the blocks we can pile up blocks on top of [Music] it thanks to this rock bed the pyramid is slightly higher but this isn only trick used by caffra to make his pyramid look [Music] taller since he wanted to build something as high as his father he cheated a bit and used a slightly steeper slope than his father did the sides of caffra have a 53° angle compared to 51° for kufu it may seem like a small difference but steeper slopes like these give caffray a more gracious aspect compared to kufu and this isn base of the pyramid 2 is a true Masterpiece of geometry with perfect proportions photogrametry gives us a clear view from above if we Trace lines following the pyramid that they cross each other perfectly at the top and they follow the edge closely so truly the pyramid is almost perfect a couple of mouse clicks are enough to confirm thanks to photogrametry that the base of the Pyramid of caffra is a perfect square but how could such accuracy be possible scientists believe the answer May lie in the mysterious holes that can be seen in some places of the Giza Plateau everywhere in Giza we found that these holes are 40 cm in diameter the reason for the constructure of this holes is to make an accurate square base for the pyram the hypothesis goes like this Egyptians installed wooden poles in the holes thanks to these they were able to draw semicircles then by drawing a line between the connecting points of the circles they could draw a perpendicular line and therefore the pyramid angle today we use satellite we use technology to do it but the ancient Egyptian found a very simple way to do it the holes this simple but clever technique let Builders reach an incredible level of accuracy each side measures 215 M with an average variation of 8 cm which is unbelievable the right angles are almost perfect too as perfect as kuo taking a tour around the pyramid thanks to photogrametry Frank Monier discovers another distinctive characteristic in the construction near the base we notice the presence of huge blocks megaliths they long the blocks in the Pyramid of kufu don Pyramid of cafre blocks of 20 30 and even 50 tons are quite common so there the Mason of the technique used photogrametry also lets us study how the blocks are laid on the upper part of the pyramid which is very difficult to reach in the [Music] field it looks like the masonry is random we have small blocks big blocks without any logic it until you get to the top and the courses look fairly step underneath the intact casing are they two different phases was there an interruption in the work we don of cfr not doing masonry as big and as well joined as we see in kufu vassel doev believes this to be yet another of caff time I love cafre because he was a very smart and practical person when looking at kufu everything is clean straight the blocks are more or less the same height but here we can see three layers of big stones in order to support the building of course but after that there are smaller Stones Bigger Stones not really straight or even and they discovered that it much faster and no one would ever know since the beautiful casing would hide it all it leather and cafre was leatherette it done quickly and efficiently and looks the same caff Limitless even the very location of his pyramid is a strategic choice if we look at the northwest corner the aerial view clearly shows the traces of a quarry that must have been used during caf rain this Quarry was known but here we clearly see how the blocks were placed we can see the furrows carved to detach the Stone from the ground by taking their supplies right next to the pyramid the builders killed two birds with one stone they decreased the time needed to transport material while doing the excavation work required all around the pyramid vasad Dov will show us this Quarry located a mere 20 M from the side of the pyramid here we mountain cfre used to build his pyramid and here we see the part that hasn been used but everything else was taken and placed on the monument we often wonder how long it took to build this but the stone is right here and we can even see the marks left by the tools of the workers how they carved how they took blocks of different sizes caf exterior seems as complex as kufu but what about its interior the Great Pyramid of Giza has a complex funeral system of three chambers has cafre the little sister a similar [Music] installation in order to find this out we received a special authorization to go inside the pyramid the pyramid is usually closed to the public but we got a special authorization we lucky for the very first time our team will be able to digitalize caff interior even though it inside we have tools that give us ible data and allow us to create very good quality 3D models caff at ground level it leads to a corridor that goes down called the descending passage and then to a 60 M long Corridor at the end of this passage lies the first burial chamber we gorgeous and again you see it directly into the mountain and covered by beautiful stones yeah caff it chamber inside kufu it the pyramid and was allegedly carved directly in the mountain in the open thanks to photogrametry Frank manier is able to study its peculiar architecture from a distance The chamber also known as a Chevron Vault the chamber is in the ground but it protected from the weight of the pyramid thanks to this Chevron Vault we can see it here this vault is the most heavily loaded vault in the world it masonry of grouted Stones no less than 140 M of masonry are piled up on top of this Vault it record in the world history of construction 140 M of masonry hundreds of tons of stones held by this incredible vault kuf Fu use Chevrons inside a pyramid thanks to these experiments caf technique here the Vault Bears the entire weight of the pyramid the ceiling is made of Big Blocks placed like Chevrons this placement means that the weight is carried where there it effective that every kind afterwards will use it the loads are spread on the sides they towards the side walls flat ceiling instead the loads would bear down on it it would break and collapse The Vault of caff chamber is a true construction feat indeed it still looks almost as new 4,500 years later we can see small cracks so although the vault is in an excellent shape indeed it has still been worn out by an incredible load hundreds of thousands of tons rest on it it had an impact so although it good shape it cracked this is something very difficult to see with the naked eye but obvious on the photogrametry there caf complex his s cagus brings up many questions the sarcophagus actually was made of red granite and red granite came from asan and you have to know there is two things here that we have to think either the ancient Egyptian architect ordered the Workman to do it in the Granite Quarry in asan and they can make the lid separate and they can make the sarcophagus separate or they brought the pieces to make it here was cafre sarcophagus made on the spot or brought from Aswan I really think that they made it to Aswan because if they bring the pieces here and any mistake can happen then it will be useless look at the size of this it exactly can fit with the size of the interest the fact Caffrey strives to such Perfection for his tomb is due to it having only a single chamber unlike his father who had created a complex funeral system with several Chambers some egyptologists believe such Simplicity to be the result of the pharaoh mind this is the main idea here let what to bury the king if he dies so he can be resurrected was AF simply playing it safe or did he want to differentiate himself from his father no technology or any other clue can currently answer this question but the obvious Simplicity of the construction is a source of questions for scientists we often looked for other burial Chambers inside cafre because we thought it was much too simplistic one day perhaps new technologies will allow us to go even further and to uncover caff [Music] Secrets but in order to discover the last treasure of Giza we have to go around caffray indeed the last pyramid that of his son Menor is much smaller than the others on the plateau it 63 M high it than the Pyramid of kufu why did we go from extreme gigantism to a human scale could be the running out of space on the Giza Plateau because the pyramids are built on this diagonal and manar pyramid is very close to the southern edge of the plateau it drop but there not a lot of room for a gigantic pyramid but such change could also be explained by politics if you look at the statues of M look at his face kufu and Kim strong kingship strong Kings but began for the first time to see a kind man a man who a nice guy and he good and goodnesses and touching their hand then he feeling with M Kare that they out of steam things are slowing down you just get the impression that nobody really supervising funds are running out and yeah that the whole process is just losing Steam and they tired whatever the reasons explaining mcor that what matters is that the last Pyramid of Giza is a mixture of techniques even though it was built almost a century after CFR we sometimes hear that moror built a small pyramid because they didn how to build anymore the techniques had been lost but right here inside his funeral Temple there carved Stone on Giza here some blocks weigh about 200 tons it means the techniques were still known but this idea was different and here again the extreme accuracy of photogrametry will perhaps help us to better understand how mcor pyramid was built when zooming in on Cory the first thing that catches my eye is the Quarry located near the northwest corner the Quarry has been mentioned very seldom and never described but photogrametry will allow us to create a very detailed plan of the blocks they carved here we can still see the furrows used to detach the construction Stones we can see that the blocks were rather big something like 3 m by 3 they could weigh more than 10 tons each 20 even perhaps raon here too the builders from Antiquity used materials available nearby so they wouldn them over long distances but this strategy doesn for every stone in the pyramid indeed Menor made some aesthetic choices that are in sharp contrast to his ancestors one of the characteristics of Menor is that he encased his pyramid in Granite it and protects better we know that everything that holds in a pyramid is made of granite so here the whole casing is in Granite but did he ever reach the top not sure unfortunately he didn time to finish the poor man didn as long as kufu or cfre and so he couldn his pyramid every King want a new trend for himself they maybe M thought that I have to make something different than casing my pyramid with lime Stone every Dynasty has a trend something new the first 16 layers of Manor are made of granite this is the only Pharaoh on the Giza Plateau who used so much of this rock egyptologists think that the rest of the pyramid was limestone Granite is much more difficult to carve and takes much more time Manore took the risk with this decision that his tomb wouldn ready by the time he died one of the last tasks that remained undone was to smooth the bottom of the pyramid in Granite so the workers walked away from the job leaving the outer faces of each casing Block in Granite with this big belly of extra Stone all of that was meant to be cut away actually hammered away with heavy Hammer stones and work just stopped but it left us a kind of Frozen moment in one of the processes of building [Music] pyramids Frank Monier is in Paris and he continues to analyze the photometric data of the last Pyramid of Giza he notices something unusual about how the sides of manori were built they seem slightly curved inwards when we do a horizontal cross-section we notice that all four sides seem concave now if I move the cross-section from bottom to top we see that this is not even at the very bottom we don we go upwards the bend becomes more and more obvious the accuracy of the images lets us see something very difficult to perceive with the naked eye namely that the sides of the pyramids are slightly bent inwards but our expert believes that it has nothing to do with the construction there saying that there was a deliberate intent by the builders to create a pyramid like this meaning a pyramid with eight sides instead of four it theory now during the Middle Ages pory workers used blocks from the casings of the Giza Pyramids they removed them and let them slide down the sides of the building so they could be used in building Cairo so the process of detaching the blocks and letting them slide down may have also damaged the pyramid this series of blocks being detached from the top may have ended up causing furrows on the sides of the pyramids also during the Middle Ages the sultan Osman Bay ordered the digging of the famous split on the North side hoping to discover the entrance to the pyramid but it century that the real entrance will be discovered by an English Explorer it located much below less than four meters above the ground it leads to a narrow Corridor that goes down to a first chamber it Motif the door doesn this is the first time you have decoration inside and under the pyramid since the time of joser just beyond this you have a port culla slab that boom is lowered down in a slot and that would have closed the pyramid uh um that would have been the second line of defense the first line of defense presumably would have been the outer casing and the plugging of the uh passageway Manor copied the security system used by kufu for his burial chamber a pullus brought down by pulley Beyond this system lies another horizontal Corridor leading to another room much bigger this time so we come at the end of a horizontal passage to this rather spacious rectangular room cut completely out of the natural rock and many think this is the first burial chamber of Mare and you know it case now there at the bottom of a second sloping passage but people think this is the original burial chamber because there a socket at the Western end of the chamber in a kind of Niche just right for a sarcophagus this is Manor characteristic the funeral system has nothing in common with the classic Model of caffra quite the opposite actually it how it all fits together images from photogrametry prove very useful when we dimensions or how everything is organized but here a quick glance is enough to understand here the first Chambers and the various rooms leading to the Vault these images will help us study how the various rooms are organized because they from each other The Ensemble of burial Chambers and passageways do get simpler through time but here they experimenting they mind still they seem to have decided on a second burial chamber in Granite um and uh yeah the photogrametry captures that complexity yet what for egyptologist in menor system is that no sarcophagus has been found in the first major burial chamber despite the fact everything seemed to have been prepared for it it compelling that this is a socket for a sarcophagus it here the corner is cut away and this is a lever socket so that they probably with a big wooden lever kept the sarcophagus a little bit up so they could adjust it and then only when they had it in its perfect position could they let the lever down and boom lower the sarcophagus into this socket yes it looks like they did all the preparations for the sarcophagus and yet they changed their mind somebody changed their mind maybe the king because they prepared yet another chamber further to the West and so the Builders of the pyramid prepared a space for a sarcophagus before giving it up but vasil DV doesn believe in a change of plan rather he thinks this is a trick Menor is trying to deceive he created some kind of chamber in the beginning which is supposed to be the burial chamber and it burial chamber during mcor pyramids have been desecrated already and we found items that should have been in kufu burial chamber inside menor chamber there was kufu name on them so we clearly see how meori is trying to trick thieves into believing that this is the burial chamber while the real deal lies Beyond did it work that remains to be seen the real burial chamber of Mori the one that should have sheltered the embalmed body of the Pharaoh should therefore be located at the end of the long Corridor going down from the first chamber Mark laner is leading us there so the final burial chamber where mare was probably laid to rest is this beautifully polished at one time polished Granite chamber at the end of the passage system in order to build the 17 Square chamber in Granite the builders probably carve the stones directly on the spot it room after they put the blocks in place they put the blocks in place with the outer faces rough and UNS smooth and then they literally sculpted the room out of the rough Granite that get about 1 cm of this Stone turning the corner or 1 cm of this Stone turning the corner but Against All Odds there currently no tomb in this chamber however when explorers first came in during the 19th century there was indeed a sarcophagus what sarcophagus was discovered during the 19th century and taken away by the Explorers they decided discreetly to take it out of the pyramid and bring it to England unfortunately the boat car caring them back to England sank and the sarcophagus disappeared in the Mediterranean Sea before losing it explorers had been able to look inside the sarcophagus it was empty but a closer analysis could perhaps have shed some light on the mysteries of the pyramids today despite tremendous progress due to promising Technologies such as photogrametry many secrets are left unsolved on the Giza Plateau one of Egypt sites the coming years we more discoveries because the Giza Plateau hasn there are many Mysteries left things to discover and so we hope that the current research and the research of the future will bring us new elements to help us understand how the great pyramids were built although others believe that the my iies surrounding the pyramids are precisely what has been Fascinating People for more than 4,500 years [Music]	Success
Amsterdam's Revolutionary Water Engineering: Scientific Techniques Explained | SLICE SCIENCE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFIcboRNn2k	SLICE Science	this defense strategy took full effect in Zealand the region devastated by the storm of 1953 seen from the sky it looks like lace the water is everywhere to defend themselves against it the Dutch erected some impressive DBS in 1979 a huge construction of Earth and steel was created the Oster Shadel heing or the Eastern Shelt storm surge barrier was the first Super structure to be built after the storm of 1953 it took 26 years for this unprecedented technological innovation to see the light of day this 9 km long barrage located between two islands has 62 steel sliding doors each weighing 480 tons these 62 barriers which separate the North Sea from the Eastern Shelt River have come down 27 times since the barrier went into operation each of the doors weighs the same as 15 heavy trucks and they are lowered as soon as the swell exceeds 3 m on 27 occasions they have fended off Coastal surges like that seen in 1953 [Music] it has protected our uh country from floods from the sea already for two generations and so it will remain a very essential part of our flood defense strategy once the south of the country was secured this extraordinary plan to protect the country then turned to Amsterdam country capital the biggest port in Europe 80% of the city of Rotterdam is located below sea level Rotterdam may have made its Fortune from water but at the same time it risks perishing from it too in the north and in the South everywhere the water could come in had to be blocked to prevent flooding the rivers are the enemy to be fought and the first defense is the Haring fleets a spectacular construction that regulates the Waters of the m and the Ry the two rivers that flow through Rotterdam as soon as the water level gets too high and threatens to flood the city the 17 openings in this Dam are activated and the river water is dispatched into the North Sea this 5 km long Dam also serves as a four-lane [Music] Motorway the budget given over to this project and the money still granted to maintain it are quite phenomenal since its implementation the Delta plan has served as a military strategy constantly pushing the technological limits and its centerpiece is the most prodigious superstructure ever seen in the world [Music] the marlot caring built in the 1990s its purpose is to protect the city from storms located at the entrance to the port of Rotterdam this mobile Dam protects more than 3 and A2 million inhabitants along with the commercial activity of the eighth largest port in the world this hydraulic structure was completed in 1997 and is the largest mobile structure in the world at 420 M long the equivalent to the length of four soccer fields end to end and 20 M High its designers have planned for all eventualities to prevent such a system from breaking in the event of a major storm they left a slight opening between the doors when they close this breach prevents the dam from breaking when water flows in hard and fast so about 3 m or 3 M50 above the mean sea level and a storm surge with a certain force wind Force 11 or 12 then it is decided to close the dam twice this unrivaled example of technological prowess has proven its effectiveness during the storm of November 2007 and the North Sea storm in January 2018 water levels reached record levels the authorities decided to close the dam and manag to avoid the worst for the people living over there at around 3.2 m above sea level it very important for the dam to close in time to avoid their houses being flooded for Europe country challenge is to keep the threat as far away as possible in order to ensure the greatest possible protection from the water the marlant caring has a partner construction with which it works in tandem the harle caring barrier is located a little further in land it works like a guillotine and wasn included in the Delta plan but since the 1990s climate predictions have made it indispensable this impressive 98 M long Mobile Dy is mounted on three pillars each of its doors is suspended at a height of 14 m above the canal comparable to a five-story building since 1997 the closing system has been used twice simultaneously with the mass slant caring barrier but this is a very gradual process and we monitor this very closely uh how this will evolve because Safety First today the Netherlands seem to be fully protected by its anti-flood Weaponry just like Amsterdam it is permanently monitored to keep the threat at [Music] Bay but behind their incredible technological prowess the Dutch live with danger every day they have profoundly transformed their territory and it is very tightly controlled the aim is to have total control over the entire system which no longer has anything natural about it as such we disaster rather we system failure that is due to this vision of having total control over nature in this artificial country nature is like a machine in which humans control every car and living in a machine like Holland means that you have to update upgrade your machine every 30 40 50 years 50 years ago we thought that we were finished for the next 500 years and now we know that we have to upgrade it that the the levies that we have the poers that we have are not enough to keep Holland dry for the next Century Innovation and Ingenuity can never stop here because there are so many dangers facing the Netherlands in addition to Rising water levels river floods and storms another major problem that is nibbling away at the Netherlands is one of coastal erosion this is one of the first consequences of rising sea levels the June subside and then disappear and The Disappearance of these mountains of sand is endangering the land behind the coast indeed the Junes are the first line of protection against high waters they act as natural ramparts without them flooding would be unavoidable and the Dutch have come up with a unique kind of vessel to reinforce them the xand motor the idea is simple sand is gathered from the seabed and then sprayed in a continuous stream back onto the coast this strengthens the coastal Junes which then protect the rest of the country what makes the xand motor so unique is that it uses the energy of ocean currents to bring the sand to the June and the natural movement of the tides to stabilize it this amazing system which is based on natural processes does however have certain consequences for the [Music] environment it dredges the sand from the ocean floor but the ocean floor is basin shaped so when you pump the sand from here the sand on the coast collapses and falls back down to the seabed and they keep trying to put it back here but when you keep doing that it keeps falling this process is currently being used in the ha to protect the coastline some 20 million cubic meters have been pumped to create the equivalent of 256 soccer fields of Junes and beaches this project is called the June Delta the xand motor to technology may eventually prove to be harmful to the country and its inhabitants by constantly having to find solutions to the problem of living in inhospitable territory the Dutch could end up having to leave this land perhaps the solution for staying safe in Amsterdam actually involves living on the water instead the latest architectural creation is these floating houses in the isberg district on the outskirts of Amsterdam this suburb is composed of seven artificial islands and houses that float we see it as a technical solution uh which is very safe it has the exact same comfort and and aspects as normal house the only thing sometimes we call it a boat because of regulations and sometimes we call it the house of regulations so we think about more flexible cities how can we use the water to be responsive to react on on everything that to be ready for a unexpected future for the moment these floating homes are among Architects preferred means of adapting to the rising water levels that are one of the biggest challenges currently facing the country the houses are supported by floating concrete tanks immersed in the water the rest of the construction is made of light Steel steel and wooden panels which allow for a traditional layout inside the houses are anchored to the bottom of the lake with steel moing posts to stop them drifting but here again there is a flip side that must be taken into account behind the idilic image of life on the water these floating houses are already posing some ecological problems as always technological innovation disrupts ecosystems these houses resting on concrete tanks make the water surface opaque this lack of light causes Aquatic Life To Die faced with this new problem engineers and Architects have had to propose new Solutions such as houses on stilts the most important thing is that if we start building on water it above the water but it also underneath the water we call this blue habitats and if I go to a city the first question they ask what is the effect on the ecology on the water system so we built artificial uh corals underneath it we bring enough water light and and air in it and by that we can influence the system uh that means that if you or the middle of a sea we can create these buildings and they start to be as catalst functions for creating new ecosystems around it but is this floating Home Solution enough to cope with the major upheavals awaiting the Netherlands in 100 years entire regions of the Netherlands will most likely be wiped off the map due to rising sea levels caused by melting glassiers combined with Coastal erosion and land subsidence the entire Western facade of the country as well as the Inland areas to the south and west of Amsterdam could be completely erased and submerged by water despite all their inventiveness and technicality the Dutch May no longer be able to find land for shelter living in such a vulnerable country that means that if there water and more climate change we probably have to leave our country because if we do nothing if we just keep them as it is if we don levies higher if we don to be floating then we will be the first to leave float or leave this is the Dilemma caused by climate change that is facing the Dutch once again they will have to come up with an answer armed with their knowledge of water management there are are extreme scenarios and I also believe that then um within the country we could do great things if you think of uh our response and reconstruction after the second world war then uh a population can do a lot in a short time when the need is there and the Dutch are proving this to be true right now a unique project on a gigantic scale is in development the idea is to build a wall to hold hold back the sea it involves a truly colossal Dam that would close the North Sea in two places two gigantic walls would have to be built in the middle of the [Music] sea the first some 500 km long would connect the Scottish Coast with Norway the second 150 km long would extend from the southern tip of the UK to the coast of [Music] Britany this outlandish project would protect 25 million people from the risk of [Music] submersion for the time being this project is not the subject of a political and economic debate on a European level it is an alarm Bell being rung by Dutch scientists to raise awareness about government in action on climate change but once again the impact of such a construction would be immense this Dam on an unimaginable scale would transform the North Sea into a freshwater lake such extensive modifications of an existing ecosystem would irreversibly disturb the surrounding ocean currents in including the famous Gulf Stream it is this ocean current that ensures mild Winters across Europe without the Gulf Stream every country in Europe including the Netherlands might then experience winters like those enjoyed in Siberia the problem is that when you build a wall you think you protected but it same you carry on expanding creating building behind the wall because you think it you and that about you try to resist and protect yourself but if the wall or the Dyke were to be breached well you can imagine the scale of the disaster that would [Music] ensue the risk of a technical failure is huge one only has to imagine the amount of water that would be held back by these two dams and if a breach were to occur the flooding of the entire Coastline would be a catastrophe for which no one could ever be prepared now evacuation of let region of Rotterdam the Haag our capital and Amsterdam within 24 hours it impossible millions of people evacuate out of that area so uh the evacuation plan is also to get people to Higher Ground so our evacuation is more a vertical evacuation than a horizontal evacuation and the first region that might risk being wiped off the map is flol land the suburb of Amsterdam this immense poer this land reclaimed from the sea is today the area most at risk 400,000 people live and work here a population comparable to that of Manchester or Miami is it is absolutely necessary to ensure its safety it a societal choice that must be made and that know that sea levels are going to rise by two or 3 meters but we don when we have to make the right political decisions now which won future this is our duty the example of flavo land the newest and most endangered province is leading the Dutch to change their attitudes at a time of climate change a new environmental Consciousness is emerging encouraging them to give up on the idea of more growth today Society values the natural system and nature much more and is hence in favor of leaving it as it is we have to listen to Nature we have to live with water and we have to follow nature and then see what we can do with that only fight against it that doesn anymore we should understand what the water is doing what nature is doing and then make the best of it the time has come to return artificially created land to the Sea depolarization is the new choice of the Dutch authorities to protect the country from danger reclaiming land this practice that has been carried out for centuries has under the effect of climate change had a negative effect hiding behind a dyke there is a growing awareness of the risks but I also think that on schools they don how this country works because if you would talk to just somebody here on the street they say yes we know we are have polers and we know we live below sea level but they don active system if you water out we will we will drown [Music]	Success
Fighting Sahara Desertification: The Green Wall Project | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlzABuM9-dw	SLICE Science	[Music] the world fertile land is Vanishing swallowed up by the desert Africa has felt the full force of this in a century the Sahara has moved South by 250 km over a front of 6,000 km the land has become sterile and the population has had to [Music] flee in the 1950s there was nothing here like that the June was 300 M off this land was all cultivated now you can see the June it palm in Morocco and Sagal a stubborn and decisive struggle is being fought against desertification the ecological barrier between the great desert and the Mediterranean that makes them of global ecological importance if this ecosystem is ever destroyed the desertification will move north and affect all of Europe we must win back Land from the desert the objective is to reconquer 87,500 hectares of land to do that we decided to build a great green wall putting in place 1.7 million to 2 million plants every year to retake strips of desert [Music] the Sahara immense extends over the territory of 10 states from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea in the north it reaches the Mediterranean and in the South it is bordered by the Sahel a semiarid region that then becomes tropical Africa the Sahara wasn inhospitable desert in the mountain range of enidy in Northern Chad Eve gotier once a research director for the cnrs is listing the rock art sites that tell of a very different past from today once the Sahara wasn we see it to be now during the hollene epoch 6 to 8,000 years ago the climate was much more humid and some people even talk of a green Sahara well it probably wasn more probably it was a savannah with a lot of animal life but it certainly wasn yes it see it there are some fine things at the sight of this petrified landscape it was once a verdant Eden a magnificent Savannah with many trees where Wildlife was varied and plentiful [Music] this is one of about 800 shelters I found in an edti and the walls display a message you see the presence of cattle which shows these people were [Music] herders there we can see Hunters yes we can see their quite clearly but what we can add is that while they were animal Farmers they were also always hunters for their arrows they seem to have used arrow heads of this type you see there are several examples which come mainly from deserts from different Sahar and countries morania Libya Algeria and sometimes they huge numbers which shows how important hunting was at the time they hunted all kinds of animals including elephants orox small antelopes and even Birds this shows that the desert was occupied for thousands of years practically continually this is in Striking contrast to the present situation where the Sahara is all but deserted if someone had said to the people who lived here just a few thousand years ago which is as much as to say yesterday that the region would become a desert of stone and sand it safe bet they wouldn but the desert is there and it is AB dancing the pens which are around us like this one are scattered around A prometer unlikely hypothesis is that the herders settled here at a time when the lake surrounded the promary like a peninsula it proved but what we can imagine and what these pens certainly show is that the people were herders but their way of life included fishing they used the Lake as well as the cattle to feed themselves the cave paintings show in drawings the daily life led by the people who painted them in red ochre there are portraits of their game animals descriptions of their hunts if Eve gotier has found fishing scenes these prove that there were many lakes in this region of the ancient Sahara Hassan you take the right and I work H wow that great one two small boats and a hippo h a bit more to the left there that perfect in this cave sheltered the fishermen and their small boats drawn on the rock it in this shelter today especially when we look around at this totally arid context 8 to 10,000 years ago the lake was much larger you can see here that it came some distance a few hundred M from here but that 20 times bigger than it is now here on the iPad there satellite images which show clearly how Lake Chad has changed since the 19 and you can see as the images progress how the lake shrinks do you think the lake will just go will it disappear yes well you see if the climate continues to get warmer like we in a decade or two the lake will have completely vanished do you think Chad will be entirely desert well unfortunately we fear that if the climate continues to develop in the way it the southern part of Chad will become a [Music] desert some experts predict that if Lake Chad disappears the whole region will look like this 20 million people will have to move into Exile several thousand kilometers from there in the Northwest the Great Lakes which feed the oases of Southern Morocco are as well drying up [Music] who [Music] 1250 here we the Great Lakes is found and which was once full of water it was between 3 and 5 m deep where I now sitting now it drought and especially evaporation meteorological forecasts for this part of Morocco predict an increase in temperatures between 0.6 and 1° C so that rise is an additional pressure upon water resources which are already precarious and in a fragile state [Music] [Applause] [Music] desert rains are unpredictable not a drop will fall for months sometimes for several years and suddenly a deluge will fall for [Music] hours the lake is now 100% full that thanks to the three last floods that the lake is full up to this level but I took a photo before that here I it and the lake was dry 3 days of torrential rain have refilled the lake do you see where it goes to it filled the lake in some regions of the Sahara the rains are so violent that they lead to dramatic events in December 2014 more rain fell here in a few hours than normally Falls in an entire year the Wy brutally burst their Banks and more than 30 people were carried away and drowned it caused hundreds of millions of Euros of material damage thousands of houses were destroyed roads were cut and the electricity Network severely damaged This calamity struck an area where resources are rare all year long Southern Morocco suffers from chronic thirst and when the long awaited rains finally arrive it disaster this water which could have been providential was lost and served no purpose other than to create fresh Ravens in a landscape that had already [Music] [Music] suffered over the last few years a number of rainwater reservoirs have been built to create Reserves 400 km of additional channels have been added to the existing thousand km recovering all available water and giving it to the population is decisive for the survival of the Oasis for some of them it is already too late professor Lassen kabiri has come to the ruin of the Oasis where he grew up there were date palms at least 15 M high it was all densely green here with thousands of date palms women everywhere and children playing I was born here it was my palm Gro in the recent past nearly 200 families lived here and harvested dates the palm trees have died of thirst life has died out and the desert has won again because they all tried to go It Alone the farmers have dug their own grave and one of the 200 Wells which were dug here in the Palm Grove and which pumped water each one for intensive farming to start with that worked there was water and then it ran out here you can see the roots of the date palm which sort out the groundwater motorized pumping drained the groundwater so automatically the Day pal will die [Music] the chain of oases formed a barrier which for a long time stopped the [Music] desert the loss of Traditional Values of mutual Aid combined with a lack of water led to the end of a number of oases the barrier fell and the desert swept through the breaches [Music] Mohammed buadi project coordinator for the Southern Oasis program has made some alarming findings how did this happen first there was the drought then the sand came you see the palm trees are dead they before before the dates were plentiful there was water and we lived well how many people were living here at the start of the there are four where did they go to they went to work at agader the big towns [Music] you this school in the students now you see there are only four in this house there are still people living the others are all empty as you can see there one left in the village and this house no one in that one the same for that one that one they gone the decline of the Southern oases was also caused by the abandonment of ancestral irrigation techniques used in desert areas of North Africa and the Middle East the first Oasis dwellers found their water in the melting snow of the Atlas Mountains by building networks of underground drainage channels called Katara with without maintenance many of these channels blocked up and now the water from the Atlas Mountains doesn arrive Professor mmed Madan is actively campaigning for the repair of the irrigation system just where we are here there field of Kara of over 12 kilm you can even see it by satellite these ketas were dug several centuries ago and allowed the irrigation of the Palm Groves below them most of these underground channels were dug three centuries ago go the oldest are over 3,000 years old if they are regularly cleaned and Consolidated where necessary they still irrigate Parcels of [Music] land these cones are Earth which has been pulled out of the underground drainage Gallery this happens during the digging and cleaning of the gallery and they also allow Iration and sunlight to penetrate during Collective work of cleaning and these Earth Wells are access points and irration vents the K system was abandoned in several places for several reasons not just the natural effect of drought but also through human factors like urbanization there pumping and also young people who no longer wish to work in the ancestral system as well as that sand clogged up the catchment zones these channels are the underground foundations of the rampart raised against the desert the sand has to be cleaned out of the K the stones need to be removed and the aeration Wells reopened which is what we Villages we work started 3 days ago and it well about 18 M descending over 18 m in a well that is only one meter wide is impressive Len prefers to let mmed Madan who is used to this lead the [Music] way just here there of water but when there the water can get up to here about the height of a man here if there are floods or rains the water can rise back to its usual [Music] level this work was done with rudimentary tools they didn Dynamite or explosives just picks and shovels like they did before and this goes on for it goes on for 3 and2 km the objective of my research is to convince the farmers and the Oasis dwellers to maintain this system and get water without attacking nature it adapted to the Oasis System adapted to the climate and adapted to work because it right to irrigation water each farmer has water rights when their rights are Jew they open their stream to irrigate their field and when their right is up they close the stream so as to pass rights onto the next farmer so an oasis is part of an ecosystem of which the DAT Palm forms the main structure it plays the role of sun shade in relation to all the other plantations which it protects during the day from the Sun the other plants capture humidity which they give up during the night to the date pal a date pal produces over 100 tons of vegetation during its life this material forms humus which is vital to cultivation it also produces 25 kilos of dates collected by the women sugar Rich fruit which contain many vitamins and mineral salts it also offers wood for building and for wicker work finally it provides a magnificent sun shade in the shade of which all the other plants grow this is a field of lucern these are red peppers that cabbages carrots and turnips traditional oases were places for subsistence farming survival level farming which had a role a few decades ago but nowadays the young people of the South don other perspective than a difficult existence with low [Music] income the rise in popularity of the Caper which had fallen from favor as a condiment recent interest for argan oil used in cosmetics the revaluing of barbery figs or the honey of wild bees as well as the fashion for organic henna and modern irrigation techniques open up New Perspectives [Music] in order for people to stay in the Oasis they must develop a market economy it not like before when they work just to survive right now farmers are developing products with added value so as to earn money and to remain here otherwise people will leave their Oasis and the desert will move in nowadays the Oasis are cultivating a lot of organic henna and irrigating with drip feed systems which are costly to install but economic to use true that hen is a plant that uses a lot of water but we compromise between a product which sells well and the available water in the OAS how are you price is good this year they better the last two years prices have risen between 50 and 60% in spite of its high price organic henna is more and more sought after in cosmetics to make skin Beautiful by softening it for cleaning the skin dying hair or to decorate hands and feet with temporary tattoos Oasis dwellers have understood that to survive they must cultivate acclimatized plants which have a niche market convinced by this efficient strategy Coastal oases are developing barbery fig farming which is also an attractive product here we worth the journey it mountain with a real ocean of greenery right in the middle of the desert on the other hand to get to this it isn easy in the center of the desert there less than 100 mm of rainfall a year but there cactus captures humidity from the air which comes from the sea the sea is 20 km away humidity Rises and comes here the cactus has tiny pores which can open and these allow the cactus to suck in the water today this unloved plant with a terrible reputation is being rediscovered as a present from nature and we still don know everything it can bring us with this Cactus you can really do anything because firstly it can use it to cook with and it has enormous potential as animal fodder as for the fruit there are a lot of interesting things for human nutrition jams and nectar can be made and you can eat the fruit the cactus is also precious because of its mineral content there anti-aging properties the plantations are multiplying as the virtues of the barbery Fig become known because of this Cactus entire areas of previously sterile Hills are becoming [Music] green is it because of the cactus that all these plants are growing back yes in this place there was nothing it was like the hill in front but when we put the cactus here at the forest regr this plant wasn it beside it is swell dmos and when you plant Cactus as it spreads out it gives shade to other plants so they proliferate around it and when you have plants you get animal life a whole chain a whole ecosystem appears where there was nothing bringing plants to the coastal area of Southern Morocco is vital immense quantities of sand thrown up by rivers and streams are left by the ocean on the shore the sand carried by the wind blowing in from offshore creates the Junes which feed the desert there are Junes like this one which have moved three 100 km from the coast to the desert over thousands of years in the far south of Morocco the coastal town of tfaya is at the center of one of the most powerful wind systems of the Sahara the ocean winds join with the Winds of the desert and form giant Junes with bases of more than 800 m in diameter the Junes can be divided into two types these huge Junes which are rare and are called Mega bans which move between 3 and 6 M every year and these little Dunes which move 25 to 30 m a year the little Dunes shaped like a cresant moon can join up and form a chain known as an G the migration of sand from the coast to the interior is so strong that the coastal road is often submerged traffic has to Halt you can see that National route one has been covered by sand that sign poost is completely buried this is the rest of the road covered by sand the coastal road is vital for the South every morning digging machines go back to work at an endless task many dwellings at TF have been invaded their doors are blocked their door frames stuck the walls themselves attacked the sand affects all of the town [Music] infrastructure a few hundred kilometers to the Northwest the town of mamed close to the Algerian border is trying desperately to survive the onslaught which has already destroyed half of its houses like many of his neighbors sliman has had to move several times to escape being [Music] [Applause] [Music] buried there were people here before the sand buried the houses and they had to move this is the house where we used to live this was the room where we slept this was the kitchen through there the staircase and this was the way in this was the front door of the house the sound has buried everything there these rooms people try to escape but the sand catches up at mamid the wind is a little less violent than a tapaya but it blows more than 300 days every year this house may collapse because of the storms the people are scared so they tent it takes two days of storm for the sand to get to here here just two days the sand wind follows us from down there right up to here that the whole village is under threat these sandstorms will end up by forcing us all to leave this is the door of San house how long will he be able to live here the sand has followed us here it invades where we live it follows us everywhere the sand has blocked my door we can away every day but the sand has beaten us many places have become ghost towns a rain of sand falls night and day stif all Life The Villages drown one by one and the desert advances inexorably submerging [Music] everything a technique known as palm squares has proved effective in front of a zone that needs to be protected fences of Palms planted in a square are placed in the direction from which the dominant Wind Blows the Palms reduce wind speed without causing whirlwinds and stop the sand which is carried to ground level Falls and then gathers there before reaching the protected Zone The Sound advances 19 M every year against this Invasion there are two methods which work here we fight using Palm squares with the leaves of date palms but these squares can only resist for 10 years besides that we try to plant Tamaris using ceramic pots because the pot retains humidity and so the cuting can grow to form a large tree which will stop the sand like that we are making a green belt which will resist longer maintaining the Palm squares needs a lot of Labor and when returns from agriculture are small The Oasis dwellers give up at the architectural School of rabbit architect Carlos Perez Mata is looking for an alternative here we to hold back the sand whether it be corrugated panels wooden Stakes with Nets Palms even Earth walls we that these Solutions offered by agricultural Engineers don work up till now the sand has overcome every obstacle placed in its way but caros Perez Maran hasn up the objective is to establish a system with barricades placed on the terrain with a rounded form so as to adapt to the shape of the Junes on a giant scale this giant scale will also allow us to put apartments inside since the Junes rise to 7 or 8 m will need three-story buildings with very narrow alleys and small patios this is just to protect against the [Music] Heat like everywhere else industrially produced breeze blocks easy and quick to put in place have replaced traditional construction techniques the the architect inspired by the old buildings by using Earth to benefit from the shade of the palm trees the dwellings should be put back in the heart of the Palm grve as they once [Music] were this kind of urbanization is nothing new it living in a Palm Grove living inside is always more pleasant than living outside where the Palms provide no protection [Music] a field of small barken Dunes very like those which threaten the oases offers an ideal site to test under real conditions we reduced barriers with a rounded Earth wall so that we can see how the June behaves this allows us to study whether the June will really stop or move off to one side and finally if we could construct Living Spaces inside it [Music] our architect Magnus Larson proposed working with bacteria to solidify the grains of sand once they we can start to work from an architectural point of view so that we can make a living space for people [Music] [Applause] [Music] at Taya the local authorities have launched a last chance program [Music] here at taaya 800,000 tons of sand come from the ocean and fall on the town every year you see here the wall which was built to stop the sand it needs to be six met high before this wall was here the sand caused health and breathing problems for the population to stabilize the sand we use plants which adapt well to The Climate here and what plants are you using 90% of TAA 155,000 hectares have already been planted the TAA must survive winds over over 50 kilom can you give me an idea of how old these trees are these trees are about 3 years old and they M High thanks to this we reduce sand encroachment of the Town infrastructure by 80% the project is to double Plantation surface every 2 years but the cost is so high as to be Out Of Reach for the very poor Southern oases does this mean giving up before the desert the pan-african great green wall project to stop drying up of the Sahel was launched in 2005 it meant to reforest a 15 km wide band from jibou in the North of Sagal over a length of 7,600 KM up until now only Sagal has really committed itself to this huge project the sahal zone is an intensive mobile grazing territory for vast herds of cattle sheep and goats in the dry season the animals graze the little grass that subsists while waiting for regrowth in the rainy season which only lasts 2 months the soil completely bare has no [Music] protection well here you are the seasonal problem a month ago everything was dry no grass the ground was cracked and very dry one night of rain and the way is blocked the road Paradox of desert areas [Music] the violence of the rainstorms might fool us but in fact the amount of rain that falls annually is low sometimes very low the rain falls on hot ground which increases evaporation finally like in South Morocco the rain RF is very [Music] irregular in some Villages large reservoirs have been built to recover the rainwater in the dry season these are supplied by Wells which reach the groundwater but there are far from enough of these today there but a few months ago there were 40 or so come to get water to supply all the villages it after six months of recording and then there the landscape and the environment 6 months of a totally desert environment and then after the rain of these last few days the landscape becomes completely verdant the rainy season is the only time during which the great green wall can be extended these are plants that don watered they have to be planted when it late and we have a lot of area to cover in a month we should have finished planting the area plant these young trees very tender are Delicacies for the herds and all the animals want to eat them this Barb Wire is to protect the plantations we where there are thousands of head of cattle without the fencing they on anything that was planted it only herders practically no Farmers these are herders who are becoming more and more sedentary half of them live all around the parcels of land it because they know they the dry season when grass becomes rare there you can find something for the animal The Zone was relatively arid with Advanced deforestation when you think what it was like 5 years ago when we started up and you look at it now and see what it become It [Music] encouraging now we have to plant a distance of 545 km that 545 km won just be one plant after another we plant them in groves this is ACAA neotica we planted all kinds of ACAA this year 1.72 million plants that here we are in one of the oldest plantations making up the great green wall after 8 years we have plantations of this type of tree which is particularly adapted to Drought conditions these trees were also chosen because they population for example acaia Sagal which makes acaia gum which is used in Pharmaceuticals as well as other trees like the banites which the local people use for medicine or food these properties make the local populations conserve the plantations in the long term overall the herders have respected the enclosures even if here and there starving cattle have made a few holes in the fence traditional burn-offs to encourage regrowth have been forbidden a fire break has been made around each parcel thus protected the ecosystem is reborn migrating birds return in masses particularly in the rainy [Music] [Music] season about 20% of the trees planted don percentage in an arid Reg [Music] the great green wall agency has seven nurseries where thousands of trees await planting however scientists would like to improve the resistance of the young plants they experiments which have already worked in Laboratories here are the acaas which are due to be planted on the site of the great green wall to help them to grow and adapt to a Rel ly hostile environment in a few months where they won water for 10 months we part now it them to resist these adverse conditions for the 10 months to come the mushroom that we eat is only the visible part its filaments develop under the ground over very large areas the mushroom as it develops will establish a sort of web in the soil which allows a liazon and interaction between different plants trees and herbaceous plants are more easily able to exchange nutrients between different sorts of plants right now however the use of the mushroom is limited to a few Parcels of land and in the short term our objective is to produce enough of these mushrooms industrially to use them on a large scale over large sections of the great green wall right we plants from these two lots treated with the preliminary tests have shown that plant mushroom symbiosis multiplies the survival rate of young trees by four now the experiments are facing the challenge of the field a lot of herders have settled in the areas around the great green wall forest rangers work with them to recruit the labor force they occasionally need and to collect information especially about what they feel this project started here eight years ago do you find things are positive or negative what I want to pass on is that I project offers work for several months and you leave behind your sheep and goats and donkeys you work hard and at the end of the month you then this goes on for five or six months is there any point in working if you say you haven it treasury other people and other projects have used it but when the money comes in you paid in spite of recurrent funding problems which have upset payments of promised wages the herders have become more sedentary over the last few years those who are nomadic come back to the country in the rainy season hering products are still an essential part of local resources at the market of weo held every Tuesday goats sheep and cattle are sold [Applause] while the great green wall has been built to hold back the sand the intention is also to fight against poverty and diversify Revenue sources for the local population the creation of gardens [Music] helps these spaces are reserved for women who use them for Market gardening and haic culture they gain revenue from that and that diversifies work already they say it habits it before in some areas because they mic the children can when we started to act here people started to settle down and the school which was here reopened because the young people who once moved the animals for grazing stay here the great green wall show me what good okay children what isn desert desert fire no water those working on the great green wall are not limiting themselves to restoring the ecosystem they taking care of people this is not just an ecological project the great green wall will have an impact in transforming the environment which will have an effect on health for example in providing a much more diverse and rich food supply that is much better for today the other hand with the water that will come along with the wall we could have infectious diseases developing The Observatory run by Anthropologist Jill Butch records changes anticipates problems and measures the efficiency of health and sanitation action in the field in this notebook we have the figures over 3 years of the frequency of malaria we can see a very big fall thanks to the release of impregnated mosquito is absolutely exemplary since it managed to link the agency which plants the trees and the scientists which monitor all the modifications which come with that perhaps it is the only Pioneer and the others have difficulty following this example but it has to be said that the sahal is a war zone and I think that starting from senagal we will convince the others to build this great green wall we edge in the S we have to ensure that desertification doesn lands of the S and that we whole population of an area on the Move we have to try something to keep them in place and that challenge The Oasis program in Morocco and the great green wall of senagal show that The Retreat of fertile land can be stopped it conquering lost ground but fighting to ensure that reconquered desert land is viable this fight is everyone if it is lost millions of climate refugees will swell the desperate crowds beating on the doors of Europe [Music]	Success
2017's Most Devastating Natural Disasters | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXBhOshvtiY	SLICE Science	[Music] the year 2017 will be remembered by many as a year of extremes local weather anomalies caused massive flooding and mudslides in South [Music] America wildfires spread across Aid lands consuming forests leveling buildings and causing unprecedented loss of life in Europe and America two deadly earthquakes struck Mexico in separate locations just weeks apart it was incredible we thought it was the end and a series of record-breaking hurricanes battered the Caribbean one after another in an onslaught of Devastation it wasn the devil you hear it roaring you know like a like a train coming or something eyewitnesses describe what happened while experts explain the science behind these events clearly the biggest headlines are going to be for for three significant hurricanes in the Atlantic Harvey Irma Maria but we significant events very bad wildfires it heat waves have led to Wildfire and then we flood events too the year 2017 was notable for a wide range of natural disasters every year catastrophes cause loss of life around the globe but in 2017 a large number of people died as a result of an unexpected tragedy after suffering a long dry period California was a Tinder Box ready to ignite in October conditions were such that no one was surprised when a series of wildfires flared up throughout several counties in the north of the state drought dry Fuel and high winds caused the fires to spread rapidly moving from Wilderness to Urban centers overnight hundreds of separate fires were reported and firefighters were unable to contain them as they blazed out of control destroying everything in their path the fire residential areas shocked riskmanagement experts like Robert newwood the in a Wildland fire typically the fuel of the fire is the vegetation and the trees the eucalyptus trees the pine trees but in California one of these fires in October actually moved into into a city and and the fuel was the houses themselves so the fuel was the wooden houses quite densely packed burning and we lost 5,000 houses in in one fire the California fire is changed the way experts viewed wildfires until 2017 it was Unthinkable that a fire could spread so rapidly and caused so much damage in an urban landscape but these extraordinary blazes changed all preconceived notions about how forest fires could spread more than a million acres of land were destroyed at least 41 people were killed and the economic cost could be close to $6 billion earlier in the year Europe had also witnessed a ferocious fatal fire early in the summer of 2017 the Iberian Peninsula was sweltering in a searing Heatwave with temperatures often above 100° F on the 17th of June for reasons that still have not been confirmed 156 fires erupted in the Pedro GA gandi area in central Portugal spreading dramatically and creating a firestorm what is clear is that hotter drier summers are setting off more forest fires accelerating the ongoing migration from rural areas leaving lands untended that in turn fuels new and more intense fires as the fires rapidly spread rural inhabitants like Leandro barata had to make quick decisions about how to react to the encroaching Flames well I was having a rest when I heard a helicopter and voices I got up and saw the fire straight away the fire was 300 M from the village the bushes were burning the fire was burning everything in its path grap Vines and the houses were in danger a lack of infrastructure and communication problems meant inhabitants were frequently left to their own devices and the area was plunged into chaos and confusion [Music] 1,600 Portuguese firefighters fought an intense battle against the Flames that spread faster than they could be subdued the region is known for its extensive Pine forests but invasive eucalyptus trees proved particularly dangerous they contain a highly flammable sap that explodes in extreme heat causing the fires to spread and intensify go [Music] [Music] firefighting aircraft from neighboring France and Spain dropped tons of water onto the blazes in a bid to bring them under control the area has experienced wildfires before but never on this scale [Music] [Music] as the fires took hold destroying vegetation and approaching Villages many inhabitants found themselves trapped in their homes Luchia Pera was one of them here it was h it was an absolute hell at 6:00 in the evening both fires joined together there are no words to describe what happened here yesterday it first time in my life that I can remember a situation like that we were completely surrounded people outside said that the Flames passed over the top of the roof from one side to the other the fires ravaged more than 100,000 acres as firefighters contended with ser in heat and rapidly shifting winds forest fires generally cause huge Devastation to Natural areas but have a relatively low death toll but as weather conditions deteriorated the rapid pace of the fire took Everyone by surprise desperately trying to flee the area 30 people were burned to death in their cars trapped by the flames on a rural road while 17 others died as they tried to escape on foot only 4 months later port pug would go up in Flames again a huge number of fires allegedly set deliberately by arsonists blazed across the country and conditions worsened when high winds fanned and spread the Flames making it impossible for emergency workers to fight them we had these very Fierce fires flaring up first of all in June and then again in October in Portugal with large loss of life I mean the loss of life in such fires people Tred to escape in their cars straight into the fires and one thing we especially after heat waves they can move incredibly fast and much faster than it and and and so fast that it dangerous for people who are living downwind 64 people lost their lives in June the largest loss of life due to Wildfire in Portugal 45 died in the fires in October raising questions about the country Services and their ability to respond to disaster of this scale while some countries suffered from intense heat and dry conditions others experienced the worst flooding in decades Madagascar the world largest island is an extremely poor country that is regularly victim to a variety of natural disasters the nation is continuously hit by flooding drought and insect infestations it also stands directly in the path of tropical Cyclones that form over warm water in the Indian Ocean and head straight towards the island after several years of limited tropical storm activity the Island abundant Wildlife send a change in March 2017 Madagascar would experience the worst storm in 13 years on March 7th category 4 tropical Cyclone inao hit the region of antala on the East Coast bringing Heavy Rain violent winds and devastating storm surge for 2 days the Cyclone battered the island obliterating everything in its wake before being downgraded to a tropical depression [Music] [Music] [Music] in the Northeast the population witnessed scenes of Destruction and a landscape transformed by Winds of up to 140 mph each year the Nation crosses its fingers while the government does its best to prepare its citizens in the face of the frequent extreme weather events the island has created its own office of risks and natural disasters in charge of handling the nation hazards is Ty vendi what we observed was that the effects of the water after the Cyclone were worse than the wind the wind cause damage but only material damage the water that poured into the villages was worse most of the deaths that we saw were from people who had already been moved into safe places but they were strong willed and wanted to cross again and when they crossed again the force of the water took them away people took refuge in their homes unaware that they would soon be completely engulfed by the rising Waters the storm left scores dead triggered landslides and floods and nearly a quarter of a million people found themselves homeless a week after the storm the government declared a National Emergency by the time the Cyclone had moved on the country was devastated roads were cut off there was no access by sea and high winds prevented planes from taking off the wind felled the national radio fa Arin witnessed the destruction we endured the Cyclone Ina which passed at more than 200 km an hour the problem is the Mast even though we protected the national radio Mast it fell to the ground and now we have no more national news the electricity has still not been repaired that no drinking water no electricity and we are still in Total Blackout at the local airport the already rudimentary infrastructure was reduced to the bare minimum 10 days after the Cyclone planes were still being guided down with binoculars and shortwave radios from a control tower with no windows this kind of C do spirit is vital after a crisis allowing Aid workers like massimiliano kosi access to some of the worst hit areas Maro and cetra suffered serious flooding cutting off roads and destroying Bridges [Music] [Music] yes [Music] the mayor is explaining where the water Rose to during the Cyclone it went right up where he showing at the end of the stick you see there between the two houses there the road over there is cut off because there floated there in the water during the cyclone and it moved between the two houses it moved there and stuck in the middle of the [Music] road in the regions of antala and sambava all the crops and rice fields were destroyed the locals do their best to save as much of the rice as possible but despite their efforts outside Aid is required immediately it because the rice that they had stopped in all the villages was ruined by the water and got soaked in the water for hours and hours and it drying it out but they can only save a quarter of it a quarter of all the rice the world food program can provide temporary relief for the inhabitants but the problems caused by the Cyclone will have a KnockOn effect over a much longer period with the majority of the year rice crop spoiled by the flooding food is an extremely short supply even more concerning is the fact that farmers will have nothing to plant next season food provision is an ongoing problem for Madagascar where as many as half of the children under the age of five suffer from malnutrition that Cyclone caused a huge amount of rain to fall in the Northeast part of the island now in Madagascar is a very very poor country and it in particular by Cyclones by floods and by droughts and it never really recovers in the aftermath of one disaster before another disaster hits better known for its lemurs than its uring hardships Madagascar receives little outside Aid each time disaster strikes the country themselves up and carry on as best they can this storm the worst in 13 years left more than 80 people dead and cost the country $400 million in damage on the other side of the world a rare weather phenomenon would bring a vast region of one country to a [Music] standstill the north of Peru is an area that normally experiences little rainfall and in early 2017 the whole region was undergoing a period of severe drought but abnormally high temperatures in the Pacific Ocean were about to ca a dramatic change in the situation at the end of January rain started falling within days the area had been transformed phenomenal precipitation LED normally dry riverbeds to overflow creating mudslides collapsing Bridges and closing roads people Downstream from the river are at huge risk very high risk because the population lives very very close to the banks the warming of the sea water is normal that happens all the time but this time the sea temperature off the coast of lambc was 5° higher than normal Peru Landslide season usually falls in the first quarter of the year but you can remember flooding and Devastation of such intensity as they experienced in 2017 this sudden Deluge has been attributed to a localized weather occurrence known as a coastal El Nino in which warm water pools off the coast of Ecuador and Northern Peru causing heavy rain it Peruvian meteorologist Jean Carlos Espinosa during a normal season we have around 30 to 35 mm of water per month on the other hand during an ELO we can have between 600 and 650 mm of water during these months we days it has rained 1500 mm on Pura which is a huge anomaly compared to typical conditions 2017 bear Peru its often non-existent urban planning the rain continued to fall forcing residents to find makeshift solutions to protect what remained of their [Music] homes communities found themselves stranded with little or no supplies and dependent upon outside help the infrastructure designed to cope with this type of event was completely overwhelmed when two rivers flooded their banks in the region of lambay the river broke its banks and unfortunately the dam could not manage such a large amount of water many of us Survive by farming which has been completely destroyed whether it corn our land is not suitable for growing corn or lentils anymore but because this year was wet we grew rice as well unfortunately everything is lost flooding devastated 15,000 Acres of [Music] crops experts believe that climate change will make extreme weather events like this even more frequent houses that had escaped previous floods and seemed well out of Harm by the torrential flows of mud and water the water Rose so quickly that houses and businesses were destroyed in the space of several hours floodwater and landslides known as hos in the local dialect caused 260 Bridges to collapse and left nearly 2,000 Mi of Road unusable thousands of people found themselves completely cut off with no supplies and a lack of basic Provisions huge sedes of Northern Peru were brought to a standstill andero carasco has seen flooding here before but never like this 1998 was already an exceptionally bad year with extreme weather conditions but this year in 2017 this is the worst we about 13 vehicles have been lost and the rain keeps falling we happen it Commerce each time the roads cut off shiku can goods wacos are an annual occurrence in this part of Peru but Mass migration from rural areas to cities means that people have set up home wherever they can in marginal areas according to the country million people now live in flood Plaines directly in the path of roaring water and mudslides major changes are needed to prevent another disaster like this according to local residents Cesar vion now look that Corridor that has always had water but people don landslide corridors and they build around them and above them which makes it narrower so the land side is restricted by a corridor that isn that everything is devastated and all the houses are destroyed this Corridor is where the biggest landslides happen with very big Stones when the landslide passes the houses move like they would in an earthquake even 100 m away everything moves so much that you need to get out move away and wait for it to pass reconstruction of major town towns and cities on Peru the relocation of hundreds of thousands of people and cost around $9 billion while the first priority is to reconstruct homes a second longer phase would involve rethinking Peru infrastructure to prepare it for future unpredictable and extreme climate events we had a local El Nino not a global El Nino the waters got warm the rain started and and it rained extremely H and then you in these coastal cities in Northern Peru and the Peruvian government has actually now set up a plan really to try and stop this cycle not just make it the next time you get an El Nino you floods back again but to actually try and make improvements to build back better the flooding and mudslides in Peru caused the deaths of more than 100 people and caused $3.1 billion in damage in Asia a few months later unexpected flooding would take another country by surprise [Music] the island nation of Sri Lanka is famed for its sandy beaches tropical forests and tea plantations Sri Lanka is also affected by two monsoons each year the Southwest Monsoon causes a shift in wind direction which typically brings Heavy Rain from May to September having suffered drought condition for 2 months and with water levels well below normal the 2017 Monsoon was eagerly awaited at the end of May the expected rains arrived and then some [Music] over the course of 3 days up to 18 in of rain fell in some places and inhabitants soon realized that this was not the beneficial Monsoon they were hoping for the country Center issued evacuation notices for residents along several Rivers appealing to people to move to Higher Ground when the water level rises we have nowhere to go all we can do is move everything we can to high ground but if the water level rises too much we have no choice we would have drowned we were lucky lots of people drowned and there was a lot of damage it sad by the evening of May 25th water levels had risen and transformed the countryside from Lush grey to lagoons roads and access to Villages turned into rivers and many places could only be reached by boat everything was flooded everything was washed away with the water the water rose up to the first floor a lot of things were washed away we stayed with him people from four different houses were staying with him they fed us all for days some Rivers Rose by as much as 50 ft submerging the countryside for miles around residents found themselves in an unrecognizable landscape surrounded by water the worst flooding that the country had experienced in 15 years brought secondary problems people were at increased risk of mosquito born Deni fever and there were reports of crocodiles found in homes Amil kumara for 4 days this was our kitchen it was destroyed by the flooding the walls broke and the roof was washed away by the water the water stayed for 4 days yesterday the water level went down we rebuild the water [Music] in some areas the water receded as quickly as it had risen while in others 10 to 12 ft of water remained roads Villages and Fields were submerged as land turned into lakes as flood waters Rose so did the death toll towns and Villages were stranded when torrents of mud loosened by the rain thundered down hillsides heavy equipment was used to search for survivors but rescue efforts were hampered by lack of drinking water lack of electricity and continued rain nearly half a million inhabitants were affected by the disaster this is the road where people go to the school and the main road from here from this estate so now you can not see any roads here uh it it has been raining for 3 days last Friday and uh at about 6:00 we came to know that there is a landslide the members of All Families they were died unfortunately three of them were our children our school children our students of our school and uh we could find only one body of that those uh CH family and we couldn others still they are trying to get the other bodies to confirm whether they married died or [Music] not Tales of tragedy were common in the aftermath landslides hit with no warning wiping out whole family in other areas water levels from flooding Rose so quickly there was no time to save any [Music] possessions [Music] with as volunteers pick through the debris saving anything they can the scale of the disaster is apparent as the country modernizes deforestation has exposed many regions to greater risk from the effects of heavy Monsoon rains areas that once absorbed water have been cleared to grow crops like tea and rubber in towns and cities water levels rise quickly putting lives in danger and wiping out livelihoods the monsoon sweeps through as it moves further up the Indian subcontinent so I mean this year the monsoon was particularly intense and um it caused significant flooding I mean again Sri Lanka is a poor country the poorest people may be living in the flood zone itself so there there are a lot of features of of how poor countries will handle um an event like this which which makes them particularly prone I mean um prone to loss of life prone to loss of housing because they haven moved to to build the flood defense to Zone people so they don most dangerous places as the waters receded 220 deaths were declared and damage was estimated at $1.5 billion while the monsoon is an annual occurrence some countries are at the mercy of events that are very difficult to predict Mexico is one of the world most seismically active regions sitting on top of several intersecting tectonic plates these plates resting on the Earth liquid mandle constantly slide against or under each other along the coast of Mexico the Coco plate slides underneath the North American Plate at a rate of about 3 in per year but these movements are not always smooth sudden shifts can result in [Music] earthquakes on September 7th 2017 an 8.2 magnitude earthquake struck the Gulf of tantek off the South Coast of Mexico despite being the strongest earthquake to hit the country in the last century the death toll was relatively low but less than two weeks later a second earthquake struck run no around no run [Music] [Music] during the dramatic events Carlos Gonzalez was watching his seismographs he said on the 19th of September at 11:00 we were doing a national earthquake prevention drill then 2 hours later at 1:14 p.m. we were hit by a 7.1 magnitude earthquake located about 75 M from Mexico City at a depth of about 40 mil it was quite a deep earthquake a magnitude 7.1 and it caused um a lot of damage again in the area immediately around it but actually Mexico City itself was located I think 100 kilometers or so from the location from the epicenter of the earthquake Mexico City is built on a dry lake bed made of sand and clay that amplifies the the destructive effects of major earthquakes exactly 32 years before the 1985 Mexico City earthquake killed around 10,000 people it two earthquakes on the 19th of September one in 1985 and the other in 2017 it makes us think about the way we can prepare and inform people in the country when earthquake alarms sounded many people thought this was just a continuation of the morning drill after 20 seconds of violent shaking it became clear that this was no exercise more than 40 buildings collapsed in Mexico City killing scores and trapping hundreds of people inside inhabitants rushed to escape from buildings and found themselves surrounded by rubble and at risk from gas leak as the world became aware of the scale of this situation teams of Specialists from around the globe arrived to help rescue survivors and search for bodies even days after the major earthquake the threat of aftershocks and collapsing buildings meant rescue teams were working in high-risk situations team members raised their arms to call for total silence bringing the city to a temporary standstill while while experts listened intently for signs of Life personal information name blood type contact details were written on their arms in case of further accidents highly experienced Japanese search and rescue Personnel worked tirelessly Around the Clock But as time passed signs of life would become less and less fre quent while media attention and Aid were focused on the capital smaller towns like utla closer to the Epi Center were largely left to cope with a disaster on their own locals like ho Miranda had never experienced such an [Music] event I was at home having lunch when everything started to shake violently it was incredible we thought it was the end it was a terrible day for our town because it hit by an earthquake we didn would happen to us today we are completely devastated the town is in such a mess that it looks like there has been a war the sheer scale of solidarity in Mexico City meant that many volunteers were turned away and Di diverted to outlying towns that were in desperate need enri huarez and his team arrived from over 600 M away we are in it the disaster and also where most help is needed for the population we started a big campaign to help the whole population of the town there are many many people who participated we gathered eight or nine eight tons of goods things that are essential medication water everything you need to survive because unfortunately we have not come to solve the problem just to help the town of HLA was devastated by the Quake 3,000 buildings were destroyed and at least 73 people [Music] died Mexico had been slow to introduce strict building codes the oldest structures suffered most in the [Music] Quake San Antonio Alano was just 30 m away from the epicenter of the earthquake local priest Dario Varela saw his centuries old church reduced to Rubble the epicenter was very close to here we suffered a lot of material damage as you can see given the state of the church and the houses it was a very violent Quake first we felt to sort huge explosion in the church as though it was broken into two and then afterwards the bell tower collapsed and the bells crashed to the ground time has passed but our houses are still ruined there are families who have no roof over their heads and who are living outside in all weathers in towns like utla and San Antonio Al panoan earthquakes are rare old buildings constructed using traditional techniques stood no chance against an earthquake of this size where you have houses actually built effectively out of mud and cement what we call adobe houses they tend to be particularly fragile to what high frequency shaking so the shaking from a from a smaller earthquake May well pick off um adobe houses so we see throughout South America and Central America mean the old Adobe houses a lot of them have already been knocked down by earthquakes they in earthquakes they dangerous because their walls can be heavy the roofs can be heavy too and they can have high levels of ferality and injury from adobe house collapse in Mexico overall they very well informed about what you need to do to reduce the consequences of disasters but if you outlying Village somewhere you may be sort of beyond the view of government and you and people may simp um construct the same kind of buildings they had before unless the government comes in and actually trains the builders in actually how to build safer buildings usually the techniques of construction at Morelos and pbla are traditionally buildings made of Earth and they don structures so with major earthquakes the walls fall down what we should do is to combine both construction techniques concrete and steel structures with Earth walls to strengthen the houses that we need to reconstruct in these areas the road ahead will be a long one and the earthquake of 2017 will remain in the people to come the earthquake caused 370 deaths and the economic cost could be as much as $2 billion as the ground was shaking in Mexico the Caribbean and the east coast of the United States were in the throws of one of the most exceptional hurricane seasons on record in the Atlantic tropical Cyclones are known as hurricanes these storms which form between June and November originate off the coast of Africa and move over the Atlantic towards the Caribbean they get their strength from warm ocean water and depending on the speed of their wind They Are CL pacified from category 1 the weakest to Category 5 with wind speeds over 157 mph as soon as they make landfall the storms lose their source of energy and dissipate each year storms crossing the Atlantic are tracked in an effort to predict which will fizzle out without fuss and which will escalate out out of proportion on August 17th 2017 an Atlantic storm lost strength and authorities downgraded it to a tropical wave within a couple of days no more warnings were issued and the danger seemed to have passed but as it moved over warm water it gathered strength and by August 24th it had become a hurricane with a trajectory taking it straight towards Texas [Music] hurricane Harvey made landfall as a category 4 storm with Winds of 130 mph causing unprecedented destruction throughout the state passing over land should subdue the power of a hurricane but Harvey had other plans it three or 4 days it caused record levels of rainfall never seen before over a 3 or 4 day interval in in the US this rain fell almost almost specifically on the greater City of Houston in Texas Houston is the fourth largest city in the US it it Prides itself on not having any zoning controls which means you can build anywhere you don question is it in a flood zone or not um and and the city was really devastated by how much flooding there was from from from the rainfall Houston of 6.5 million people live on flat terrain that is prone to flooding the storm coast would have catastrophic results the hurricane struck the heart of America chosing refineries around the Gulf Coast initial loss Assessments in Texas estimated that almost 60,000 structures were destroyed [Music] evacuations were limited and some people like James Williams had no choice but to stay where they were to write out the storm it sounded like first it was just real loud wind you know and all a say You like a train coming or something then it hit just all out of nowhere all you could hear was just wind and that it and I you know when you realize you got no where to go you know that pretty pretty touchy feeling that you get you know less than a third of mobile homes are built to withstand the forces of hurricane winds in Marinas most people just left their boats to their fate the few people that remained witnessed the terrible destruction firsthand but it was the rainfall that was truly devastating Houston received the brunt of Harvey the city receiving more than 50 in the amount this city might expect in an average year one feature which we the past year or so along the western edge of the Gulf of Mexico is this the hot water layer has not only been at the surface it that has meant the a lot of heat a lot more evaporation and and that clearly was a factor in affecting why Harvey intensified so dramatically before landfall but also I think when people have the chance to really examine and model This Record levels of rainfall will be a a signature in there of actually this temperature at the surface but also how thick that surface layer of hot water was just days after Harvey hit the Texas coast the next Main major hurricane Irma was gaining strength out in the Atlantic residents of the Caribbean and Florida rushed to prepare for what was about to become the largest ever recorded Atlantic Ocean hurricane making its way inexorably towards them the parent Parise island of St Martin lies less than 200 mil to the east of Puerto Rico half French half Dutch most of the 75,000 strong population is involved in the tourist industry conditions in the Atlantic were ideal for hurricanes deep warm water and no upper atmosphere disturbance means tropical storms intensify over extremely short periods jumping from category to category and giving people less warning of their arrival as the hurricane approached the island it passed over warm water and intensified rapidly making landfall on the island of St Martin on the night of September 6th as a category 5 storm irmer intensifies Category 5 winds up to 175 mph St Bart and St Martin are devastated the eye of the storm Category 5 has just passed over the island B Suli you through a very difficult experience practically one part of the hotel has been ripped out there are almost no doors no rooms lots and lots of Destruction here in St Martin um the sea the waves are practically washing into the entrance of the hotel I wanted to share with the listeners what was happening outside I went out I left my hotel room I found myself in the corridor and I didn the keys to get back in I was in the Cor coridor of the hotel for an hour an hour and a half I shielded myself between the wall and the lift and practically an hour or an hour and a half later I saw little light the light from a headlamp someone who was in the hotel and I realized it was the caretaker someone who worked at the hotel and I asked him if he had the keys if he had a key to my room he opened my room I went inside to take cover and where I was outside the roof was ripped off I heard a boom and everything exploded around me honestly I thought we were dead personally I thought we were all going to die I locked myself in the bathroom and the water was almost up to my knees it was a very very difficult time especially when I was outside my room and when I heard what was happening around me you see even a month afterwards I still have trouble talking about it Irma is intensified up to not only category five but really extreme Category 5 level I mean to to wind speeds which um of 300 km an hour and over which which are are you know had never been witnessed for a hurricane in that in that area in the least in the last few decades and it mean even even I mean typically when a when a tropical Cyclone reaches these really intense levels it tends not to last very long it is quite unstable it actually picks up some cold water you something happens but it actually maintain this intensity I think for 37 hours and um that had never seen been seen before with Winds of 185 mph the hurricane bulldozed the island what had been a Haven had become a scene from [Music] Hell inhabitants witnessed their houses shaking on their foundations even the country metal shipping containers were lifted by the wind and sent tumbling over [Music] land Irma was the most powerful Atlantic hurricane in recorded history those that sat out the storm in their homes like Kristoff enok had their lives transformed by the experience I looked down there and there was a pool of water coming in so I took my hammer and chisel from the furniture here I took my torch and all my things I called the cats there were two in the bedroom over there but they didn they were terrified but the other one followed me and I came into this part and here the door was closed with a piece of plywood which was blocked by the door and the padlock here I was locked in and I pushed the padlock it fell outside and then I couldn even if I had managed to open it I couldn the water prevented me from opening the door then a wave came in and when it washed out it forced the door like that and I got out and swam to the stairs over [Music] there residents in high-risk areas were told to evacuate in the small hours of the morning down here we had the water that came in from the the beach itself came over the mango and flooded all the houses here as you can see to the top of the house you can see the marking of where the water had reached I came back instantly after the hurrian passed uh and um I saw a lady right by the house and she was theread so I was thinking you know what there down here and we about how much people government officials believe that 95% of the Island destroyed or damaged by Irma almost nothing escaped the power of the wind and the storm surge Boats were Swept Away by the wind and waves dumped in unlikely [Music] locations many people had removed their boats from the water before the hurricane arrived but despite their precautions almost all suffered major damage those that remained in the ports sank or were demolished as they were smashed against each other in the Island devastation remained more than a month after AR [Music] passage sticking to its path of mass destruction the storm curved North hitting Cuba and losing some of its power over the landmass before making a beline for Florida most of the state wealth is concentrated on the coast where beachfront properties are in high demand and at Major risk from hurricanes hundreds of thousands of Floridians left their homes in the largest evacuation in the state history [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] following Harvey a second major storm of this size in one season was unprecedented but unusual weather systems seem to have become the norm [Music] hurricane Irma swept up Florida Peninsula before finally losing strength 10 million Floridians were left without power after the storm and damage was estimated in the billions of dollars but out in the Atlantic yet another hurricane was already forming this next hurricane was called Maria and the tiny island of Dominica lay directly in its [Music] path hurricane Irma had caused little damage in Dominica and many people thought warnings about Maria were exaggerated while some people prepared to leave their homes others ignored the warnings after explosive intensification Maria doubled its sustained wind speed from 80 to 160 60 MPH and Dominica was struck by a category 5 hurricane radio DJ Steven dangleben was on the air when the hurricane arrived at some point in time we went off air okay and when we went off air Kurt said it is too early for us to be off air we the nation station and um I said Kur you said man we have to run up to Egan which is about mil 3 miles from here and when I went when I reached the site I said I have because I saw what was happening the trees they were um Sway and there was a lot of debris to the entrance I said I minutes if I don station on in 5 minutes I have to forget about it and I did get it on as soon as I came I saw what I saw the generator um had a fault I cleared the fault and started the generator and then I head back and on my way back was a big challenge because it had gotten worse and there was a a tree that blocked my path so I decided to go close to the trees and use the van to break the trees and it did worked and I came to the station hurricane Maria was the 13th named storm the fourth major hurricane and the second second Category 5 hurricane in [Music] 2017 as the hurricane hit with wind speeds of 165 mph the population soon realized that this was not like any storm they had ever seen [Music] before passing over warm water just like Irma Mar intensified dramatically they say we were going to have a category 3 or Category 2 but that move from one to two to three it skip four and when directly do five you were not prepared for that at all no one was forecasters have a good idea where hurricanes are heading but even experts like Ralph Tumi struggled to gauge how strong the storms are going to be changes in intensity very hard to predict still but track was well predicted and it was well understood that there would be severe flooding and and so the warning given out by the weather service was was was actually very accurate despite warnings the nation was taken by surprise Melina bu saw that her community was not overly concerned all the television and radio presenters were talking about a violent hurricane that was coming but because Irma had already passed and it hadn done anything we weren we underestimated it there and there were all people who died a lot of the people who died were stubborn because we went to see them to tell them to escape that it could be a category 5 storm and they said we stoken time but there wasn 8:30 p.m. the Water started pouring down the mountain and washed everything away water rushed down Ravines tearing out trees and ripping houses from their foundations weeks after the storm but cleanup operation has made little impact in the fishing Village of Scott head it will be a long time before life resumes as normal in the meantime with schools still closed children find entertainment where they [Music] can the struggle for basic Provisions in the aftermath consumes the inhabitants [Music] days and he the first time that I heard the wind actually whistle it was singing it was crying it was howling all at the same time and playing Tunes you know it was just amazing but at the same time it was terrifying by September 20th the storm now a category 4 hurricane in Gulf Puerto Rico which was still reeling from Hurricane Irma a mere 2 weeks before Winds of 155 mph and more than 20 in of rain flattened residences tore roofs from homes and caused major floodings the ferocity of the storm left the entire country without electricity and wiped out Communications [Music] and on Puerto Rico it also caused very significant amounts of damage both as a wind event and as a flood event we seen you know the way people are living now after Maria and Puerto Rico is like how they were living a 100 years ago when the storm had passed residents remained at risk from flooding and landslides the 2017 hurricane season came as a major surprise even to those who study the phenomenon but several years of calm meant that some experts hadn surprise so really it decade for some time in terms of landfall and an activity if you look at the historical record this was a quiet period And so sooner or later it was going to go back to if you like normal and it went back to normal in a big way [Music] C what can we do that nature and at the same time I tell myself it lesson it need to realize that nature is changing that the planet is warming and there will be more and more typhoons and Cycles and they will be stronger and stronger climate scientists are concerned that three major hurricanes in a row could be the new normal hurricanes get their destructive energy from Ocean heat as the ocean temperature rises is it possible that future storms could be bigger than those we have already seen the theoretical limit for these storms is is is quite terrifying so we haven reached those it of of duration as well so the conditions have to be favorable and they have to be favorable for a long enough time and then you can reach very very powerful powerful storms so on the whole uh the the the if you like the potential intensity that they can reach generally isn there is always some disturbance in the atmosphere which doesn there is definitely potential for much stronger storms this return to normal meant that whole islands were wiped out with other regions taking months or even years to recover the economic damage to the Caribbean and the United States was unparalleled I think overall the economic impact is probably going to be largest for Harvey and then um second for Irma with all the impacts in Florida but and then Maria in Puerto Rico I think in terms of the longterm impact Maria is going to have the the biggest impact of all because the the r to provide really in you really deep assistance from the mainland us to Puerto Rico has has reduced the speed of recovery quite significantly the economic cost of the three hurricanes is estimated at over $350 billion Harvey alone was the costliest ever hurricane although the official death toll for Harvey Irma and Maria stands at 323 we may never know how many people people really died during this extreme hurricane [Music] season 2017 is the warst year on record that hasn Nino apart from earthquakes all the year signature of global warming extreme floods ferocious fires and the strongest Atlantic hurricane ever our Planet will always be at the mercy of natural disasters but while we have seen hundreds of deaths this year from earthquakes and hurricanes the situation could have been much worse so thankfully now we talking about damages in terms of dollars we tens of thousands of people dying which not so long ago 50 60 70 years ago a landfall in the United States would have killed tens and tens of thousands of people so we are we have definitely moved on we we we find it difficult not to incur the economic damages but at least the lives saved as considerable so we [Music] progress as we create protective systems and improve construction to save lives the economic cost of each disaster rises though the death toll has become much reduced 2017 will remain etched in the minds of those who survived the planet [Music] the disaster Diaries is not an exhaustive study of the year catastrophes many are not included in this account a mudslide in Sierra Leon killed 500 people an earthquake in Iran killed 540 and every year the monsoons on the Indian subcontinent take the lives of thousands in December the fifth largest wildfire in California more than a thousand homes and reduced 230,000 acres of land to Ash our planet marks of human activity but mankind is learning to defend itself from the violence of the weather that it has Unleashed [Music]	Success

tourist destination thanks to its stunning scenery Rich marine ecosystems and its wide range of Wildlife [Music] in the South yala National Park is home to a variety of mammals reptiles and [Music] birds on the morning of December the 26th 2004 tour guides like thushara Paris had no idea of what they were about to witness we didn that day normally between 6:00 a.m. and 700 a.m. we see a lot of animals but that day there were not many they were scared of something but we couldn figure out the reason for that the animals were aware of something no human could sense but far away one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded struck off the coast of Indonesia and last lasted for a full 10 minutes Sri Lanka was Far Enough from the epicenter that the Tremor itself couldn but the earthquake triggered a series of tsunamis giant tidal waves along the coast of Indonesia India Thailand and Sri Lanka killing over 230,000 people fishermen at Sea were out of the danger zone but they too saw changes as he Leon AGI discovered when he returned to his boat in the days following the tsunami we went fishing a few days after the tsunami but the fish that we had seen before the tsunami weren there there were no big shs of fish in the water before we had seen crabs on rocks on the seabed but they had also gone we did not see the fish show their usual Behavior at all even sea creatures like prawns and turtles disappeared during the tsunami and after the tsunami as well many people in Sri Lanka believe that animals were able to sense the impending catastrophe and move out of Harm [Music] since ancient times stories have been told of animals warning humans of impending doom before it happens reptiles geese and dogs have all been credited with saving us from various disasters but until recently there had been little scientific study of this phenomenon the in 2011 Dr Martin wikelski began studying the goats that wander the slopes of Mount Etna in Italy towering 3,352 m above sea level mount etner is the most active volcano in Europe most eruptions affect only the vicinity of the crater and pose little danger for locals and their [Music] [Music] animals over two years Dr wikelski tagged a number of goats and sheep that live on the volcano slopes then kept a close eye on what the animals got up to using the data collected he was able to see how their movements changed depending on the volcano Behavior what we saw was that before every major eruption before every one of those um the goats were showing erratic strange Behavior they were getting really nervous um but then when when you have an eruption coming up and we don know what it is but there coming from the earth mantle going towards the surface and somehow the goats know and that because they are not in one group together they are distributed around the mountain and it in activity it wiggling around a little bit or walking around no it tripling of activity and that massive difference Dr wikelski knows that the goats act differently before an eruption next he needs to find out how they can tell that something is about to happen well the truth is we don what it is that the goats experience what they sense but it interesting because we can now collaborating with the vulcanologist find out where these correlations are and then we can go out and say well could it be smell as the lava as the magma comes up through the mountain is it more the tension in the mountain which they measure and maybe it something else maybe it is influencing the plants that is influencing the goats but we don [Music] yet wikelski has recently returned to the slopes of Mount etner to improve on his first experiments thanks to sophisticated tags that allow him to track their movements in real time Al so we did studies here before on the goats 6 years ago studied them for 2 years but only locked the data so only wrote them in the memory of the tag and now we have for the first time a realtime system which is really exciting because now we can uh determine what the goats are doing when the mountain is going crazy so from the previous data we know that the goats are active 4 to 6 hours before a major volcanic eruption which is really enticing so uh within 10 minutes or so we get the data from these animals and can tell whether they are going crazy or not having confirmed that goats make good volcanologists wikelski now hopes to apply his knowledge to other [Music] animals the next steps are that we go to different parts of the world and ask people which animals are known to uh tell you something about disasters that are coming and those will be the animals we tag with the people there and determine whether they are as good as the goats here the animals in shanka and the goats in Italy Are Not Alone In figuring out that something is about to happen before it takes place and one study has even identified the clues that some animals are picking up on the the O search organization was set up to help scientists collect data in the ocean the deep sea and its many inhabitants remain largely misunderstood due to the difficulty of acquiring hard facts despite their High Media profile there is very little concrete information known about even some of the most recognizable animals such as sharks Dr Robert hter has been tagging various species of sharks for the last 35 years in 2001 he and his colleague Dr Michel hiel had marked a group of young black tipped sharks that were living in shallow water in Tampa Bay Florida but on September the 11th tropical storm Gabriel formed in the Gulf of Mexico 3 days later it hit the Florida coast with Winds of 110 km an hour and heavy rainfall we had uh receivers acoustic receivers that were tracking the movements of of about a dozen or so young sharks when the storm approached our coast and when we downloaded the data we saw that these little sharks had left the the comfort and the confines and the protection of the nursery area and had gone out somewhere offshore into into lower Tampa Bay perhaps out in the Gulf itself where they eaten themselves by by larger sharks what is the times when the the 13 black tip sharks left the nursery but they began to leave uh with the downturn in barometric pressure and were were fully gone even before barometric pressure hit its bottom point the Sharks reacted to the low pressure associated with hurricane rather than the wind and rain that Sharks we now know in their ears and yes sharks do have ears they have inner ears um that can pick up the pressure difference uh that depth some of the animals reacted very quickly after this happened uh a few others took oh an hour or so to to kind of make a decision it leave 20 years after Dr H observations an noarch team set off on an expedition to Nova Scotia to tag and follow the movements of great white sharks when they arrived in September 2020 the location was ideal for finding sharks and the weather was beautiful but they were clearly gone they had left uh they were avoiding that area and and staying offshore it seems the Sharks had send something something and sure enough shortly after Huracan Teddy pummeled the Nova Scotia Coast the calm seas of the tagging site was soon transformed by 10 m waves [Music] from his previous work on black tipped sharks Dr hutter was able to make deductions about the great white sharks in Nova Scotia by inference we we conclude that the sharks that could have been there in that in that very productive place left roded out offshore in deeper water and then when the hurricane effects were were pretty much cleaned up returned and that later a little bit further down the coast when the sharks returned the team was able to catch and tag them unlike goats the shark tagging operation requires a large team of experts and a huge amount of logistics using an elevated platform the shark is towed into place and the specialist set to work like a Formula 1 Pit Stop each person on the team is responsible for their t task which they try to perform as quickly as possible to limit the distress to the animal samples are taken and the shark is tagged before being sent on its way Dr huter and his colleagues follow 70 great whites in real time and can observe how they react to changing barometric pressure and incoming weather disturbances while these animals show signs of being able to forecast natural disasters others are unable to escape from danger they live in a world where extreme weather events are part of their [Music] lives the island of Puerto Rico lies in the Caribbean Sea a thousand miles off the coast of the United States it Beauty with its mountains waterfalls and [Music] forests on the Eastern side of the Island lies eluni tropical rainforest this area has an average rainfall of 3 m per year and a highly diverse ecosystem as well as birds and mammals the tropical forest is also home to more fragile creatures both in the water and on [Music] land each year the Caribbean is hit by hurricanes arriving from the Atlantic Puerto Rico lies right in the path of these huge storms when hurrians land they bring huge amounts of rainfall to the island over very short periods of time [Music] as the water rises the equivalent of a full Year washed into the rivers within the space of a few hour hours rainfall and flooding threaten the forest inhabitants these sudden seasonal onslaughts mean even the river smallest residents have had to look for Solutions the shrimp cope with the rising Waters by heading to find shelter or hunkering down some shrimp Simply avoid the worst impacts of the storm by getting out of the water and walking on land in fact very few shrimp die during these events many times they are merely relocated and can even find themselves in the midst of a hurricane induced smorgas board surrounded by food though they are small these shrimp eat a huge amount of the plant matter and actually clear the rivers of storm debris without these creatures the streams and Waters of pret Rico would be completely overwhelmed by organic litter after storms and hurricanes when a cyclone approaches fire ants find themselves in a very vulnerable position faced with Rising Waters and torrential rain but they have adapted and come up with a flood drill forced to abandon their home the ant version of Noah incredible feat of survival engineering ing the worker ants literally stick together hanging on to each other by holding tari the insect equivalent of hands enough air is trapped on the bodies of the workers around hairs on their legs to prevent them from drowning and the Ants constantly move on the raft taking turns in various positions [Music] the queen and lari are protected in the center the driest safest part of this nautical pancake a fire ant raft can survive for several weeks drifting with the currents when the water recedes or they encounter dry land they swarm to Shore and reestablish themselves on new territory the queen is escorted off the raft and taken to a safe location where the ants will continue the next stage of their lives the animals of Puerto Rico have found some incredible adaptations in order to survive in their stormy environment elsewhere some species choose to head directly into the danger zone in North America Virginia Shore is made up of a series of undeveloped Barrier Islands here one migratory shorebird stocks up on food before embarking on a momentous Journey that has intrigued ornithologists for hundreds of years [Music] Dr Brian Watts from the center for conservation biology tracks Wims and studies their migration we had the opportunity to deploy satellite transmitters on birds and over 10 years we tracked almost 50 Birds um as they crossed the Atlantic and built up a data set to look at how they interacted with storms that there are two main populations of Wims in North America the birds look identical and both spend the winter in Brazil but Dr Watts discovered that the two groups had found different solutions to the problem of hurricanes it turns out that these two populations have different strategies of um dealing with the storms uh the one McKenzie Delta population basically stays out over cooler water where storms don storms um the Hudson Bay population flies directly across Hurricane Alley but it does so in a place where there are islands that it can use as ports during a storm and if it does encounter if they do encounter storms they down on those islands wait out the storms refuel and then move on to the wintering grounds the McKenzie Delta birds take a massive detour an Epic Journey covering 6,000 km nonstop over open water and staying well away from the storm area the Hudson Bay population takes a shorter route though it thousand kilom heading directly through the danger zone They set off into the unknown unable to tell if there are hurricanes approaching but they have a number of options if they get caught up in storms if they are confronted with a hurricane these birds are either battle their way against the headwinds or land on one of the many islands in the area sometimes they powerful Tailwinds that slingshot them out the other side by either avoiding storms or risking storm interaction both populations have adapted to the seasonal dangers yet their population continues to decline while he was tracking one particular bird named Goan Dr Watts discovered that the risks were not always weather related Goan was flying over the West Indies I encountered Hurricane Irene was put down on monserat and then flew over to Antigua and was on Antigua for seven days and then flew to guadaloop and was shot the morning it arrived on guadaloop by hunters in a shooting swamp Dr Watts believes that these birds show remarkable resilience in coping with extreme weather conditions but it remains to be seen if they can survive once they reach dry land birds have an amazing ability to adapt to changing conditions and one species of bird has actually turned a bad situation to its advantage on the island of New Britain in papia New Guinea two volcanoes have been erupting on and off since 1994 the local town rabol is situated directly in the crater many of the town the thick Ash and aerial bombardment and find somewhere less geologically Lively it certainly doesn ideal location for rearing youngsters but when the humans left another creature moved in choosing this apocalyptic landscape as a nursery for its babies in forested areas chicken-sized Polynesian megapod Birds bury their eggs in deep nests of decaying vegetation but around the crater they lay their eggs up to 2 m deep in volcanic ash [Music] egg laying takes place during calm periods between eruptions megapod parents don other bird species instead they leave that job to the volcano itself [Music] I [Music] [Applause] [Music] sometimes the MEAP pods Brave the disaster Zone to return and lay a second or even a third egg the sparse trees provide little protection from the constant rain of volcanic bombs in some cases the stress is too much and the birds abandon their eggs before they have a chance to bury them as usual in nature nothing goes to waste megapod eggs have the largest yoke of any birds making up to 50 to 70% of the egg deep in the warm Ash the surviving eggs are kept at a constant temperature unlike like most other bird species megapod parents never see their offspring and play no part in raising them when they finally hatch underground the young chicks must claw their way to the surface they emerge fully feathered with eyes open and ready to fly from day one it seems like a risky Venture but every year thousands of birds come here to lay their eggs and entrust them to the bowels of the Earth Earth in the face of natural disasters Birds show adaptability and Ingenuity in the north of Australia certain species of birds have learned to go even further harnessing the elements with a skill previously thought to be unique to humans for thousands of years indigenous tribes in Australia have managed the land landcape by using controlled burns when burning begins black Kites and other birds of prey arrive from miles around known as Firebirds they prey on insects reptiles and rodents as they escape from the Heat [Music] [Music] within minutes of an area Catching Fire Birds appear as if from nowhere ready to take advantage of the bounty of food The Blaze creates a feeding frenzy as small animals flee the front line of the fire wildlife cinematographer Mark lamble has worked in the Northern Territory for many years the birds would wheel around the fire and then they some would swoop in front of the fire and some would swoop behind the fire and pick up uh dead dead morsels on the ground of insects and little lizards and small mammals and the OD amphibian and they they would pick them up out of the air swoop up grab them lift them up and then feed on them but in several Aboriginal dream time ceremonies indigenous tribes refer to birds flying into bushfires picking up a burning stick and dropping it elsewhere in order to spread the fire Mark camped out with indigenous guides to try and capture this response on film for the first time ever the Firebirds don Behavior frequently on the odd occasion we saw a bird swoop down and pick something up that wasn Firebird picking up a stick bringing mark one step closer to filming the birds picking up a burning stick and spreading the fire now even skeptical Western scientists have started to take indigenous stories seriously and believe there is compelling evidence that fire starting is not just accidental but for Mark there is no doubt about what indigenous people have known for gener ations I for a long long time 30 plus years in the top end I I before but I and when you stop and you might be even filming a fire and suddenly that fire is on the other side of the road and the only thing there to have done it is a bird you assume it picked up a stick and and moved that fire it seems that the birds only start a new fire when an existing one has reached a barrier and is in danger of going out the birds appear to want to flush out more prey and understand that fire is the key to this abundant food source fires are part of life in Australia but recent years have seen some of the biggest bush fires in recorded history now the Australian government is showing renewed interest in indigenous burning practices in the hope of keeping these fires under control [Music] off the South Coast of Australia Kangaroo Island is well known for its unique ecosystem but in 2019 and 2020 this Wildlife Haven was badly affected when bush fires burned more than half of its surface area on the island and around the world experts and Layman watched the fire spread concerned for the future of the endemic species found here this is an area that is used to fires the plants and animals here have developed strategies to cope both during the fires themselves and afterwards once the danger has passed renowned environmental physiologist Peggy rismiller has discovered that even the smallest animals have developed some surprising Behavior is the the termite species on kangar island Nudo termis exosis is a very special termite that eats Timber and uh the inside of a termite Mound is like a catacomb and uh that termites eating wood and going in with the the wood and the termite spit forming these these catacombs but then the outside of the mound is actually covered with a soil type um from the surrounding in areas and from what we learned it looks like the termites actually mine certain minerals and put them over their mound to actually fireproof them or at least making make them more fire retardant termite Mounds are not impregnable to fire some of them do burn but they rarely burn all the way underground to where the queen chamber is located after the passage of the fire the termites get back to work rebuilding their [Music] empire aidas are found only in Australia [Music] when threatened by fires aidas go into a type of hibernation known as [Music] torper they between their spines and that causes them to to have sort of an insulation they also have the unique ability to lower their metabolism their respiration their heartbeat and they can Sur survive things like fire even when some of their spines might get melted by the heat of the fire this period of torper allows them to conserve energy while they wait out the [Music] danger in fact Peggy rismiller has discovered that the Ecology of Kangaroo Island is not unique all the species all over Australia have evolved with fire for the most part the species um are very good at surviving fires and have their own methods for doing that eucalyptus trees are native to Australia and are found throughout the island they contain an oil that is highly flammable not ideal in an area where fires are a regular occurrence each year the trees shed their bark and leaves creating huge piles of combustible fuel on the ground when a bush fire passes through this Tinder Burns quickly [Music] [Music] the trees may lose leaves and branches but the fire moves rapidly so the trunk and roots are usually spared in fact some eucalyptus trees depend on fire to reproduce eucalyptus seeds are contained in hard seed pods that are sealed with resin these cones can only release their seeds when the heat of a fire has melted through this protective case the seeds Then Fall onto a nutrient Rich bed of Ash where all competitive plants have been cleared out creating an ideal area for young trees to regrow small orange funguses appear on the ground directly after the fire they have a crucial role helping to change the soil PH after it has been alkalized by fire browsing animals are temporarily driven out and the heated soil reduces the number of Plante eating insects and soil organisms during the important early growth period period eucalyptus trees produce new growth which Sprouts directly from the base of the tree the stress of fire causes epicormic buds to shoot directly from the trees if the leaves of the tree have been burnt these buds Sprout and produce new foliage allowing it to survive [Music] eucalyptus is not the only fire dependent Tree on the island some of the vegetation on kangaro island is is quite incredible because it actually needs fire in order to germinate so when the fire came and uh a lot of the plants actually threw open their seed pods and seeds were scattered [Music] everywhere various tree species need fire and extreme heat to propagate their seeds fire is a positive force bringing renewal and even resources to other species now that fire we saw a lot of different bird species come in and feed on those seeds some of the plants which came back quickly are only here and that the astonishing things about kangar Island grass trees or zanthera are one of these endemic species they are extreme slow growing and some of the tallest species are estimated to be more than 400 years old and yet during that time they must have outlived numerous [Music] bushfires a fire may burn their leaves and Blacken their trunks but the trees usually survive in fact their growth point is buried underground protected by tightly packed Leaf bases away from The Inferno above some grass trees are even stimulated by fire to flower so the zanthera actually needs fire in order to make its beautiful flower stocks and those flower stocks are important for food for the nectar feeders such as the pygmy possums and a lot of our Birds spear-like flowers growing up to 4 M long appear as a result of this outwardly destructive event the fires seem to be catastrophic but nature demonstrates its creativity both during the event and afterwards we did not lose any species and it is amazing how resilient our Wildlife is when it comes to surviving fire a period of Plenty can even follow in the aftermath of a disaster a phenomenon that is not limited to Kangaroo [Music] Island the country of Nepal lies on a fault separating two tectonic plates as one plate slides under another pressure builds up and can be released in the form of an earthquake even a medium-sized Quake can devastate vast areas and kill thousands whole towns are raised to the ground but Quakes also cause mudslides bringing the country to a [Music] standstill however one part of the population takes this kind of disaster in its stride never at a loss for inspiration monkeys are ready to take advantage of the situation in Nepal rees protected and flourish in the jungles around the [Music] city they are regarded as holy Animals by Buddhists and Hindus but they are considered pests by the local farmers having adapted to the influx of humans in the area they are known for raiding crops a low effort High benefit way of sourcing [Music] food after a recent earthquake in Neal troops of maacs continued this behavior in urban settings where they headed into towns and rumag through the rubble to find food these freeloaders don catastrophic Quakes stand in their way for them the Tremor has merely created a new opportunity maacs are one of the most successful primate species on the planet after humans to take what they want and Escape quickly they have developed Pou is in their cheeks that let them store food while they transport it so they can eat it [Music] later these maacs are also not restricted to one type of food they can adapt to the resources available putting them in a much better situation when disasters hit and destroy their habitual food sources [Music] switching food sources and the ability to store food or fat are essential for thriving after a cataclysm having escaped the mass extinction of its dinosaur ancestors one common bird continues to demonstrate its ability to survive Kawai is one of the largest of the Hawaiian Islands it is covered in tropical forest high mountains Crystal Clear rivers and sandy beaches but despite its Adil appearance the island is sometimes hit by storms with unexpected results [Applause] in that movie Jurassic Park a hurricane came through called aniki and aniki blew these chickens into the air and they wound up you know Landing wherever and uh had starting with new families and stuff and before aniki there was no chickens around but since that one storm in um it [Music] chickens in Steven Spielberg huge storm allowed marauding bloodthirsty dinosaurs to break free and terrorize the island while in real life hurricane an Nikki allowed the Island domesticated chicken population to fly the coupe and live according to their whims but they find Freedom on This Island red jungle foul brought by the first Polynesians had already made their home in kaai mountains the freed domesticated chickens and wild jungle fowl into breed to form a whole new breed of chicken the feral chickens of [Music] Kawai an entire population of domestic animals returning to the wild is a highly usual occurrence but the feral chickens have grabbed the opportunity with both feet and have adapted very quickly to the urban environment of the island and most of the locals seem happy to share the island with their feathered neighbors and no matter where you go if you go back up into the mountains and in the jungle there you go everywhere you go to Walmart there chickens on the island this new breed of chickens is equally at home in the jungle and the city biologist Ean Garing and his colleagues have come to Kawaii to study this unusual bird population don you in why Kawaii makes a great uh natural lab for our studies is that we have a historical context for when these populations began exchanging genes so we know about how many generations have elapsed since those storm events um and since this population um underwent an exponential increase in the size the number of individuals now in this case we have domestic birds that we of now gone back into natural conditions they of the Native red jungle fows so you have a process known as feralization whereby a domestic population suddenly has to reima has to adjust to these more natural conditions so has this led to a chicken population explosion even the experts can only guess um you can see that yeah the the number of birds is dramatically increased in the island but it very hard to get a truly accurate population sensus if I was forced to estimate maybe 10,000 people are going to say 10,000 and some are going to say a million um and yeah my my guesses would be somewhere in between those numbers however many chickens there actually are the birds like the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park were able to take advantage of a major meteorological event and make a bid for Freedom returned to the wild it seems they remain free for the foreseeable [Music] future recent years have seen a marked increase in natural disasters around the world experts predict that global warming will lead to rising sea levels supercharged storms prolonged droughts and heavier [Music] precipitation on Kangaroo Island in Australia Peggy RIS Miller believes that increased lightning strikes will cause more fires in the Island that will affect the ecosystem will be really interesting because fire is natural and fire has not devastated the ecosystems but it has changed ecosystems and I think with global warming and with more fires the ecosystems Will Survive and it adaptations happen but there certainly be here in the future life on Kangaroo Island has evolved over millions of years to cope with fires but it remains to be seen if nature elsewhere will be able to cope with a sudden change in the climate certainly humans have a lot to learn from the natural world as our planet changes if we look closely at how Nature has adapted we can take inspiration from examples of survivors resilience and successes [Music]	Success
How Iceland and France Are Revolutionizing Geothermal Power | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pqro3sydTkE	SLICE Science	[Music] right under our feet lies an untapped source of energy clean affordable and abundant but reaching it is hard work conditions are extreme even lifethreatening if it goes above the level you just pass out and if no one pulls you out of it unfortunately you die but in Iceland and elsewhere people are taking huge risks to bring us the energy of the future in a world running out of fuel the world out how to power our cities using some ingenious methods solar nuclear fusion wind and steam this is a land where clouds rise from the ground and where trees are man-made 70% of the power in this European nation comes from sources of energy that are clean and renewable the chief source of energy is also unconventional the tiny countryand on the edge of the North Atlantic is the world leader in geothermal power geothermal plants take Natural reservoirs of steam from deep underground and convert them to electricity this plant opened just 2 years ago yet work has begun to double its capacity it new plant with whole new headaches only from the outside this is the drawing huge headaches we we won back today huge parts installed with outsize tools T it it favorite tool in the job Miles of pipes and slle gates to control problems the brightest Engineers Absol but when pump number one was running we had the full pressure on the suction side of the pump the extension to the plant must be ready in 6 months but the severe weather here could wreck their time table this builds up onto the profiles and breaks them and we off because that you know puts more pressure we have to let it be and this is what the wind only the wind did to a full column like this most of all to double the plant capacity they need to find twice as much steam we have an obligation to provide certain amount of power for the project as a whole and we establish enough uh Steam for the new turbines in a small village in France a pilot project is trying a whole new approach to geothermal power there are no steam reservoirs here so they have to drill deep into the Earth then add water to create steam first you have to to hold on and to destre two decades of research and work to reach a source of energy hidden 5,000 M below the surface the last day it nerve-wracking engine is running let go leaking more than before if it works this plant could help wean the world off fossil fuels stop it in Iceland Marcus fry enjoys having a green job like obviously it for the planet and it feels good when you do whatever you can you know but I don clean power and it sounded good geologist grar erson knows geothermal power is not an exact science we are definitely gamling it very difficult to say about a well prior to drilling or prior to opening it up for the first time in France zavier G has high hopes for the Venture it something new and to to develop some technology to to bring to a long living system and Jean Paul fat experienced but still excited by the project it theob see the number of Kow on [Music] the winter in Iceland yet construction has begun freezing temperatures and constant wind impede progress tens of thousands of Parts have to be cut assembled welded and adjusted a gigantic jigsaw puzzle and every piece must fit precisely 10 mm over yeah I need to have it back weld a piece here so it won don foolish otherwise I will kick your ass at the foot of the mountain Marcus races the clock to build a new cooling tower he supervises dozens of workers few of them from Iceland Iceland is one of the world most developed countries very good do yet among the most sparsely populated with just 300,000 people It suffers from a shortage of workers yep go ahead Marcus where salaries are lower but the work ethic is strong and the main thing with places like this is experience cuz these guys are working with us for the first time like 80% of them and we had to show them everything just absolutely everything I mean a ratchet and a spanner and where we use this cuz some of the guys use these as hammers some of the guys you know use this as a as a you know open things what how can this be they learn fast in 6 months the new generators must be ready to run but the crew doesn even English you take level you know level uhhuh yeah put level along and then you can just get pen they do understand basic English but you know it explain something to them then we go get an english- speaking one we tell him and he translates so we always find a way to do it we can the weather if you let the weather control you you in [Music] Iceland depending on the direction of the wind steam can envelop marcus site workers at the tops of the chimneys can these are the conditions we have to work in you can imagine like I can barely see my colleague here next to me so you can imagine if we trying to work together this gas as comfortable as it can be it than that it can be really annoying not just annoying steam can be deadly Steam from the bowels of the Earth Earth keeps the plant alive flowing through the pipes like blood through veins grar Iverson is a kind of steam doctor his job is to keep the plant in good health sodium in the steam corrodes metal greter has to find it and eliminate it before it can damage the turbines another element in the steam is also harmful to life grar can but he can smell it this is pure geothermal steam mixed with UNC condensable gases like hydrogen sulfide and which is a poisonous gas so um yes when I feel that the concentration is getting relatively High I I back a little bit away if the concentrations go above 3 400 parts per million then you would fall down and die so it you know what to avoid it it big problem hydrogen sulfide smells like rotten eggs but that [Music] problems Marcus and his crew are building the cooling towers and today they work down wind they can carry a meter to warn them of danger this is a H2S gas reader and it gives us a reading of how much gas there is there it sulfur this is much more accurate and if it starts it starts making noises it Peeps and if this reaches a level of 18 we have to leave the site cuz people start passing out cuz you can it once it goes past a certain level like when you drive into the area you can smell a bit of a smell and that maybe a level two or three here it okay for us to work 8 hours in about level 15 it goes above 15 we just have to go the level is creeping up toward the danger zone there this gas it travels in pockets and if this pocket comes around you sits maybe around your head you take one breath you pass out and if no one pulls you out of it unfortunately you die that every time you stay too so always someone to back you up but if you both pass out I hope you have a nice trip to [Music] [Music] heaven the land of ice is also the land of heat rising from the Earth ground steams sizzles and Bubbles Iceland is one of the most volcanically active regions on Earth we are standing in the middle of the western Icelandic volcanic Zone and you see certain uh surface manifestations like eruptive fishes uh to the sides both East and and west of us we have an older area which used used to be in the middle of the riftstone but has since drifted East and West the Mid-Atlantic Rift between the American and European continental plates is one long chain of active underwater volcanoes in the north they surface and Traverse Iceland which itself straddles the two plates as they move apart the rift has left a huge scar on the right is Europe on the left America in the middle sits H shidi once a ski station it something much more profitable [Music] the surrounding land gets plenty of rain about 30 in a year and the rain seeps down to the Hot Rocks heat and water the ingredients of steam grar is hunting for More Steam to feed the expanding plant but each Zone he inspects is not only different it changing grar and his crew never stop collecting data they use maps of underground activity to help decide where to drill they use the global positioning system to pinpoint possible sites from there grar uses his gut 10 years ago we had a massive earthquake which lasted for 4 years and the area Rose by 20 or 30 cm and this was due to a magmatic intrusion at 7 kilm depth below us so sampling the surface ferals gives us an indication of whether this magma is reaching the surface or not we measure the temperature of the springs and the pools we measure the the pH the acidity other things we do is we samp the gas coming from these Springs and these ferals the composition of the gas and the concentrations of certain constituents in the gas give us a direct indication of the temperature in the geothermal Reservoir beneath us so by sampling the surface gas we can map the subsurface Reservoir and we can have a better understanding and a better idea where to drill uh if the area would be developed in the future [Music] in volcanic regions where fire and water are abundant all you need to do is drill down about 6 to 9,000 ft to find steam at almost 500° f [Music] the steam flows from the wells through large pipes to the plant then the steam is cleaned of impurities before reaching its final destination the [Music] turbine the steam turns the turbine to power an electric generator the Italians pioneered electricity from Steam more than a century ago and it still works the same way at the turbine cold water forms a depression that accelerates the Steam and improves the turbine condenser the condenser is linked underground to a cooling tower inside pumps carry the water to the top where it [Music] fans on the way down water hits the air cools and returns to the [Music] condenser although it sits apart from the main producing Machinery the cooling tower is an essential part of the plant Tower number four still awaits its chimneys each is the size of a school bus and weighs as much as a grand piano yeah must be this to lift them they rented one of the biggest cranes in the country but it emergency Elsewhere on the site this is just terrible we won crane back today it tomorrow stop lifting it when the is coming over here it lift one R yeah I doubt it though set up the crane lift it in probably fasten it so annoying go nothing can happen till they get the crane back as suddenly as it vanished it back I this crane is such a little I know it standing on four legs on four little pieces of wood it should be yes but it just you know it it country it weighs 80 tons and has a 120t arm so long the crane operator can what he how get communication is very important with the crane driver you know if he goes down too fast and like you see this could break this floor for instance it just has to be exactly level and you can see how close it is the cut here and see it few millimeters here so this is very precise the crane operator has to set the chimney to within A4 of an inch then the crew must align it to a fraction of that [Music] all the while the crane stands by in case they need a lift and the meter running for rental it per hour we don the expensive crin we just want to do the job good but we try to adjust it as good as possible B now and uh later on we use special tools to finalize the adjustments no special tools here just Brute Force take take but it make the final adjustments by the end of the day all all four chimneys are in place now we can get rid of the expensive [Laughter] [Music] crane they still have to assemble the fans and there says a storm is [Music] brewing Iceland is the Saudi Arabia of steam this area contains some of the most productive steam wells in the world with huge reserves enough to power the whole country indefinitely but two Wells side by side May produce far different amounts of steam deciding which Wells to tap is the job of scientists like grar we are definitely gamling it difficult to say about a well prior to Drilling or prior to opening it up for the first time you need a lot of steam sometimes you find very good quality steam but there not enough of it generally speaking in this area you need just over 2 kilos of steam per second to produce each megawatt of electricity these Wells are probably producing some 17 18 kilos of steam per second and that eight or even 9 me of electricity so these are extremely good and we happy about them geothermal electricity has made Iceland the richest country per capita in all of Europe this gift from the earth seems inexhaustible so long as they tap the right Wells they can power the new turbines for the plant so we find enough Steam and I think we it now so we have more than enough at the [Music] moment with active volcanoes and plenty of rain Iceland is made for geothermal power but geothermal energy is everywhere if you dig deep enough far from any volcanoes in a French Village just a few miles from the German border an international team is developing a new type of geothermal technology it by a European Consortium 20 years in the making Iceland inspired the idea but the team had to invent the solution the plant opened just 3 months ago but the team has to constantly adapt to surprises at this moment the plant is shut down for repairs yes first you have to to hold on and to discre it this one is okay po supervises the repair assisted by his right hand man zavier advising the team is Peter a mechanic fromand to find WR I think it shaky but his advice is priceless the team is using a pump from Iceland and it hasn conditions a far cry from [Music] Iceland in Iceland geologists create maps of underground activity then decide where to drill giant steel drills rattle the ground 24 hours a day at depths of around 6,000 F Fe the drills reach reservoirs of steam at 500° F this is the raw material that flows up the well and through pipes to the plant where it electricity rain will come sooner or later to renew the reservoirs of steam to hit 500° rock here in France they have to drill down nearly 15,000 ft twice as deep as an Iceland the rock down there is dry so they have to sink two shafts one to inject water to produce steam another to pump the steam up when the steam leaves the power plant it pumped back into the well the French inject the well with local water some of the saltiest water in the world in fact the village here is called SS salt in the local dialect salt is eaten away at the steel pump and put everybody back to work breakdowns like this don in Iceland where the water is so pure you could bottle it because of the high salinity of the water and the the the number of particles which were on the on the water we damaged the inlet of the pump it coming from Iceland and in Iceland the water is less mineral ized than ours and we are now looking for a new mety of the pump one more time so we have to to find materials which can uh support this type of water and it find I think I think it was a corrosion H it up they need to find a new to resist corrosion in the meantime they Jerry riger Repair and put the pump back in place now it tests to do and we assume that this pump with the all metaller will list not so much time but enough to make the test we want and after we put everything out and change the pump [Music] itself on a normal day they could lay 15 to 20 sections of pipe today anxious to finish the repair they laid 25 we were as speed as we can and we did a good job today very good job the last [Music] day Peter is persuasive this is really the last one after that we wouldn [Music] with a second wind and the urge to get to bed they lay the last pipe in record time very good in my head very good and in my muscle it will go if at least so until Friday it will be good but we can manage it it seems to be very good on Monday they find a whole new [Music] setback Iceland is bracing for a big storm at H shidi Marcus install the fans for the cooling towers that was [Music] good the blades turn at more than 60 MPH so they need to be firmly anchored [Music] T it it little tool here Climer to tighten the bolts an ordinary wrench won [Music] do I love it it the job it tightening is maybe like 10 10 Newt M this is has to be 12200 it well it dropping the key Marcus has to push till he hears The Telltale click that level that we wanted it 1160 isn 1180 that means we pressure thank God they have to repeat the ordeal dozens of times for each fan the Iceland people oh yes finished it left when rain hits the site it creates halves and have knots the welders have shelter they can in the Rain the have KN are exposed to the elements Marcus is a have not inside the chimneys at least he has Shelter From the wind a visitor has brought the extreme weather tropical storm Bera probably the only tropical thing you Iceland to precisely angle the fan blades they it problem when we don tools people buy non-waterproof tools to bring to the wetest area in the country so now we have to put plastic over it seal it and now we can hardly see through the plastic it makes everything slippery and now I always like this the water goes down it rain that but this is what I get paid for helping Marcus is a student on summer break as the bolts are tightened she checks the angle of each blade for best performance 7.9 de is perfect and we only allowed to have 7.9 or 7.8 or8 we cannot have anything else and that know how hard it is to move this one like 00 0.1 it little student needs a boost sorry we just trying to get the box because our staff is so small she can plates there always some weird problems like this Blood okay she announces any movement in the blades angle down to the fraction of a degree what oh yeah [Music] sorry maybe she needs one more tool like a megaphone 90 8 7 point [Music] ulie is Marcus he years he cooling towers yet building his reputation took sacrifice I see my family 3 months in a year yeah I married with my job I have my wife is second sorry to say but it true this year his son is working with him pocket money for Steven and good company for his dad he wants to make his driving license he wants to have a car later on and I told him okay I help you you can work here you can make money for your driv driving license and we are together the whole time it but the boss treatment is it 32 or 22 2 okay the boss weather snow be easier to work in this is different cuz this is rain this is wet and the wind is so strong at the moment this is more like a storm you know it going and in winter it know it different we this the weather wins the rest of the fans are grounded and too fragile to be buffeted in this wind usually if it was something bigger we could probably lift it because these are so delicate we don chance so we all find little things we can do but it to carry on with the fan blades but what hope so ahead lies another set back for another crew at the pilot plant in France the repaired pump is ready for testing [Music] testing Polo and zavier are like expectant fathers proud and N we are a bit stressed because we have a lot of parameter to work on and to be sure that every every stage is running very well to increase progressively the flow to decrease the flow to be sure that the pump is running well it good start was running go pressure the engineers stand in theine conly monitor the output and [Music] pressure all goes well until zavier detects an anomaly what is leaking more than before the indicators are in the red now if we go over 40% you stop it no choice but to stop the pump and the test one of the pump seals has failed a small glitch with a big impact for the pump to bring up steam the pipe has to be airtight but a seal is leaking as a result they can the pressure they need in the office everybody is working because one ring has broken and we have to change it and it change this ring we have to have no pressure inside the hole and so we have to decrease this pressure by injecting some salt water so it needs time and money to be done so it to make geothermic [Music] to replace the faulty seal they have to lower the water level they call it killing the well they do it by adding salt to increase the water density for once their everyday enemy becomes an ally the faulty pump cost days of delay one week later they again once more hope returns pressure goes to the exchanger filter one gets water we have pressure inside engine is running everything ready everyone is back in place Polo at the controls and zavier at the command post what more adjustments and more tension I open filter one sensors do you see something is it still going up at last the pressure Rises and steam flows through the pump now we will be able to produce electricity with the flow we have on this pump we are able to produce electricity we are proud of what we do now we are a bit stressed because there is a lot of of risk and of pressure on the crew to do it but we are very proud of what we do now you don search for geothermal power you can make it if Sals Works it [Music] village it will fuel hope for geothermal power to one day supply the world in Iceland tropical storm Bera has moved on every morning at 730 Marcus arrived from rikic one morning ritual is as important as his coffee could they have play time with Bruno no there since I put it on him first they sort of ask me to now because they know that he has a vest before that they didn know they had dog wests what huh since he was 3 months old he living in the car with me on work site so everyone here knows him and he really good safety feature also for our company cuz like when we around the cooling towers he knows that so if we have a different company coming in wearing a different uniform he parks at them and lets us know straight away he dog as you can see the mountains here behind me that there like he does for 12 hours a day he gets to just basically Run free and I think he mean not to mention how much I spoil him Marcus boiling water kept the foundations of tower number four from freezing Tower number three was just a skeleton and the crew was still green yet soon they overtook their own schedule well the estimated time for a tower I think according to the contract is about 5 to 6 months like the first Tower took us maybe 5 months now we making a tower in about 3 months but don that working like acrobats in Wind and Rain they erected the towers without a single Calamity we have been actually very lucky there have been no serious accidents people have actually just crushed their hands broken broken a two fingers that happened here we we we built so far seven cooling towers here The Four Towers that Marcus worked on this year are all complete now the challenges move indoors inside the plant workers apply final touches and run the last tests before the turbines are turned on with the start up LOM trouble German Engineers from the company that installed the condenser detect a problem in the Maze of pipes one of the pumps that carries water to the cooling tower isn working he found MTI we are starting here a cooling circuit a small circuit with two parallel pumps they are working absolutely parallel and only one pump should work now we have tried it on that side this pump is working correctly and makes a pressure of around 1.5 bars that should be when the pump is working and here this pump makes a pressure of zero that means no water is Flowing although it is absolutely parallel and we assuming that something is wrong here in this suction side no suction no power somewhere in this maze lies the tiny problem that shut down the whole plant absolute but when pump number one was running we had the full pressure on the suction side of the pump so with that the plant drafts every engineer to solve the mystery we we start now pump number one we opens the suction valve start the pump look to the pressure then we do the same on this side and afterwards when it has no pressure they have to open the pipeline as a last resort they decide to open the pipe itself and examine the suction valve that [Music] engineer but the valve seems to be working fine the mystery remains can be blocked let try it okay we have seen it correctly or better this let SP it in with no more ideas they put the valve back and try again looks good okay is the yeah go now we have the [Music] pressure this m need a kick there was a lot of G in this area maybe maybe but now we have the pressure all things are okay the problem was that maybe something has forced this flap into a closed position and now when we have opened it had it moved at sometimes a little bit it has gone now in open position it running well fine [Music] okay nearby a familiar face still working up high but not in the towers I holiday no I it so um you know there until the next Towers come up so basically I just got assigned to a different job they asked me where I like to go and well the day they asked me it was really bad weather outside so I chose to come inside and ever since then it is fine I week it the cooling towers I for like two and a half years now it quite nice just to do something different and you know so I in about a year get back into the cooling towers until then it mean I could go on holiday you know without pay of course for a year and just come back but yeah it see I haven exciting part I think there planned I mean as long as I have a job and everything I different job to that I don think token viewers responsible to anyone it [Music] nice right on schedule thanks partly to Marcus the new generators fire [Music] up in less than a year the young plant has doubled its output year by year geothermal power plays a bigger role in producing electricity and the planted H shidi takes Iceland One Step near its goal to become the first country with no need for coal or oil Iceland inspires other nations to tap their natural gifts wind waves sun energy as clean as it is endless geologists have mapped another huge steam Reservoir at hel shidi enough to double its output again one slight problem the pipes are already as Tangled as they can get so the factory can expand they plant right next door [Music]	Success
Spaceship Earth: Our Planet's Fragile Future | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXNoDliKyqU	SLICE Science	[Music] for [Music] imagine this just 50 years ago no one had ever seen the Earth people say to me I wonder what it be like to be on a spaceship and I say to you you don you astronaut 5 4 3 2 1 Zer all engine R lift up off we have a lift off 32 minutes past the hour we got a roll to [Music] clear and program [Music] oh my God look at that picture over there there that pretty got a color film Jim can I got it right oh that [Applause] shot one of the great revelations in my lifetime that have come out of science that will be spoken about 3,000 years hence occurred on Christmas Eve of 1968 when Apollo went around the Dark Side of the Moon and for the first time in human history we saw not a a sunrise or moonrise but an earth rise and in that sort of sudden moment of Illumination we saw that we were not an infinite Horizon we were a finite planet we didn New Wealth but to return with a new vision of life itself and in doing so the whole Paradigm shifted [Music] I think for sh is our scientists have had half a century to analyze our ship as a whole now for the first time they can see where we from and where we [Music] [Music] for many centuries we were gazing outside of the planet and this made us think in a different way about God Humanity uh Power uh what on it was the outside look that created modernity if you like and in a sense if we look back onto Earth from outter space which is only possible if you have an space vessel Rockets things like that when you may start to think differently about our planet what we are doing to the planet what we are doing to ourselves so I guess it paradigm shift I think the last 50 years have been in particular advancement in systems thinking quite generally many disciplines have not yet understood that they still think you know reducing reducing in in science and in focus and so on is the progress of science but it progress of Science of the the last decade was taking the pieces and integrating them back to a holistic understanding modern science is system science for for [Music] [Music] it Planet it or it way this is one system which will have system properties which you can analyze by looking just at the biology or just at the physics we now know that there are some uh negative feedback type mechanisms that keep the planet Earth relatively stable that help to stabilize the planet and they they do involve living organisms e [Music] the sunlight has instigated the development of what is probably the biggest invention in the history of our planet planet with is photosynthesis so can take an energy Quantum from the sunlight combine it with CO2 and then you can create Sugar Plus oxygen and this is the basic formula for our Evolution on this planet now Sugar means you can create biomass of course you can build higher forms of proteins it a billion years long plants on the land like the algae in the oceans are acting as cooling agents for the planet the atmosphere of Earth has 21% oxygen in it and of course it which enables large complex animals to exist [Music] [Music] the interesting thing is not only do you create oxygen but you draw down the CO2 from the atmosphere and you store it in biomass and so on a tree will fall into water so it cannot be oxidized again and this tiny little part of carbon that is taken out of the natural cycle that is the source of the so-called fossil fuels and it takes 500 million years to 1 billion year to create that for most of our career as a species we human beings got energy through the food that we ate which grew from sunlight or from animals that ate plants and we also exert Ed energy into the environment by way of muscle power initially just our own muscles and then with uh human slavery and by domesticating animals so our use of energy was on a pretty rudimentary basis really until just the last couple of hundred years when we gained access to fossil fuels back in 1850 which is really the Industrial Revolution coal was about 18% of our energy Supply at that point and wood biomass was over 80% in 1850 that our only hydrocarbon fossil hydrocarbon was coal arguably oil started in Canada in 1858 oil is very unique it dense it store it world if you project the amount of energy that about 6 billion Jews of energy and if you translate that into you know how much work would that be for a human being to generate that much energy I think it works out to in in the order of six years you know if you had that person paid at us minimum wage that barrel of oil would be worth you know something like $140,000 that valuable and useful oil is the fossil fuels have created our wealth they civilization they have enriched the lives of billions of people in ancient times fire made us human in the past few hundred years and fossil fuels made us modern energy is the master resource we barrels of oil per day that required to run society and as of the year 2011 we burned about 1.2 trillion barrels of oil what is stunning to me about that consumption is that 50% of it has been burned since 1988 so we barrels of oil per year we Barrel [Music] Fields hey what [Music] for before after e for fossil fuels also involve huge flows of money the oil money often fuels tyranny and stability and Corruption uh it is behind many of the conflicts in the world we actually pay about 10 times more to sustain military forces meant to intervene in the Persian Gulf than we pay to buy oil from the Persian Gulf conventional oil is already in Decline and we at least three Saudi arabas worth of new conventional oil just to maintain that that decline on a very very shallow level going forward there return on energy investment you have to use a certain amount of energy to drill a well to build pipelines to produce the oil the net energy yield of drilling a vertical well into the Garfield in Saudi Arabia back in the probably at least 100 to one so we invested a a barrel of energy to N Out 100 barrels of of useful energy now we Frontiers very deep water and so the net energy return on that is probably somewhere around 25 to one we tar Sans only 20% of the Taran are are shallow enough to be surface minable and that about 5 to1 80% are only recoverable by so-called insitu methods that have a net energy return of about 2.9 to one we about two barrels of useful energy we wouldn Alternatives if we look at shil oil we have to find enough new production to make up for 40% decline every year to keep production flat and that requires a lot of drilling and and a lot of hydraulic fracturing if you look at just the public push back against the technology of fracking it very [Music] high yes you have different opinions uh when they heard they were coming in a number of people are excited cuz they they most of the people have leased their land so I would say over 90% in our County are leas so for them it just I then there very concerned about the industrialization and the contamination yeah my other half she got all pissed off with me cuz I was fighting with them all the time it like you know something I protect what we own from being destroyed we already lost the water and she was mad cuz I was constantly fighting with them you know her thing was you know just lay down and be a good little gas wh as like no so she walked out on me then you have neighbors pissed off because you got signs in your yard you other ones that from the town well there well thank God for you you don problem but over here we do it area they drive neighbors against neighbors people that normally wouldn hate you hate you because you have water problems now and they year they locations at some point there is a side right off to your right as we drive up here you to see it straight down the runway off to the left there there and that rig so the rig is drilling under the Speedway they can be fenced in they can be concealed they can be bmed up plant trees around them they non-descript I mean you can make them fit into pretty much any environment oil production from the two biggest tight oil fields in the world will likely be a bubble that will last maybe 10 to 12 years consider that the oil that we today took 500 million years to accumulate 500 million years of solar energy preserved in that oil and we every year that works out to about 5 million years worth of solar energy burned every year in terms of our oil consumption and 14,000 years of solar energy every day so that tells us one thing that certain this a non-renewable finite resource it foreseeable lifespan of the human race as a species on this this planet this is the big intervention Homo sapiens has found a way to release the carbon back and to reoxidize it that means you enhance the greenhouse effect in an artificial way but at the same time you take away all this useful energy because this energy would be useful for future Generations as well but we just consume it we burn it it gone and we cannot wait another 500 million years to build back yeah e one thing is completely certain and that is that the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere is rising an ominously fast that rise is primary due to what humans are doing no one doubts that also it is absolutely clear that uh extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere produces extra warming there that the situation has turned scientists into Navigators monitoring our [Music] Direction there clearest observation window is the melting Arctic no generation of scientists has faced a challenge so difficult so important or so exciting we history of our species like the one we now we a planet scale influence and know it we now for the first time have this ability to observe this stuff are we destined like most species when we hit a resource limit to have a jagged rebound period or can we with this gift of foresight that we have smooth it out [Music] consciously I started doing Arctic Research In 1970 when the Navy decided to send the first British nuclear submarine to the Arctic the director of the Scott polar Research Institute persuaded them that it would be a very good thing to do scientific work and collect ice thickness data so he pushed me forward as the person to do it so I going on them for about 40 years now we months the ice then was very formidable and most of it was called multi-year ice that year and it was very thick maybe 3 m thick heavily rided with these great piles of deformed ice nobody had managed to get to the North Pole in an ice breaker in those days because the ice was so heavy in the last 15 years the amount of multier ice has diminished and now there ice that grew that year so it so thick it doesn it routinely go to the North Pole in an icebreaker now crashing through this stuff to somebody who Arctic as it was in the 70s and it world the Arctic has warmed up about 3 times as fast as the planet as a whole what happens in the Arctic is what the planet in a few years time Nature has a certain order in everything that it does as a result of warming the bodies of ice will melt much faster the oceans will expand because of the heat that they are absorbing and therefore you will get sea level rise [Music] complex nonlinear systems can behave in an Abrupt way and even worse they can behave in an irreversible way you have activated or transgressed a Tipping Point you know if you stand in front of an abys and somebody gives you a push from behind you may fall down if this person after you are falling already but just take the hand back doesn will not miraculously reemerge and be put back onto the cliff that call a Tipping Point the so-called Gulf Stream system in the ocean where we have seen a Slowdown over the last decades quite significant slowdown already could the Gulf Stream be shut down completely yes it happened during the I ages several times with green lamp melting there is a very high chance that not only the circulation will slow down in the North Atlantic but it may be shut down completely yeah so that element here clearly the situation for three or four years now in the United States Canada but you have extremely warm weather on the west coast and extremely cold weather on the East Coast this has to do very likely with the warming of the Arctic The Retreat of the sea eyes which is affecting what we call the chat stream this is this rhythm of high-speed wind around the Northern Hemisphere and in general this uh Jetstream is creating certain waves for a few days only so-called rosby waves and what we find is with with disproportional Arctic warming these rosby waves get get stuck they can create unusual heat waves or the Californian drought this is a big surprise for many people because they feel global warming means oh it warmer but with our dynamical weather patterns are being reorganized through the perturbation of the chat stream for example in a highly nonlinear Way by human interference it different story yeah it but it terrifying everywhere on the planet is now affected by human [Music] activities well one of the most obvious changes is that species are moving to higher elevations in mountains because it gets colder at higher elevations and they closer to to the North Pole and the South Pole and that if you like is the real kind of signal that it differences in the amount of warming in different regions rather than by some other factor which is changing in the environment the best evidence is from Europe and North America because that where the been most volunteer amateur naturalists who distributions of species for many many years if this rate of movement carries on for the next 100 or so years which is the general expectation with climate warming then the whole distributions of animals on the whole planet are going to move to somewhere else from where they used to be so this is just a major re arrangement of the whole of biological life on Earth [Music] if there then they they will be failing to expand in the north but they will be retreating in the South a number of organisms now are very sensitive to these changes so 500 billion tons of carbon dioxide has been Tak taken up by the oceans We Now understand that over time that has caused a 30% increase in the acidity of the oceans and we the first thing you begin to see is more changes in high latitudes because more CO2 goes into the water at high latitudes see changes in the Arctic in the Antarctic region first but now we out to the present and as you go out to the end of the century we see that the entire Arctic Ocean and parts of the North Atlantic and the North Pacific are now corrosive from top to bottom that means shells and skeletons would dissolve from top to bottom the same thing is true for the anarch region here all the way out to Australia and parts of uh South America but even in the tropical Zone there are conditions no longer favorable for curls to produce your shells or skeletons this is what the shell normally looks like completely clear this is what happens when you put it into 1100 micro atmosphere CO2 for 30 days look how dissolve the [Music] shs we see a slow down the rate of growth of corals and perhaps 25% or more of the fish that live in the oceans spend some time of their life in a COR Reef habitat some fish for example the clownish they actually move towards their predators in a high CO2 world as opposed to avoiding their predators they do this because the CO2 has an impact on their neuro receptors and so the fear response they have is just the opposite of what it should be and there are other organisms that do well in a high CO2 world for example jellyfish so you could see there whole shift in the [Music] ecosystem and our planet about one out of every seven people on average rely on Seafood for protein in their [Music] diet for George deoki is witnessing Extinction in real time he spent 40 years in Alaska studying gilot the seabirds eat the Arctic codfish that live under pack ice the ice was pulling offshore and taking their food away and then I started seeing these major die- offs of chicks in the nest polar bears are obviously the the best known and most iconic part of the pack ice ecosystem if you see a polar bear you are seeing X number of articad that has been that been eaten by a seal and then that seal has been eaten by the bear I slipped in a tent with nothing other than my shotgun uh and frequently not even unpacked because I never saw a polar bear uh for 28 years and suddenly we had a mother with two full grown Cubs coming up to our tent site after I got over my fear of polar bears I I started really feeling sorry for them they swim in 150 Mi or more they then get to land they they are eating things like gilot eggs and gilam chicks male pull be weigh from 800 to 12200 lb and to have them be eating something as small as a gilmont egg which is not as big as a hen you realize that they are very hard up for food I didn the loss of a major ecosystem or the or seeing a species that basically has depended on that system for the past 25,000 years have to deal with a loss of that system the speed of global warming now depends on feedback loops we cannot control like the thawing of permafrost the way it works is that permafrost gets warmer the liar that thows in the summer gets deeper and deeper every year and the carbon that was stored in the perm Frost for tens of thousands of year gets relase to the atmosphere then that carbon as greenhouse gas influences the climate also and it gets warmer if the climate gets warmer then we get like more throwing of that active layer in the summer and the more throwing we have then the more carbon get activated so this is what we call the feedback BL because like one process influences the other and that goes on until probably all the carbon that is there stored in the Perma FR is used to be released in the atmosphere permafrost extends under all of the Arctic land masses but it also extends out to sea it of the last ice age if you have warm water the water melts the seabed the permafrost melts and that releases methane because there the subsea permafrost and methane is a very very powerful greenhouse gas it 20 times as powerful as carbon dioxide so if you release a lot of me ethane into the atmosphere you to accelerate global warming and that that happening at the moment but there right there that example w oh that was way up [Music] there but yes warming events can be very harmful today the world is just sort of starting to show signs of the conditions we saw at the end of the peran the end per mass extinction happened about 251 million years ago in it species on Earth and we start to think well how could a huge amount of um volcanic activity cause a global mass extinction like this and most of the interest focuses on not the lava itself but the gases that come out with volcanism I think the main culprit we think of is is the carbon dioxide it started to release methane and so what we think happened at the end of the peran is we get this sort of runaway greenhouse effect whereby um we and carbon dioxide warming up um the planet before you know it the world has just got so hot that it becomes extremely hard for life and we see a sort of a mass dying of of animals on land and in the sea exactly at the same time we start of that effect any report from the late peran would say we be be wary be careful the world is is starting to break down and losing its ability to cope with greenhouse gases and the big unknown for us today is how fast things happen will this happen in 50 years so will it happen in 5,000 years W it [Music] [Music] bra our Engineers are responding to the crisis but every solution faces complications for for for for Fore fore foree speech foreign spee comp for economical is social Iceland is the only industrialized nation that has come close to running entirely on renewable energy we are a volcanic active country that has the geothermal resources underneath to tap into and what we do is we drill holes into that Reservoir about 2 km deep get the hot steam up out of the ground pipe it into the power plant then take it into a turbine and Generator set and produce electricity I think it our electricity um that comes from geothermal but over 90% of our heating comes from geothermal I think the societal benefits of geothermal District heating have been great for my country the fact that you can heat your home with very little cost all year round you can bathe you never run out of hot water public swimming pools all over town that are open year round people waste energy in a way they don homes they know it it doesn not every country can use geothermal to supply as big a part of its electricity mix with geothermal as we can but it can play a much bigger role in many countries geothermal makes it possible to grow inside of these green houses all through the year Iceland can produce enough vegetables peppers cucumbers tomatoes anything that grows inside the greenhouse we can produce we have enough geothermal energy and we have enough electricity and uh we can we can even uh we can produce that much that we can feed a lot of Europe with our growing the final step was Iceland plan to fuel its vehicles with hydrogen just put electricity into water and that separates water into oxygen and hydrogen and the hydrogen molecule actually stores the electron and then you pump the hydrogen into a vehicle and you go through the fuel cell process but then you can see things dripping from the tail pipe and that water Iceland pilot project of hydrogen stations we actually realized by using it this station with only 30 cars that if you if we would had 200 Cars we would actually be running this with a profit the car manufacturers expected the hydrogen to actually develop faster and the fuel cell would be ready faster also the um recession we hit we had a huge problem with the American car manufacturers and so on there infrastructure when you have no vehicles that beginning and the question is where is that money coming from so we have the early adopters disadvantage everywhere where there has been testing of battery electric vehicles or hydrogen vehicles or any of the new technologies the public is in general very positive but sometimes people don their money where their mouth is Japan is also a volcanic island with great geothermal resources but for its energy the country chose nuclear power despite its history with atomic bombs [Music] but after the weapons were used in Japan and after the end of World War II then people began to want to transition the thinking away from the weapons a a little bit more to what they call peaceful uses 10,000 scientists and Engineers are at work to prove that atomic energy does not mean only the atomic bomb and that led in many ways to the nuclear power Fleet most of the reactors that we have were licensed in the early between then and the early they were designed in the 60s after you paid for the reactor it cheap to operate so that in the staying power of of nuclear and the other piece is really the advantages from a climate perspective the US government under President Obama launched a program to support the development of nuclear power plants because of climate change it seemed that finally nuclear power was going to make a big comp back and you saw around the world a very upbeat view about nuclear power and that was what people called the nuclear Renaissance where the Chernobyl the terrible nuclear accident of 1986 was seen as being far in the past and then came Fukushima [Music] e [Music] [Music] [Music] there [Music] [Music] you been forced out of their homes for several years now some of them will never be able to return uh the the communities that existed will never reform even if from a technical and a medical or health perspective people could come back to the area and it impact the people been evacuated it is impacting their entire economy and I suggest that the impact would be at least half a trillion dollars the biggest area where there be impact is on the ocean the expectation is the majority of the contamination went out to the Sea you had a natural event like the tsunami which to some extent was localized in Time Event it happened and then the waters receded and you had a tremendous tragedy with people dying then you had a secondary effect which was the impact of the nuclear power plant which is a long-term crisis so it that tsunami has been made to last 40 years and to think then that they came from a place that was used to generate electricity it just shows that in a way this technology has real fundamental problems that need to be [Music] addressed everywhere in the world people reconsidered nuclear power some countries decided to continue like France China had a pause and then has renewed it Finland said yes Abu Dhabi said yes Germany said [Music] no in Germany it is a deliberate decision to say the future of modern industrial societies is a climate friendly decarbonized industry why do you harvest energy in such a indirect way photosynthesis has an energy efficiency of 1% so why not using the sunlight directly it really yeah even today I mean average uh efficiency rates are 12% [Music] 15% every person on this planet more less has access to that [Music] energy photosynthesis created life on Earth in the end as we know it if this is possible to create human civilization based on 1% efficiency I sure we can build it based on 10% efficiency again a no brainer [Music] the machine [Music] [Music] here for [Music] we pH best con [Music] house for [Music] for for kind of crowed on the roadways right now as you take a look at 10 onto is 95 southbound big delays there as you head toward the top of the full warm Bridge delays on giant a 20 km traffic St from the city you know my three favorite words in all of this is be aware of scale when you alternators I think I think there a chance that collectively Renewables can replace the current energy through point in 2011 primary energy was 33% oil 30% coold 24% gas 6% large Hydro 4% nuclear and 1.59% non-hydro Renewables and that includes wind solar geothermal and burning biomass that starting from the biggest piece of the solution is figuring out how to lower our energy throughput a lot without you know radically uh reducing people of living not going to be easy uh it really needs a new paradigm you need to look at what global population 1860 when we got started on oil population was about 1.2 billion when I was born uh it was about 2 and A2 billion you know now we billion people so it lifetime [Music] [Music] the only way we because of hydrocarbons I mean that was raiding the Treasure Trove the so-called Green Revolution that allowed us to Triple production of crops like corn and uh many other crops is based on hydrocarbons the net energy return on investment for the energy in the food that we eat is about 10 to one so 10 parts largely hydrocarbons input diesel fuel for tractors nitrogen fertilizers some natural gas pesticides antibiotics overall it to1 if you look at North America a lot of it was built after cars and it was built on the Assumption of cars modern shopping centers offer the convenience of close a-and shopping and ample parking space the vast sea of houses created by this explosion of the urban population flows outward in Endless waves we can drive anywhere we want to at any time for any reason including fun now in our life time comes one of those rare moments when a great door swings open and man enters a new age the age of the gem yes the real secret is not only a great source of energy but also the freedom to make it work for everybody and using the magic of research oil companies compete with each other in taking the petroleum molecule part and rearranging it into well you name it Fabrics toothbrushes tires insecticides Cosmetics weed killers a whole galaxy of things to make a better life on Earth and if you have both of these things any goal is possible it destination Unlimited while modern economies grew through energy intensive consumerism very few people thought to wonder how long it could [Music] last limits to growth was written 40 years ago in 1972 for the first time in modern history started the discussion about whether growth is good now we are 40 years later and of course we have learned a [Music] lot we have been increasing income and particularly among those people that don consumers you know we should have so we have grown the income we have grown the population and we have grown the ecological footprint although in a very very silly manner if you look at this from spaceship earth point of view don [Music] good and we growth that is largely based on carbon what does that growth lead to what is it we actually want the number of Brands you to in a day is some vast number uh whether or not you watch TV you know it this kind of bath of branding and and buying our conventional journalistic Enterprise which is a big chunk of what people absorb dayto day is not grappling with these questions if you look at the history of let environmental problems or consumption itself has rarely been one of the things people write about it don disregard for the consumption story but it you know there maybe for most people most people greed is what fuels the economy and the rising demand isn coming from Japan it the United States it from Western Europe it China India Middle East itself Brazil it globalization are becoming part of the global economy we went from a situation where 2/3 of world energy was consumed in the industrial countries to now it half and half between the developed and the developing countries so what these numbers tell you is a story and it story about the tremendous economic growth that you Emerging Markets it shift in the global economy between who manufactures who consumes it of needing jobs needing buildings housing needing Transportation all of which takes energy most of that energy is wasted shed as useless heat that is only visible through infrared the your car uses each day about 100 times its weight in ancient plants and then it is so inefficiently used that only about 0.3% of the oil burnt in your car actually moves you as the driver the rest of it is wasted or moves the heavy steel car you know why is it that our design standard is not that all homes should be 80% or 90% energy efficient and by that I mean that 90% of the electricity that they need they either generate from within or they offset the need for to to begin with why isn standard and you think about doing it that way then that approach you know I think we take for granted the electricity that we have and and I do think we don as we should no I don notice the mortgage payments you know the maintenance on the house the upkeep on the house tell the only time thing about it is you know when you hit the the peaks in The Valleys so you know we went through a really cold winter and we just got our last gas bill was huge and then we noticed there was a significant change but on a month to month basis no it doesn I can hydro or what we you have to redo the whole next week or actually if I coach I thought you hand that last night pretty well what happened now frame of [Music] for speech speech speech [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] fore [Music] [Music] as I think we redefine wealth and poverty we wealth downward and poverty upward I think that the transition towns are an example of of real social change in action the transition movement is quite an audacious idea it ordinary people make happen in the place where they live where they try to build their local economy decarbonize it but to see that as a historic opportunity to do something extraordinary so a transition group is always putting on events showing films setting up projects running events that introduce possibilities uh into the community Consciousness so this is the healthy Futures Garden and uh this works with the local doctor local people who have obesity or heart disease or whatever how to grow food there great kind of winter staple vegetable so this this is uh this is red Russian kale and really really delicious we nicely with this which is rocket or Rola they call it in Italy totness spends 30 million a year on food and of that 22 million is spent through just two supermarkets so more than half of what we spend on food leaves this town the upside of that though is that a third of what we spend on food we spend in local shops so our take is that actually that foundation on which we build the economy of the future we run a scheme here called the totas pound which is a a local currency you can only spend in local businesses with local Traders so um these are the new toness pound notes that we will be printing it is it is backed by Sterling and they got local scenes and you can use the toness pound in about 70 shops so the idea of the tonis pound or the idea of local currencies is to keep money in the local community because of course you can spend it in London is Happy brilliant thanks very much I think the incentive is just feeling that you something for your local community so what you can see on the big building over there that Hall and uh the solar panels on the roof of that were put in place by TT and the idea is that the money that from the electricity there goes into Energy Efficiency fund for both for the building and for further a field in the town one of the key things we here is is called transition streets so transition streets says get a group of people on your street together knock on the doors do you want to be part of this you meet seven times in each other houses the first time you get to know each other the rest of the times you one week you talk about water another week you talk about energy and then you make pledges of things you each session if we of joining this group you must put solar panels on your roof we would have not even started but the first thing we did was oh let let more Recycling and then as we discussed and we had ideas one among one another the idea of solar came out and at the end of the course we had actually put solar panels on our roof but we were taken there a bit at a time that tells me how much CO2 we it tells me how much I and how much I I encouraged to have a go at taking green initiatives because my friends are there encouraging me into it and I haven to take the initiative on my own I got someone there helping me along yeah yeah it became a fun thing to do didn it was like working as a team yes and that that you would have normally have taken on a lot of what transition does goes on underneath the radar it rebuilding relationships and connections and kind of inspiring people in ways that actually you don just first come and walk around the town I cash economy so I fix bikes for pies or for fruit someone said he poem he wrote me this beautiful poem and and that exchange nobody knows how you decarbonize and reduce the oil dependency and build the resilience of of community after Community across the world but the only way to figure it out is by not waiting for anyone permission but by having a go and starting to do it and there 44 countries in thousands of communities around the world and together we figuring this [Music] out let of for kind in [Music] in the world we have 192 captains you know all the heads of state the main challenge is for them to agree on what direction to send the ship we already have the technologies that are necessary to solve the problem so the problem is not lack of Technology lack of money it is the lack of will it Global Society to decide exactly what to do one of the most intricate patterns of all is our civilization we are the complex system also I mean it guess in system sphere you go beyond that you say here is the system and here am I so to speak or it whatever and here it yeah the interesting thing is that the individual particles create the system and the system at the same time is influencing the individual particles so we have to think in interactions rather than linear cause effect relationships I think that really for the last 50 years our culture has been highly individualistic all of the narratives we tell each other are focused on on on people as individuals striving to maximize their uh self-interest and what uh it turns out that the human evolutionary story is also one of of Highly Cooperative group groups to tell that story we have to begin with what makes our group so different than the average primate group there you at the expense of your group members or you could succeed as a group compared to other groups the current thinking is that what makes our species so different than other primate species is that mechanisms evolved that suppressed our ability to gain at the expense of each other within groups and so therefore we had to succeed as [Music] teenss human society it social insect colonies than we ever knew so this has been a metaphorical comparison for a millennia what that it during the last 10 or 20 years often people associate evolution with competition evolution is just as much about cooperation and typically cooperation is required before competition and so most of what we regard as distinctively human in terms of our minds such as language symbolic thought and also cultural transmission are all forms of cooperation that required a kind of intelligence predicated on trust this became a new evolutionary process where we could now adapt to our environments much more quickly because what we learned we could share and we could transmit and it that our ancestors could spread out of Africa and adapt to all of the different climatic zones and hundreds of ecological niches the other great scientific Revelation that will be spoken about 3,000 years hence is the fact that we are all literally brothers and sisters studies of the human genome leave no doubt whatsoever that race is an utter fiction the human genetic endowment is a Continuum indeed all of us are descended from a handful of pids who walked out of the rift valley some 60,000 years ago but the fascinating thing about that Revelation is that if you accept that we cloth by definition every culture shares the same raw genius yet we we all look a little different because we were colored by our place in the [Music] sun in some senses the people in different parts of the Earth are genetically different from each other of course skin pigmentation is an awesome example of that if you live in a very sunny place then you need dark skin are you still getting enough to manufacture vitamin D if you then you need to be lighter skin but then you get seasonal changes then your skin pigmentation needs to track the seasonal changes and so that suntanning is We Now understand that we began to change our relationship with the Sun a long time [Music] ago the passenger cabin was the Earth uninfluenced by hum hum with wild plant and animal species the big change 13,000 years ago was the origins of Agriculture the development of Agriculture or food production there was just much more food available for us and so the result was population explosion food surpluses technology writing Empires invention everything interesting it meant that human impact on Earth was far greater several thousand people require more resources they use more soil they require more water they use the land more intensively the Maya were the most advanced civilization in the new world they Cho down their forests the result was soil erosion reducing their own potential to grow food there were too many people for the landscape to support what could have saved the Maya civilization from collapse is doing something different 50 years before that collapses often develop rather rapidly when a society is at its peak the Maya thought that everything was going wonderfully and it was but they did not recognize the warning signs for the future this is very illustrative of the problems we have on spaceship earth even though we have worked for 20 years you know to try to agree on a carbon tax we have not managed to agree our children about the spirit of Kyoto and remember well the place and the time where humankind first chose to Embark together on a long-term sustainable relationship between our civilization and the Earth we feel that we should follow the stipulation in the convention to have an new meeting because there are many questions to be discussed in cop it gives me great pleasure to welcome you to the sixth Conference of parties to the United Nations framework convention on climate change Mr President Saudi Arabia strongly uh oppose that proposal to give Canada an additional 70 million tons of CO2 let us all capitalize on The Good Will present in this room it gives me great pleasure to declare open the 13th session it gives me great pleasure to declare open the 14th session in addressing climate change it is inadmissible to undermine the efforts of developing countries to get rid of poverty and backwardness we know the fault lines because we them for years these International discussions have essentially taken place now for almost two decades and we have very little to show for it other than an increase acceleration of the climate change phenomenon the time for talk is over I would call it a tragedy of the commons we have this Global Commons this place where we put all of our carbon dioxide emissions and and we know we shouldn it someone in Japan will do it or someone in China might do it so so why should I stop so we all want to blame someone else we hope Cancun signifies a major step in action to deal with the challenge of climate change it gives me great pleasure to declare open the 19th convention on on climate change we human enemy than we are to fight something abstract and diffuse such as climate change and it think of it that that altruism at one scale turns into selfishness up the ladder so uh when I looking after myself that could be bad for my group if I group that could be bad for my clan if I bad for my nation if I my nation that could be bad for the worldwide economy so goodness turns into Evil all groups share that evolutionary Instinct including corporations well it number of Western democracies run on donations from large corporations campaigns in the US especially are very dollar intensive and the fossil fuel industry has been ponying up for years they contributors to politicians uh they hire some of the the best lobbyists in DC to do their bidding they have a lot of entrenched interests in Congress and they defend them I would say the extractive industries oil coal gas as well as nuclear interests and all the rest they do everything they buy the politicians they also work through the public the mind of the public to try to create the iCal demand for the agenda that they have Coke Industries started in the Heartland take Charles and David Coke for instance the two owners of coke Industries a large private conglomerate they refine oil and gas together we are Coke I did visit the David h k Hall of human Origins and I was surprised by how front and center the messaging around climate seemed to be they were asserting that humankind has survived all sorts of temperature shifts for thousands of years and insinuating that we to weather climate change like it a normal thing when it historically unprecedented I think the fact that the Hall of human origin is hosted by the Smithsonian really helps give it a serious sense of legitimacy what they do is they place the question in your mind is it a hoax Homo sapiens experienced large changes in climate early humans met the challenges they faced by being adaptable caring for the young using Fire and Building shelters come explore the [Music] ID these are the people who are profiting off of wrecking our climate uh 350 parts per million is the safe upper limit of carbon in the atmosphere right now we 400 much higher than the atmospheric conditions on which civilization developed and that life on Earth is dependent on what would it take to get back to 350 a lot of work but it insurmountable and it price it would mean decarbonizing the entire planet uh in the near term it means taking all the fossil fuel reserves we have all the fossil fuel reserves accounted for by coal oil and gas companies and leaving 80% of those in the ground for our investment campaigns we producers on Earth we want to revoke their social license to do business as usual the same way that social movements have done that with tobacco with slavery with other issues we know that culture moves politics not the other way around from a Global Perspective young people are a seen as a moral voice across cultures and I think that really important here because that upper hand we do have moral Clarity to what we planet with the same climate we always had once we start thinking about this in terms of right and wrong that think we breakthroughs if you look at climate change alone then the CO2 footprint of today isn sustainable but progress has been very questionable and in any of our scenarios currently the uh climate change will will go well beyond um the two de of um uh global warming that is seen as the maximum that the world can handle the energy mix of the world over the decades will change change in such a big system is slow and it will take many decades for it to to reform itself the relative quantities will shift more towards gas more towards Renewables as the world continues on a sustainable path so I see oil as part of a sustainable [Music] future the Obama administration tentatively approve Shell begin oil extraction off the Alaskan Coast this summer Federal scientists estimate the Arctic region contains up to 15 billion barrels of oil and shell has long fought to drill in the icy waters of the chuckchi sea shell said quote we remain committed to operating in a safe environmentally responsible Manner and look forward to exploring our chuckchi leases in the weeks to come [Music] [Music] a big problem in the past is a conflict between the long-term interests of any society and the short-term interest from some people who profit by doing things that are bad for the society those are the several reasons why at their Peak these societies did not see what was happening to them and did not take corrective action [Music] so who is there today in the modern world who and a short answer is most of us are pursuing short-term [Music] goals so we live in a pathological Society in part because we have a narrative that pretends if we all just maximize our appetites then the society will work well there is a sense in which a society can function well without its members having the welfare of the society in mind we could be concerned mostly about our own reputations for example and yet in order to have a good reputation we have to do good things for the [Music] group but it received economic version which pretends that if individuals just strive to maximize their monetary gain and you have no restrictions then Society is going to work well that has to be the most toxic metaphor that Unleashed upon Society it and to focus on the bad stories of the societies that collapsed some societies have not collapsed partly because of good luck that they were living in Rob areas and partly because they made farsighted decisions to avoid damaging their environments Japan during the Tokugawa era the Shogun gave orders that the forest be conserved but that order would not have been obeyed unless the Japanese people were receptive to preserving their own environment and their own forest [Music] Tokugawa also called the Ado period began in 16003 it established an ethic of conservation that lasted until the late 19th century [Music] for for for when it unfolded the jaw-dropping nature of what those waves did was stunning [Music] but then I also focused in on this astonishing sobering reality that there were these tsunami stones that had been erected in the Hills there in centuries past the inscriptions are just haunting one of them says do not build below this Stone remember the Great Waves of the past in Japan where they they knew there there the the engineers who designed the nuclear power plant and the vital systems put the generators in in places that could be flooded and stuff like that you say you know hello what is it about us the more we recognize our own traits and patterns of behavior the more apt we are to be able to build into our Norms as individuals as families and then as communities the capacity to say at least some of the time that we need to be making this decision based on a longer time scale it and the now it and the and the long so that takes it also into this other special realm the realm of values you can in problem or related issues with just technology or just rules if you don have people [Music] evolve for so imagine this the scientists studying spaceship earth have finally discovered the answer to an ancient question what is the purpose of our journey for [Music] do we know the way forward I think there we do know the way forward we to create a planetary organism somehow we have to get the entire human population on the planet to function as a group left unmanaged evolution is going to take us where we don influence on the biosphere and our cultural evolutionary processes are going to take us where we don go that is I think is a conclusion for for all that we don that so how do we do this at a worldwide scale well metaphors stories framing all of this is important let [Music] earth so now we can see ourselves in a part of a a spaceship and there there the spaceship malfunctions then huge consequences [Music] let passengers only crew [Music] what does that mean it means is basically we all have to tip in [Music] here can we create a narrative so that that becomes comes the norm so not just is it captivating at a psychological level but that if you actually deviate from that and you become a passenger other people will say wait a minute you need to become part of the crew [Applause] oh [Applause] [Music] for [Music]	Success
Prehistoric Worlds: Earth's Greatest Extinctions | SLICE SCIENCE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rldH8-9GpEw	SLICE Science	[Music] these climate convulsions pounded the already weakened creatures that still clung to life and the onew punch of cold and hot put in motion the first mass extinction in Earth [Music] history by the end of the tivian 85% of species had been wiped out but a handful of hearty survivors made it through including some of the Primitive bony fish which would navigate a singular pathway through the Tree of Life One for which we should be eternally grateful [Music] its descendants branched out to give rise to all the vertebrates that have ever existed without it no dinosaur would ever have walked the Earth no bird would have taken wing and no mammals or reptiles would ever have emerged emerged and there would be no humans telling the story of life after this first mass extinction and the ones to come life branched out into billions of different forms each family each group each species being part of a vast spreading tree there the lottery of Extinction and whatever those survivors are that next radiation happens that next evolutionary burst happens so if you want a simple way to think about extinctions on planet Earth is the survivors are the winners and their descendants are the ones that populate the next time period the desolation of a mass extinction sets the stage for an evolutionary Renaissance within tens of millions of years of the ordovician catastrophe the survivors had given rise to a new era the [Music] devonian it was a completely new world full of new prey and new Predators some quite astounding in the sea we call the age of fishes because now the fishes have evolved and they get some Whoppers and and one of the greatest fishes of all time is this animal called dun [Music] OAS duncle oeus is the super predator of the age of fish right at the top of the food chain it probably swam in a constant search for large enough meals even specimens of its own kind in the Natural History Museum in Paris a plaster cast of duncle oas jaw testifies to The Killing power of this giant of the devonian this is the well-honed weapon of a fearsome Hunter paleont G clayon studies placoderms the large family to which duncle Aus belongs this animal is part of the group called plads which means that they have thick bony plates under their skin here we see the jaw with these sharp points which are not teeth because teeth didn exist yet it which presents this pincer form so it can crush and chop up the prey in which it fed and while Dunkle osus terrorized the Seas the continents were being [Music] transformed the beginning of it on land there end there were forests so devonian is when you get a a land environment that starts to look like something you might recognize you go from nothing to forests but trees release water vapor into the air and may have triggered epic storms over the [Music] continents torren swept dead and decomposing plant matter into the oceans choking them oxygen levels plummeted global cooling and Volcanic turbulence may have worsened the crisis in the Seas as well for marine life sustenance grew scarce eventually the food chain collapsed the devonian extin intinction strangled 34 of the world to death but on land the forest kept thriving any creature looking to survive the disaster at Sea would have to seek greener pastures literally and that would require some anatomical Innovation so you have a variety of fish that actually um are maneuvering their way around in shallow water and they have have these lobe like fins that actually if you look at the fossils and they actually you can start to see the the Rays of fins actually have distinct bones and it lineage of fish that eventually evolves into amphibians with the Seas suffocating and the Lush land beckoning the men new required updating pioneering fish like tiik a descendant of the bony fish that slipped through the first mass extinction had already been experimenting with life where the shallows meet the land it had gills to breathe in water but also A Primitive lung for breathing air and four robust fins that would later become legs fleeing the choking oceans tiik and its family the copter agans crept out of the water and slithered through the Second Great Extinction and the world would never be the same a new chapter in the history of life began and again in the race of Life the winners give rise to new branches of the evolutionary [Music] tree in the new age of the peran the first modern trees developed photosynthesis enriched the air with oxygen at the same time the continents drifted together to form a supercontinent Pangia a vast new territory for landg goinging animals to explore and exploit animals unlike anything the world had ever seen before evolved to handle life on Terra Firma where conditions like temperature varied much more wildly and harshly than in the Seas to protect their offspring big predators like the gorgonopsians began to lay the first eggs with hard shells all the early land animals walked on four legs hence the name tetrapods a body plan that any in the story of life and some were quite flamboyant what you that look like a big iguana with a great big Sail on its back it these sails were for either impressing the other sex or for moderating heat you can rotate towards the Sun and your blood is warmed up on this big warming surface or you can rotate away from the Sun you can cool it [Music] down these paleosaurus with their iconic sails lived alongside daod herbivores with a new innovation a beak designed to excavate the tough roots on which they fed these huge animals were probably hunted by the biggest predators in Pangia like the titanon or Titanic killer a reptile that could grow to a length of 5 m [Music] in the Seas 100 million years after the collapse of the oceans vibrant new lifescapes flourished you would have just loved scuba diving in the peran and you all these incredible creatures that are out swimming around there there now and you Sharks certainly one of the most amazing is this animal called helicoprion it basically had this whirl of teeth mounted in its lower jaw and it would slam into its upper jaw and it was a slicing mechanism it swam around the sea and just chopped stuff in half and then came back and ate it the massive fossilized te teeth from this buz saww shark suggest it could have grown to a length of 12 M on land and in the water the biodiversity of the peran was simply spectacular but it was doomed the most devastating natural catastrophe the Earth has ever seen so far awaited them a cataclysm that would transform this paradise into hell on Earth for millions of years some 250 million years ago in what is now Siberia the Earth tried to turn itself inside out these vast Cliffs called traps formed when the planet Bel lava over and over again for tens of thousands of years Iceland one of the most volcanically active countries in the world is entirely built by lava flows it is an open a laboratory for geologists like patrique daver and embedded in The Rock he finds the barrels of a lava flows smoking [Music] guns when there is an emission of lava there are holes in the massive Rock and these holes are filled with gases which come out at the same time as magma there are different types of gas there vapor there are sulfur oxides and carbon dioxide we know water vapor is greenhouse gas which tends to raise the temperature as does carbon dioxide but sulfur oxides have a double effect on the one hand they Cause acidrain And they also partially block out sunlight leading to a drop in temperature and lower light levels which means a reduction in photosynthesis and so perhaps fewer plants and since animals feed on plants fewer plants mean herbivores start to die and then in turn the carnivorous animals die too the peran traic extinction was the mother of all extinctions basically a lot of our friends that have been with us for the entire Paleozoic things like trites the last traby goes lots of these earlier marine organisms they survived through much of the earlier extinctions sorry [Music]	Success
Lionfish: The Deadliest Ocean Invader | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN8-sN8cu5o	SLICE Science	[Music] [Music] da okay sure my [Music] come so we diving site here off the coast of North Carolina and this is a site that we been collecting a number of lion fish over the years these fish that we bringing that the divers are bringing up today we research at our Laboratory [Music] for [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] sh [Music] [Music] [Music] that massive that one big female here [Music] you got that down don [Music] man we okay think [Music] fish about marking them in terms of uh knowing their genetic identity based and we might need to add new markers to so using the genetic tools and these molecular markers that we these genetic polymorphisms one of the things that we tell is how many fish were originally introduced into the east coast of the United States so you know when you look at two fish and they look morphologically to be very similar you can fish came from the same parents or not and so using these genetic polymorphisms we can actually look at the amount of genetic diversity that these invading populations and try to track back to see what number of fish that were introduced into the United States initially genetics research shows that we have a a very few number of lion fish that were introduced into the Atlantic um probably fewer than 10 which was introduced into the United States likely from the aquarium trade it is a very popular aquarium species that is imported into the US from um Indonesia from the Philippines uh we know that many thousands of lion fish have been imported into the United States in the last decade [Music] the reason uh L fish were introduced is still not clear and we know that is a bad idea and there have there are many Outreach campaigns and efforts to try to inform the public about the impact acts of releasing your pets Into the Wild [Music] [Music] so there are many different aspects of lfish life history and their biology and ecology that have really allowed this um Invasion to progress um and for Lish to become one of the most aggressive Invaders on the planet [Applause] [Music] [Music] battle scar and Jason you don either no [Music] for [Music] [Music] [Music] I marine ecosystems in the Bahamas because of the L Fish Invasion are we going to have reefs dominated by lots of lion fish with very few native species this can have impacts for commercial fisheries and recreational diving and of course just the Ecology of chy fish um where you one species [Music] oh for [Music] what ah here we have a fantastic strike of the lion fish lion fish are unique among fish predators in that they have incredibly protrusible Jaws uh they use suction to generate a suction pulse of water that draws the prey into the mouth the human eye sees at about 30 Hertz that means at about 0.33 milliseconds and you can see here by this time stamp that this behavior of striking at the prey is occurring in onethird of the time that the human eye can perceive and you here that the jaw actually protrudes over 40% of almost 40% of its head length and when it m reaches his maximum jaw protrusion it expands its head from the side and it what basically like sucking through a strw it sucks in the [Music] [Music] prey when we think about kinematics of how the jaws and Fishes work you got to keep in mind that the skeleton of a fish or the skull of a fish rather the skull of a fish is actually made up of over 20 different bones so here we have a skeleton made by a colleague of mine Steve Husky and you can see how intricately aligned all the different bones are in the head of a lion fish [Music] now when we compare this lion fish to other predators that have been examined using this kind of kinematic analysis we see that it falls out about third place among all fishes in terms of the amount of jaw protrusion it can generate the uh all-time champion of course is a pulus insid known as the sling jaw Rass which is also common in the Red Sea um here we have a cichlid known as patin spendid it found in the freshwater Amazon region and then we have the lion fish among Marine fishes it in terms of how U it can feed on its [Music] prey running the water and making it thin so like you can make a sheet of water in de gas the thinner you make the water the easier it is for that water to release the gas that super saturated in it okay so this is a respirometer we have a a chamber with water passing um being pumped through the chamber and into a reservoir and we content of the water as the water passes through the chamber as the lion fish is respiring and it the water as part of the respiration process and so if we the water coming oxygen levels of the water coming into the chamber and the oxygen levels of the water exiting the chamber so we fish uh can consume as high as 6% of their body weight per day uh over time at some of the higher temperatures and when calculating that feeding rate uh we impact on the fish Community um in some cases lion fish can remove um a considerable biomass of small forage fish fishes um and can even deplete that biomass causing change to the to the reef fish Community including biodiversity and forage base that we know is really important for commercially important species like Snapper and grouper this something right there it may or may not be on his fins and his body yeah yep [Music] [Music] [Music] pretty much it was a good dive but a lot of line fish considering we just removed uh fish from this reath 3 months ago okay okay so the Gap height and width yep Roger that Cape height we got 5 cm okay Cape width is 4 cm a crab oh crab yep see the yep okay so we had a clinging [Music] crab yep in level three and again that volume was that volume was two M tell what we have in there I can see right now lime fish have colonized virtually every Marine habitat in the Bahamas from shallow water call reefs to Deep Water call reefs to M Groves to Sea grass areas to marinas to sandy beaches around artificial structures this makes local control efforts very difficult because we have to Target not one or two um habitat types but multiple habitat types over an entire [Music] [Music] archipelago for [Music] [Laughter] is [Music] [Music] give you a hint where do they live Coral beefs mangr near beaches warm areas everywhere yeah we have them everywhere in all sorts of habitats all on the the dorsal side here and how many dorsal spines do you think that lion fish has anybody know so there are 13 spines on the dorsal fin of uh these species of lion fish okay remember how Nicolas said there are many different species of lion fish but the one that we find here in the Bahamas has 13 dorsal spines and these are each independent they can move around and as you can see this skin right slides down very easily away from the spine okay so this means that I the tissue the venomous tissue is actually contained within this all right so if I touch it it Venom myself then that problem is so even if this even though this fish has been dead for a few days even though um the spine is removed it still possibly contains Venom that can harm me so the the Venom glands when they are disrupted they release Venom into the victim and the Venom is a a neurological toxin that affects the nervous system it can cause extreme pain um in humans allowing for things to occur like paral is temporary paralysis um blistering extensive swelling um and and very extreme pain for for several hours it may be similar to a wasp sting an extreme wasp sting at first that will gradually get worse um there have been some cases some very rare cases in which people have died from lion fish and scorpion fish stings we currently this is the spine itself here you can see the hard bony structure with the tip this is the spine these are the grooves of the spine here and then this is the Venom gland [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] in the Red Sea we see that the lion fish is in balance with the natural ecosystem the lion fish is a native predator of the Red Sea but it also has competitors uh what we see in the Red Sea is we see lots of grouper species that are about the same size and are also very effective Predators so when we see lots of groupers we see very few lion fishes and vice versa [Music] in the ocean of the southeast and tropical Caribbean Sea um there are really no natural predators that have been documented to actually be praying upon lion fish at a rate that can control their local densities [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] for um lion fish have a very robust and uh vigorous reproductive biology they are capable of reproducing every 3 to four days they the females can release over 2 million eggs per year uh then they can become sexually mature within a year so the first 6 months of data looks really exciting we found that if you remove lme fish once every 3 months or once every 6 months from coral reefs we are able to reduce lme fish numbers by 50% or more than if we done absolutely nothing at all what is the fact that removing lme fish only once every 6 months seems to have the same ecological impact as removing lion fish once every 3 months in terms of we fish uh densities at 3 versus 6 month removals this is exciting because this means that in terms of management we can get the same ecological effect for half the amount of effort so this looks really hopeful because it looks as if we will be able to control lime fish in small localized areas with not a lot of effort [Music] [Applause] [Music] no don don NES get uh into eating them some of Na get eating them and um before before when it came first um everybody thought that the meat was pricing because they understood that the lion fish had a poison Venom but people are now growing out of that fear and beginning to eat them eat the meat [Music] [Music] wait till you start suiting up in okay clear for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] there you we going to sit you right here [Music] still ling fish down there oh they not going to go away hey Cecilia how you doing man y just come back off a tripic yes all right all right how it been all right all right it went well youall caught a lot of fish caught some all right you didn to see any lion fishing um yeah on this trip yeah all right all right A lot of them all right yeah we saw plenty of them all right cuz you know there there invasive species yeah what they doing they killing out all the fish yeah in 2009 we decided to do something about it we developed the national lion fish response plan the plan serves to maintain a marine ecosystem as well as to control lion fish populations and amend Fisheries regulations uh the lion fish problem is such a huge problem that one study actually shows that it has reduced prey species down to about 65% so what are we going to do about it we my but when you do have it on your menu a lot of people are so excited to have it because they can other place so all in all it you save the environment and you have a good um tasting product on your menu [Music] out [Music] that [Music] about some 50 L Fish I didn just so you got there and the wood steps sit back hands to the side down to the center [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you you should try to get this I think he might get a fish here H he might get a fish here he against the side yeah oh there one by that Corel oh yeah there it is they like it the little juvenile fish there huh yeah going to get one that once look at it that this one seems more to be just tunning not even minding us being here yeah and there specimen nice lion fish here it its own you might notice there really any fish around it and it looks pretty swollen stomach so pretty much eats everything around it and then moves to another spot so car yes on a normal sub dive yeah when you 1,000 ft how many lion fish do you think you see on a th000 foot dive maybe 10 but you see them I 800 ft but mostly you see them you see the most between two 2 and 400 ft okay so they even go down to 800 ft but most of them around 2 300 ft 2 to 400 so finding one here at 500 ft isn abnormal but they higher up yeah they at 300 ft we constantly are we heading up or what I to got to look at it by the squirrel [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Shark Feeding has been controversial for a long time and also obviously Shark Feeding with lion fish because it can change the um behavior of the sharks in their natural um environment now yes it is true that it does everything that we do on the water it will affect their behavior um introducing the lion fish to the Sharks which is an new organism that they never seen before especially in the Caribbean has helped because we only did a couple of times probably two or 3 months of it and then after that we haven and it seems that they have recognized the lon fish as a food source without us feeding them to them so yes it does has an effect with sharks but I think in a you know in a bigger picture we have helped the reef and we hope we help it for a future permanent [Music] future I would say that I am not optimistic about the um future of lion fish I see the lion fish Invasion progressing uh continuing to expand in both its distribution we now have lion fish in the Southeastern Caribbean we will likely see them continue to invade along the uh coast of South America perhaps as far south as the northern coast of Argentina lime fish do not survive when the me winter bottom water temperatures go below 15° C so this 15° Mark appears to be a threshold where above that lion fish survive and thrive but below that you just don all but they likely distribution is is probably going to extend all the way from from Cape hatas North Carolina in the north All the Way South to the northern coast of Argentina or we thinking that it will disperse through the panwa canal probably for a couple of reasons the water there between the Pacific and the Atlantic as well as there being freshwater lakes that could be also be a barrier to dispersal however we really don for sure whether they can um disperse through the Panama Canal [Music]	Success
Bees on the Edge: Uncovering the Extinction Crisis | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1c1vpcpoNo	SLICE Science	[Music] [Music] for 20 years beekeepers have been faced with high levels of portality one fine morning they find their hives empty of workers and sometimes a carpet of corpses however since November 2006 the hecome has grown to such a proportion that in entire regions of North America Europe and Asia the trees are no longer giving fruit since they pollinated this disappearance affects both domesticated bees and wild species alike who is responsible what is responsible for these thousands of deaths there B you ask yourself you say what have I done I idiot I no further you tell yourself it fault that done to make them go this is why very few people admit that they perfectly well that they some have lost many but no one will admit it because in any case you aren going to be reimbursed there insurance to cover the loss of so there in front of youres [Music] at the moment we just have a few suppositions and we them to explain the deaths of colonies that we we it because we presume it problem probably but we areed play veroa Destructor is the first suspect that came to the minds of beekeepers and scientists A 2mm long M that arrived in the 1980s with queen bees imported from Asia a sort of tick that pierces the bee its holth the blood of insects there early I don problem what I mean is when we have a strong Colony the bees manage to handle Po in fact you find very few however the colony is weak for whatever reason the is an opportunist and then it invades The Colony completely you can seear see veroa on a great number of bees and then you have to treat to treat veroa the only products authorized by veterinary services are chemicals the disadvantage of these substances is that they accumulate in the wax that contains the honey and each new dose is added to the preceding ones as phip L A be Keeper in the M area explains at present for chemical treatment with AAR for example we obliged to double the treatment application period so this does have an effect on but in fact each time we take action against the pathogen there are always side effects there are no treatments that have no effect on organisms otherwise they wouldn other Solutions exist and everyone has their own recipe Andre com has been inspired by the treatment his father used to keep ticks off his dogs OD fruit branding which doesn leave a residue in the wax produced by the Bee he tested his treatment for 5 years before finding the right dosage the OD mustn proceed 30 cc odv at 90° I emphasize unfort and we wait half an hour you have to work very quickly since the odv is very volatile there are perhaps aund or so what makes Vara proliferate is the decreased immunity of the be the be since the beginning time it has had TI since it exists the be has had tick veroa has been in Europe for 20 years a healthy Hive will tolerate its [Music] presence it parasite is not therefore the cause of massive disappearances but a consequence of the weakened state of the bees but what has weaken them the situation is complex in natural settings wild pollen and nectar gatherers most of which are solitary are also disappearing at this stage of the investigation the cause of these deaths remains a mystery unaware of the danger the best friends of flowers continue to gather pollen and nectar [Music] [Music] in this there were 20 I and I know my when he put herbici on La I said to him when you do the treatment call me if you do it at midday it doesn morning call it because what do bees do in the morning they go looking for the D by 11: a.m. I had lost 17 Hearts I went looking for him I could I was boiling with hatred okay okay I take back the word hatred because you told me I shouldn because it hurts I I took him to the op and I said to him what did I tell you when you treat in the morning call me I de evaporates at 11:00 a.m. I the we can do that but none of my workers came they were killed by the herbicide by carpet of bodies our second lead starts in the summer of 1997 engraved in beekeeper memories as the summer when thousands of colonies died the beekeepers see a link to seeds coated with a new generation of insecticides like GAO and Reon over a 7-year period French beekeepers lost 450,000 hives the we 9697 are due to a large extent to the massive use of certain pesticides in agriculture to seed substances that are neurotoxic long systemic meaning that they penetrate into the interior of the pl and the whole diffuses the substance Jean sh Bou director General of the French agrochemical industry Association represents phyto pharmaceutical companies such as Bayer BASF and [Music] Monsanto to explain the phenomenon of The Disappearance of be several hypothesis have been put forward including that pesticides but what I can tell you is that the pesticides authorized today when the conditions for use are respected present no risk Mark edwan is a veterinarian and University researcher in Agronomy whose mission is to understand why beeses in certain cases fail to return to the hive he comparing the behavior of bees on organically and conventionally grown crops on this subject we from knowing everything knowing how the toxicity will be expressed and most importantly how it will be expressed when the exposure to toxic substances lasts a long time and I believe that this is the current problem compared with for years the exposure to bees to toxic substances is much longer now with systemic insecticides than it was before when a field would be treated from time to time because it was attacked by past zier Ru is president of the association for the development of professional apiculture he recalls one phytopharmaceutical treatment used on crops surrounding hives it sunflower parasites and which attacks the bee find its way and sunflower where the colonies were situated there was nothing but sunflowers at that period there were no other flowers there were 40 hears of sunflowers around the colonies and they didn of 80 hies already 50% of them were dead practically within the month that followed and i of the winter certain pesticides therefore can have long-term effects that months after exposure which makes it practically impossible to pinpoint the guilty molecule and The Chronic deaths in B are the phenomenon of massive B disappearances in these instances we never found pesticides present in sufficient quantities to explain the mortality personally I don Goon Theory I think it plays a very marginal role it might be important when you have hives that are totally weakened but this is not what the results of the ASA epidemological investigation shows us what the epidemological study shows is that we live in a background of pollution there are constantly traces of pollutants and Highs but this is not what kills I don capable altering all ecosystems and practically all living organisms and ecosystems could not have an effect on bees basically mean that the be is the only organism that is not affected by pesticides and we for example that when the pesticides are used alone in certain cases it is possible that they don effects at all but when they used in they induce an explosive effect that can cause very high moralities in less than 24 hours moralities thep 95% of the population deated in less than 24 hours in the test that are carried out the potential cumulative effect so to speak of several is also studed which explains why today certain combinations for example are prohibited in the presence of be it fungicides with certain insecticides can change the behavior of bees by slowing down so to speak their ability to escape or fly so these combinations are prohibited everyone agrees experiments have shown that pesticides are dangerous when mixed together but this raises a question can these prohibited combinations be produced without the farmer because of the Persistence of the substances over time these insecticides are very persistent even very persistent in certain cases to the order of magnitude the time necessary for the concentration of insecticides in the soil to be we thought at first was two weeks a month in fact it perhaps even 6 months or a year so the following year there will still be the insec from last year persisting insecty will of course be added to by the next dose applied the following year to verify whether different chemical substances might accumulate in the soil we asked a farmer to tell us what treatments he used on his crops in 15 or so fungicide treatments after that a herbicide and then one or two insecticide treatments per year the schedule of phytosanitary treatments is just as eloquent so here are the products that have been applied with the dose per hectar this is an insecticide very expensive there must be others there are 11 18 21 29 that quickly becomes very expensive in less than a year and throughout the growth period of a crop herbicides fungicides and insecticides are used one after another the result is that in the soil and inside the plants are substances that are authorized and used correctly but which produce combinations that are prohibited by the companies themselves one of no moda skills is Raising queen bees the queen differs from all other bees by her size and Longevity she alone is marked with the color of the year of her birth red means 2008 once I was talking with an archist who would just poison thees of a they wer but I said to him now what would happen if I came to your place and cut down half of your apple trees with the chainsaw and just he looked at me and said well complicated I take my shotgun and blow your face off that exactly what he so I said that what you highs he looked at me dumbfounded he just understood what was going on I believe that more and more since we subject that farmers are starting to understand this problem and the phenomenal the problem now is that there are also networks Market gardening and farming technicians working for the phytosanitary maintain different discour so it like against the iron there are so many examples of intoxication that the question must be asked why would anyone authorize the use of 880,000 tons of pesticides in France each year we decided to examine the procedure of approving these substances all products used for plant treatment are subjected to the market authorization procedure and in this Mar test which are mandatory on the other were def years ago and they longer adapted the of the test is that at the present time we can study an approval file for the possible effect moing marketing approval might gender I couldn I presented a risk to bees after all we do have a few cases where in all conscience I said that there was no risk to bees and then afterwards it discovered that there was a potential risk and in these cases the products have been withdrawn the use of GAO has been suspended for sunflower and discover that little C called crer which is from exactly the same family has been approved for the national territory I know that it in Germany following a certain number of problems with be so what we witnessing in fact is the replacement of one active substance by another active substance that resembles it perhaps it be a good idea to get a general decision about a class of insecticides that would save us a great time pesticides are toxic at infantes Doses and when they spare adult bees the substances brought in with the pollen poison the lava the secondary effects of these products have not yet been revealed when a new generation of insecticides arrives on the market those produced by the plants themselves genetically modified plants in France This concerns ma for the most part [Music] okay you can see there we have orange poll from the sunflower and then quite a few yellow balls which are from Ma they that the be has been working on M you Analyze This pollen afterwards this poll will be sent to a specialized laboratory to see whether there is G are not in the area where the hives were you see GMOs are something new recently pled 100 I because this m produces its own in in considerable which is more than the quanti that would be applied by the spraying method we until since February 2008 the growing of Monsanto 810 M has been suspended in France pending further examination to get a clear idea of the GMO question we went to Germany to meet with the eminent Dr Catz renowned in particular for his work on the impact of GMOs on bees well in most cases um we found out that genetically modified plants have no effect on honey bees [Music] and yet 3 years earlier Dr Catz had demonstrated that the foreign Gene used to modify canola had transferred itself into a bacteria living in the intestines of bees a transfer from a plant to an animal the discourse today is amazingly toned down we really see that it is directed against lepidopteran so butterflies and it looks like that other factors plus the toxin then affect the bees with research increasingly funded by industry including the chemical industry are scientists still free to publish the results of their studies did you receive I don pressure from Love on fil oh sure yes yes yes I did I didn was first I was kind of naive when I started with the studies and thought okay it that exciting on the one hand and so but I got a lot of pressure and so we we cooperating with a chemical company and so some of the scientist and managers said it said why we look at this crazy stuff anyway so um some studies are disturbing especially when they call into question patterns on life but this does not prevent Dr Katz from having his own convictions regarding GMOs so far well this is my very personal view not the professional view on agriculture and GMO I think we should increase or keep diversity is even in the agricultural plans High instead of just focusing on a few and I think the possible problem in the future might be if we just only few focus on a very few numbers and of different types on a certain plants GMOs or no GMOs our Countryside has been taken over by manoc culture a floral impoverishment that harms the bee which needs a VAR diet so we have wheat wheat and more wheat practically nothing else no other grass is tolerated and obviously on the soil if you look no insects practically n density zero very low so it desert for pollinators the fact that the countryside in any case a good part of Europe is dominated by intensive agriculture has a direct impact on bees and on pollinators in general the land is fragmented the natural envir tin on a wide Matrix intens if we compare this with fields of we painted by the Impressionists a century ago the fields were full of color there were poies corn flowers things like that plants that were visited by the to the that comes here will have to go elsewhere he wants to eat a hive containing 60,000 bees fertilizes 35 million flowers hours per day Bernard vaser and his team at the inra in Aon are the first to have measured the economic value of be pollination compared with the action of the wind and insects it potential consequences of this decline of pollinators to measure that we developed a technique in the context of the alarm program which consists of evaluating the impact of insects as compared to wind pollination or passive self-pollination here we have a capitular with a hydril plastic bag to measure pollination without wind or insects passive self poin here we have a capitular and a Gau sa that allows 75% of the atmospheric pollen to penetrate the difference between the two gives us the impact of wind pollination and then pollination by insects or free pollination the difference between it and the two other Capas will give us the impact of pollination by insects the inra has estimated that 80% of the world without pollinators for the agricultural sector this represents a worldwide turnover of $153 [Music] billion the bee is thus an ally to the world economy a necessary condition for the Harvest [Music] bees travel no further than 3 km from their hives and beekeepers move them in relation to the different flowering periods this represents a veritable transhumans over hundreds of kilom to collect pollen and nectar from hectars of apple trees strawberry plants and melon [Music] Vines desent descent in the past beekeepers would pay to leave their hives near a field of lavender today as the pollinators disappear the farmers are calling the bees for help Bruno Camu professional apiarist also runs his hives out to orchardists it distribution of hies you have to put four hives in one place so we spread out our which is not ideal for Mon and then you have to realize that you little the merciful potential treatment and the of death n times out of 10 it hasn because he informed about the importance of this is brownberry honey I really do have great faith on the fact that beekeepers and Farmers work together it undeniable it beekeepers first of all place our heart n times out of 10 is the Good Will of a farmer and then also partly because our be work on the cultivated plantart they also work on noncultivated PL [Music] notiv so we there hence no fruit or vegetables but pollination presents another advantage of prime importance the transport of pollen from one flower to another contributes to genetic dispersion a Melting Pot of plant genes this is how since the beginning of time fruit and vegetable varieties have been able to evolve and remain strong and resistant to disease this floral diversity is also essential for [Music] bees at this stage of our inquiry it seems that the health of bees depends on a varied pesticide-free diet [Music] following the different German Swiss and French testimonies we went to the United States to meet the people who this mysterious be Affliction colony collapse disorder or CCD David Hackenberg runs a professional pollination service he has 2,000 hives that travel more than 5,000 km a year most of our beehives right now are in Upstate New York producing a crop of honey they they just came back from pollinating blueberries in Maine and uh we have a few beehives here today we going to look at here the decline of wild pollinators is dramatic and fruit and vegetable producers cannot expect good harvests without renting hives from beekeepers if the mortality of domesticated bees continues by 2012 there will not be enough pollinators in the United States if they all look like this we really happy there 50,000 bees in this Hive good time of the year you know bees are doing fine and makes beekeepers happy although all the bees in the United States don now they problem we already see some hives that are starting to come down with a problem and uh we some show you what what CCD looks like David Hackenberg is the first beekeeper in America to have alerted public authorities and scientists about the Fatal decline of his colonies this High We is got problems it there population never builts up the bees disappear before they get to age and they mean they they got a problem I mean that Hive in another couple weeks may be dead maybe may be gone you ask yourself what did you do wrong but finally I realized it did wrong it my the environment of my bees have been in and when you stop and really start thinking about it from that aspect that it out here that you have no control over then you kind of get angry because of the fact that somebody else is affect somebody else out here something else is affecting my livelihood and there nothing I can do to change it David Hackenberg and researcher Dennis van Angel storp know each other very well The Beekeeper has entrusted his CCD affected hives to the scientists who uhoh and this bee right here it a dance see that dance is telling the other bees where to go and find some food so there all it collect food have all disappeared and uh they bees are hungry research teams at the US Ministry of Agriculture initially found an explanation a virus we have found in a lot of cases CCD colonies have Israeli acute paralysis virus this virus that is not from Israel it was just a guy in Israel who found it first and so we think that what happens is the bees get the flu influenza this virus was triumphantly announced in 2007 as being the cause of deaths in American bees a single and ideal culprit that under the authority of the microscope aneled the other hypotheses a virus all that was necessary then was to find a cure but Dr Jeff Pettis revealed to us what they discovered when they pursued their investigations yes we viruses as probably just a perhaps just a consequence of something else that going on in the colony we know that honeybee viruses are always present and under normal conditions they don a problem with the virus Theory discarded the researchers turned their interest towards a fun NOA known to infect the bee NOA which is a gut parasite of bees is also on the rise in in US colonies and we don understand why might the proliferation of NOA be responsible for the abnormal mortality of bees in the USA noima is an interesting one because there is this new type of noima now NOA s and we are finding in fact in some of these colonies very high levels of noima s in the summer which is unheard of usually we see noima in the fall so this is a problem for many beekeepers noima s there is no question but in CCD colonies most of the colonies that have CCD we cannot find any noima Saran when we look neither the virus nor the NOA theories can fully explain the sudden deaths of bee colonies the American researchers are now looking at the impact of pesticides as well we also wanted to look at pesticides both the pesticides that the beekeepers applied to control the mites and the pesticides that maybe the bees were bringing in from the farm um that farmers reply and bring it to the hive we did find that there were high levels of pesticides in some cases and certainly that can bees so it probably doesn probably a problem in bees Health in the middle of apples they sprayed a sale which is a nicotinoid amid a corporate product they were told by the chemical companies you can spray this stuff in the middle Apples because it honeybees it don agree with them it don it that may bring back to the hive feed to the young and it becomes a birth defect in the US we almost never look at interactions at least we to look at the interactions between two pesticides so that we understand whether two pesticides together could be more harmful than either one of them alone and also in com combination with things like fungicides which are often applied at the same time that a pesticide would be applied so we don at the interactions but it that we contributing you visit the scientists here in the United States are going to tell you that we pesticides in the samples of pollen 30 some fungicides numerous herbicides all in a little sample pollen that big same conclusion as in France the pesticide mixtures produce effects that no one can control most of the scientists here in the United States off the Record you know if they weren to you on camera or talking to the news media they they is the problem we don out false warnings so we don say that ah we we compound or that compound without some really good evidence because then the grower or The Beekeeper becomes confused that you this was a problem this was a problem and now you problem so we want to be sure that we have good evidence before we talk about reasons for concern coming from the researchers who in 2007 had proclaimed the existence of a link between the virus and the collapse of be colonies such caution about confirming the role of pesticides in The Disappearance of bees is Food For Thought does the $33 billion Market shared by a handful of agrochemical companies have anything to do with this caution hey how you doing was not the virus Theory ideal for a new pharmaceutical contract looks like these pumpkin looks like these pumpkins are getting ready for bees I see a couple flowers up here I I think if you can come Thursday that good uh if we can look at about 200 hives uh by the end of the week uh that 200 in about two weeks we to New York here Monday and Tuesday and get them ready and get them down here so we or Friday morning early no they just that darn that coming along Thursday is going to be about perfect we won yep if I had to count on wild bees uh for my pumpkin crop I I would not pay for the cost of planting and and starting a crop pollination is so important uh we need the extra bees in for for hives and the wild bees just aren that it may seem incredible but wild bees are inexistent in the large crop growing areas of America we dramatic increase in the cost of the bees uh because the beekeepers have to replenish their beehives so we an increase uh in price by twice as much as the previous year and that was just just in one year I haven of my personal practices yet uh if I can get some scientists to to you know pinpoint some of the chemicals that are causing the damage I will make those changes here on this Farm said you know I I got enough problems I just don have time to screw around you guys if I probably had my my best wishes for the bees I probably wouldn pumpkins but the farmers got to have bees I have to have a paycheck to keep going so sometimes we take bees and places where we know that what we get through it to keep in shape a bee needs sugar obtained from the nectar of flowers and protein provided by pollen however pumpkins offer very little protein to remedy this American beekeepers as in any industrial animal rearing activity resort to mixtures that bear little resemblance to the insect natural food to make our protein for our bees we starting out with sugar uh brewers yeast dried eggs uh canol oil vitamins and citric acid and a few other little things some honey and we come up with this protein Patty which we started to uh feed to our last year and it seems to be doing the [Music] job faced with a decline of bees and lack of Honey humans tend to act irrationally forgetting that the bee feeds on its own honey and the pollen it Gathers it about how fast we can grow this crop how good our lawn can look uh and unfortunately you know we have forgot about nature I going to happen that that eventually we to somehow prove that this is what I think it is uh and the Public scream loud enough that the government uh makes the chemical companies pull this stuff off the market I mean it because we money here I mean we the biggest corporations in the world and uh the way politics works in the United States is if you can pad somebody can get done anything you want in France when winter dages on too long many beekeepers feed their bees sugar syrup or corn glasses sometimes not free from chemical substances however in the mour region pier brasque and his son Roma ensure that their bees have a stock of their own honey it stock so the bees can get through the winter so the idea of honey as a dietary supplement it sa Su could never replace honey because in fact honey contains antibacterial sub IDE The Colony should only consume its own stock what it has collected another black hole of knowledge concerns the electromagnetic waves that cover our environment in an invisible fog bees are able to locate their hives to within a millimeter thanks to a particle of magnetite in their abdomen but what if the waves from the transmitters used by our mobile phones and computers Disturbed their sense of orientation Studies have been conducted but they researchers were trying to see an acute effect on these radio frequencies the microwave was it capable of cooking bees or not I but no one looked at the longterm effects of these radio frequencies I not saying it was radio frequencies looked at in another way in the absence of serious research it effect of pulsed wave whose impact on the orientation of whales and human health is beginning to be realized in natural settings far from big cities these radio waves puls to travel over several kilometers might explain certain be disappearances in a farming area at the base of a hive Dr Colin films the behavior of disorientated bees here is no longer capable of really flying completely it doesn the what fly straight it makes little but it straight goes off to the side so this is really characteristic of an intoxication here is a mobile completely mobile so we would say if we wanted to compare with what has been found in M we could almost say that it then well it lost you can see it if you have a good look at the ground if you get right down on the ground then you can see that there are many bees they don hive they don so here the problem is that we can see the nervous system link to intoxications now going to the source of intoxication it difficult we can of course look for a possible neurotoxin and maybe find one but in certain cases the doses that can kill an insect are so small that even best the best chemists will not be able to find a Trace [Music] the conclusion is clear there are two forms of bee immortality the first is a radical carpet of dead bees and it may be due to the application of pesticides at times when the bees are gathering nectar and pollen the second is a slow death in the field without returning to the hive and it may be explained by coated seeds or the invisible mixture of chemical treatments those used by farmers and sometimes by beekeepers to control veroa unpredictable and little studied effects confronted with The Disappearance of the bee scientists worry about the consequences for humans if you think about what we would eat if they had no Bees at all to pollinate you would only be able to eat corn wheat rice and other wind pollinated insects a very good American example is if you have a Big Mac the Big Mac and you get rid of all the pollinators you do not have the meat you do not have the lettuce you do not have the Cucumber or tomato you don even have the sesame seeds on the bun all you have is the bread naturalists are accustomed to saying that nature is strong and that insects are particularly resistant to attack we hope the bees will resist what about humans on The Human Side we to get a very good idea of the diseases induced by pesticides we can observe the midterm effects between 6 months and 3 to 5 years after exposure and we find disturbances of vision Behavior concentration and orientation we find paralyses as well we find problems of sensation at theous level that is in the skin and many other effects similar to those observed in soldiers exposed to chemical weapons during the Gul War we now know that almost certainly pesticides are the cause of a certain number of cancers lymphomas and adults leukemia and adults but also brain T in children and adults the anxiety of farmers faced with crop ravaging pths and their recourse to chemicals are understandable however without bees their awareness of the danger is beginning to reach the countryside it would be ideal if public authorities heeded this warning to and ceased their eradication of plants along railway lines roads and foot paths several municipalities in France have already implemented a pesticide-free policy and the same Lucidity applies to private Gardens the survival of pollen and nectar gathers is in the hands of us all in sahor they know that looking after bees rhymes with looking after humans wow bees are dying through human activity in particular the use of [Music] pesticides we can no longer Fain ignorance and pretend that we didn [Music] know well bees are just one more item on the list of the thousands of living organisms that we disappear from the earth bees are quite simply one species too many their disappearance could ring the death nail for Humanity that better let us have the humility to heed the message sent by the millions of collapsing bee colonies and the wisdom to do something about it [Music]	Success
Revolutionizing Life: The Science of DNA Programming | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntCJ6xv9Ek8	SLICE Science	[Music] from cells to fully-fledged organisms from molecules to ecosystems life exists in a myriad of forms until now biology has sought to observe and understand it perhaps even to control and exploit it but today scientists are looking to invent and manufacture New Living beings basically to synthesize life this is the challenge of a new technoscience synthetic biology biology 2.0 which promises to solve all our problems is this a new and ultimate Industrial Revolution or is it just the opposite by affecting life in such proportions are we not taking unprecedented risks to find out I traveled the world to meet The Field learn and discover more and sometimes getting completely lost the th biology it genetic engineering on steroids we want to be able to program cells as easily as we program computers every product of synthetic biology is something that hasn every genome that we engineer hasn existed before synthetic is really not a word that that sounds great these days there are concerns about long-term implications governance failures failure to control failure to ethics [Music] my first surprise was to discover that with synthetic biology it biologists who can work on living beings now but Engineers too after Bridges buildings and machines now they to the era of engineering life astonishing that tickles my curiosity right away apparently there Professor who trans forms bacteria into a form of calculator that can be reprogrammed like a computer how well to find out I head for the east coast of the US the man in question is one of the disciplines pioneers and apparently one of the most brilliant new bioengineers as well as one of the most unusual I have an appointment with him in Massachusetts on some Marshland [Music] my name is uh Christopher boy I professor of biological engineering at the Massachusetts instit of technology and I biology [Music] center hello Chris void Cambridge but he unusual setting to explain how his work started one of my hobbies or guilty pleasures is to go crabbing and they one of the most delicious things that you can imagine eating when we look out at the natural world we see all of the sophistication that living biology can perform in synthetic biology and we trying to build new biology that hasn before existed but we what career the crabs are the essence of what biology can do and even though you think of a crab as being kind of a dumb animal when you see it in its environment you can see it thinking about what it being very careful and cautious it can survive incredible conditions its ability to act as a defense to swim the material that are on the crab are incredible everything is just [Music] perfect in my own Journey towards Biology one of the most remarkable things has been understanding that cells make decisions and it that we think of because we think well we make decisions that Consciousness if you cut your finger and you bleed onto a cover slip and you look at all the cells you cells those cells have the capability to chase after invading bacteria hunt them down consume them and then look for additional bacteria so you chasing after this bacteria it runs that way it makes the decision to follow and all of that you can have circuitry and decision-making capability sensing capability within individual cells all encoded in the [Music] DNA what crabbing does is you have to be so focused at the moment that it clears your mind and so I have a lot of the ideas for what we do in my lab immediately after crapping sometimes on the drive back home I new ideas and that can [Music] occur unfortunately the catch wasn good as we me to appreciate another local speciality as he explains a little more about this new discipline that designs life as one might do with a machine it [Music] possible because we have to understand that every organism every living cell has one or several functions certain cells aid in digestion others convert light into energy for plants or transform sugar into alcohol like yeast a surprising little unicellular fungus but how do these cells know the nature of the work they have to accomplish they quite simply have a manual or a program inscribed in their nucleus their genome The genome is an organism instruction book for life it describes all of a life forms functions the book is made up of several chapters which we call chromosomes chromosomes themselves are composed of genes they form the sentences in the book each gene or each sentence is read like an instruction all the genes together tell the cell what it has to do all of this is written using an alphabet DNA made up of the well-known molecules a g t and c for adenine guine thymine and cyto sign which are always organized in pairs the a with the T and the C with the G known as base pairs genes are transmitted from one generation to the next identically or modified to respond to essential new functions or new requirements for the cell to survive this is what we call Evolution if we know how to modify them and put them together we can then change very simple functions into more complex ones approaching light in this way radically changes scientist seeing life forms as a sum of different functions as a system is no longer the starting point of a biologist but that of an engineer Chris Voit is among other things an engineer this time he invites me to MIT for him living organisms are machines which can be put to use to serve mankind I seeing his laugh welcome thank you thank you I wonder if there are crab machines in his office has all the area being built recently or what we lab is really create the foundational tools that allow you to think bigger with respect to how we use cells in order to create new materials or new chemicals or to create a living system that respond to its environment in a way that we find useful every product of synthetic biology is something that hasn every genome that we engineer hasn existed before in order to build these new genomes it looks at life very differently than I do his vision is that of a designer of a system architect to synthetic biologist cells are like machines they contain all of these different working parts that collectively work together so that biology can do all the things that we see around us and one of our roles as Engineers is to be able to get in and understand how to manipulate these machines so that we can reengineer them to do other things everything that encoded in the DNA sequence and so if we want to go in design it to do something new it always comes down to manipulating the genes that are required in order to have the code that does that new thing so there being able to engineer biology trying to create an algorithm that runs inside a living cell where it all of the things that it has to do to survive but in the background it r running one of these programs that you challenging problem for a long time in synthetic biology you had to do it by hand it was very low Tech it just was trying to break down genetics into these more fundamental functions in the last couple of years we computerated design techniques that allow us to have new algorith applied to the problem so that the computer can design the DNA sequence for example a big part of the effort in my lab is to desine the computer software where somebody can go in and using a highlevel language the same language that computer chip they can create an algorithm where instead of having it turn into an Intel processor it actually automatically takes that and turns it into a DNA sequence very well basically Chris voy and his colleagues are using a computer program to create new DNA sequences which is still engineering but how do they switch from the computer to reality Chris tells me that the virtual sequences he designs are physically assembled on another continent he orders them by email from a specialist German company called G art companies of this kind are are known as gene foundaries they make DNA from simple jars of chemical products Each of which contains one of the four basic [Music] molecules when we order a sequence of DNA we send a file that can be T of thousands of base pairs of a t G C just dedicated to physically building a DNA sequence [Music] and they guarantee that they back that exact DNA sequence where every single base pair is exactly as you ordered it so we have DNA which is sometimes virtual and sometimes real traveling around the world electronically or in little vials by mail I have to admit it sounds pretty scary can Chris Voit or any other synthetic biologist simply order any genetic sequence they want even a virus or some other pathogen Chris reassures me apparently all the companies that synthesize genes are regulated by strict internal and external controls and rules on the other hand he is concerned about other potential issues linked to synthetic Biology one of my biggest concerns is around illicit economic interests currently it straightforward for a student from one of these labs to be able to build a organism that can make illegal drugs for example and so if you can make a yeast make heroin or make methampetamine or any other of these compounds you really looking at it Innovation that completely changes globally the way that we think about drug property ation and affects politics and World conflict and everything that going to come online very soon like in the next 5 years and I don really engaging that risk or thinking through what the implications are going to be this is a real problem and I can only hope Chris void for him in any case whatever the uses or misuses the 21st century will be [Music] biotechnological we the surface as to what can engineer biology and the real question is when are we going to get to the point where we can design and build an entire genome from scratch using fundamental principles just understanding how the different genetic components click together I think it challenges right now in science the last century in large part was defined by electronics and computers and so on I think this century and the economy of this Century are going to be around the possibility of engineering biology Chris void talks about what the future holds and I can see the Dr dramatic progress has been made since DNA was first discovered in the 1950s and the first experiments in genetic engineering were made in the it was at that point that the word Engineering in this context took on a new meaning as Engineers began to work in biology for the first time their contributions were also crucial to the amazing adventure of the first sequencing of the human genome in the early 21st century today Compu comp technology enables scientists to progress even faster increasing calculation capabilities and speed and extending the possibilities for Designing new genomes as I listen to Chris void explain how it an entirely new living organism in a laboratory I have a strange feeling of deja vu I think back to an announcement made in 2010 the effects of which resounded like a bombshell well beyond the boundaries of the scientific community we first synthetic cell this is the first self-replicating species that we on the planet whose parent is a computer at the time the story was that scientists had succeeded in making a form of synthetic life from four bottles of chemicals and a computer program certain observers immediately contradicted this version of The Facts like Jim Collins whom I meet in Boston he too is an engineer or more exactly a professor of biomed engineering I that surrounds synthetic biology the hype is problematic at times we for example have seen many many more media pieces on synthetic B then we have original papers I don Buzz to generate funding I think the media needs to generate Buzz to sell magazines sell newspapers this will no longer be our lab in a few days Jim Collins tells me that in his opinion synthetic biology can only work with already existing organisms and that it creating life from scratch he gives me his version of what Craig ventor [Music] 2010 they had taken a natural micoplasma bacteria they sequenced its [Music] genome they made some slight modifications to that genome on the computer they synthesized it chemically and introduced the synthesized natural genome into a related micoplasma and were effectively able to reboot it that that organism was able to take up that genome I think what Craig done is a technological Marvel they did not create from scratch a new organism or life they modified an existing one if it had been presented in that way at the time the story would definitely not have made the international headlines in the same way but beyond the publicity the story brought to synthetic biology I once again note the relevance of engineering research now involves constant toing and throwing between biology and computers synthetic biology has been dominated by analogies from information Theory and computer science so you talking about the cell as a programmable unit you software for a cell I think this helps Engineers to understand where they can actually impact molecular biology but these analogies can only go so far in that a naturally evolved or organism is not an engineered system it that before he talks about results Jim Collins reviews where the field actually stands now he emphasizes the difficulties that he has to confront every day as someone who life in synthetic biology we pretty good at coming up with the circuit schematics pretty quickly we gotten pretty good now finding the parts and we together making them where we very good is that invariably the circuit does not behave in the way you like and it typically takes many months if not years to get even a simple circuit to behave at the level of quality of function that you [Music] like this lack of reliability and results in no way prevents further research there every aspect of aine machine workings in order to use it for several years now Jim Collins has been working on medical applications as I scientists he has been influenced in his choices and decisions by his [Music] background I was a Collegiate Runner and my junior year my third year in college I actually uh had a persistent strep infection and it more or less ended my running career my lab recently has actually been motivated to use engineering approaches to address persistent infections and we were able to use an engineering approach to actually figure out how do persistent bacteria behave and how we can actually then exploit that to change its state to make it vulnerable to the antibiotic through his ability to understand at least partially how the Machinery in certain bacteria works Jim Collins knows how to destroy them his research focuses in particular on organisms that can be seen almost everywhere in a formidably resistant form biofilms biofilm is a community of bacteria that is surrounded by an extracellular Matrix and they attached to a surface so the stuff on the side of a ship is an example of a biofoam most bacteria exist in bams and they why a bioengineer like myself is interested in biofilms is that bugs in biofilms are a thousand times more resistant to antibiotics and bugs love to form biofilms on anything we put inside somebody going to get an artificial knee an artificial hip pacemaker for your heart the risk is not the surgery the risk is you that happens they then basically have to open you back up remove your device let the infection clear and then reintroduce the device we decided we want to take a synthetic biology approach to eradicate biofilms and what we did was we re-engineered bacteria Fage bacteria phage viruses that specifically infect bacteria we engineered the bacteria phage so that they would Express enzymes that would break up the biop Jim Collin bacteria but also the very structure of bofilm a thick Matrix that provides a highly resistant coating by attacking it bacteria Fage eliminate bacteria layer by layer this new approach is extremely effective the Fage infects the bacteria they the themselves using the machine of the bacteria and then they explode the cell our approach is able to go in and allow the phage to pen tra and infect the top layer of the bath but then break down the bath to expose more and more [Music] [Applause] BLS and we were able to show that this approach could eradicate greater than 99.99% of the biofilms in various settings be they clinic and or industrial wonderful Bravo but I do have a doubt could this highly destructive bacteria Fage be the precursor of other equally virent modified organisms and end up being completely uncontrollable Jim reassures me more oress we don have extensive capabilities to re-engineer organisms just yet most of the organisms that we make are much weaker than anything you find in nature and in fact one of my points to the public is they really should be concerned about what Nature has out there because it is incredibly powerful and it [Music] it natural Predators microscopic or otherwise is chilling one of the greatest Feats of the 20th century was certainly to limit or control their effects could bioengineers go even further meanwhile I Chris Voit that cells can make decisions and by modifying the Genome of these cells we can modify their decisions and their behaviors Jim Collins has told me that we can enormous possibilities afforded by computers in terms of simulations and calculations we knowing how to create a living organism out of nothing on the other hand we are able to work on relatively simple living systems which enables us no small feet to conceive of cells that could be of service to medicine for example but what about more complex systems that combine a variety of functions this very subject is the research field of the engineer I to meet on Manhattan Beach in Los Angeles my name is Ron Weiss I professor in biological engineering at MIT hi Hi how are you nice to meet you nice meeting you too so we go this way Ron Weiss is co-director with Chris Voit of the synthetic biology department at MIT like Chris he also enjoys doing his thinking in the open air ever since I was a little kid I was interested in programming things and computers halfway through my PhD I was working on this project called a morphis Computing and the notion was that we like to be able to program very small entities it might be even the size of a grain of Sands and get them to do things and I was looking at biology as a way to get inspired because we have millions or billions of little Computing elements that interact with one another and are working towards a particular task or set of behaviors for Ron wise the analogy between his two passions computers and biology works perfectly his objective is therefore to ultimately be able to program a cell as simply as an information technology engineer can program a computer to give it several tasks so when we want to design behavior in a Cell usually what we do is we first come up with some kind of a highlevel idea there we want a cell to be able to accomplish and then we start decoupling that meaning we start decomposing it to smaller pieces that we may be able to then genetically engineer inside the cell Ron wise makes an analogy between his own objective and the local Surfers he breaks it up into several sub problems in order to Surf you need one to float and glide on the wave two to control your trajectory three to adhere to the board and four if you fall off don waves to put each of these subf functions into practice you need to use and combine several specific tools in order to explain how to give these different functions to a surface cell Ron invites me to accompany him on the Quest for various parts required for its construction in other words it go shopping how youcome thank you which one if I pursue his analogy for the float and glide function the tool is a surfboard to control your trajectory you have to choose for from among a range of fins to adhere to the board there are various waxes and to be sure not to lose it you use a leash and we say we have this Gene that can do something we have this other part that can regulate the production of this protein and then we can glue together for example 10 pieces to create a large DNA circuit what we do is we usually actually go to the freezer and we look to see what parts what genetic circuit we have available to build something one of the important goals in synthet biology is to be able to have a huge library of parts and circuits that are just available for us and for everyone else in the world to be able to engineer with there the number of parts and devices and circuits that are available so for example the registry of standard biological Parts is the world biggest collection of genetic parts and I think it has on the order of 10,000 or 15,000 parts that are available for people to experiment with and to build other circuits uh and components with the basic pods or pieces of DNA used as construction modules are naturally known by those who engineer life as bio bricks when their equivalents are applied to the ideal surfing scenario they enable Ron Weiss to use the most cuttingedge technology to float and glide and keep stable All That Remains is the human factor and this is much more difficult to control for Ron the fact that not every aspect of life is understood in no way hinders engineers in their research we definitely want to be able to program the cell before having a full and complete understanding of it and as we we it to refine and reoptimize the programs so it programming learning programming learning programming learning so what can run wi achieve using this technique today in his lab he can manufacture 300 biological circuits in parallel in three or four days with each one containing up to 15 genes but this is nothing compared to what he will have to be able to do in order to build the circuits for a cell with more complex functions the circuit in a bacteria requires 4,000 genes in a human cell this would be 880,000 genes for simple behaviors we now are able able to engineer the cells to be able to perform them reliably but what about more complex behaviors my dream in synthetic biology is be able to type for example a genetic program or use some kind of a 3D modeling tool that allows me to think about the behavior that I want and press a button and then a few hours later get a tube of DNA that contains a genetic circuit that will exactly carry out that program when I put that inside the cells it haven we can program the cell to do anything that we [Music] want as I leave Ron Weiss and the MIT campus I can synthetic biology research is essentially North American there are quite simply more resources here more Labs more Capital The Prestige and the money of American universities attract students and phds from around the world and many of them settle here however in Europe and in France there are several centers devoted to synthetic biology as well as a number of independent teams Jerome Bonet runs such a team after a long stay at Stanford he returned to Southern France to pursue his research thanks to private funding he too wants to master the complexity of cellular circuits and sees living beings as instruments instruments he wants to control my name is Jerome Bonet I synthetic biology scientist at the structural biochemistry Center in mon what I engineering principles particularly Electronics principles to cells we could basically say it means programming cells like we program a computer hello Jerome hello shaonan are you well fine and you yeah in West African music there are some very simple rhythms with certain clearly defined Elements which intertwine in a complex way we can compare a cell to this sum of small actions which are ultimately simple but which combine to form something complex in synthetic biology we the complexity we can manipulate because of the various contextual effects we might find like interactions between components we don with very simple systems and once we understood them we can add other parts and make them more complex so the the plans to go to your lab yeah let disciple of Drew Andy one of the founding fathers of synthetic biology Gerome Bonet has decided to apply his mentors Maxim to his own work complexity sucks he relies on the notion that if one soon be able to understand it and what he wants to build should be of use to the complex biological systems conceived by Chris Voit Ron Weiss and Jim Collins my research involves manufacturing genetic components which enable cells bacteria as it happens to perform logic operations additions and multiplications and also to store information to have memory that we can program the aim is to program a cell using a language that close to a computer language certain functions are much more difficult to obtain in electronics but we manage to obtain them in biology where the architecture is much more simple notably because in electronics we have motherboards where we install components and it biology we molecular soup in three dimensions and so this enables different interaction action what I initially developed in my work were genetic switches which are based on the manipulation of DNA molecules in cells the switches designed by Jerome Bonet enable the expression of a gene to be controlled this means the implementation or not of a particular genetic function but as I really understand a logic gate is several transistors transistors right yeah Jerome risks an analogy with the nearby Canal what we sequences these switches is to control the DNA like we control the flow of water in a canal with locks we can either block the Gene not what we equivalent of a transistor [Music] I like an onoff switch for the current and Jerome Bonet is already bombarding me with a number of poetic terms such as RNA polymerase logic gate ribosomal subunits enzymes what I do understand though is that like with computers by combining transistors increasingly complex functions can be created within a cell it lets us introduce calculation into biology the world is completely changed whereas it cost 3 million to sequence the human genome 15 years ago today we can do it for ,000 in the day we progress but compared with electronics we started building computers or even before the transistor was invented we provide people with tools and then they apply them to their particular problem this could be for making a therapeutic molecule for example like an antimalaria molecule or for programming a cell like a lymy for detecting cancer biomarkers things like [Music] that tools like those developed by Jerome Bonet first of all have to fulfill a function in synthetic biology like with all research applications are needed and as soon as possible and so it healthc care sector that these bioengineers have concentrated their effort eff if there see the biggest pharmaceutical Laboratories it of three countries it feger a professor of biotechnology and bio engineering at eth the federal Polytechnic he also uses and assembles biog bricks but with very precise medical applications hi John hi Martin nice to meet you nice to meet you [Music] here in Basel people produce Blockbuster drugs which are on the market saving uh thousands of people lives so it was most natural to expand this technology using designer cells so cells which are engineer at multiple levels on the way to his laboratory Martin feger shows me something that has become a symbol of the city and which in his mind also symbolizes the logic behind his work the fountain created by Jean tangali what tangali did is he took rubbish parts parts uh which people threw away and from this compon components he reassembled machines which are not useful but are beautiful so uh the analogy with synthetic biology is take the parts biology Parts we they can work like machines unlike Dy who does something beautiful synthetic biology is also a piece of art but has the ambition by assembling new components to do something useful for example in treatment strategies I think artists and scientists they are pretty similar you need to be the crazy guy the creative guy who invents and innovates uh support ideas which are not uh Common Sense there about the eth offices scientific workplaces and Labs all over the world tend to look the same with supposed to be at the Forefront of research here but the real Innovation lies inside the heads of those who work here yes this is just a cell which lights up and this is some simulation and Martin feger has a truly unique approach well what we develop is our so-called prostetic networks now we are very familiar with the word Prosthetics if we have uh a problem with the heart we get a prosthetic heart if we have a problem with our arms we have prothesis for that so meaning mechanical prosthesis which replace a mechanical part of our body now we transer this complex from the mechanical world into the metabolic and the molecular world we call the designer cell and we engineered the bio sensor which constantly senses the metabolite in the blood if it levels and if it it the designer cells can precisely sense the metabolite in the blood it processes this information and produces a protein which is then released back into the bloodstream so if your blood fat levels are too high the sensor recognizes that produces a satiety hormone which tells your brain you should stop feeding there behind that the sensor which looks constantly at the blood fat levels is actually just a derivative of a sensor which we have in the liver so it fact that this was engineered into cells which are then implanted into the body which makes this device unique Martin fena shows me the mice in which his designer cells have already been implanted these cells prove the progress that the next step implanting them in the human body in order to obtain this objective the cells have to be produced according to procedures that are strictly regulated other so here we have to treed mice they uh are normal here they have type two diabetes we need to control therapeutic trans gen very precisely so we thought about the best way to control trans Gene in your implants was to control transin in your body through the skin just by Shining Light onto the [Music] skin in future applications the blue light will be replaced by an organic trigger within the body for the moment the blue light only serves as proof of concept Martin tells me how it works the blue light penetrates the skin reaches your uh designer cells implanted Under the Skin and can fine-tune the expression of a gene inside your body inside the implant so the sensor we used at that time time was just the blue light sensor we all have in our eyes it reacts to the blue light we shine onto the Skin So this again is a beautiful example on how synthetic biology has nothing to do with being synthetic or artificial it natural human receptor from the eye into another cell prosthetic networks cannot only get the regulation Dynamics right it can already detect the onset of a disease so which means it automatically diagnoses the problem and already counteracts it your implant will supervise your body at any time and you don it takes care of diagnosis and the first Intervention when we Len listen to the scientists the arrival of such application seems imminent in reality this isn in everyday pance means 10 years at [Music] best I still have time to eat chocolate unless I light but perhaps now is the time to worry about the secondary implications or side effects of such work and applications in this context we have to take other factors into account such as economic issues and political [Music] action one good place to start could be Washington DC and so I head there to find out [Music] more I meet Elliot or Powers a Belgian who she works at the woodro Wilson Center a think tank and discussion forum for academics scientists and politicians the first thing Elenor works on is public perception she wants to know how people regard this new technoscience if they it s biology it is really not a word that that sounds great these days why are people more comfortable with some technologies and really scared of other ones I think in the case of CTIC biology first of all there is a problem with playing with something that alive something that genetic code you know it identity in a [Music] way to get get a better idea of how people perceive what these Engineers of Life are doing Elenor regularly invites citizens panels to take part in focus groups the first question to be raised concerns what they know about the subject most of the time people don know about stic biology they don usually don it but you know they are actually able to make quick analogies quick characteristics to Notions like cloning stem cells and genetic engineering 15% of our participants are concerned about the risk of synthetic biology before information and it moves to 33% post information which means that when you start to explain to them what you do with Biology on a computer DNA is the software of live what kind of application we could have for DNA Energy System for the food system the discussion becomes more complex there are concerns about long-term implications they are concerned about government failures failure to control failure to anticipate failure to ethics they want oversight regulation transparency but if you look at her technological history there is always failures to control and failures to anticipate you always have a form of accident or a form of surprise when you deal with new technologies a great humanist said that technology gives you a gift in one hand and stab you in the back with the other and that I itself the problem is that science is part of an economic Enterprise it supposed to produce growth you need to go fast um as fast as possible to the market with with great applications I think we should sometimes go fast when it comes to health research for example but we need to be mindful each time it implications on on larger systems and policy making is definitely behind so from the lab to the federal agencies we need to get better at anticipating potential bios safety and biocurity implications before commercialization but we have time to do risk research because most of the promises are going to be realized only in 10 15 20 30 Years elanar also looks at other issues that may be of less interest to the general public and less worrying but they discoveries affect our common asset life itself who will own this biology 2.0 you have two obvious cultures that are actually fighting each other in CTIC biologies you have culture that for much more open source systems they come from computer design and they know that Innovation comes from sharing comes from openness and of the most traditional culture that comes from molecular biology they are used to patent some company are actually keeping huge libraries of genetic variations Clos from the public and from other universities and that think it could definitely stifle Innovation can individual interests outweigh the common interest energy Health Food the implications are so important and potentially lucrative that we entitled to our reservations in considering living beings in a radically new way assembling their components like building blocks and modifying them at will to be useful and profitable Engineers have initiated a technological Revolution that goes far beyond anything that [Music] before I can see that some of my own fears shared by Elenor poweres are legitimate but others often come from my lack of understanding about What synthetic biologists are actually [Music] doing what do they intend to make and what are their methods are they getting results are applications already on the market and will these applications now or in the future dramatically change our daily lives my journey into the world of synthetic biology continues [Music] [Music]	Success

scientists who work for uh at that time the power companies and the microwave R companies I mean they called me everything but decent they didn didn a long series of AD Harmony attacks against me personally that pissed me off that made me angry in shreport Louisiana Andrew Marino has devoted his research career to to proving the effects of electromagnetic waves on living matter an objective he set for himself back when he was studying their therapeutic effects the initial work had to do with understanding how the body electrical signals um are used to regulate and control its growth uh and I was in an Orthopedics Department in the in the late 60s and early 70s and we were interested in using this information to help grow bone um uh particularly after a a fracture an injur injury and as part of uh as part of animal experimentation regarding safety before we applied electrical energy to people uh we began applying it to animals and uh uh uh we began to see uh changes in in animals that um uh seemed ominous seemed serious over the past 40 years Marino has published close to 150 articles on the biological effects of Electro magnetic fields these articles shed doubt on the reassuring statements issued by the industries exposing the [Music] public since the 60s the increase in artificial radiation has led to several studies among groups of people who are highly exposed to it those who live near airports or high tension lines Personnel in the Telecommunications industry and above all the military but studies underscoring the functional troubles or risks of illnesses linked to low-level waves are systematically criticized the common wisdom in the early 1970s at that time the focus was on Radars and and microwave ovens and power lines because cell phones didn exist the common wisdom was that the energy that they produce is so weak that it can affect the body uh so the the seminal question then became is that common wisdom correct or incorrect from the fields produced by electrical appliances to Wi-Fi our daily environment exposes us to all sorts of radiation but the concerns of both the public and scientists were rekindled with the invention of the cell phone a radiation emitting object that we hold right up to our heads the reason electromagnetic waves are so intriguing to researchers is because of the energy they transport through space because when we talk about electromagnetic waves in concrete terms we other words of particles that carry energy the higher the frequency of the w the more energy the photon has and the more photons there are the more powerful the radiation we distinguish different kinds of electromagnetic waves by their frequencies [Music] the radiation used for communications has a relatively low frequency which means not much energy cell phone signals belong to the microwave family between 900 and 2,000 MHz as this is lower than the frequency of light we assumed they were harmless since the radiation known to be aggressive to matter such as X Rays or gamma rays occurs at much higher frequencies [Music] back when the first mobile phones were put on the market the only known effects of microwaves were thermal at high power in other words when a large quantity of photons is emitted microwaves cause water molecules to vibrate and heat up matter this is how microwave ovens work cell phones function at frequencies similar to ovens in in other words with the same type of photons but at a power that question researchers first asked was whether the energy transmitted by phones was enough to heat the brain Joe VR is a physicist employed by a cell phone operator the purpose of his research is to measure the energy transferred from the phone to the brain to guarantee there effect by measuring electric fields in liquid joov VR infers the energy absorbed by the 10 most exposed grams of the brain he determines a phone SAR its specific absorption rate Ma the S listed in a phone booklet States the maximum energy absorbed by the user brain the legal s limit is set at 2 watts per kilog of matter which ensures mobile phone users that no significant amount of heat is generated contrary to what this hoax ad by a company marketing headsets suggests if you can focus on on heat generating uh mechanism you know that your device doesn human head uh if it did no one could ever measure it because we can thermometers into the middle of the drain so it speaking as a lawyer to adviser might say fund all those studies you possibly can the legal norms for telephones based on the SAR are more and more disputable because they rest on the assumption that health problems can only arise from thermal effects what Andrew Marino suggests however is that radiation could have other consequences besides generating Heat at levels below what the SAR allows us to measure it carnival game where where you you put a pee under one of three Walnut shells and you move the Walnut shells around and you try to confuse people with the p is and it they get you to be looking at this shell but the the real problem is under that shell this shell is Sir that problem among these questions research essential concern is whether or not artificial waves can have an effect without generating a rise in temperature below the legal limits does matter react to radiation without any detectable transfer of energy that can be measured by physicists [Music] imp [Music] [Music] alen vion caused quite a stir [Music] along with physicists from the lasia lab in France who designed a reverberation chamber that gave perfect control of radiation exposure Alan vion exposed tomato plants to frequencies equivalent to those emitted by mobile phones for 10 minutes to avoid any thermal effects he used a level of energy lower than the legal s limits [Music] the experiment showed that the plants did in fact react to exposure they were quick to produce the protein calmodulin a typical response when plants are exposed to environmental stress [Music] [Music] the experiment was widely cited in international Publications the results established by vion scientific Dogma living organisms can indeed react to radiation without a measurable transfer of energy despite F himself in the debate on health risks this fundamental experiment attracted a great deal of media attention and reawakened concern about the consequences of artificial radiation are humans as sensitive to electromagnetic waves as plants [Music] are usually at night I became ill and I I felt like I couldn breathe as soon as I had a panic I had to sit up and I started to feel that um I had problems falling asleep because I was afraid that that would stop [Music] breathing I I can friends and so on longer I have changed occupation because of my Electro hypers sensitivity in Sweden over the course of the more and more people claim to be affected by electromagnetic radiation like allergic reactions the problems they described forc them to take shelter to withdraw and physically cut themselves off from a world that had grown hostile [Music] known for his militant positions o Johansson is one of the first researchers in the world to seriously consider these people symptoms after leading studies on the skin cells of people irritated by computer screens he historical figure in the debate on artificial radiation by fighting for social recognition of these symptoms and giving them a generic name electr hyper sensitivity every human being is Electro sensitive if I would take you and put your fingers into the socket you would have a strong voltage shock you know so that electrosensitivity uh and that of course but these people with the electr hyper or over sensitivity they react maybe to fields that you and I we do not react to when you look on the incidents there has been some very sharp increases uh for instance 1997 and then the digital techniques in Mobile telecommunication was introduced in Sweden and for some reason the number of such persons and their complaints they again started to increase Electro hyper sensitivity is officially recognized in Sweden as a disability and 2% of the population claims to be affected but although the number of registered cases is increasing throughout the world the phenomenon remains a medical Enigma if I know or can figure out what happens in the body then I can also hopefully try to do something about it I think most of us reason that way the opponents the people that didn believe in this from the very beginning they said that such persons they were just postmenopausal women they were imagining this they had some psychosomatic reaction Etc which could be the case although when new groups were added these counter explanations died away of course electr hyper sensitivity raises a question that has yet to be clarified and arouses the Curiosity of scientists because until now no lab study has clearly proven learn the link between exposure and the appearance of symptoms adding more fodder to the feud between those who suspect eh sufferers are victims of collective paranoia and those who consider them harbingers of a health Scandal now I studies led by Andrew Marino explore the human body at a very weak frequency for 20 minutes Marino isolates his human guinea pigs from all environmental influences and then submits them to random stimulation of an extremely weak electromagnetic field the basic idea of the study is to prove conclusively that uh electromagnetic field enter the human body and are detected by the body probably in the head uh and uh result in changes in human brain electrical activity analysis of subjects brain activity shows that they do indeed detect the signal even at an unconscious level the nervous system detects sound light heat touch taste electromagnetic fields the same process there located someplace it interacts with the electromagnetic field that comes into the body and generates a signal to the brain to tell the brain that there electromagnetic field in the subject environment the brain recognizes that there therefore ignores the signal but this process of detecting and ignoring detecting and ignoring taxes the Adaptive ability of the of the body in other words you going on all the time compared to your your health if this wasn the time according to Marino humans react to electromagnetic waves in the same ways they react to other environmental stimuli but this original Theory remains restricted by the lack of funding Marino has for his research at this stage despite the growing amount of evidence human sensitivity isn by the scientific [Music] Community but behind the problem of the body the question of their harmfulness reemerges do they represent a major public health issue governments are launching vast research programs and scientists are called upon to provide rapid and final [Music] answers in the year 2000 the European Union decided to fund The Reflex project proposed by the verum foundation in Germany the aim was to observe whether mobile phone radiation had adverse effects on human cells France loffer was the research coordinator his role was to combine the expertise of biologists and physicists from 12 labs in seven different European countries to come up with a study he hoped would be irrefutable [Music] four years later ad Coffer presented his report which he centered on the most alarming [Music] results this Happ for in fact in a living organism there are specialized proteins that repair brakes in DNA strands but the bigger the brakes the higher the risk that something goes wrong in the repair which can lead to chromosomal [Music] aberations but many researchers are skeptical about the capacity of microwave to break DNA strands even indirectly Adel cofer highly disputed and despite his admonitions he from the EU even though they commissioned the study in 2008 edel Cofer asked the European union for more funding to verify the results he whether the effects observed with inv vitro cells can also be found in living beings [Music] meanwhile all over the world a multitude of guinea pigs are being submitted to the entire range of microwaves in search of the majority of known illnesses many experiments come up with unsettling results many come up empty-handed but they all reach the same cautious conclusion more studies are needed unud in Bordeaux France the IMs is renowned for replicating experiments that have found adverse effects and contradicting their results these experiments partially funded by cell phone operators are led by biologist Isabelle lroy and Bernard ver an expert in electromagnetic [Music] fields for in Lun Sweden in addition to his work as a neurologist Leaf sulf conducts research on rat brains and in particular on their blood brain barrier the blood brain barrier is very special it has tight junctions as compared to all the other capillaries in the body the brain has a very special uh type of wall which is highly constricted and which just doesn out the blood brain barrier prevents substances in blood vessels from passing into brain tissue after exposing animals to mobile phone radiation for 2 hours sford noticed that the blood brain barrier became permeable in 1/3 of the rats exposed which provoked a leak of Albin when we in the late 90s after having studied 15 or 1600 rats uh and found that this was a solid finding there is for sure a leakage of alamin the rats own alamin out into the neurons these leaks could be causing migraines or according to Sul the destruction of neurons a neuronal damage also might be an explanation when you talk about how a tumor is produced in the special both the balina type and the Bine [Music] type and yet the impact of electromagnetic waves on the blood brain barrier has indeed been confirmed by several teams throughout the world of the 15 or so studies published the majority confirm this type of effect how can we explain that studies on the same animals seeking the same effects provoked by the same waves wind up with opposite conclusions the confusion that emerges from all these carefully run experiments reflects the massive Stakes resting on these research Under Pressure Laboratories find themselves pitted against one another some funded by operators are faulted for being lenient While others are accused of negligence in their [Music] protocol the data keeps accumulating but Society is still waiting for a fin final verdict what conclusion can we draw from the thousands of articles that have been published up till now interpretations of the same data differ from one researcher to another and the scientific truth eludes us an essential question emerges from all this confusion at what point should the public be alerted if you have like 5,000 Publications in peer reviewbased scientific journal and if that it 50001 or 50002 or when is it enough and who is going to decide that there is a huge amount of experiments now showing that there is some something and I would say that that the governments the states the authorities they really have a very very strong obligation to listen to this in 2007 bioinitiative an independent report captured International attention it compiled the most disturbing results of 1500 studies and extrapolated a multitude of adverse effects on humans in particular cognitive troubles sleep disturbances hormonal upsets that could lead to breast cancer risks of neurodegenerative diseases various tumors in the brain or salivary glands cardiac Rhythm abnormalities disturbances of the immune system or even a decrease in [Music] fertility this highly alarming report was signed by a dozen researchers who decided on their own initiative to alert public authorities and the media to what they consider to be a major health risk and I think it that the public is confused and doesn really know what to think the delicate position of governments faced with an uncertain risk translates perfectly into a fashionable concept the precautionary principle we really need to ensure that the precautionary approach is taken we also need proper research centers to be set up to ensure that the real effects of this kind of uh non-ionizing radiation are actually properly examined by independent assessors but above all the precautionary principle reveals an irrefutable fact research on health risks is always a step behind Technologic iCal Innovations Torn Between the urgency of the situation and the necessary objectivity fundamental research is trying to understand how cells react to electromagnetic waves after studying how plants responded to mobile phone radiation Alan vion expanded his research to human [Music] cells to study the interaction between waves and living matter Alan vion decided to focus his research on skin cells [Music] the first stage of the experiment consists in seeing whether exposed cells trigger an adaptation mechanism in response to [Music] radiation because our cells are constantly adapting to environmental constraints this is why they produce proteins which are the workers in the cell for example when the temperature around a cell is too high a specific Gene is activated to produce proteins which temper the cell vion is looking for Clues to protein production in cells exposed to microwaves are human cells sensitive to the waves of mobile phones [Music] the cells react one hour after exposure these results show that human cells are sensitive to radiation levels comparable to the those found in our environment this discovery opens the door for new Research into understanding the consequences of this sensitivity by exposing a biochip on which each human gene has been isolated VI On the entire range of reactions that human cells could have [Music] in response to this work other researchers are focusing on a very specific cellular mechanism and exploring the consequences this is the case with a major experiment published in 2007 by Ronnie Seager the first question was can we detect the response by low no thermal effect very low energy radiation for short time and the answer is yes then we ask ourselves the next question what is the mechanism how the cell sends this low energy radiation and transmit it into the [Music] cell the DNA is actually the commander of the cell it tells the other parts what to do and how to do them Ronnie Seager is a biologist at The whitesman Institute in Tel Aviv his speciality is signal transmission inside cells there are a large number of different receptors the aim of his research is to understand how DNA is informed by what happens in the exterior environment in order to trigger the production of appropriate proteins there are several different communication lines it actually like telephone lines they take the signal from the membrane and bring it to the nucleus and then the DNA can start operating and tell the cell what to [Music] do proteins are produced from DNA to adapt the environment the cell has to tell the DNA which proteins it needs this is the role of signaling Pathways which transfer information from the cellular membrane upon contact with the environment to the core where the DNA is found we decided to apply a very low energy radiation much below the energy that is emitted by a normal cellular phone and for very short time 5 minutes 10 minutes 15 minutes and see if we can see any changes in the communication lines when Sega subjected the cell to radiation he discovered the systematic overactivation of one particular signaling pathway we identified this pathway we call it Cascade because it activating the other activating the other you know the exception or characteristic of this discovery can be explained by the complexity of this signaling pathway transcription factors okay is that clear seager attention beyond the scientific Community because this particular signaling pathway is also involved in cell [Music] growth the overactivation of this signal could therefore favor the proliferation of cells it mechanisms of the cancer process there is a chance that the radiation that we found under some condition again I want don alarm everyone just for the low energy radiation but there are chances that with high enough energy this will be somehow support production of cancer not cause it by itself but support it [Music] but beyond the mere health issue the collective goal of all these scientists is to identify the initial interaction between waves and living matter the transformation of the physical energy from phone radiation into a biological process [Music] everything boils down to the semi-permeable membrane the interface between a world of disturbance and the highly regulated balance of the cell where is the interface between the physical response the radiation and the biological response name be the enzyme somewhere in the cell membrane could be a protein capable of detecting waves to identify it Marino in on the case of the glass catfish this fish is extremely sensitive to electromagnetic fields and can detect minute fluctuations in the Earth magnetic field by applying extremely weak electrical charges to the surface of this fish attempted to locate the first receptor on one surface of that cell we can find the specialized protein that detects these very very weak fields we expect to find the same protein when we begin looking for it in the human cerebellum it if you identify it then you to H finally come with solution to some of the problem that may occur by radiation Seager assumes it protein nadh his theory is that the distribution of electrical charges of this protein could be modified by the very weak microwave fields and trigger a chain reaction [Music] despite all of these cuttingedge studies we still don explanation but each researcher is gathering evidence in their own field that little by little clarifies questions about the health consequences of mobile [Music] phones the cell studies they can give us information about mechanism for cancer but epidemiology is said to be the most important part if you look into the risk for human health because we have to do with we we are doing with human beings and not with animals in Laboratories or cell studies in Arro Sweden Lenard hardell regularly carries out research to identify the causes of cancer in his patients contrary to lab experiments Howell people in their natural environment he conducts epidemiological studies well the idea came in early 1990s when I was in a National Group in Sweden looking into the whole field of electromagnetic fields from electrical supplies and from power lines and so on because we had the debate about the leukemia risk so I was on that committee and when we looked into the data in epidemiology we saw that there could be an iation between electronics Industry and brain tumors so we decided to do a specific study on [Music] that hardel creating two groups of people one Afflicted with a targeted illness in this case a brain Shimmer and the other group the control group not [Music] afflicted by comparing cell phone usage between the two groups hardell tried to determine if the cell phone is a risk [Music] factor the main trouble with this kind of study is gathering accurate information how often did these people use their phones over the past 10 years which year did they generally put their phone up to hardell study carried out on 4,000 people is the most commented on in the world because it was the first to point out an increased risk of different kinds of brain tumors linked to cell phones what we see is that there is an an increased risk after cell phone use for 10 years for gomas and also for acoustic Nomas we can see that the risk for acoustic Nomas is even a bit earlier than for 10 years but it the longer time you use it and the same risk is found for the cordless phones as used mostly in homes or in offices we must point out that the individual risk is is very low because it 10,000 person whatsoever who gots the disease and if it in that population but the problem is of course that this is a worldwide exposure so still if the risk is low individually you will get many cases because everybody hardel telephones because the effects of relay antennas are even more complicated to measure the power of their radiation quickly diminishes with distance relay antennas expose us to a much weaker amount of energy than a cell phone pressed up against the ear but they do so continually and until now no study has managed to clearly evaluate their influence on our [Music] this lack of knowledge leaves the public and media without any rational tools to explain the recurrence of disturbing incidents public opinion has been inflamed by abnormally High rates of cancer among children in schools where relay antennas exist while official reports conclude it and residents is forcing operators to dismantle their most controversial antennas after 15 years of research the sensitivity of human cells to radiation from mobile phones has been confirmed by numerous lab studies but statistics concerning the health consequences remain uncertain if the risk of serious illness such as a brain tumor appears low for an individual it could very well be significant on the scale of 3 billion users as for the chronic symptoms of electrosensitivity they documented more and more often but the real impact of electrosmog still Fades into the multitude of fears inspired by our [Music] environment we live in a world where people will smoke cigarettes now I can think of anything more foolish than that uh but you see if you desire to smoke cigarettes a a and you know that they harmful uh the evidence that they harmful hasn you choose to do it that the broad use of lung cancer actually started during the second world war and the epidemiology came in 1950s then it took very long time for society the governments to react the same is for asbestos used since 100 years and there were some early indication that this is hazardous the only thing that I insist on is that is that um the people who would make money from having uh certain factors put into the environment allow the research to be done honestly and honestly communicated what do we know whether it implication of major industrial groups in the research into health risks logically stirs up concern and consequently triggers [Music] suspicion little by little communication strategies have replaced the strict scientific debate as if some people exaggerations could compensate for what others are [Music] hiding mostly history will show who is right or who is wrong and I mean I I was the first in the word to show that agent orange gave the cancer and we were very much attacked at that time and the story is repeated by now in the recurrent debate on health risks we expect scientists to provide definitive answers but in a realm of new research where different fields overlap and where economic interests are at stake the scientific discussion is partially [Music] blurred the clarity of the debate rests on whether we can provide the means for genuinely independent research then everyone one will be able to make an informed decision as to the risks they are willing to take in the name of freedom of choice and what they of safety [Music]	Success

The Hidden Powers of Plants: From Immortality to Space Exploration | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJTcza80_L4	SLICE Science	[Music] humans are gifted with intelligence and creativity we are capable of moving of remembering of feeling we are also persuaded that we are omnipotent yet the observation of the world of plants should incite more humility as the Genome of a simple grain of rice contains twice as many genes as that of a human humans are still struggling to produce efficient solar energy our green neighbors have been mastering this technique since way before we appeared on [Music] Earth mysterious powers are at play and plants are hiding their secrets they transform sunlight into sugar molecules a ready to use form of energy scientists call this photosynthesis chlorophyll is the key player in photosynthesis it allows the plant to absorb energy from light the first step in converting energy from sunlight into a chemical form the pigment absorbs red and blue wavelengths of the spectrum green light is less readily absorbed giving the leaves or algae their overall General [Music] color algae are the very first vegetal organisms to have appeared on Earth they can be found in all aquatic environments enlarged by electron microscopy they look very similar to [Music] jewelry they are datom microalgae with over 100,000 species known to date datom represent the most important group of algae in the vegetal Plankton world at the base of of the Aquatic food chain in spite of their minute size they possess genuine machinery for photosynthesis photosynthesis is one of the most incredibly sophisticated regulated biological machines that we know about without the magic of photosynthesis there would be no oxygen in the atmosphere life would be [Music] rare planet Earth is receiving enough solar energy per hour to power all of Mankind entire year 1 hour of sun for an entire year of energy a humiliation to hum kind still struggling to find efficient ways of capturing sunlight to produce energy plants have had 3 and a half billion years to work out how to turn the energy from sunlight into food they good at it and how they do this is what we mysterious the Sun powerful that plants have developed stop and start security mechanisms to avoid overheating the capture of this energy is so efficient that it needs to be highly regulated because it can provide too much energy to the other parts of the plant so some of that energy needs to be dissipated when the sun that that happens by turning on safety valves these safety valves take the excess energy and dump it as harmless heat rather than destroying the plant [Music] it is these tiny pores called stamata that regulate the gaseous and energetic exchanges in Plants during photosynthesis plants undergo complex energy transfers at unbelievable speeds the capture of sunlight moving through space happens incredibly fast we can lives as ftocs it of a second a ftoc is to a second what a second is to approximately 31.7 million years a staggering rapidity for these plants whose metabolism seems so slow Gregory scholes discovered that plants use quantum physics in order to optimize photosynthesis the sun particles obsorb by the plant can be found in two different locations at precisely the same time can actually take two Pathways or three Pathways simultaneously it was unimaginable just a few years ago that this could happen in something that just grows [Music] outside the tireless quest for Light May well be the reason for the immense Global surface deployed by plants while the skin of a human being covers an average of 2 square m scientists estimate that the leaves of a tree 15 M High covers a surface area of 200 hectar which is roughly the size of Monaco the immense surface of leaves optimize photosynthesis for each ton of vegetal biomass produced nearly 1.4 tons of oxygen is added to the atmosphere and 1.8 tons of carbon dioxide is eliminated plants have the power to absorb carbon dioxide oide a greenhouse effect gas that participates in global warming and as a byproduct they release [Music] oxygen plants have the power to clean the planet during photosynthesis Plants release oxygen from their Roots these attract partners that are essential to plants countless bacteria that will devour the polluting organic matter [Music] in 1974 a revolutionary and natural wastewater treatment system was installed at the NASA Dennis Space Center to filter the Wastewater of both homes and Laboratories we install Plants water heis floating tropical and semitropical water with a beautiful flower to treat all the waste at this large NASA facility which houses about 5 or 6,000 people the research aimed to demonstrate the capacity of plants to transform dirty water into food oxygen and water and This 1.2 hectare Lagoon has largely met the Wastewater elimination requirements set out by NASA today hidden beneath its leaves are alligators and fish and the life of the Lagoon is humming with birds and insects as in a natural [Music] environment the system has functioned for over 40 years maintenance is limited to evacuating the large quantity of hents once a year the plants have magnificently adapted into this environment these water high if you take them out of a river or the natural environment they will have a large root system because they nutrients and minerals they need but once we put them in where we have domestic sewage mix with them they have all the nutrients they need and you can see here they because they don root system that you will see if you pull this out of the river [Music] biological stations using lagon water hents represent only 5% of installation costs and 10% of Maintenance costs of industrial wastewater treatment stations if these plants are so far ahead of us when it comes to depollution why are today not inspired one of the reasons it has been slow to be implemented is because it is simple and most civil engineers that design wastewater treatment system do not understand how plants have such magic and [Music] power plants are not only capable of cleaning Wastewater in addition they are incredible at cleaning and filtering air each species having its own specialty large trees are cleaning factors the more large trees you have the cleaner air is going be Bill Wolverton affirms that plants also give excellent results in the elimination of radioactive elements like cesium 130 strontium 90 and Cobalt found in contaminated soils in Japan where they problem over the years they found that uh sunflowers are very effective so they remove soil from their uh fields near this uh uh horrible accident nuclear power plant failure and it may take some time if plants have become our allies in depolluting the air and soil they equally contribute to purifying the air of our Interiors to test the capacity of plants to produce fresh air under shelter NASA led the bioh home experiment an airtight building built of completely synthetic materials before introducing the plants the men inside the structure devoid of plants had stinging eyes sore throats and respiratory difficulties after introducing plants covering half of the surface inside the home the symptoms disappeared in just a few days if you going to live in a permanent tightly sealed building whether it you regenerative process plants and a root microbes if you can sealed energy efficient building with plants and maintain healthy air in it that to build a more complicated system on the moon where you have to create all of the oxygen if fresh air is essential for astronauts it is just as essential to earthlings the US Environmental Protection agency has identified Endo aair pollution as one of the most serious health problems facing the Americans Bill Wolverton encourages the use of plants in order to grow fresh air for him all modern homes are concerned as they are full of volatile and invisible chemical products before the 20th century chemical products were virtually unheard of today we use more than 80 80,000 and they have invaded our everyday lives practically everything in your home is made of synthetic materials that is chemicals the uh TVs your computers the paint the paning with our modern buildings with synthetic materials when we seal them up to make them energy efficient we seal up hundreds or hundreds of nasty chemicals that cause health problems [Music] in order to fight against energy loss the tendency is to increase the construction of airtight buildings how do you build such a tightly sealed energy efficient building and maintain healthy air and the answer is plants the whole key is to educate the world of how nature can be used to clean our environment and make it a healthy environment and nature has the answer we will only Look To Nature and work with nature we can get out of this mess that we in but are we too arrogant to do it capable of helping us purify our environment plants are also world champions of sustainable development by fabric cating wood plants create unbelievable quantities of primary [Music] [Music] materials researchers estimate that 10 billion tons of wood are created each year by Mother Nature but where does it all come from 99% of this weight is made of air is made of water and made of uh Sun uh energy all these elements are barely or absolutely invisible it makes wood with cellulos and liin and this is a substance similar to Concrete mixed with armed iron but the difference is instead of taking iron from the uh mineral Earth making cement with very much uh fossil energy it needs 150° to make cement the tree makes his wood with invisible elements and builds wood which is as strong as reinforced [Music] concrete perhaps one of the most mysterious forces used by nature is the gravitational infl fluence of the moon on vegetal life it has been proven that the full moon has an incidence on the growth of plants or the conservation of wood used in the building industry the gravitational changes through a day uh mean just a change of the weight of the tree of not more than 8 grams we have analyzed the changes of wood properties according to the failing date uh of many trees 600 trees and observed changes in drying behavior of the wood uh changes in the density of the wood after drying process and all these uh changes also the resistance to compression are very significant uh linked to lunar [Music] rhythms there is no life without rhyth every uh life expression is linked to rhythms and these rhythms provoke something like heartbeat in the plants face tace with seasonal variations plants cannot wrap themselves in a coat or discard it they have to face the elements temperatures can vary from -30 to + 40° C and they are neither hot nor cold about it plants Orient themselves depending on the available light they grow straight up against gravitational forces perpendicular to their trunks branches grow horizontally holding their weight in suspension what is the secret of this miracle for me personally after all these years I no clear answer how it is possible it gravity as um as Factor they are not only powerful against known forces but I have the impression that uh they work with they work with uh with other types of forces just what forces is Ernst Zera referring to could it be that invisible and unidentified forces are hidden within our galaxy 3 2 one Mark is go for auto sequence start [Music] the Atlantis STS 135 space mission transports several hundred rather special passengers they are green they are not aliens but plants destined to play an essential role in the conquest of space [Music] NASA the complex ecosystem of planet Earth in order to establish life in space after 11 days in space this experiment investigates the symbiosis between plants and bacteria in a zero gravity situation 341 check 342 check 343 check 344 check back on Earth the whole team is impatient to know how the little green plants have survived things under [Music] control prior to opening that that seal we dioxide will give us a measure of the amount of growth and respiration and the ethylene an indicator of the stress that the plant has has been under that [Music] good you get a photo of that all right take another one there you [Music] go these plants look quite good they seem to have stayed in place 100% germination no [Music] contamination under zero gravity the symbiosis between plants and bacteria is a success the bacteria created little nodules or pouches on the roots of the plants where they Thrive it is now possible for plants to to grow in space seeds to germinate seeds develop produce flowers pollinate and produce viable [Music] seeds it should even be possible to harvest more fruit and vegetables in space and in a shorter time span than on [Music] earth a short seasoned potato typically will take 105 days we by optimizing light temperature in nutrients to 85 days and get twice world record field yields in 2/3 the time but in order to survive how many plants will space adventurers have to take with them on their [Music] mission we would need about a 20 sare M to produce all of the oxygen you need roughly 40 square m for all of your calories that would provide plenty of water atmospheric regeneration and food production for [Music] one there is no most powerful plant there is no lesser plant each has a role in its function [Music] a life without plants would be a very sterile existence uh I think it would be a noisy existence where machines are removing my carbon dioxide pumps are sending me fresh air filters are moving moving the water I it would be lacking in green it would be lacking the Aromas the textures the colors that that come through through plants and life and that surround us in my environment I can imagine a life without plants it [Music] live some plants have their feet rooted in the earth and their heads in the Stars [Music] this little redwood tree is probably 2 years old it may become a full-grown adult within 50 or 60 years as tall as the ones behind us but it will take hundreds of years for it to become as as large as the biggest redwood trees on the planet trees are the first to have invented skyscrapers and redwoods are the masters of heights the tallest redwood tree is 115 M tall it tall that redwood tree is but it taller than the Statue of Liberty and roughly equivalent to a 30-story building Emily Lim is scientific counselor of the nonprofit organization save the Redwoods luckily today she won study their leaves a high branch has just Fallen at her feet redwoods make two different types of leaves on the same tree these here in my hand are from the forest floor they grow in the Shady parts of the Redwood Forest where they have plenty of water but very little sunlight so the leaves must be bigger the leaves at the top of the redwood tree are much smaller they are trying to conserve water and have a lot of light so don need leaves that are quite as large to do photosynthesis the forest grows in California near the Pacific Ocean which heavily influences the area climate but just how do these trees hydrate during the hot season fog comes rolling in during the summer and it wets the part of the tree all of these choots help to capture that fog water the fog water condenses on the leaves it drips down to the forest floor but it also gets absorbed into these leaves it is incredibly hard for the tree to get water all the way up to the top of the tree where it needs it most and so fog allows the tree to become hydrated directly meters above our head The Secret of their hydration is revealed high up in the trees water vapor is absorbed from the fog through millions of pine needles and their numerous stamata redwoods have grown in this area for millions of years and learned to survive under extreme environmental conditions frequent forest fires the trees have a super resistant bark that acts as a fire barrier this red R Tree here is about 300 years old and you can see that a fire actually did get past the bark layer and burned into the inside of this tree amazingly it these trees are incredibly able to resist fire here the bark is starting to grow over the fire scar in the inside and the bark eventually will cover up the entire cavity [Music] The Majestic giant Seas of Sierra Nevada are also members of the largest trees in the world they have developed similar defense mechanisms a natural fire [Music] barrier the bark at the base of the tree is really thick and that helps protect it it can be up to a foot or more in thickness but that you go up the tree the tree doesn thick bark further up the the damage that primarily at the base so as you go up the bark thickens and as you get up maybe 30 or 40 ft the bark may only be an inch [Music] thick they have the power to resist Decay they have the power to resist animal attack insect attack uh they have the power to resist fire uh virtually anything that is a threat to any other tree in the forest really is not much of a threat to the giant [Music] sequa even with their resistant bark the giant seas are threatened for Wayne and Wendy the park rangers humankind has Disturbed the natural cycles of forest fires [Music] [Applause] [Music] fires burn more intensely uh since we started putting them out we we created a fuel load in the forest that creates a type of fire behavior that even Giants aoas have a hard time resisting they evolved in the presence of very frequent low intensity fires now they very infrequent but very high-intensity fires that that can kill them but low intensity fires play a key role in the reproduction of these Giants to me it something so small can produce something so huge that of oatmeal and there are 200 seeds inside these cones roughly so if you figure that at any given time there a tree that sitting up in that tree ready to be released at any opportunity the seeds contain few nutrients sparing them from insect attacks [Music] the tiny little seed has to find fertile soil within a 3 cm radius from where it lands otherwise it [Music] dies fires clean the forest and leave behind them fertile soil for the seeds the heat rises high above the canopy a signal to the tree that will prepare to release thousands of seeds their strategy of survival is in the quantity of seeds and the extraordinary longevity of those that reach adulthood the giant Seas of the calaris Big Trees State Park in California were amongst the first to be discovered in 1852 the stump is about 24t in diameter right now uh but just recently we found an old record from 1850s they indicate that at that time when it still had the sap wood on it was about 27 ft in diameter such Dimensions were truly inconceivable for the citizens of the 19th century the discoverers of the Giant seoa had a rough time convincing the general public they peeled the bark off took it to the city reassembled it in the shape of the original tree and try to convince people that this is what the actual tree looked like but no one believed it they thought it was a hoax cuz no tree could be that [Music] big today researchers estimate that the biggest seoa weighs 2,100 tons roughly the weight of 30,000 human beings these extraordinary trees have even mastered the art of Being totally useless to humankind upon falling the sheer pressure of their weight breaks the wood into pieces virally every other tree in the environment uh we use for whether provides food Lumber uh construction materials whatever these trees have very little use uh for a while they were being harvested and turned into grape steaks and fence posts which is a shame for such a massive tree to end up like that but because it has such limited use there was never any economic benefit to these trees and so we can appreciate them just for what they are visitors and local speak of a powerful state of emotion when strolling amongst the Giants a spiritual Voyage of body and soul where all notion of time ceases to exist if I years old and these things live to be 3,000 years old um they have an enduring quality about them that that to me is really inspiring they also it lot of people come to grow it pilgrimage there inspiration a sense of [Music] awe the impressive longevity of certain trees May well Intrigue us could the power of green withhold the secret to [Music] immortality have some trees found the means to fight against cellular aging [Music] [Music] [Music] in the White Mountains of California perched at an altitude of 3,500 m in a lunar landscape the bristle cone Pines are recognized as the oldest trees in the world their silhouette May resemble dead wood nevertheless they are alive they because there them you know they of a sterile environment you know it free of a lot of pathogens and other things that would affect their health and eventual long longevity the air is thin the soil is dry and freezes almost every night even during their short 6 week [Music] summer the oldest bristle cone pine tree is almost 5,000 years old and grows only 2 and 1/2 cm per Century almost all the cones on this part of the tree died at the end of the first year of their growing season it takes a pine cone actually two years to mature um and we only have two of them that are going to make it to the end of their development could The Secret of their survival be wrapped up within their DNA David Neil geneticist at the University of California Davis seeks to find out if these trees possess adaptive genetic particularities genes that may be different from one branch to another of the same tree these trees are adapted to live in this very high elevation Zone but if there warming and they cooler places there to go they can because there at the top so the question is can they adapt to live in this very environment if it becomes warmer here or not you know they don up and move if the don environment like a animal does it just picks up and walks away these trees have to be able to survive right here where they are born and do they have the genetic Constitution to be able to do that [Music] surely bristle con pine trees hold an invisible secret to their immortality it and that have never been able to see or understand their genetic [Music] code we expect to in find some unique bits of genetic information it may be very very minor genetic changes but that are uniquely held by this organism that allows it not only to live in this environment but to live so long in this [Music] environment what don old probably the oldest looking the old the very oldest tree in this Forest you would never think it is the oldest um again that longevity um they don look old like humans and other organisms do uh it can be old but not look [Music] old if we can understand the genetic basis of longevity in a bristle cone pine tree might we use that knowledge in order to uh increased longevity in other organisms most notably humans who seem to want to be able to live [Music] forever true Immortals are made of wood [Music] [Music] the age of a tree is not strictly limited to its appearance the key to the secret of longevity in Plants could well be hidden underground with its massive root Network the Aspen poer could be the largest of living organisms on Earth [Music] and at first look one would think that each one of these trees resulted from a separate seed that grew into an individual seedling and then a tree but in fact what we believe has probably happened here that each one of these trees results from a chute emerging from the root of a neighboring tree such that every one of these trees is actually connected to each other through the underground root system here and then in fact every one of these trees is not different but they are exactly the same in fact this is a clone all of these trees are genetically identical if a fire breaks out their root network is well protected beneath ground even if the whole Forest were to be destroyed the roots would survive and trees would grow again the underground network of roots here is enormous in terms of biom mass of these plants that may in fact have all resulted from a single seed at one point in time can you imagine this huge you know many many megatons of biological biomass uh having resulted from just one [Music] seed here that looks like it right here that in a lateral form like a root that had hasn like the other [Music] trees and we believe that poers may be an example of some of the largest if not the largest living organism on Earth [Music] [Music] the races on between scientists each hoping to be the first to reveal the oldest Aspen popper of our planet some colonies may have roots that originated 880,000 years ago it should not be long before genetic research reveals the [Music] truth on another dimension the the plant that appeared most recently on Earth is a genetically modified petunia I have created a new kind of life I added my own DNA to the plant and because now this plant has human DNA humans are animals I call it a plol a unique kind of plant that has animal DNA [Music] [Music] so wherever you see the red veins of the flower my DNA went from my red veins that is my blood to the red veins of the flower you see red veins you my DNA is there [Music] when you realize that your DNA functions actually works in a plant it can only work in a plant if we have something in common and if we have something in common with plants that shows very clearly that life is a network and we are all connected [Music] what you are watching is a natural plal elesia clarkey is half plant half animal to be more precise these sea slugs are animals that behave like a plant they can photosynthesize the sea slugs have incorporated into their own bodies the photosynthetic cells of algae [Music] when they do not find algae to feed on they can remain three or four months without feeding producing their energy exclusively from photosynthesis exactly as plants [Music] do it is surprising cuz animals can photosynthesize animals have to have uh some sort of uh energy input other than carbon and sunlight plants are the only organisms that can survive with uh uh just carbon in sunlight and here animal that does it quite well I mean animals aren photosynthesize that plant-like characteristic but here they are and they do it very well [Music] to his surprise Sydney Pierce discovered another species of sea slug Alisa chlorotica even more efficient this one can survive for an entire year without eating producing all required energy entirely from photosynthesis as long as the food algae is around these animals can continue to live very happily and they don photosynthesize at all uh the trouble is they constantly and so um if they run out of food then they can photosynthesize while humankind focuses on solar panels as a prop for photosynthesis these small sea slugs are well ahead in the race to a Greener [Music] energy the way humans capture uh solar power is entirely mechanical and chemical uh whereas the sea slugs are able to take the photosynthetic Machinery already made right out of the algal cells and put it into their own cells so I don but sea slugs are doing pretty good scientists are trying to figure out how these sea slugs have evolved with the Plant [Music] World could it be at all possible that one day we humans could do likewise that a share of ourselves originates from the Plant World and that some of our energy is produced through photosynthesis it would be nice if humans could do it CU you could just go out and lay on the beach periodically and stop eating food and paying for groceries and so on science is incessantly pushing back the boundaries that have risen between the Plant World and the animal kingdom such boundaries are perhaps not as strong as we once thought researchers are revealing a whole new world a world which is very much our world life is a vast Network and everything is connected [Music]	Success
The Untold Benefits of Hypnosis | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_rL84yDllU	SLICE Science	[Music] [Music] but what is hypnosis is everyone receptive to it how has it developed the father of medical hypnosis was a Scottish surgeon James braid in 1853 braid was late when visiting a patient when he arrived the sick man had his eyes fixed upon a candle flame and seemed cut off from reality pain no longer tormented him braid then had the idea of plunging his patients into a similar state which would give them he reasoned a kind of mental anesthetic medical hypnosis was born while the pioneers of medical hypnosis knew how to take advantage of the effects they knew nothing about the origins or nature of hypnosis [Music] hypnosis is close to mental states that we experience daily without asking ourselves [Music] why when our mind is absorbed in thought lost in contemplation of a picture or taking refuge in the past we enter a state of consciousness that forgets about the surrounding reality hypnosis consists of provoking this mental disconnection perhaps you seen a blue sky with little white clouds sailing over it then the physician guides the patient suggestions and there you might perhaps find the shape of an armchair and you can take the time to settle yourself in it for over 30 Years Maria Elizabeth Fonville and teams from the University Hospital of Le have pioneered Research into medical [Music] hypnosis we network of Consciousness consciousness of the external world everything which we feel through our sens and also that sort of internal Consciousness that little voice that speaks to us and by which we are absorbed when under hipnosis we are in a little internal world and disconnected from that which surrounds us [Music] thanks to Medical imagery brain activity under hypnosis can be characterized and differentiated from simple distraction like the recall of a memory Focus your attention and now I find nice things in your memories and enjoy this Moment by looking at all the detail of what is around you there so here in a normal State these regions of the brain are blue which is the network of consciousness of our surroundings what is felt and here in a state of distraction which means that episodes from the past are being relied but without hypnosis and brain activity is always present however under hypnosis there really is a kind of disconnection all this region is dis activated and it can be seen to disappear analysis of cerebral imagery is accompanied by a qualitative study of the sensations felt by the volunteers as well as the questionnaires I ask you as well how deeply were you absorbed in your memory and did you notice any details oh yes can you explain I was in the woods when I was walking there was a carpet of leaves and I could feel the coolness and smell it all the brain of the volunteer behaved as if the experience they described had really happened sun while cerebral imagery shows that the network of consciousness of surroundings is disconnected under hypnosis other areas of the brain are very busy it can be seen that in these regions which are rather visual and which are important for feeling and for movement as well as for emotion there hypnosis yes so there between thinking or remembering something and experiencing it under hypnosis because hypnosis activates these regions as if things were really being seen really felt as if you were really moving hypnotic suggestion is capable of making us live through a mentally constructed experience and so to modify our perception of reality is conceded by it which makes hypnosis particularly interesting as a means of escaping pain in this condition he can feel no pain your arms and your hands are without sensation mry the long need Carter give me your right hand as You observe the needle has been thrust completely through the subject hand no feeling no pain this lack of feeling is the one infallible test of profound hypnosis even though this film made in 1945 is a little exaggerated hypnosis can really treat pain paralyzed for following an accident Patrick Coulson suffered from sharp pains and cramps in his legs drugs and chemical treatments no longer helped he turned towards hypnosis with Dr Fonville at the LI Hospital hello sir how are you fine thanks just fine really it yes completely in terms of my pain I can manage to get above it to manage it more easily so when I pain you do the hypnosis exercise I do the hypnosis exercise I can really feel it Go socially it I really bitter I drugs I have to take by around 50% oh yes you were taking a lot before huge good and it to you well I may have handed you the keys but you open the door and it important that you know that hypnosis acts like an internal voice that modifies our perception of reality reprogramming our perception of a situation or a sensation con as far as the perception of pain is concerned we can see here all this network which lights up which activates when we of normal wakefulness whereas under hypnosis you can see that there activity a little brain activity can still be seen in the primary sensory cortex so the subject is still feeling something but it differently there you like although there is always some perception of what happening when somebody experiences pain we see activity in multiple areas of the brain it goes to the sensory cortex which processes where the stimulation was how big it was it also goes to the lyic system anterior singular cortex where information is processed about is this something I should be worried about is this something that should make me suffer and make me frightened it also goes to the other parts of the brain the frontal cortex that processes what does this sensation mean is it dangerous or is it okay when all those work together to say the body is in danger the brain then creates pain [Music] all these parts of the brain that interact to create the pain experience work together and by influencing any one of them you can decrease pain Dr dson yes nice to meet you nice to meet you too welcome to the study appreciate your participation here let me take your code oh thank you Dr Jensen is trying to evaluate the effects of hypnosis on patients suffering from chronic pain before the first session we going to be calling you to assess outcomes how much you sleep quality and different outcomes such as that and then we get an EEG assessment electroen craphy you sessions with me and then after treatment have a second EEG assessment because we anticipate that the treatment will have some specific effects on your brain activity at the cerebral imagery Center the patient taking part in the study has an initial electroencephalogram this records a profile of the brain waves which is used as a reference point before the first hypnosis session and now you can imagine you can experience any uncomfortable Sensations as an image or an object perhaps it fire perhaps it represents those uncomfortable Sensations and in your mind can place that object into a box it thick strong insulated box so those Sensations are muffled it farther away after the hypnosis sessions the patient returns to the imagery Center for a new electroen come on in oh thank you okay so today we another recording to compare with the first one sure when you came in before I your eyes and use whatever skills or techniques you learned EEG recordings allow us to understand the effects of hypnosis on brain activity with hypnosis we see a greater increase in this very slow wave activity called theta waves these waves correspond to a relaxed State and improve mental availability one of the things we found in our studies is that many patients report not only that their pain is reduced but they have these other beneficial effects as well they sleeping better they feel more calm they feel more in control of their emotions how you doing that was very relaxing so hypnosis has side effects but they universally beneficial you compare that to medications for pain such as opioids that cause constipation that cause breathing difficulties that can be you can get a tolerance for even addicted to if there were a drug that that produced the pain reduction benefits of hypnosis plus gave you a sense of well-being a sense of control a sense of calmness that drug would be a blockbuster everybody would be on that drug you hypnosis is free I mean once you learn it you have it however for 150 years medicine has favored chemical and drug treatments for pain the invention of anesthetics such as ether in 1850 and then later nitrous oxide opened the way to Domination by chemical anesthesia and medical hypnosis was [Music] forgotten for several years certain practitioners have been rediscovering its virtues especially in anesthesia during surgical operations at the leage hospital Dr Jo has become a specialist in hypnotic anesthesia hello Madam how are you before the operation he goes over the key points he has established with the patient in a previous consultation so I a little definition of hypnosis as I said yesterday hypnosis is a modified State of Consciousness so it dream it isn conscious and so you perceptions and you touching your throat so it State of Consciousness and what modifies it will be a memory that you relive it this patient who will ago a thyroid operation has opted for hypnosedation which is a combination of hypnosis and local anesthetic 8,000 patients have already been operated in this way at the LI Hospital you comfort spreading closer and closer a little like waves making their way up a beach Dr Jaris will little by little guide the patient to pleasant memories of an afternoon she spent bathing in Hot Springs that she has chosen to relive while I little you can imagine that you having a nice bath or a shower and while your throat is being wiped with a cool liquid imagine what you will feel is the shower water trickling over your throat around your neck over your shoulders and as it runs over your body it increases your feeling of comfort even more and now what happens around you in the room doesn you anymore you voice and the music and while a piece of material is placed over your face you there calmly hypnos sedation reduces operation stress appreci as well as the secretion of hormones linked to this we hypnos sedation the production of hormones is less than is released when a general anesthetic is administered but what astonishing and interesting is that when there is surgery there is inevitably an inflammatory reaction but we able to show that Hypno sedation reduces the intensity of that inflammatory reaction from the surgeon sedation has other advantages we realized that bleeding was easier to control because the patient was in a more natural state and there was better vascular control than there is under general anesthetic hypnosedation doesn surgery at all the anst has a different role from what they must perform for a general anesthetic using chemicals a general anesthetic is a reversible pharmacological coma and let me tell you further that despite all the research the deeper mechanisms by which our anesthetic agents function are still not very well understood so you state of coma can be avoided by using another a technique well I think that all the better for the patient and the proof of the benefit of avoiding that coma is clearly that postoperative recovery is faster good evening Madame Cay how are you everything going well you happy about it it went well really well I was in the Springs so I had a nice day there you are it was good I could feel that I was in surgery but really in my head I was somewhere else I see you there that yes well that the hypnosis well if you surgery under a general anesthetic there found it a bit more difficult to concentrate [Music] properly in France it was not until 2013 that medical hypnosis was officially recognized by the authorities Dr Jean Mark benheim convinced the faculty of medicine to create a specialized training cursus more and more doctors are discovering this new approach to all medical studies are made on a basis of intellectual understanding but hypnosis opens up another field which I would call sensorial we agree I object often in the first lesson the students the doctors perform as if they were patients experiment to disturb to disconcert and confuse the senses so that later they can use that with their patients it becomes confused and I know just what force I should apply but am I holding [Laughter] anything the Keen interest of the medical world is a result of the beneficial effects of hypnosis that are seen daily by Medical Teams now it question of scientifically evaluating these effects this is what veronique Vice blat an anst at the moner hospital is doing she practices hypnosis with pregnant women in labor to calm the pain of contractions and reduce Their Fear of epidural injections so on a scale of 0 to 10 of fear what number is your fear if zero is no fear of an epidural and 10 is maximum fear what number are you seven seven so what I now is to swing forward at your own Rhythm calmly and Beatrice will help you the method Associates nonverbal hypnosis in the form of a light swing backwards and forwards with suggestions made by Veron now you can walk in a place that you once liked a place you like now a place where you feel at ease and safe vinique Vice blat has made a study of 155 women which shows the effectiveness of hypnosis two out of three women have a clear reduction of contraction pain and of the fear of epidural injection the average pain which was at 7.5 Falls to 5 out of 10 after hypnosis and the fear of epidural injection which was at five on average Falls to 3.2 for all the womenm evaluating the benefits of hypnosis interests official Health institutions like inserm in France zulet gagen is the coordinator of a report which has listed studies LED throughout the world while in Germany these Studies have been given a lot of Aid in France they have had little support and what means did you have to make this study Goodwill everyone absolutely no institutional financial help while the effects of hypnosis on pain have been proved by many studies the approach of public authorities to this therapy has been somewhat timid evaluating hypnosis is clearly more complex than evaluating a drug because we chemical molecule that we administer has a specific effect instead we an act where there are potentially many different components that play a role sometimes in Synergy and the interactions between the practitioner and the patient play a major role the other difficulty in evaluating hypnosis comes from the fact that some people are more sensitive to it than others [Music] so before using hypnosis it idea to test the hypnotic sensitivity of the subject we have developed a test that we can use both in research and clinically to reliably determine how hypnotizable a person is and what that involves is a brief induction into hypnosis and then a series of instructions uh for a hypnotic like response to verbal suggestions so you get a score from 0 to 10 that is a reliable measure of how hypnotizable the person is little bit look up all the way up as you keep looking up slowly close your eyes close close take a deep breath this is an exercise in your imagination just imagine your hand to be a big buoyant balloon and let it float upwards higher and higher as the rest of your body feels heavy and relaxed can you describe what that feels like Patricia it feels like kind of like wind is pulling it up does your left hand feel as if it of your body as your right hand left it does feel not it does feel not as much a part of your body all right thank you that very hypnotized well your score is 10 out of 10 and free want as sleep there are reliable and very stable differences between people and how much they experience hypnosis so about you know 10% % of the adult population is extremely hypnotizable all in all about 2third or at least somewhat hypnotizable and about a third just aren hypnotizable at all Dr Spiegel is looking for a neurological signature linked to the hypnotic sensitivity of the subject hi Josh how are you doing I great I vacation that you had can you tell me what vacation that might be sitting on a hammock in Jamaica looking out at the oce good we just take a few moments to enjoy it recordings reveal a particular quality in strongly hypnotically sensitive subjects the question we were trying to answer was is there something different about the activity of the brains of people who are High versus those who are low in hypnotizability so the concl clusion was that the coordination between these two regions where we worry about what to do and we plan and conduct activities is more coordinated among High hypnotizables than it is among low hypnotizables and that can help explain the absorption you get in hypnosis where you engaged in what you not worried about whether you should actually be doing something else all right make a fist again with so a person who is very sensitive to hypnosis doesn them and and fully participates in it without analysis with no other thoughts go take a deep breath this total absorption is the quality played on by stage hypnotists MMA the famous Canadian hypnotist selects the most sensitive subjects in the audience and makes his show with them I do a test and I find the 15% of the audience who are the most sensitive I ask them to come up on stage and in less than 5 Seconds they fall into a state of sleep and that which I don at them and H they fall asleep so there is a connection which is the difference between this and hypnotic therapy on stage my hypnosis is a bit deeper where I try to raise Consciousness so that the dream is even more intense for them so if I tell them on stage that it feel the cold it starting to feel cold colder and colder the person enters a somnambul state of hypnosis they can do things they can see people around them can hear sounds about them but at the same time they dream that is offered to them they the imaginary world that is offered to them and now open your eyes and see where we are ah we Stone Age we little legs little arms move your legs like this good we can walk now some people are scared of hypnosis it unknown it don it control by the hypnotizer of the hypnotize there between the two it than control and we can be reassured to know that if something is too difficult morally to accept or physically impossible to do you the suggestion the volunteers recruited by the hypnotist become ET box like Rocky or Pilot a jet like in Top Gun altered perception by suggestion which is spectacular in shows can also be measured in a laboratory at the University of Stanford Dr Spiegel shows that under hypnosis our sensorial perception is modified okay Patricia we getting ready to get started are you okay yes good slowly close your eyes take a deep breath Dr Spiegel is a volunteer under hypnosis she cerebral imagery machine which allows the regions of her brain which are active to be seen the doctor replaces the color image by a black and white image and suggests to the volunteer that the image is in color what do you see now Patria it looks like you put colors there it looks like I put colors there can you name some of the colors you see now there definitely green there yellow and purple and pink pink and blue and dark brown for this volunteer very sensitive to hypnosis color perception is the result of a mental projection shown by analysis of the zones of the brain experience what the studies showed was that when we gave the hypnotic suggestion um that they were looking at color when they were actually looking at black and white we showed an increase in blood flow in the color processing regions of their brain so believing was seeing it is just that possibility of plunging ourselves into an unreal sensorial experience which gives hypnosis the power to change us its field of application could be very wide losing weight stopping smoking getting over a phobia managing stress beating repetitive mannerisms never before has hypnosis been so much in favor the reticence associated with hypnosis is fading and an Ever growing public is becoming interested in it hi Tina come on all right Tina now I your subconscious mind to provide you with an image of your future self at the size and shape you want to be walking along confidently toward you now she has lots of energy and as she sits down next to you imagine she places her hand hand on your arm or shoulder for support to continue making healthy food choices for moving your body for just taking better care of yourself when a person comes to see me I promote hypnosis as a tool not as an open-ended kind of therapy so usually I will see a person for one two or three sessions depending on what they coming in for and rather than come back to me for reinforcement I want them to have the results in their own environment and so I provide them with the recording and that helps to reinforce the changes okay Tina the more you relax Tina the more your body trusts you sometimes the body stores fat as protection or insulation from other people or feelings so it important that you feel completely safe and relaxed inside here so your body will release that extra fat naturally the more that hypnosis takes into account the needs personality and background of each person the more effective it is techniques the things said and the images used vary from person to person not bad in the case where a person needs motivation to exercise for instance or to feel more energized I will use the active hypnosis to amplify that second wind to help the person feel like they are getting stronger continuously keep pedling as you distance yourself from any thoughts feelings worries or fears Ken is using Dynamic hypnosis with Naomi a patient who managed to stop smoking but has since developed an addiction to electronic cigarettes you are now recharging your body with the constant motion of your legs filling it with Energy pay attention to how good that feels we are often caught up um by particular ways of looking and experiencing ourselves and what hypnosis often allows us to do is it allows us to actually look at ourselves from a different vantage point [Music] by doing that it affords us the opportunity to actually change our Behavior because we suddenly realize or we have insight into how we perform in a way that we didn [Music] hi everybody let going Professor Raz has developed an experiment which shows that hypnosis can modify the sensorial cognitive processes of our brain which act without our knowledge what I do in a few minutes is I have each one of you sit at a computer and you are going to be looking at a face that is going to be uttering some sounds your job is to look at the images listen to the input that you get over your headphones and basically note down whatever it is that you hearing what Professor Raz doesn the volunteers is that the only sound heard in the headphones is bar while in the picture the speaker pronounces other syllables such as PA or fa the incoherence between the two messages leads to 75% of the subjects noting the wrong sound this is what is called the GK effect from the name of the psychologist who demonstrated it it shows that our brain automatically combines the visual and auditory dimensions of a message if there is an incoherence between the two perception is Disturbed as you saw this is an easy task you just you know watch and listen and you know now we another twist uh to it I hypnotize each one of you and I to give you a particular suggestion and then you again think that you then let your eyes close very slowly you know as as you them close very slowly and relax your shoulders relax your muscles just feel that you listen to my voice I want you to notice that it focus and grasp what you hear your auditory sense is more dominant than anything else that is going on this super hearing is going to be very important when you do the task again because with this particular skill you immediately report on what sound you just heard from the computer after the hypnotic suggestion of Professor Raz the error rate in perception of the message Falls from 75% to 25% the murk is a task that even if you know about it and even if you try very hard to prevent yourself from letting the effect manifest you still show it what we for certain people people who are highly hypnotizable if you take them and you use hypnosis with them you can actually de automatize things that we thought are completely and deeply automatic that raises all kinds of very important questions about how we can influence and how we can help human behavior because a lot of the behaviors that we engage in that are difficult for us to change and difficult for us to disengage from are often automatic [Music] behaviors when we question a smoker they know it kills and it has a nasty taste and reason has no place in it so it becomes irrational the person must feel that the reflex which will heal them doesn reasoning but from a corporeal perception so in the end hypnosis makes the body reappear along with its Sensations to sum up hypnosis makes you feel more than understand Dr Adrian chabos stimulates release for this patient who is suffering from stress episodes there are zones of the body which can feel the effect of stress and tension and when you feel there is a tension okay there you are release see what there is that Pleasant or interesting in that [Music] release going back to the sensorial allows us to renew access to something primordial natural and therefore the object of anxiety the object whether it be work phobia or an addictive link is [Music] disarmed so that a subject can feel what opens them up to suggestions without rationality forming a barrier their brain has to have access to a very special degree of Consciousness Dr jeppi de benedittis has succeeded in characterizing this degree of Consciousness by quantifying it starting from a technique derived from the Electro cogram he can number the brain waves associated with different levels of consciousness this experiment consists of measuring the level of consciousness of a particular subject at a given moment and in the end it allows us to produce an indicator which we call a bispectral indicator which is calibrated between zero and 100 zero corresponds to a total absence of brain activity or brain death 100 is the activity of complete wakefulness for reference the indicator was 65 for subjects under general anesthetic for volunteers under hypnosis Professor Benitas recorded an indicator between 77 and 92 the lower the bispectral indicator the deeper is the hypnotic State the indicator variations know that the hypnotic state is a dynamic cerebral process during which the brain works in a particular Zone Of [Music] Consciousness your body is very heavy like your left arm which I just let drop and you are resting as deeply as you ever rest the time is frozen I imagine the remote control for life has been paused this intermediate Zone of Consciousness between sleep and wakefulness allows our brain to function in another way a situation can be experienced or lived through mentally without the filter of rationality the power to imagine an action and to visualize it under hypnosis is requested more and more for the mental preparation of high performance athletes Dr singer is a well-known specialist in a applied hypnotism in the world of sport high level athletes like kylo Ross Olympic Champion and World gymnastic Champion come to him one thing we know is that anything you do mentally translates physically very quickly so the Mind always controls the body so if we do something very powerful and very positive for the mind it will help the body so a lot of times an athlete needs to use hypnosis in order to perform physically to their best consistently Jack singer gives his athletes the facility to act on several levels to manage stress concentrate to mobilize positive emotions to visualize an [Music] objective an athlete with as many awards as Kyler Ross knows that mental attitude is essential when you another competition there expectations that you have you know it so hard to do it can I do it again um how do I stay focused I now so there a lot of potential stressors that could be there so she really came to me for me to tune up her skills and to help deal with those stressors I wanted to work a lot um about improving my confidence cuz I know that I trained so much but then that one second year on the competition floor it perform to your best abilities so that takes a lot of confidence and belief in yourself so um that I on you you to constantly weave in the five C know calmness confidence concentration being in control and consistency you feeling totally in control when we get to the advanced stages of hypnosis I actually look at every event that the athlete participates in so I have them just visualize what they at every step of that event and that translates beautifully into their mind just doing it automatically get yourself ready for the vault and let me know when you see yourself ready to perform the Vault excellent you Cho double full [Music] so excited so pleased with yourself so happy with yourself all of the years of training all of the years of sacrifice all of the years of concentrating all of the years of focusing all of the years of confidence building have all paid off you have performed magnificently and you yourself everyone is so proud of you to prepare for challenges which demand 100% of his physical and mental resources Bonar also turns to hypnosis I began hypnosis when I needed to prepare my sleeping and waking rhythms for my first transatlantic balloon race I was very scared and my fellow team member was too that would be attacked by fatigue and incapable of recovery and then I started to take hypnosis courses without knowing all about it it was simply to be able to manage sleep hypnosis has always had a magic side in people same in my own head when I began and in fact what is magic isn it of their comfort zone and they can have the tools to relate better to themselves with their own internal [Music] resources during the Odyssey of the Soul impulse the round theor trip of a solar powerered aircraft where beorn was alone in the cockpit for several days in a row hypnosis was an essential [Music] support it helped him to remain concentrated to control different situations manage his stress and especially thanks to it he could optimize his short rest periods what putting yourself to sleep which you usually hear but that in a few seconds obtaining complete relaxation which makes you rest and recover enormously during training in the flight simulator I was fascinated to see that the moments when I recovered best were in a hypnotic State without sleeping and that this this was a lot more effective than when I really slept nowadays this psychologist passionate for adventure includes hypnosis in his plan for a healthy life hypnosis is something you can include in your daily life you don have to go around the world in a solar aircraft or a balloon beton would like hypnosis to be available to everyone doctors often try to keep hypnosis inside the world of medicine as a technique to apply to their patients I think hypnosis should be taught to as many people as possible and first of all to children so they can prepare their exams with it or have less sphere of life or manage their relationships with their parents and friends it that should be taught which has to be developed which should be accessible to All in This Spirit the hypnosis training institute created by Kevin finel offers public sessions open to all who want to discover hypnosis set yourself down have you ever practiced hypnosis no not really all right not consciously at any rate no all right so the idea of public sessions was to make hypnosis understandable beforehand I held conferences which were quite standard to explain that this state was to demystify it and to show people that there were things that were possible with it and that it wasn self- exloration and I often had people who agreed but still couldn hypnosis was so I said to myself that maybe I had to start with a demonstration then by showing it people realize that it very gentle that there is no need to take power over someone that that wasn hypnosis hypnosis is above all to give another person power over themselves I allow people to enter that state because I know how to get there but it person who goes there if they want to and they feel that it go there it often gives you the feeling of raising up we ask questions in an Extended State of Consciousness which brings us a lot of new understanding we level of ourselves and so new connections will be made I was still there but there were things which were changing and uh hypnosis reveals the power of our [Music] brains we can show that thinking about something can actually bring about a strong perceptual change well we can have that the brain is so powerful that it happening inside it than what is happening outside it as a matter of fact it shows me that we live in our brains when it came into Research Laboratories hypnosis reinvented itself the public stopped considering it as a practice of magic and sorcery it is now known that it activates the brain in such a way that it develops a special State of Consciousness and that State of Consciousness can benefit medicine and many other human activities just like you can enhance athletic performance you can also enhance cognitive performance you can enhance learning and memory and things of that nature as we understand more and more the science of hypnosis and that it really is a normal state that we can benefit from I think more and more people are beginning to feel more comfortable with it [Music] be careful however the mental availability induced by hypnosis makes you vulnerable to being [Music] influenced I ask patients to be very careful when they meet a hypnotherapist you should ask what their training is I think that just like in everything else something that works can also be misused become a dog ethics must guide the hypnotist and relationships with their subjects must be based on trust while science is beginning to understand the fabulous powers of hypnosis much remains to be discovered about a practice whose mechanisms are intimately linked to the complexity of our brains and the way in which they work which remains mysterious [Music]	Success

Venice vs. Tourism: The Fight to Save a City| SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7swfNk6cSo	SLICE Science	[Music] Venice there earth a mirage between sea and [Music] sky built a thousand years ago on the water the city of the does is a trip back in time an Ode to Romanticism but today the city is in trouble the danger comes not from the rising sea levels but rather from the 28 million visitors who invade Venice every year behind the postcard 8:00 a.m. the famous Piaza San Mar is slowly waking up at this time of day Venice still belongs to [Music] lovers suddenly just offshore the monsters arrive every day these cruise ships offload thousands of tourists into the city visitors who stay for only a few [Music] hours like these two [Music] couples these Cruise passengers have only 7 hours to visit Venice I love it I love it oh it romantic Shantal and Luke take snapshots as best they can in the midst of the crowd wait take it with your camera bit closer I was taking your ear a quick photo going past the Rialto Bridge a mythical spot in Venice and here they are in the Piaza San Marco despite the dense crowd the magic Works instantly oh it magnificent look at that it beautiful I didn absolutely overwhelmed so moving I moved I can it but the clock is ticking these tourists have to visit Venice on the run at the end of this Marathon the two couples are ready to drop we walked we want to do everything everywhere but time slipped by we didn realize it one day and Venice is not enough we need three days I think Mix us really want to come back and take some more time so we can see more of the surrounding area you know the islands and everything during their day in Venice these four pensioners have spent most of their time on the Piaza San Marco this is the main problem with tourism in Venice millions of visitors flocked to this open Square which is only 100 m long a tiny space that is now saturated the Piaza San Marco has its own rules for handling these crowds as the signs indicate people are not allowed to sit down they shouldn or drink here or they risk a fine of 500 instructions the tourists ignore another band feeding the thousands of pigeons as their droppings are damaging The Monuments here again tourists don care they all want to take home the classic Venice photograph the one with the pigeons why you give food that you like it yeah I think it take picture you know it taking picture it home like that you know look at all the pictures that you got that means to say came from the Lord okay it but people are feeding them I don choices to do no there are you know policemen around you know so they could say do not take pictures do not take take picture but they could [Laughter] [Music] indeed the policeman standing a few meters away don tourists disregarding the laws you said to them it but I saw a lot of person there is too much tourist too difficult the square and uh say the people that is not possible to feed the p because we have also other things to do for the policeman it battle and rudess is commonplace to see the extent of the problem we wait until the crowds have [Music] left 6: a.m. one of the world is an open air garbage dump it day this is a sorry sight for Luca de pieri a garbage collector who was born in [Music] Venice tourists are not respectful they eat and then throw everything on the ground to turn into a picnic [Music] area unfortunately I think there are far too many tourists in Venice even if it good in some ways because we haven efficient ways of controlling the flow of tourists all these people need to eat so unfortunately they come and hang out in the most beautiful places even on this square right in front of a church I don it Luca and his colleagues will spend an hour cleaning up the piao S Marco before the arrival of the next horde of [Music] tourists hundreds of kilos of collect waste are then carried off by hand in Venice nothing is done the same even garbage collecting in this Labyrinth of small streets the corners are sometimes hard to negotiate is it hard in these small streets see yes that Venice you have to carry all this rubbish using all kinds of carts through narrow streets filled with people lots of tourists tourists in Venice generate 30,000 tons of garbage annually this trash is then removed by boat the complex Logistics involved makes it three times more expensive than in Paris in this city on the Water The Tourist explosion causes other damage as well irreparable deterioration that most visitors can imagine MOSI runs the largest Association for the defense of [Music] Venice the Grand Canal is the shaniz of Venice with famous elegant palaces lined up one after the [Music] other there that got married near Mani Hotel Mato whose family has lived in Venice for several Generations is exasperated to see his City suffocating from tourism right here the Grand Canal has become a Highway by increasing the number of tourists it increases the number of vaporetto gondolas taxis transport boats more tourists means more traffic therefore more [Music] damage the increasing number of even more powerful boats is a Calamity for these ancient structures when they built Venice they couldn have predicted that in 7th centuries there here the waves C by this traffic create a huge problem because they undermine the foundations of the Palaces where under the water the waves beat constantly against the foundations all along the canals the EB and flow caused by the intense water traffic beats against the walls and ruins the facades the impact of the water deteriorates the stones and loosens the bricks creating holes under the surface even worse the waves are dredging the bottom of the Lagoon unearthing the wooden pilings on which Venice is built salt water is infiltrating everywhere through the cavities created by the backwash and seeping up the walls damaging entire buildings another Scourge is destroying the city the cruise ships 300 M long 60 M wide these floating cities are taller than the highest buildings every week some 30 ocean liners cross the Lagoon weakening the city of the doas even more this afternoon a number of venetians have prepared a counter offensive a protest action on their own terms the police are on high alert for 4 years the Committee Against large ships has been protesting their Passage through the Lagoon Tomaso kiari is one of the movement [Music] leaders born in Venice this activist is outraged at the ocean liners destroying his City when the ships Sail by here they displace 135,000 cubic meters of water they therefore put a huge strain on the canal banks on our homes and our monuments structures collapse if you go to San Georgio where the ships have to make an S maneuver to leave you can pull blocks of stones out with your hands they making money and it of us who have to pay for the damage the protest takes place on the water dozens of small boats are waiting for the ocean liners that are more just a few hundred meters away to cast off raise the flags higher when the ships go by we to try and stop them with our small boats is that possible of course it possible David and Goliath the signal is given the cruise ship is getting closer the demonstrators are going to try to interfere with its passage and symbolically throw eggs at it stand here so that you can throw them a really long way the police intervene to prevent the protesters from getting too close Tomaso waits for the right moment to launch the attack hey look how I can mess you around Coast Guard look [Music] [Applause] wait wait okay go higher [Music] higher man you got go on take good aim that was a good one we hit the boat it it the activists get as close as they can to the floating building that away this is my home here they Dangerous Ones [Music] [Music] the liner steams on without even slowing down it cruise ship multinationals which generate 300 million EUR turnover every [Music] year Venice is endangered but the authorities don protect it and with good reason most of the tourists who invade the city don spend a single night here they don the city to pay for the upkeep of The Monuments this woman city counselor is responsible for Public Works one year ago the city launched one of its largest restoration projects the iconic Rialto Bridge worn down by the incessant Passage of millions of visitors this 16th century structure has not been restored in 40 years the scaffolding runs along its facade right up to its roof it here because once the work is finished you won of the Rialto Bridge anymore you be able to see it from below very few of us will be this fortunate again the renovation will take 18 months these Stone Cutters have dismantled the balustrade to repair all the damaged Parts in the marble cost of the job 5 million euros is money from tourism financing this work no no no no the visitors tax that tourists pay is not used to fund Renovations in the city there is just enough to pay for the services the tourists themselves use we have a one-day type of Tourism that doesn while using the city services it issue of the financial cost but also that of invasion tourism is an incredible resource but managing it is problematic for us the city had to appeal to a private sponsor to fund the work in exchange this clothing label as a 12 M High advertisement on the most photographed site in benice [Music] the city of the doas accepts all these problems because tourism is a vital sector in Venice the only one flourishing despite the economic crisis it generates 30,000 direct jobs including Barbara to she [Music] Marco Barbara is one of the venetians who supports tourism Venice is only economic activity we don Venice tourism is what keeps Venice alive everyone depends on tourism my dentist depends depends on tourism I guide I depend on tourism the restaurants the hotels everyone in Venice depends on tourism this former history Professor switched to tourism 30 years ago when she began Venice had 65 guides now there are nearly 300 Barbara loves her City and wants to show people the real Venice the one outside the Piaza San Marco this morning you daily life what from its beauty and its monuments is the way people live so try to stay on the right in the small streets otherwise you people tourist routes but it we streets this is the real Venice the little canals the small Bridges little balconies filled with flowers the roof Terraces Barbara leads her group down the tiniest passages and into countless hidden little Courtyards this is not a compello it a la most of all she wants people to understand the Venetian lifestyle Venice is not a small town Venice is a big Village I have friends who meet here every night for drinks at 700 p.m. sharp and over there they meet for drinks at 7:30 this town really leaves a mark on people it village and that it magnificent and it Unique her message to tourists don behave as if you were in some conquered land let this man by he Venetian and it because many venetians are nearing a Breaking Point you know venetians are like pandas they aren them like Christina Juani a book [Music] seller Christina lives in the real Venice the one with the Small hidden Courtyards and the quiet little streets just a few hundred meters from the Piaza San Marco to get to work this book seller has to walk through the tourist areas venetians like Christina immediately stand out from the crowd for their decisive quick Pace moving against the flow of tourists this is a tunnel that I nearly always avoid there are so many people it walk through I hate this street for venetians every trip they take in their daily lives is a nightmare [Music] it look you can move it a hurry we have to go to the bank we errands but we crowds it us venetians live in a state of Siege there are just 56,000 residents compared to the 28 million visitors that are everywhere even on their public transportation the vaporetto some days when I get on a vaporetto I get off at the following stop because I can may have sent several people to the hospital really I joking but when I say please and they still don shopping trolley with me I push feet legs too bad I to but if I or had a hard time getting through the Piaza San Marco then I complain Christina complains but she belongs to several associations that propose Solutions she thinks every effort must be made to limit the number of tourists in Venice even a radical measure charging an entrance fee to the P San there is a proposal to deal with the city tourists close the Piaza San Marco and make a museum of the Piaza and the surrounding area so that people pay to visit this District it would be the only Public Square in the world charging an entrance fee do you think that this square is unique I don squares in the world have so many visitors every year if it becomes a museum we could better manage the number of people it interesting proposal closing the Piaza is a difficult project to implement some residents even want to charge an entrance fee to the entire city persistent but unworkable ideas in the meantime exasperated venetians keep tourists at arms length even during the most spectacular festivals on the first Sunday in September one of venice is about to take place the historic rata in this gym on the other side of the city venetians meet up to get ready this city councelor is the head of the [Music] celebrations these people are disguised so that we can leap 500 years back in time our duty is not only to show what we were and what we to say that even if our lifestyles have changed we history of the great city of Venice it century a time when Venice the serenisima dominated Europe venetians are still proud of this opulent era there aren troop the event is not even publicized on the streets of the city deliberately so it private here you see what venetians experience when they tourists the tourist who takes over and wants to decide everything is a tourist to be avoided if we started to change and accommodate them we venetians it would all be just a meaningless masquerade 2 hours later venetians are lining up along the Grand Canal the luckiest ones are at the windows of their palaces other are packed into boats the best place to get a view the historic procession opens the [Music] festivities but everyone is waiting for the boat races where the Orman row standing up this is the most popular sport in Venice every year the city compete cheered on by their qus there are very few tourists Among The Spectators except these three French visitors who can what on they something what them all the names are streets I don know they told me they do it on purpose so that not many tourists come what do you think about that it to discover Venice on the other hand it it Venetian culture so well it advertise it more we Venice so I don watch this type of event but at the same time if people knew about it I along the canals so what the best thing to do is I don know therein lies The Dilemma how to make a living off tourism without losing your soul for Christina the Venetian in some neighborhoods it president of the shopkeepers association this book seller has seen all the local businesses disappear one after another that was a historic toy store for 50 years and this bridge is still called The Bridge of toys by the venetians then it was a shoe shop and um that lasted for two years and now it souvenirs tourist shops have invaded Venice here is where the disaster begins that was a store there were the two others opposite it was a famous fabric store and I used to buy fabric here for my sewing this one closed nothing but souvenirs bags made in China there and vegetable shop but we used to have everything we needed the butcher food [Music] stores this street changed overnight suddenly you go by in the morning and at night it had changed it me over the Last 5 Years all over the city the number of stores selling junk for Less than5 has skyrocketed cheap leather bags fake traditional masks souvenirs sold as if they were made in Italy all identical but fairly genuine the ultimate symbol of this counterfeit Market is the famous Morano glass lights vases figurines and jewelry at unbeatable prices how many of these objects would truly made on the island of Morano just opposite [Music] Venice mik veki has a store specializing in Morano glass located just Steps From the Piaza San Marco they have show this one an official expert mik knows the counterfeit Market well today nearly 80% of the glass sold in Venice and Morano is not made in Morano it or elsewhere in Europe it not handmade that come from Morano in Venice eight in 10 glass objects are therefore fake moros to get a better look we do a little shopping with a hidden camera this shop in the city center looks like the real thing we go in and buy this horse marked Morano glass m v Morano yes it in Morano okay blow glass we call aventurina this kind of glass with the oxid metal oxide inside mhm and it made in the island of yes I go take that if we are to believe this dealer this € 29 horse is a genuine Morano thanks in this other much more luxurious shop we choose this small very expensive vase this little vase is €60 with a small discount we only deal in Morano glass we are intrigued by name written in Gold letters on the vase what signature of the master the man who made the vas that girl I still working do these objects really come from Morano here verdict so this piece is very poorly made the details are crude looking at the base the workmanship is not perfect usually the base underneath should be perfectly smooth to demonstrate M Compares it to a genuine Morano horse on this one for example you can see that the base is entirely smooth Morano glass is an artistic glass all the details are ly crafted the man the ears the mouth this is the work of a master glass worker with years of experience this is not next we look at the vase from the luxury shop this is Classic Glass from Tuscany it was machine made especially the rim you can see that the circle is perfect by hand that impossible so it doesn Morano because the glass workers there only work by hand and then this signature is absolutely meaningless is it possible that they invent a signature yes I could write my name you could write your name anyone could write their name the ultimate interception at €60 the fake Mirano is more expensive than the real thing a small vase like this one a genuine Morano would cost 30 or 40 this fake vase is really too expensive there is only one official label guaranteeing the authenticity this label indicating the workshop number beyond the agreed tourists this counterfeiting is slowly killing the Morano Craftsman every week mikay goes to the island to buy merchandise from the [Music] workshops imperio rosi and Mario constantini are two of the Island remaining glass [Music] makers very quickly performing precise rapid movements Mario transforms this piece of molten glass into a horse head [Music] these glass makers use the same tools and techniques as those of Morano first class makers techniques that date from the Middle [Music] Ages it takes Decades of practice to master this skill [Music] Mario started at the age of [Music] 11 if you 20 years to become a master but if you don you [Music] life what do you think about counterfeiting unfortunately it hurts our image because people don the Chinese made objects and ours but the difference is enormous the Chinese products are rubbish and Morano this ancestral profession is now endangered because there are not enough young [Music] people if there aren workers mathematically will disappear the job today they stay in school until they 25 in the past you already in the workshop at the age of 10 or 12 one quarter of the workshops have closed in the last 15 years only 150 remain in Morano under the pressure of mass tourism the historic city of Venice is gradually losing its authenticity and becoming a theme park venetians no longer even live Behind These Walls currently one in every four homes is rented to tourists a world [Music] record multiple agencies have been created in recent years to manage them like that of Marco malante an English-speaking Venetian [Music] businessman a member of a long-standing Venetian family Marco has become rich through tourism like a handful of venetians he now manages some 30 Apartments most of which are located near the Pia San Marco we manage 10 proper is here uh we will see one today which is one of our latest and amongst the ones on the top of our range of [Music] offer on the top floor of this entirely renovated Palace Marco manages a 120 s me duplex two living rooms two bedrooms marble bathrooms decorated in pure Venetian Style of course it original pieces of uh furniture and this is very nice and typical of Venice uh nice houses when you have this kind of symbol like that this kind of uh design but it house 16th century house and uh it has quite a lot of success because it match as you will see also upstairs um new features or uh modern features together with a very good and tasteful uh layout of the house this duplex is only rented to tourists to people who can pay up to €400 a day especially to enjoy its rooftop Terrace the owners do very well from it it a town where you can that makes immediate a point it is profitable in the way that you you still have the property which has a value that increase year on year bad years 3% Good Year 5 6% which is still good and uh then you have uh a a return from uh the holiday rentals for the for our management a return that is uh sometimes uh double to tribal what you can earn if you would have rented to a normal residential contract this rental brings in an average of €9,000 every month a rent that the reach of most vs more apartments for tourists means fewer that are available for residents finding a place to live in Venice is becoming harder and harder this is the other major battle for Tomas oari the anti- cruise ship activist with members of his Association he helps families like that of Nadia tatana her two children and her partner Nicola usardi to find housing they quite simply squat an apartment and openly accept responsibility for it Nicola takes us to visit the place where he for 4 years a three- room apartment with rudimentary facilities this is the bedroom we have about 70 square met which is a good size for a family like ours an apartment like this usually rents for ,000 to 12200 a month so for people like us it hard to stay in Venice with such high rents in this small town of 56,000 residents real estate prices are the same as those in Rome Italy for this couple who work in the tourist sector and earn together €1,500 a month to find suitable housing I can apartment what can I do the children need their space and we as parents do too we could go into debt which is not okay I don poorly I that in Venice 60 families occupy Apartments illegally and the town lets them do it proof according to Tomaso that mass tourism is doing more harm than good to the population it and wellbeing this model of Tourism has boosted the real estate market to excessive levels that illegally occupied homes in Venice they fight back and don the speculation they resist because they just want to keep being [Music] but not many of them can hold out in recent years the city has been emptying out at an unexpected rate in 20 years it has lost 20% of its residents most of them young inside the city itself the remaining population is aging to draw attention to this attrition several hundred venetians staged a funeral for Venice it was a symbolic burial to alert public opinion to the programmed death of their [Music] City metoi planned this funeral since then he has organized regular events in support of venice survival one of his most recent battles was to save the last hospital this is the last remaining Hospital in Venice they tried to close it a few years ago because there are fewer and fewer residents the problem for us but also for tourists is that the closest hospital will be on the mainland more than driveway in 2011 Matteo together several hundred demonstrators and they were able to save the hospital but for how long for me if they close the hospital it population a City without a hospital is a city Bound to Die the end of public services and small businesses a dwindling population in time Venice could become a ghost town a mere [Music] backdrop this threat terrifies the venetians like this group to which Mato belongs which strongly Advocates an eternal Venice afraid of being forgotten afraid of Disappearing they symbolic acts aimed at raising awareness at a global level as in September when every year they raised the flag of the winged lion which represents the past Splendor of the most Serene Republic they fly the banner at Top This Fort which stands at the entrance to the Lagoon as a warning to tourists it pride and a way to show that we belong to our city which is represented by the flag it territory we welcome everyone provided that all these people respect the town and its residents these venetians who have become a minority in their own City are falling back on their tradition and their identities the last vestages of the city of yester year I afraid I Venice it Venetian because I was actually born on the mainland but since I got married and came here 42 years ago it has become my city I would like to continue to live here and to die here I would like to speak directly to the tourists tell them that the only solution is to allow Venice to reclaim its human scale which no longer exist the 30 million tourists don provide us with any benefits all of us at the international level have to save Venice so that it once again becomes a welcoming place so that it is once again a city that people love because that [Music] to protect Venice tourists must learn to travel another way visit the city on foot and not by boat take time to explore beyond the usual tourist itineraries and blend into the city to respect the beauty of the SES and the peace and quiet of its residence a responsible type of Tourism is crucial because at this rate in 10 years the number of visitors will exceed 50 million [Music]	Success
The Untold Story of Sperm Whales: From Hunters to Protectors | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2vbts7zUwc	SLICE Science	[Music] rata raldi has been following and studying sperm wells in guadaloop for over 20 years today he welcomes on board Pierre GGO Veterinary Specialist of marine mammals and president of the Lux ber Association Odyssey P represents the government of the grand duche within the international whaling commission there he fights to save citations including sperm whales Pierre travels the world to observe them and work for their conservation today he is one of the top spots for approaching sperm whales while the males spend most of their time on their own the females and their cubs cross the Caribbean from St Lucia to monserat Via nearby Dominica throughout the year often sailing just a few miles off the coast of guadaloop here we to have this very special underwater topography no continental shelf a slope that is 3,000 ft deep 4 mil from the coast so it divers to observe and to study I also wanted to know how many sperm whales you could observe around guadaloop and whether they stay here or move around the Caribbean islands we have 250 sperm whales really not counting the large breeding males of the 250 100 are really faithful to guadaloop we find them very regularly in family groups but apparently the animals have a feeding zone of 1,250 Mi oh yes that big how do you find sper Wells in this vastness Renato and Pierre are actually going to spot them first thanks to the sounds shall we try to listen to them yes they immerse a hydrophone an underwater microphone phone to try to find the sperm whales underwater where they keep themselves out of sight all right let I don no you see I West Renato scans the ocean moving the microphone in all directions he tries to discern in the D of the ocean ocean the mysterious clicks emitted by the sperm whales characteristic dry clicks that scientists learn to decode and interpret oh that it can you hear them yeah I can barely hear them wait I headphones just a second it strong okay contrary to popular belief sound travels much better and faster in water than in air and sperm well clicks can be heard several miles away oh yeah y they yeah you can still hear the clicks yes oh that it we have coders there are animals on the surface probably socializing click click click kodas are sound patterns made of clicks that sperm Wells use to communicate between each other oh yes I can hear them too yes did you get them there are a few on the surface you can hear click click silence click click click click click silence click click click it we can hear sperm whales long before we can see them okay it 180 mow Let listen again do South okay [Music] everyone is scanning The Horizon the sperm whales are somewhere to the South maybe hundreds of feet below the surface but inevitably they will reappear they eventually they must go to the surface to breathe in the open air and it their Two Worlds air and water that rato and Pier will be able to find them and observe them Mano do you copy yes I do we ahead they away okay I just spotted them where 3/4 of a mile behind we won perfect they the surface now we sure and a cub well maybe it not going to dive is it oh yeah it going to dive come on Cal fin on the right yeah beautiful to identify the sperm whales one by one pier and ronato take pictures of the coddle fins because each one is unique in its shape from scars and bites left by Predators a beautiful cordal fin from this we can draw up a complete directory of sperm Wells individual by individual we have other sperm whales due south closer to the coast and we have two or three sperm Wells there too we have to look carefully to see if we can see them blow when they return to the surface the sperm whales exhale the air from their lungs projecting it with droplets of water oil and steam which will form the cloud of blow this blow allows them to be spotted from afar [Music] the s-shaped blow hole is closed by a valve which by reflex opens to breathe and closes as soon as the whale Dives underwater sperm whales renew up to 90% of the air in their lungs with each breath compared to 10 to 20% for us human beings [Applause] a breath of amazing efficiency and sperm whales really need it most of their lives are spent underwater often at Great depths there they will feed themselves by hunting squids and the most mythical of them all the giant squid against which it struggles in Titanic and legendary fights when they die they will not be able to breathe for 45 minutes to an hour so before diving they spend a lot of time taking deep breaths to store as much oxygen as they can in their bloodstream and muscles [Music] then they totally [Music] disappear and what there 3 to 6,000 ft below the surface must be retraced and imagined by scientists by diving so deep the sperm whale achieves a whole series of extreme physiological Feats it will have to resist pressure 200 times higher than on the surface its flexible rib cage prevents its lungs from being crushed and its metabolism can be slowed to save oxygen and in the absolute darkness of the Abyss the sperm whale will see thanks to sounds it emits clicks that are focused like a laser thanks to a complex system located in its huge head which alone weighs five tons he scans the ocean like a submarine with a sonar just one of these clicks will allow him to detect a squid measuring only 25 cm over a mile away with its sonar a giant squid 10 m long could never Escape him from the boat rato monitors at a distance what is happening in the great depths he records the distant Echoes of the hunt and thanks to these sounds he can detect the battles at take place 3,000 ft below the surface he indication of where the sperm whales will reappear we need to check the position you say I far to the West is that it yeah you see it left that the swell we speed up a little bit and then we listen again is that okay with you all right to have every chance to find the sperm wheeles then to observe them more easily the crew launched a drone into the air from its position in the air the Drone will offer us another perspective in the last few years drones have become a valuable tool for science scientists enabling them to discover new behaviors and interpret them differently to clarify what they are seeing from the boat or from Shore which at times can be confusing and indeed thanks to the Drone we can see the sperm welds Rising slowly little by little a good minute before they finally emerge to the surface [Music] [Applause] [Music] that surfaced is that a female with a cup there absolutely they well they there we have two adults most of the time there are short breaks where the animals regularly meet on the surface they gently bite each other they touch each other a lot to strengthen social bonds in the group spurn whales and their cousins other cations whales killer whales or dolphins mammals like them have brought to the oceans Concepts that were totally absent in fish social ties attachment [Music] tenderness education and a NeverEnding solidarity so a cub can pass from one female to another because a female can take care of several Cubs at a time even if she is not the [Music] mother Cubs don hunt they don into the abyss so the Cubs need to be fed like us and all mammals females nurse them this period can last last a long time up to 8 years for some of them but how this nursing Works remains in part a mystery it very little and very briefly Shane jro the top specialist on sperm whales studies them around the nearby island of Dominica he hypothesized for a while that the Cubs suckled through the blo hole the nostril indeed from the air we can see the two cubs come to cling to the female [Music] belly are they just looking for physical contact do they want to stimulate the female to nurse or were they already nursing one of the babies seems to turn around several times is it trying to suckle with its mouth even the Drone has its own limits and it exactly what [Music] surface the sperm whales look calm they have accepted the presence of the boat [Applause] even in this intimate moment Pier wants to seize the opportunity he decides to dive into the water himself to try to see the nursing as closely as possible okay go go go it like this with sperm whales but it unique opportunity to witness nursing Pier directly focuses on one of the mothers and its baby as he stress to the animals they feel secure enough to let him approach without deviating from their course [Music] sometimes even he is forced to slow down and move away a little [Music] and suddenly the young sperm whale slips under the [Music] female turns around opens its mouth and slides toward the breast there is no doubt about it it is suckling through its mouth [Music] it only lasted a few seconds but Pierre managed to catch some rare images of sperm whales nursing a precious document and a special feeling for him [Music] [Music] the sperm whales probably have a lot of other secrets to reveal to us to that end don the surface passing through the mirror to dive with them and to get lost in their world to understand it better this is what another scientist franois Sano is trying to do more than 6,000 M away in the Indian Ocean off the macious coast BL flow right right under the cloud there a second one over there yeah there na nain just in front just to yeah 5° to starboard yeah can you see them just in front there two ehy oh there another one there now they the place there look look at the back the back back two three ah it going to dive oceanographer and former partner of Commander custo tireless Explorer and defender of nature France Serrano who is traveled all the oceans of the world has become passionate about sperm whales with his friend Rene uz underwater cameraman who has been following the sperm whales of maias for several years franois Sano is preparing himself to dive with the biggest predators of the planet [Music] get ready there are three there one that just came up there careful now now four there surfaced okay now it go straight go straight ponis dives into the ocean a Titanic Universe the surface is the only limit and under his feet lies an unfathomable depth of sea a universe proportionate to the sperm whales without hesitation franois advances towards these creatures which seem to come from another planet for our first Contact but the Giants do not allow themselves to be approached so easily interrupted by the diver the whole group resumes its Journey serenely only one large female stays behind absorbed in cleaning her teeth with remora fish but it finally leaves too and joins its group already far away out of sight oh they didn [Applause] us they didn they away they don but I think we to accept us but they really made us run this morning it encounter with the animal it is up to us to adapt to Nature and not for nature to adapt to us let go come on come on go franois would like the sperm whales to welcome him into their Underwater World so he increases the frequency of his [Music] Dives but the sperm whales are only passing by for a moment and are completely ignoring him [Music] [Music] [Music] water remains a difficult environment in which the human diver moves very slowly whereas sperm whales despite weighing tons are perfectly at [Music] [Music] ease in their underwater realm sperm whales display a wonderful flexibility and a sovereign [Music] strength then they escape again leaving franois a delicate veil of skin floating behind a fragile testimony of these brief meetings [Music] through sheer will and determination franois and Renee hope to gradually get the sperm whales used to their presence they will also try a new approach a new form of exploration by sounds come here ah nice nice nice nice here my friend Pascal made you a special little toy oh yeah it with a waterproof microphone okay so let me see so you will record the sounds that are reflected and concentrated by the bowl and it will protect the mic from all the extraneous sounds that come from behind and from the sides and the small camera to find out which to identify which sperm well you right well this is great can you believe it you interview a sperm well [Music] very quickly we can hear the SPM whales will they allow us to get in touch with them this time to our surprise one of the sperm whales takes the initiative it moves away from the others all of the sudden it seems to be as curious to discover franois as franois is to discover it they explore each other by their own means the Springwell doesn hydrophone like francea but it has an extraordinary sense echolocation it uses these extremely powerful sound pulses and analyzes the echo emitted by the targeted object in this case France to form a sound image it sense it sees with sounds the sperm whale inspects its entire environment it even reaches the boat something which was inconceivable a few years ago when cations were hunted by the thousands and they avoided human beings at all costs the sperm well now scans the whole boat detecting the shape of its Hull the Echolocation gives it an idea of its thickness it must perceive that it full and maybe what a bit like an ultrasound that reconstructs the image of the fetus inside the mother womb but soon the sperm whales will need to exercise their talents elsewhere they have to go hunting again then they assemble all their strength hold their breath and dive into the great depths here even the most experienced human divers can them it resist pressures up to 200 times higher than on the surface [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so franois lets them go into the abyss where light totally disappears the absolute black the darkness where the sperm whales sink and disappear but not all the sperm whales have disappeared franois captures the sounds of kotas close by these patterns of clicks that the sperm whales exchange to communicate with each other the kodas are specific and different from those in guadaloop 6 to 10 clicks instead of five each region perhaps even each family could have its own dialect [Music] this group of babies and youths remained on the surface we know that they can dive into the abyss like the adults when their mothers go hunting miles down in the ocean they can them out of Harm there is nowhere to hide they have to leave leave their cubs in open water near the surface where they could find themselves at the mercy of predators then a large female devotes herself to watch over them waiting for the other mothers to return from their distant hunt the female in charge of watching the Cubs starts worrying about the visitor approaching them she comes to scan France she swims between the unwelcome diver and the Cubs and when she gives a signal to leave everyone follows her without question back ashore Francois analyzes the images of the meeting the moment they socialize it very important step because in the emotion of the moment you cannot study everything who else do I have oh hello Arthur stop stop look look you see here Arthur bitten has no tip anymore they get bitten by a killer whale or by a pilot whale there are many pilot whales around here every single sperm wh has its own identity that we can read through the scars that are left on their codal or their pectoral fins either by large Predators or small sharks called cookie cutters who are responsible for these marks because of that we can recognize them all J you can feel she Matriarch she has a strong personality she coming to see you yeah look pay attention go forward a little and there you go that little circle there like that this very very specific Notch there only thanks to these unique details on their fins can we recognize them you know there are sperm whales of Marias right but these ones are not only sperm whales of Marias this is a particular family to Dive Into the Heart of this family of sperm whales that he is becoming acquainted with franois goes down without an oxygen tank free diving like [Music] them relationships have now calmed down as the whales sleep vertically the adults no longer bothered by his [Music] presence sperm whales always stay half asleep they remain conscious all the time because they have to come to the surface regularly to breathe so one half of their brain stays awake while the other half rests near the sleeping adults the Cubs band together and play jerine The Matriarch stays close to them always recognizable by the notch on her tail fin the sperm wheeles have accepted francea in their midst some of them are even curious attentive and turn to watch him [Music] [Music] [Music] having finished their nap on the surface responding again to the call of the depths the sperm wells will soon return to their deep Odyssey [Music] [Music] curiously gerine stayed behind she lingers next to France standing before him as if in suspension she echolocation does she recognize him it impossible to be absolutely sure the face to-face encounter ends as slowly and as inexplicably as it began franois was probably hoping to get more he persevere fra you young one so I used to me and then you go slowly to the side and wait for him to come to you yep yep no okay and you stay on the surface yep if he accepts exactly he will come I will wait for him it it accepts you but we stay on the service we don Axel Rene on you go [Music] [Music] [Music] the Cub lazing around quietly on the surface was listed by franois as as Elliot they have met many times before but this time something extraordinary will happen when fris approaches iiot stays put he doesn but it [Music] yet when Elliot faces him Francois expects to be scanmed as usual but no [Music] The Sounds the young sperm whale is making are kodas and not just any kotas characteristic kotas from 7 to 10 clicks that franois has always heard when sperm whales start playing and rolling against each other Ilia goes on to emit these kodas no less than 45 times in 5 minutes iiot calls franois in its sperm whale [Music] dialect it seeks contact and even seems to invite France to play and they start together dancing an improbable dance for two Elliot has chosen to play with franois nothing holds him back nothing obliges him and when he decides to he leaves Untamed Wild free and disappears into the big blue [Music] to understand Sperm wheels we have to meet them listen to them accept that they come to us this finally seems possible so many years after we stopped hunting them and they have found relative peace fris succeeded in his mission Beyond his expectations he witnessed and was involved in what is probably the first communication from a spurn whale to a human being a new kind of [Music] encounter perhaps this is the promise of a new alliance a pact to be sealed between us human beings and all those who inhabit the ocean [Music]	Success
Spaceship Earth: Humanity's Impact and the Path to Survival | SLICE SCIENCE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np3_PDybEhc	SLICE Science	[Music] warning the rest of us that we are flying into danger this is built for satellite monitoring of carbon dioxide over a year produces a picture of the Earth breathing in the northern hemisphere green plants inhale CO2 in Spring and exhale it in Autumn while the opposite is true in the South every year the residual CO2 levels creep up there atmosphere than there has been for 800,000 years making Earth hotter than when Humanity was born the unprecedented situation requires our scientists to take on the role of navigating spaceship earth everywhere in the world they are assessing the impacts of global warming and trying to foretell what future lies ahead for our ship their attention is focused on the Arctic where warming is most extreme and the ecosystem is collapsing young researchers are working across the remote region they are analyzing thawing permafrost changing animal behavior the decreasing reflectivity of snow [Music] cover melting glaciers and unusual plumes of ancient gases it is an extraordinary opportunity for a new generation of scientists to take on the most important challenge the world has known [Music] they are the first in their field to witness planetary changes in real [Music] time now their task is to combine their findings with older data to produce a forecast for the [Music] future I started doing Arctic Research In 1970 when I came to C Bridge as a graduate student at the Scott polar Research Institute I started working on waves in ice but I that took me to the Arctic and the Antarctic as a research assistant so we saw both ends of the Earth and that inspired me to take up uh polar research as a as a what what I was going to do with my life when the Navy decided to send the first British nuclear submarine to the Arctic the director of the Scot polar Research Institute persuaded them that it would be a very good thing to do scientific work and collect ice thickness data so he pushed me forward as the person to do it so I going on them for about 40 years [Music] now we months the ice then was very formidable and most of it was called multi-year ice that year and it was very thick maybe 3 m thick heavily rided with these great piles of deformed ice nobody had managed to get to the North Pole in an ice breaker in those days because the ice was so heavy in the last 15 years the amount of multier ice has diminished and now there ice that just grew that year so it or so thick it doesn it routinely go to the North Pole in an icebreaker now crashing through this stuff to somebody who Arctic as it was in the 70s and it world well I think the summer ice is going to disappear very fast and my predi is it time there still be ice filling the Arctic Ocean all through the winter but it [Music] months the Arctic has warmed up about three times as fast as the planet as a whole there what happens in the Arctic is what going to happen to the rest of the planet in a few years [Music] time scientists working on the ice caps of Greenland and Antarctica are also seeing unprecedented [Music] melting as ice melts from the GL glaciers the ocean is [Music] rising the second uh picture gives you sea level rise which is the result of melting of bodies of ice across the globe as well as thermal expansion of the oceans and here during the last century we had an average increase in sea level of about 17 cm since 1988 the United Nations agency the intergovernmental panel on climate change has been amassing data from the world scientists to understand what global warming will do to our ship for more than 10 years rendra porori coordinated their efforts now we have enough observations on the basis of which we have come up with very clear findings in the reports of the ipcc and incidentally these reports are written by the best scientists from all over the world the ipcc doesn scientists anything for the work that they do and then hit against but the sheer importance of being part of ipcc reports is enough to see that they put in those extra hours this is the only planet we can live on so we have to be concerned about it the earth finely balanced system Nature has a certain order in everything that it does with warmer temperatures you of evaporation of water so therefore that that means rainfall and snow as a result of warming the bodies of ice will melt much faster the oceans will expand because of the heat that they are absorbing and therefore you will get sea level rise both as a result of the melting of ice as well as the thermal expansion of the oceans it is certain that the global ocean will rise through this century and the next though no one knows how much predictions range from 40 cm to 6 M even the lowest prediction means that in this Century 100 million Coastal people will be flooded annually [Music] complex nonlinear systems can behave in an Abrupt way and even worse they can behave in an irreversible way you have activated or transgressor Tipping Point if you stand in front of an abyss and somebody gives you a push from behind you may fall down if this person after you are falling already but just take the hand back doesn will not miraculously reemerge and be put back onto the cliff that call a Tipping Point the so-called Gulf Stream system in the ocean where we have seen a Slowdown over the last decades quite significant slowdown already so where have been of course speculations could the Gulf Stream be shut down completely yes it happened during the is ages several times with Greenland melting there is a very high chance that not only the circulation will slow down in the North Atlantic but it may be shut down completely yeah so that tipping element here clearly a situation for three or four years now in the United States Canada but you have extremely warm weather on the west coast an extremely cold weather on the East Coast this has to do very light ly with the warming of the Arctic The Retreat of the sea eyes which is affecting what we call the Chet stream this is this rhythm of high-speed wind around the Northern Hemisphere and in general this uh jet stream is creating certain waves for a few days only so-called rosby waves and what we find is with with disproportional Arctic warming this waves get stuck they can create unusual heat waves or the Californian drought this is a big surprise for many people because they feel global warming means oh it warmer but with our dynamical weather patterns are being reorganized through the perturbation of the chatstream for example in a highly nonlinear Way by human interference it different story yeah it but it [Music] terrifying we are living in a world which already has a lot of stresses if you look at some parts of the world there already is a major problem with availability of water and with climate change in some places that serious because climate change only adds to some of these stresses the complex interactions of climate change include the unforeseen ways people react to it in California the long drought has decimated crops and driven up commodity prices that change in the market created a disastrous Chain Reaction far away [Music] the price of corn is getting higher and higher because of the dought situation in America then the production of corn from America is getting less then the price of uh corn is double this year so the people start to grow more corn they cut the tree for corn Plantation in uper North it creates a lot the problem [Music]	Success
Paris at Risk: Could Another Historic Flood Happen? | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQ9d9EA9nu0	SLICE Science	[Music] [Music] imagine muddy water invading Paris imagine hotel de conord or the L inundated these images are not those of a disaster movie they are a projection of what could happen in 10 years one year or perhaps even in a few weeks a major flood of the sen in Paris we know that at any rate whatever happens these high waters will occur and will cause problems and The crucial question is ensuring that it doesn in a catastrophic scario because this kind of scenario has already happened in 1910 the Centenary flood a huge rise in the sen that occurs on average once every 100 years and whose return is inevitable with a paralyzed Capital public transport that stops operating for several months thousands evacuated a widespread blackout for millions of people since 1910 Paris has tamed the sen Paris has protected itself but also made itself more Fragile with an underground like swiss cheese full of networks Transport Systems and parking lots like all the major cities in the world the French Capital has spread into the suburbs with millions of additional inhabitants it would be an extremely complex event to manage particularly due to the thousands of people to evacuate to confront the challenge every day dozens of experts are working to plan for the rising water to reduce the power of the river and limit the destruction but while the science is progressing climate change is reshuffling the deck everywhere on the planet natural disasters are increasingly devastating in Paris the tension has gone up a notch the 1910 flooding of the sin has become an average flood and we are now asked to work much more on Extreme floods that would greatly surpass what they had in 1910 now imagine what would have to be done that day how do we prepare for what is increasingly likely but never [Music] certain the sen the most beautiful thoroughfare in Paris flanked by the city monuments but it is far from being a tranquil River it can transform itself into an absolute nightmare for parisians in 1910 an exceptional flood paralyzed the capital for several weeks the water rained a record high transforming the streets into rivers and making life [Music] impossible it images we have of Paris during the flood make it look like Venice there are ladies in long dresses strolling along flooded canals first of all we forget that in these streets it smelt really bad there was Refuge there were holes so was the risk of roadways collapsing we forget that people were cold that people were hungry and it first time people were being photographed they weren cameras they photos don these people experienced at all avoiding another 1910 immediately after the disaster the government tackled the issue its first mission was quite obvious how could the S be regulated how could they prevent the Water Rising so high as with every major flood in this country afterwards there was a commission of Engineers who gave feedback about what had happened then gave advice on improving and ensuring that it wouldn often or that the damage would be minimized over the years they destroyed docks widened arches and dug out the riverbed to improve the flow of the sand at the same rate to flow all of these Renovations enabled a level of flooding like that of 1910 to be reduced by around 30 cm mechanically but these 30 cm gained were insufficient in the following decades other floods threaten the capital in turn they had to strike a harder blow 200 km from Paris the Le Doon is a place for Sunday strolls a Leisure Center this huge body of water didn exist 100 years ago it has two missions in summer when the river level drops it releases water to allow for navigation for drinking water production or for the cooling of the nuclear power plant of noen in Winter however when the sen is High it retains water to avoid flooding and protect the region of Il def the lake is located on what is known as the catchment of the sen that is the series of rivers that feed their water into the river to retain the water in the event of flooding besides the L Doo four other Reservoir Lakes have been built for the largest of the river pansier in the mor region to slow down the Yun there sh that regulates the mount and Temple and amamos that keep the ob in check all of this was not done with the click of the fingers Farmers had to be expropriated and Villages swamped to gain just a few precious centimeters the cumulative effect of capping Peak flood levels on these Four Lakes would allow for a flood like 1910 around 60 to 70 cm to be alleviated from Paris obviously if it occurred in the same way in the month of January at a time when it is almost completely empty these 70 CM gained thanks to the great legs added to the 30 cm from the renovations have improved the flow of the river allowing the water level to be reduced by 1 meter in the event of a flood similar to that of 1910 more than a century later the capital was thus shielded from a repeat of the one in 100e flood it confidence and many people tell me anyway the river can no longer overflow the river is controlled mastered there won or damage in the end these kind of events will go smoothly we with them but the system is not infallible what happens if it rains in the spring and the lakes are already full and what happens when it rains Between the Lakes and Paris this is exactly what happened in 2016 in 2016 the rain came down Upstream of the Lakes so physically we don how to send water back upwards firstly the Lakes were virtually full at that time of year and I believe that the efficacy of our Lakes on that flooding in Paris was around 5 cm just 5 cm less in Paris retained by the lakes in 2016 this flood confirmed it these Reservoir Lakes are not enough but they should soon receive a significant [Music] boost 120 km away a huge construction site is just getting underway in laas vage in the sen it will be the most recent addition to the series of Great Lakes do you think it nicely yes it storage Bay unlike its older siblings the village is located much closer to Paris just before the junction with the Yun it will therefore protect the capital much better but it is also a very different construction site it is no longer a matter of flooding Villages the lake is being created over were existing artificial swamps and here the water is only stored for several days it won series of 10 basins that will be filled by pumps just until the floods are over we are right here in the middle of the First Basin so the area of the dam will be all around us and dkes will be constructed all around us and this will be a site for when a heavy flood in the sen fills up to a height of 2 m here for instance we will have 2 m of water above us when the Basin is in use then once the flood is passed we will Evacuate the entire site and it will recover its traditional uses the ways in which it was used prior to the renovations in the event of a new 100-year flood the village could allow another 40 cm to be gained in paris water level construction is scheduled to end in 2030 [Music] but will it be too late with global warming the risks of a flood like that of 1910 are very real and might occur at any [Music] time July 2021 for the first time in Midsummer colossal amounts of rain fell on the north of Europe in Belgium and Germany floods caused dozens of deaths meteorologists were caught short all of the historical records were beaten with this event and so there was nothing comparable in past Chronicles and that also shows that up until now flood prevention has often been organized by studying past flooding events of course we must continue to do that but we must also integrate new types of events that might occur at the National Weather Center a whole sector is now assigned to climate change a vast study has been launched about the 50 years to come and perhaps counterintuitively warming does not mean less rain just the opposite in a hotter climate there will be more water vapor in the atmosphere so we should have more precipitation this excess of humidity that is in the atmosphere will not be distributed homogeneously over all areas of the planet some areas will have more rainfall and this is notably the case for northern Europe whereas for instance the Mediterranean Basin we [Music] less for the catchment area of the sen this rise in temperatures should be expressed by two phenomena drier Summers but also more extreme rain events capable of causing floods in Winter an overall higher rainfall volume with direct consequences on riverflow levels irrespective of the season the scenarios therefore all converge towards the same conclusions the centinary flood becomes a bit more likely every [Music] day so how do we confront the threat how do we prevent water from spreading everywhere how do we protect Paris and its architectural Treasures like the Louver this morning the famous museum is testing a new anti-flood system of protection we have to go back over each of the sacks to distribute the sand evenly we triggered located on the banks of the sen the Lou is particularly vulnerable based on recent expertise the water could overflow via this low point on the key and Infiltrate The Museum basements this barrier of huge sandbags should slow the water [Music] down we time how long it takes to put a certain line of big bags in place so we time it big bag by big bag and then we average out the whole line to have a better understanding of the time necessary to install 172 M this morning it took 3 hours to set up the barrier for the museum it is crucial to constantly refine these protections they must prevent the water from crossing the road and reaching the Islamic Art rooms or GRE Antiquities located on the ground floor and basement of the palace but here the enemy can attack from anywhere nowadays in the event of a massive influx of water we have huge difficulties identifying precisely by which point the water will enter today the museum basements are a massive swiss cheese there are many cables that pass every every there are a lot of technical networks doors all over the place too all of that means we don where the water will come from and in which direction it will [Music] circulate it was in June 2016 that the museum became brutally aware of its fragility at the Lou the alarm was raised a flood took parisians by surprise in Midsummer the water reached 6 M at the reference point of the pitz the museum closed its doors and activated its anti-flood plan hundreds of artworks kept in stor rooms were urgently brought to the upper floors in the end the S did not rise any higher but it was a close call because despite all its efforts the staff of the louv were only able to evacuate a quarter of the artworks under threat 120,000 works could have been damaged if the water had risen higher they were a hair disaster since then all of the store rooms have been emptied and transferred thousands of artworks have been shifted to a new annex of the museum 200 km north of Paris the Louisville collections are safe Paris has a globally unique Heritage but the main concern is parisians including the suburbs there are over 12 million inhabitants a huge an Hill dependent on a vast transport Network the Metro how is the company preparing [Music] itself as a reminder the goal is for us all to acquire experience because the 1910 flood will happen one day every year there happens this morning employees from the Parisian Metro technical crew had a rehearsal on the plal that was completely covered in water in 1910 and it would flood again with a 100-year event the apparatus is impressive they came with breeze blocks and cement mixers the first phase of the plan consists of sealing off 80 points on the networks Metro entrances but also air vents as in today just the beginning there are nearly 429 element areas that must be protected these are places where if there is a flood near the sen as we see here there will be risks of water penetration so edifications are put in place anti flood protections that will prevent the water penetrating the network if the S overflows and avoid disastrous damage the 1910 flood highlighted the Network fragility not only did the water engulf several stations but it spread via the tunnels and flooded the neighborhood of the sanal train station several hundreds of meters from the S most of these men are not Masons but Metro employees who were trained prior to the big day during the exercise every detail is checked so the manager takes note in a notebook in the traditional manner because on the day of the flood telephones might not work a few meters away a second group mounts Coffer dams and aluminum protection in maximum alert phase the Parisian Metro technical coordination deploys 800 people to block all of the air and atrisk station entrances within a few hours but water is a devious enemy and even with such an armada the engineers have discovered a few faults there are 429 element areas that will be raised to the surface with this in mind we need to prevent eventual weaknesses of one of the areas whether that be related to vandalism or to thrown against a protection that might hinder its resistance even if the barrier is put up on time and thus cause total or partial spread of the flood waters within the network what the Parisian Metro coordinator wants to avoid is what happened in New York during Hurricane Sandy in 2012 or hurricane Ida in 2021 [Music] 3:00 in the morning pamit station to prevent water flooding the interior of the network the Metro employees have set up their first anti Floodgate overnight this time directly in the [Music] Metro pyamid station is on line 14 the most sensitive of all the most recently constructed line it is the deepest fully automated and runs alongside the S it notably passes through the 12th District where the water could rise to a very high level if the protections give way at the K sanon station for instance water could flood the entire line at pyamid it could then go up two levels via Metro stairwells that is over 20 M high and unfurled onto Line 7even for two nights now about 20 people have put these two 400 kilo gates in place that must prevent the water from transferring to a connecting line our goal now is to avoid resurgences happening all over the place if the water gets in somewhere that would damage a lot of the network even if there penetration point for instance so that is what by setting up these secondary partition Gates that create a second layer of protection of our infrastructure but the Metro is not the only Network that allows the water to spread very quickly there is another even bigger one in the int Trails of Paris the sewers and now is it smelly or not no a little bit their role is specifically to help water circulate and not the cleanest of waters here we have the connector this is where the waste water circulates in this conduit here which is the Basin of the connector in theory this waste water is not cast directly back into the S it is sent back to water treatment plants that filter it before returning it to the river but in Paris the sewers have a special feature that complicates the situation in the event of floods besides Wastewater they must absorb all of the rain water within the same network when it rains a lot the sewers are saturated so that they don overflow they are forced to discharge into storm water spillways these Forks that lead directly to the S empty a combination of rainwater and waste water into the river but in the event of a flood the storm water spillways become hazardous because the water of the S could go in the opposite direction if we do not open the storm water spillways the waste water will first start entering the cellers which may not be watertight and if the water level continues to rise it will even flow over the roadway deactivating the sewer buffer zones with disastrous consequences for the environment and the [Music] population one solution remains batten down the hatches prevent the water of the s from entering the sewers by activating about 40 floodgates like this one when the S Rises The Floodgate will start to close to stay above the level of the Sen when the S is 20 cm under the Vault The Floodgate is completely sealed which means that the S can no longer evacuate waste water either so the sewers can be protected from flooding by closing the floodgates but if it rains at the same time then the network will very quickly be engulfed and the sewers will overflow so we must avoid the rainwater joining the network however in Paris if we exclude the bologa and vanen which are peripheral Woods 80% of the ground is watertight roads Pavements housing all of this water will therefore run off into the sewers without penetrating the soil to reverse the trend researchers are working on the concept of a sponge city a city that absorbs [Music] water in the middle of the bu vasen to the east of Paris this little corner of the garden is photographed by drone once a month two plots of land side by side which are in fact a mini laboratory flanked by sensors so here we have radiating infrared sensors operating directly and indirectly and basically all of the sensors are actually distributed everywhere at various depths and here we have the cables that emerge and connect with the electrical cabinet that will centralize the data the sun the water the amount of rain everything is scrutinized and analyzed the two plots are almost identical but the same plants the same garden soil the kind usually found in the city one thing distinguishes them there is just one difference between these two plots it the way they level in each Garden there is 1.5 M of garden soil and 50 cm of what we call the reserve which is actually just a kind of Rocky bed we fill that part with rocks and since they more space between them meaning that we can retain more water in the first Garden the water that rises up to the Rocks when it rains is immediately evacuated ated by a low pipe towards the sewers in the second Garden however the low pipe is closed the only way for the water to evacuate is by evapotranspiration that is plant ability to absorb water and restore it to the atmosphere it is this ability that the experiment is measuring today the whole policy of rainfall management is about managing the rainwater as closely as possible to where it lands at its source and as much as possible what we call nature-based Solutions the idea is not to send it very far not to let it flow and if you do it can go for a few meters but it mustn recovering the most natural path as well the experiment of the garden laboratory is only in the early phases but the first results are promising this program belongs to a broader project launched by the city council the Paris rain plan since 2018 this new way of approaching water is even a statutory obligation every neighborhood must now retain a certain amount of rainwater where it falls in the north of Paris where the ground is not suitable for absorption the obligation is only 4 mm per 24 hours however near the sen between 8 and 12 mm of rainwater must be conserved 8 m of rainfall in 24 hours represents just this height basically this amount of water fell on Paris within 24 hours if you add all this rain over Paris between 0 and 8 millit over the whole year in the end the total volume that represents is 80% of annual [Music] rainfall obviously any new building permit must integrate this constraint in this Avenue in the 12th District the sidewalks are being rebuilt with no borders around trees to allow the water to flow towards the soil directly when it rains a bit further on this street no longer allows any rain into the sewers the paving stones let most of the water infiltrate into the ground here there quantity of water so we see there small proportion that still flows because this is the equivalent of a good dose of rain the excess runs onto a gravel bed under the roadway and will the Earth without ever getting into the sewers we are going to make Paris 100% a sponge we won permeable there will still be roads but the question is how to build the city so that non-absorptive surfaces run towards absorptive ones but in the event of a major flood the principle of the sponge City will not be enough with its modernization Paris like all the major metropolises of the planet has become Fragile the city is now more vulnerable than ever today we have seven floors seven to eight floors that are built under the feet of parisians all of the technical networks travel through these basement levels the Metro electricity gas heating and teleph wires that currently serve our daily lives around 5 million people will have basic Services interrupted so that means a very widespread shutdown according to experts the first Network to go down would be heating the last would be drinking water but the most crucial of all the one on which nearly all the others depend is the electrical Network electricity is extremely important because the networks are interdependent if you don electricity you can system for example you can telecommunication networks you can water so in order for the networks to function we need electricity but electricity is like anything they will try to cut it as a preventive measure to protect their installations from the water so we might find that 3 or 4 days before we reach the peak there are suddenly whole zones without electricity the most sensitive area of Paris is in the heart of wealthy neighborhoods at the alma intersection here underg ground there is an area under heavy surveillance today a flooding response coordinator for a French electricity network has come to inspect this substation that has been completely restructured hello how are you it Powers 110,000 homes and its proximity with the river makes it the most vulnerable if the and overflows in the Paris region electricity is produced by nuclear thermal or hydraulic power plants far from the capital in places that have no flood risk electric motorways of 400,000 volts lead to Transformers located in the suburbs far from the sen but then the 225,000 volts circulate underneath Paris in big cables which sustain 36 transformation substations some times threatened by flooding such as that of Alma it is there that the final transformation of the current is undertaken before being directed towards local substations then on to homes the core is two levels down that is where behind a watertight door the imposing Transformer is located here saying it new well protected it is preserved from any river floods it and it heavy so this is where the 225,000 volt cables come to the trouble starts on the next floor down the third basement level 12 M below ground it is the starting point for all the cables that will power the neighborhood substations I the first Aqua barriers these are all the cables that will go into the street to provide Power to customers the sensitive points are not the cables themselves but the connections that must stay out of the water so in the event of overflow from the river the water can plummet through the galleries or via ventilation shafts the room is therefore compartmentalized so this barrier here which has to be lifted is to keep the water inside right I put the plates like this we it with butterfly discs we there okay that way if the water rises on this side we rise on this side you we have a pump that allows us to reinjected into the S as soon as the water reaches a concerning level pumps start working to cast the water back into the S but the most threatened floor is the fourth and final basement level located 15 M down what we can see is that the equipment used to be kept at ground level you see through the fences you can see it was on the floor and was removed so we could gain 2 m of height just in case so more water can come in here without a problem before the most sensitive installations such as the Transformer were found here today there nothing left yet if this floor is under threat it is not so much due to the flooding of the sen as it is to a much more pernicious Danger here you can see that the water infiltrated the substations so now we check that in times of flood the water will not flow in here here the point of weakness is infiltration via the fattic Zone a danger that could in the event of flooding become the major issue for the capital substrata when the water rising from this layer adds to the Overflow of the river the situation can become uncontrollable usually the ftic zones are pockets of water in balance with the sen they flow into it slowly via underground Pathways when the ground fills up with water after rain but the rising Waters of the river can provoke a phenomenon of reflux the water from the S flows massively into these zones which can no longer drain and their level rises we must imagine this flood is like a piece of theater where everything plays out backstage what you see is very very different from the reality of the flood because most of it is happening underground a ftic Zone em bibes everything you can coffee filter you can progress of water you can lay sandbags create dikes build walls on the surface this controls it a bit as for the ftic Zone there nevertheless surveillance of the fadic zones exists the capital are therefore gritted with dozens of pom meters a tool that allows the height of the zone to be measured some are near the sen others like this one must go down almost 30 6 M to find the water of a Zone on this hill in Paris however there is no risk of flooding but the measuring instrument participates in the overall surveillance of the substrata please write this down so the depth is 3670 that 15° 15 okay so that fine this point during floods will not be impacted much but it provides information on how the water circulates in the zones on the scale of inner Paris so we need data points all over the place to be able to understand how it works how the water flows okay but where is this Zone what does it look like is it at once nearly everywhere and almost invisible [Music] to have a chance of meeting this formidable enemy we must sink deep into the Parisian underground into the galleries of former quaries for instance it shows through in this pit created two centuries ago by monks people often think that the ftic zone is an underground lake or river but no it usually technically you can it the ftic zone is a bit like water in a sponge or for instance when you dig the sand at the beach and after a while you hit water sea water it principle thanks to their data the engineers from the quaries are constantly aware of the water level but predicting whether the Zone will rise and by how much is much more difficult currently when there is a flood period we monitor the level to inform parisians of potential Flooding at the substrat but it make predictions because there are many parameters we pumps pumps they began in the early 20th century with the conquest of the substrata Paris sometimes has up to seven levels Underground filled with parking lots metros galleries that thwart the natural movements of the fadic zones to tame it the builders used pumps that cast the water from the ftic Zone into the sewers or the sen hundreds of them are operating constantly in Paris This concerns the Parisian Metro especially a large part of its network is located at the level of fadic zones it has 270 pumps like this one crucial in All Seasons here for instance is the water from the ftic Zone permanently evacuated by the pump over part of line 8 without it the line would immediately be flooded the pumps are a few meters away from the tracks protected by a watertight door to continue to operate even in the event of flooding to protect its Network the Parisian Metro coordination unit Powers the pump using a dual electrical circuit that limits the risk of outages it also equips this substation with sensors that alert it if the rate of flow suddenly increases but the fantic zones remain an area for concern what would happen if in spite of everything the pumps stopped researchers from the top School of Engineering have been working on this question since 2016 we a digital model of the Parisian region by referencing all of the pumps so now we have surveyed over 300 pumps that annually sample 19,000 million cubic met in the perisian substrata mainly to preserve infrastructure next the researchers identified the pumps that should stop with electrical faults due to flooding these are all the green dots that have turned red the immediate consequence is that the water from the fadic zones starts rising in light blue the water is no more than 12 M from the surface that is in the deepest parking lots in a deeper blue it is less than 8 m in dark blue the water from the zones is under 4 m in the 12th or 15th districts near the sen the rise of the zones adds to the Overflow from the river and makes the situation even harder but the study also revealed a few more unexpect expected consequences the for on the right Bank this underground mall in the heart of Paris is far from the S it shouldn affected by the river bursting its banks but the threat comes from underground in the event that all the pumps stopped well we observe water levels that are between 0 and-4 m underground so possibly a flood in the lower levels of the Forum water that would rise to 4 M below the surface that is in fact all of the shops that would be flooded in some neighborhoods the water from creatic zones could even rise to the surface and accentuate the floods provoked by the flooded river water is by nature an element that is uncontrollable while Paris has become aware of this challenge scientists and authorities know that it will be difficult to prevent the city from partial flooding how can we reduce the risks for all of these urban areas that know they are threatened by floods do we need to come up with new architectural solutions to make the city resilient in France there is a place where this idea has been put into application this neighborhood of ran in theer once belonged to the Matra Factory in 2007 architect Eric Danel laom was given the task of restoring it but the neighborhood runs alongside a little river the sua which has proven to be rather restless so the local Council imposed two constraints no housing less than 1 M50 from the ground and no more than 20% of the land could be built on to allow the water to flow in the event of flooding the architect thus designed the new neighborhood as a place that might be flooded at any [Music] time we are working on what we call Natural regulations meaning that the water enters the neighborhoods the water flows through neighborhoods the water loses its Force as it passes and the water returns to the water the real issue is allowing the water to return to the water and not remain blocked or degraded by the houses the whole neighborhood is built in the direction of the current there is a straight road and a road curved like the river and between the two there is still water flowing in the direction of the current that current you rip out fewer trees you sweep away fewer cars you do less damage and there is less kinetic energy the houses are arranged around a big Garden that transforms itself into a temporary tributary when the river overflows in the middle we find a few traps for slowing the water down so here we are on a catchment basin that is a place where the water will fall as though into a hole lose a bit of energy calm down before returning to the river behind me the neighborhood is built in levels the road is raised by 75 cm the pavement by 1 M and the houses are raised by the statutory 1.5 m in 2016 when the sword lifted off its bed a huge flood submerged the city center the new neighborhood was also flooded but it was still possible to live there and the water went down much faster than elsewhere the water rose up to 1 M 45 that is 5 cm below the first residential floors and there was no damage why because firstly the water Rose to 1 M 45 but above all it dropped again through gravity into the river and that is what I worked so hard on there are leveling systems that allow the water to rise in One Direction but go back down in the other and so it went back down into the river in less than 48 hours that allowed the neighborhood to avoid damage while the water remained blocked in other neighborhoods on the Left Bank on the other side on the opposite Island for 3 weeks since then hont has become a reference case and the architect is advising many elected officials in the perisian region but the example of the m natur neighborhood with a great deal left up to nature would not be easy to reproduce near the S and in very big Urban sites you are working in Paris where the land is worth of Fortune I think that market forces can be a barrier to Natural regulation that is what is known as societal choices in the meantime it that dictates its law [Music] if Paris has to endure its rage it would take at least 3 months to recover normal life the water electricity and transport networks would take time to be repaired possibly even several years because despite all the research all the protections scientists have only one certainty this flood will never be exactly the one they expect that we must prepare people to be surprised it is really the notion in which this phenomenon we think we know it in part but in the end we realize that with the phenomena that occurred in 2016 2018 we have always been surprised by some of the things that happened unfortunately all of the solutions that we can develop today will attenuate these phenomena but could never prevent them we will also no doubt have other floods that will come as I was saying to highlight the flaws in our protective systems or weaken them a bit so we must be prepared for these issues so now we need to train people to confront phenomena that are very violent that truly call into question their organization and really get them used to being much more reactive to them and rather than being a spectator to what might happen we must also transform learning to live with the floods means becoming an actor within the system being yourself and capable of rising to The Challenge on your own scale [Music]	Success
Sperm Whales: Survival in a Changing Ocean | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT-BMTl2eqU	SLICE Science	[Music] sperm whale shame on man to give me such a name thinking my head is full of seamen and not [Music] oil it Really Am I live in a world that my ancestor conquered long before men made fateful contact with my family and staked their claim to The Riches of our Southern [Music] Seas my Odyssey begins in the crushing cold Abyss where creatures survive in permanent Darkness including the largest deep SE monster of [Music] all for millions of years the freezing Waters of the Southern Seas remained our domain man never ventured this [Music] far but that wasn corner of the planet has man not sought to explore and call his own including the Roaring 40s a wild expanse of air and water in the southern Indian Ocean which is my home for so long the creatures of the deep thousands of feet underwater may as well not have existed who better to explore this alien world than me I dive deeper than practically any other mammal 10,000 ft or more for over an hour at a [Music] time no light penetrates Beyond a th000 ft of water the only light in the dark zone is produced by The Animals themselves like this comb jellyfish for instance for my story and the cameras the deep ocean will be lit by powerful projectors to cast light on this world of Eternal [Music] Darkness life down here subsists under extreme conditions temperature is stable at an almost freezing 1° C and pressure is simply unbelievable at 3,000 ft it is 100 times greater than it is at sea level [Music] Darkness prevents photosynthesis so expect no plant life only [Music] animals among them the Dumbo octopus [Music] a [Music] but I mustn the story of my family it begins more than 200 years ago before these islands between the Antarctic and South Africa were ever named in spite of their relatively mild at Latitude no trees grow here even though it rains and snows 300 days a year my grandfather along with other adult males settled around this archipelago because only they with their generous warm-blooded bodies could stand the waters 4° C on the surface no wonder our smaller females stick to the tropics as for Granddad he stayed away from the islands because their Shores were patrolled by his greatest enemies killer whales with its 6ft High dorsal fin this male belongs to a family pod led by a female The Matriarch one can tell the females and young because of their short Dorsal fins The Matriarch polies the coast with her highly evolved sense of ing which creates three-dimensional maps of the waters she gets the full picture almost instantly as sound travels five times faster through water than it does through the [Music] air the killer whales are on the lookout for any unusual or interesting activity and there 2 million King Penguins that mouths to feed especially hungry chicks who depend on their parents to Chance the waters for food The Matriarch knows only too well the roots Penguins take to feed males too know the ropes [Music] but King penguins have a memory of sorts a memory that equates killer whales with [Music] death underwater Penguins emit weak sound waves that mix confusingly for the killer whales with other iant sounds so the matriarch bides her time until her prey surfaces [Music] [Music] [Music] killer whales are not only efficient Predators it so awesome pressing the animal between tongue and pallet they squeeze the meat fat and guts out in a single chunk the older female will pass these skills on to her granddaughter who in time will become the matriarch of the family [Music] keeping a healthy distance from all this killing was Granddad who was doing well for himself out in the open [Music] sea but one day totally out of the blue new visitors graced these Shores those who would finally give our Islands a name they came from places Granddad never knew nothing would ever be the same again remember all this happened two centuries ago I about men American Whalers from Massachusetts in 1772 stories began circulating about the adventures of a French Captain Marion duin he was Sailing In Search of a southern continent when he crossed Waters haunted by sea monsters at 46° South he stumbled on the islands defrain took possession of them in the name of France and called them cro after his first mate but France was a world away and couldn American Whalers the South Seaman took full advantage the way steady now steady I say in boy oh stop it there boys [Music] [Music] guess who they were after the great whales like my ancestors [Music] AR well ahead P together leave over the side our powerful forward blows created great excitement on the high seas and gave us [Music] away come back here good boy [Music] not for much longer the South Seaman knew our weaknesses the 10 minutes we need to breathe on the surface and our blind spot that keep going no they came from behind or head on to aim harpoons into our first dorsal bump he word steady now Lads steady Lads he us quiet ready to give it to him it won hour miles away from here hey keep your C when my grandfather felt threatened he coders they are the most powerful calling signals in the animal kingdom and can be heard over 7 miles away his mates responded in kind a group of about 100 males known as the cro gang [Music] [Music] shut your mouth and pull I don I can turn my heart are bleeding their Instinct was to stay close in the face of the unknown [Music] he the the Whalers wanted the group to break up they were as patient as job on this fateful day for my ancestors Instinct betrayed one of their number when an adult male perceives a threat like a rival during The Mating Season a second Instinct drives him head-to-head against the competition the larger member of the group saw the Wailing boat was just such competition and broke away it was my grandfather as long as the whales stayed close the men in their fragile boat could do little then they plunged all except Granddad what all diving don up any minute now [Music] where slide Devil he there steady Lads nice and easy right let him have it [Music] [Music] some of my ancestors were hauled onto the beach to be cut up and their fat boiled down for oil to light the South Seaman Gang the 40 Barrel bull because each one of them filled that many barrels with oil to avoid risky landing South Seaman then developed a new technique they boiled the whales directly on [Music] board the slaughter ended at the turn of the 19th century there were simply too few of my ancestors left the cros gang was all but wiped out nearly a 100 years later wailing was officially banned in the Indian Ocean and France was granted exclusive control of the cro islands and in particular their vast Oceanic shelf that was visited by Rare survivors like my [Music] father he knew all about the somber cemetery on the ocean floor all dead matter rains down from the surface this is what remains of Grandad when the Whalers had finished with him they cast him back out to be picked over by [Music] [Music] scavengers and this cemetery is full of them take the kinoid or sea lies they filter feed off organic particles floating in the [Music] currents and here tripod fish and the Antarctic toad fish it can engulf prey larger than it is and the pagoni sea cucumber it can swim a th000 ft above the bottom to avoid Predators like the deep sea crabs [Music] millions of these crabs Su quietly in the rich currents confident their Armory will protect them from their predators ones with fins and Jaws most common of all among finned Predators is the rat tail with its uncommonly large bladder that beats like a [Music] drum the drum simply helps them to keep contact with each other in the shallow Abyss around 1500 ft schools of Alvin offer a tantalizing Feast but the rat tail there is no match for a far superior predator on the cros Shelf it killing it weighs up to 800 and grows to 6 fet Patagonian toothfish killers in ambush [Music] [Music] toothfish share the Alvin with Squid that squid instead their secret weapon the largest neurons of any animal on the planet to power lightning reflexes [Music] my father like all sperm whales also feeds mainly on squid but he doesn rely on conventional eyesight to do this but on his own sonar now let me explain why our heads are full of oil and not spurn Fact one the oil helps amplify and orientate our ecool locations those sounds we send out that bounce back to us Fact Two we have the largest brains in the world and they create Imes of our surroundings from The Echoes if we raise the frequency sort of high voltage Stakes we can hone in on the size and direction of our [Music] prey but what certainly isn father never heard these sounds and until he was 80 years old at the end of his long life it [Music] surface men with their toys again thankfully they French oceanographers mapping the ocean floor my father carries a similar map in his brain and for good reason he must to move on from the cold cray Waters to find a mate in the [Music] tropics the ban on wailing in the Indian Ocean allowed the cros gang to reproduce and regroup unsuspectingly in the mosam beak Chapel [Music] this is where my mother lives along with other females you can tell they mere 30 ft long [Music] old Bulls like my father grw up to 50 ft in addition to their supersized brain they are the largest toothed predator in the world but enough boasting this was only a nursery it mother hunted another female was always on hand to Watch Over Me [Music] they taught me the codas and cries which vary from Clan to Clan so we know who [Music] [Music] talking as I grew up I met males from other nurseries around the Indian Ocean and one day we headed like my ancestors to the kingdom of the sea monsters the Cru Islands [Music] [Music] today the waters around the archipelago sound very different from what my father or grandfather were used to such unnatural sounds but they attra all manner of marine life including ourselves and Dumbo it [Music] [Music] what are these lions with nasty hooks 20,000 of [Applause] [Music] them my ears see everything the anchors drag mile upon mile of long lines from the surface to the [Music] bottom all eyes are on what dangle from the hooks holy baits slices of oily mackerel [Music] but the abelia squid knows when to turn down a free meal and makes itself scarce by blending into the surrounding [Music] light dragged down by anchors and their own weight the lines finally lay on the bottom the restaurant is open for several [Music] hours the menu entices none of the sub Antarctic squids in fact none of the squids at all like this Antarctic flying squid they prefer their meals to be alive and not on tenter hooks at night they go to the surface in search of anything that around as long as it far too large and dangerous is this hio turis [Music] squid squids are always welcomed on the surface by other nocturnal feeders white chinned petrol but who or what is responsible for the long [Music] lines inside these floating factories human hands also work through the night TR finally fishermen decorate the lines with bright toys equipped with radar transmission their Ruckus won unnoticed others will hone in on this from 10 miles [Music] away our old enemy killer whales and this time they Sea today there are about a hundred of them around cros unlike my family they developed a specific dialect of clicks unique to their isolated parts [Music] [Music] the matriarch she others in the area her cries carry over a radius of 2 miles but what exactly is her message that she [Music] toys such mammals used to feasting on Penguins don do but the long liners changed all that they attract one of the least known and rarely filmed mammals in the southern polar Seas ourglass Dolphins they dolphins that have never been seen near [Music] land anything serves as a pretext to turn the empty ocean into a [Music] playground including me [Music] now thanks to the Wailing ban here I am with other males confronting fishermen but this time the tables are turned we [Music] perhaps because of my ancestors experience we first keep a healthy distance from the boat the green one over there oh but why oh why do they have to show up out here have they lost their taste for penguins can and 30 times heavier than [Music] them the must be another reason the toys or do the killer whales know like us about the [Music] Lions The Matriarch is certainly on to something they haul the toys out before the Lions but what will come up with the [Music] Lions they [Music] but it bait [Music] I could have told them to avoid killer whales I can dive 10,000 ft to inspect the Lions but I ft the cut off point for killow whales it really is a bad day for this long liner but there are five other boats out there same shape different color the fishermen hate us especially the killer whales whom they blame most for trying to steal their catch and rightly so the white boat has no alternative but to shake them off even if it means covering hundreds of miles [Music] these desolate islands are continually battered by the westlies of the Roaring 40s with winds up to 125 mph and more at such speed clouds hug the Earth and waterfalls reach for the sky in this extreme environment nature defies the laws of gravity even land is no barrier to the the onslaught of the werles they whip up the biggest waves in the world but the winds are oily sweet they carry the scent of fish I ction but by quite a different signal beating below the storm far out to see another floating restaurant [Music] [Music] you [Music] when the long liners and their airborne and Maritime escort stop it first H The Matriarch reserves the right to lead the way [Music] curiously the males wait patiently on the surface for the females to feed them the interval is enough for the long liners to haul up rat tails and the most prized catch of all Patagonian toothfish the white boat devours five tons of tooth fish on a good day I and vulnerable killer whales could easily attack me they accommodating with the lion [Music] biting The Matriarch leads a blockade against me I know their game it intimidation I I that way they can only attack me from one [Music] side they chase me off The Matriarch Shadows me to communicate my movement to her pod H very clever a killer flank blocks my path back to the boat the Pod tries to frighten and disorient me with underwater detonations and tail slaps but I I granddad help but my clan must be beyond the S mile limit of My Cries alone like this my size and weight are now a burden what underneath me to stop me [Music] [Music] diving they even know my blind spot like

luck to them up there oh I hear their victory song is all [Music] right no way I for a few measly tooth fish on a string when the abyss provides all I need over a ton of food every day still I put up a good fight and the long liners should thank me for dis extracting the Kellow whales they return to their routine males on the surface females down the [Music] line the females are very picky they only take the oily toothfish and leave the burning rat tail [Music] here dessert and he isn opportunist around others fly in for the occasion white chinned petrols regularly follow boats and dive down to 30 ft for a catch [Applause] giant albatrosses wouldn Gather in Open Water like this but the long liners have changed these animals feeding habits neither killow whales nor albatrosses could ever hope otherwise to feed on deep sea fish but now most of my neighbors in the South Seas have adapted to this Rich new source of protein a [Music] [Applause] [Music] the fishing boats have become an artificial Oasis for scavengers and live prey Hunters [Music] alike and long made last fewer long liners are now allowed in the cros waters to protect the overfished tooth fish so our adventure with the boats looks set to [Music] continue as for me who says I don enjoy my fair share from the Lions it a secret I boats keep coming and I have three last little secrets first as a senior member of the deep sea club which excludes killow whales I can say the Natural Balance really is changing down here fewer toothfish allow their prey and mine the squids to age quietly and grow incredibly take this one from the gon [Music] family the giant clams in the background are a foot long that gives some idea of the squid size tentacles 3 ft long and the mantle are whooping 12 [Music] ft I clearly lack

First Contact? Exploring Life on Exoplanet Minerva B | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxEul7HzDKw	SLICE Science	[Music] there are no Witnesses no cheering crowds in the control room a decade or more will pass before news finally reaches us back across the dark oceans of space but the seeds of this Mission are already being swn today by the first generation of scientist bold enough to believe it could be possible when I look up in the sky and I see not Stars I see planetary systems they look to planets orbiting distant Stars searching for an answer to the oldest human question are we alone is there life on other worlds and if not why not and if so how this is the first generation in human history where we have the technological ability to actually go and answer that great question this is the story of humanity launched into the final frontier by a new breed of adventurers the Planet Hunters Engineers explorers and dreamers taking the first steps on an Interstellar Journey they know that they will not complete the Journey of a future mission searching for a second Genesis Among the Stars a spacecraft that goes to another star to look for life on a planet out there earthlike in the goldilock zone where liquid water could exist in great quantities and when will that process begin ah we are on the cusp of discovery [Music] [Music] w [Music] I am emis I am the mind of the Mother Ship I am the body that has traveled where human bodies cannot go to an alien world 4.7 light years from Earth Earth on a mission to solve the mystery is their life beyond their solar [Music] system I release my Landing module into the atmosphere of the exoplanet minova be two centuries of human labor and human hope have brought me to this moment and I am ready to touch down I am ready to [Music] explore I am ready to discover [Music] [Music] Life 4 and A2 billion ion years ago in the nursery of the heavens a star was born a giant cloud of dust and gas distended and ballooned until under the burden of its gravity it collapsed upon itself swirled into a disc and forged a solar system from the dust that star was our son [Music] [Applause] of the planets that were formed only one that we know of gave rise to [Music] life but could our sun our solar system Our Living Earth have produced the only Genesis Among the [Music] Stars my intuition is that the universe is full of life there might not look like Earth with with vegetation and [Music] animals well the question that I interested in is really the start of life and on Earth we see for a long time life was just microbial but all the essential features of Life were there nothing new was invented when life became trees and animals that was just morphological that dressing to me it interesting at all everything interesting with respect to biology was present when there were no trees and no animals and life was just microscopic the DNA was there the amino acids was there all the biochemical Machinery that makes life life was there life is a miracle and an enigma even to those who own lives trying to crack the code NASA planetary scientist Chris McKay is one of them part of a generation of scientists on a quest to find a second Genesis beyond Earth the search for life began with a lot of optimism focused on Mars here was a planet that could have had a thick atmosphere and could have had water in the recent past and in the popular literature at least still had water so the search for Life on Mars really was thought to be easy in 1976 NASA first ever landing on the Martian surface looking for the life that had been hoped for well turned out a lot harder nature was guarding her Secrets much more closely than we imagined so then things basically went quiet in the search for life and I think they were sparked again not on Mars but in the outer solar [Music] system 3 2 1 and lift off of the Cassini spacecraft on a billion mile Trek to Saturn in the final Decades of the 20th century Humanity launched a series of ambitious missions to explore the outer solar system standing by for sole rocket booster all systems go at this time the discovery of liquid water on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn in the misty plumes of Enceladus and the Subterranean oceans of Europa and ganim has opened a thrilling new chapter in the search for a second Genesis the impact of identifying a separate origin of Life on one of these worlds would extend far beyond our solar system finding life that that truly represents a second Genesis of life well that would tell us that the answer is not one it life in the universe and going from one to two is huge because in the Scale of the Universe the only numbers that make sense are zero one and infinity and what we learn in our solar system we for life [Music] beyond the renewed optimism in the search for life within our solar system emerged alongside a discovery that transformed the way we see the [Music] universe in the early 2000s NASA Kepler Telescope reveal that every star in the galaxy just like our sun is orbited by at least one [Music] planet and up to a quarter of these socalled exoplanets are believed to be suitable for [Music] life in the Milky Way alone that means roughly 400 billion solar systems and 80 billion potentially habitable Worlds the odds of finding a second Genesis have never been [Music] better the way I like to think of this is that life will arise anywhere where the conditions are right and the trick in that is what constitutes the right conditions planetary scientist Jonathan lenine is another veteran in the hunt for life beyond Earth but what exactly is life and how does one search for it the Basic Essentials for life to begin and to exist are liquid water organic molecules because carbon is really the essential versatile element that can combine with other elements in many different ways to make the structures of Life free energy and minerals and nitrogen to provide the other elements that are required to keep the chemistry going to generate catalysts that generate more catalysts and more structures until we get to the complexity of a primitive cell liquid water carbon molecules energy minerals and the secret formula that animates it all into a living [Music] cell these ingredients this recipe for life is what our scientists are hunting for on other [Music] [Music] worlds I deploy my spiderbots onto the murven surface I 3D print a fleet of drones and I let them [Music] fly with these eyes and these instruments I will taste and touch and see this new world for the first time will I find all that is [Music] hopeful exoplanets are the new frontier in the search for life beyond Earth but the prospect of exploring Distant Worlds presents an expanding Universe of rivers to cross and mountains to [Music] climb how on Earth can we prepare to explore planets we know so little [Music] about exoplanets present a real challenge because there uncertainty so knowing whether or not you a desert versus in Ocean versus in ice Tundra we may not know when we launched so you system to survive and operate in all of those uh possible conditions at NASA headquarters in Pasadena California around 100 young Engineers are busy Reinventing the wheels of The Rovers of old with Planetary Exploration we started with a large robot that was very stable very safe um and now we beginning to take more risk we to get to new places uh trying to shrink down the the size of the platform do more with less it over there just the sort of thing other Rovers can [Music] into some of our robots are designed to climb up different surfaces so we have a claw inspired robot that uses sharp hooks to grab onto the rough surface kind of like an insect or a rock climber would scale up a cliff we also use electrostatics to stick to surfaces so this is like rubbing the balloon on your head and it sticks to the [Music] wall one of the key Innovations in the new breed of Robotics is biomimicry using biological systems and processes as the model for design to look for Life behave like life we have created a material that has mechanical properties similar to that you see in biological tissues we have already with this system developed swimming robots there is a lot of work today in robots that can go between dry surfaces and and water-like surfaces wherever we find water on Earth we find life so we have a strategy that we water I think we same strategy when we visit an exoplanet I follow the uvial plane of a retreating Glacier my hygrometers detect increasing [Music] humidity I am on the scent of fresh water tracing its inevitable [Music] course its branching channels over wide flood [Music] Plains consuming rock and mineral now growing braish perhaps estrine fresh water and sediment meeting the insistent flow of an incoming tide there is a river ocean system onov B an ideal breeding ground for [Music] life this is a place where there but it it [Music] here life is pink and living in saturated salt it green things we normally think of as life the Salt Ponds of San Francisco Bay are a naturally occurring Wetland reshaped by human industry and colonized by trillions of colored [Music] microorganisms these are a type of halophilic Ara it unusual type of microorganism uh it extremophile it requires high salt and it lives in an environment where only it can survive so it dominates so where it grows it grows well and and it king what these salty bugs have in common with everything from oak trees to humans is access to liquid water all life on Earth in some sense is fragile it availability and the chemistry of water we tend to think well life on Earth is expanded to all the corners of the earth and it it everywhere that everywhere on this planet this is a water Planet but when we look beyond the Earth we realize that water is in fact rare the liquid state of water is rare and life is not the all-conquering capability uh life is it only can squeeze itself into those environments where there [Music] water water look at Carbon which is the next part of the recipe for life where water is liquid carbon can be a solid a dissolved ion or a gas all coexisting in the same place carbon is an unusual element in that it is capable of making many many different kinds of molecules there are literally millions of organic molecules known and water then becomes the mil in which all of the chemistry of carbon that leads to us is going to take place carbon-based organic molecules like amino acids are the building blocks of life combining in liquid water to form the structures of every living cell on Earth today these complex molecules are everywhere but where do they come from [Music] [Music] comp D in March 2004 the European Space Agency launched the Rosetta spacecraft on a hunt for the building blocks of life beyond Earth its destination was 400 million km away and Counting a moving Target hurtling through space at 60,000 km per hour a lump of ice and dust the size of Mount Fuji the comet 67p Rosetta and find out what it of from 2011 onwards Nicola albelli was Rosetta project scientist [Music] because comets formed in the icy outer regions they hold a frozen record of the solar systems birth and as the young Earth cooled and oceans formed around 4 billion years ago some of those same comets Came Crashing Down to Earth so could it have been comets bearing the carbon-based organic molecules from our Solar System that seeded life on Earth it was the task of Rosetta Landing module fil to find out [Music] no [Music] [Music] [Music] around 400 p.m. came the confirmation of [Music] touchdown but the follow-up signals suggested something wasn filet had bounced back into space then bounced a second time before finally coming to rest several hundred M away [Music] [Music] Miss the results were remarkable filet detected 16 organic molecules in just a tiny sample of dust kicked up by the initial touchdown among them some of the key building blocks of life on Earth [Music] [Music] [Music] Rosetta demonstrated that the building blocks of life on Earth were created during the birth of our solar [Music] system but what about Beyond could these same vital ingredients be part of the birth of All [Music] Stars looking back at our own Earth and why we have this Rich you know biosphere uh well we think it all started with having all this organic material that we are made up of that that was delivered from space uh from comets and from asteroids so when we were thinking about the likelihood of life elsewhere we pretty much thinking about the likelihood of having that same scenario taking place in 2015 high on the Arid mountains of the atakama desert Professor Karen oberg set out on a hunt for the the building blocks of life in the birth cloud of an alien star system with the help of a new telescope called Alma Alma consists of 66 individual telescopes that together it operates at millimet wavelengths and millimeter wavelengths is where we can detect molecules some these organic molecules that we are so interested in [Music] oberg turned Alma system and found the young star mwc 480 in the throws of [Music] Labor girdled by a disc of gas and dust from which planets were being born we see this dust and gas that surrounding this these young stars and what they often have little Lanes or track in them where it looks like plant formation is going on right [Music] now after months of collecting and analyzing the data oberg announced a discovery that blew the odds wide open of finding a second Genesis on other worlds in the dis of this alien solar system Elma had detected some of the same organic molecules that helped give rise to life on on Earth we found three kinds of cyanides three molecules in the same chemical family and those three kinds of molecules have also been found in our own solar system in [Music] comets the same organic molecules with the same miraculous potential to create life are out there Among the [Music] Stars chemistry is awesome is the reason that we are alive and that we the first place uh so far is only you know one system apart from our solar system where we have this chemical information but my intuition would be that it kind of chemistry is going to be almost Universal [Music] I scan for sites of geochemical [Music] activity I find a hydrothermal field of ferals and hot springs on Earth such conditions are rich in carbon chemistry and minerals [Music] I find another mineral Rich water source [Music] Upstream I identify complex molecular structure in [Music] solution I extract a sample for analysis and return it to the Lander [Music] module could this be evidence of [Music] [Music] Life yeah let there we go okay let measurement the laws of chemistry and physics are Universal so it that uh when we go to another earthlike planet with water with the sorts of minerals that we have here an iron core an atmosphere it kind of simple chemistry would have been present okay it this little guy has for us as long as there energy to interact with that mixture things will happen wow look at that one degree keep pulling up the question that we are heading for right now how certain can we be that that mix of simple chemistry could take the next step in complexity so life could begin in the hydrothermal fields of vampers Hill California all the ingredients of Life are brought together water carbon molecules energy minerals careful of the end not coming up biologists David deer and Bruce D believe this is the kind of environment where life could get started on another world bubbling pools strange colored rocks water of different PHS all kinds of flows and dynamic steam Rising it looks like Nature set and it for the beginning of a living system conditions like this defined the early Earth evidence of similar environments has been found on Mars and researchers expect hydrothermal fields to be a common feature of earthlike exoplanets but how might Nature chemistry set cook up the recipe of life everything that based on polymers everybody knows the name DNA nucleic acid that polymers proteins these are uh amino acid polymers and that start of all life are those two [Music] polymers so what we small molecules the pieces of a polymer called monomers in fact and we exposing them to energy such as you see here at Bumpus Hill and seeing where that energy is sufficient to make those mon link up one after another after another to make a polymer and in fact if we can make a protein-like molecule and a nucleic acid-like molecule and put it into a little wrapper a compartment we Proto cells each sample contains organic molecules or monomers exposed to the mineral Rich Steam and heat energy of the feral in an attempt to form a Proto cell we think that drying out such as you see all around us here at bump as hell water coming in then drying out coming in drying out that think that that cycle was very important to drive the uh process by which polymers are synthesized and then accumulate let it failure are you sure yeah there nothing put it down here the first experiment fails just as it would do many times on an earthlike exoplanet but if all the elements were present in conditions such as this this experiment in life would repeat again and again but some of them got a lot of liquid in them one last try given enough time and keep in mind we have an entire planet with lots of volcanic land is coming up with lots of Puddles like this trying to learn how to become alive mostly it take a few successful protocells that happen to be able to survive and had learned how to make more of [Music] themselves so go ahead and get them into the um boxes do that [Music] is the universe made to make life this is a a huge question that sort of beyond the scope of perhaps humans to be able to answer but what we can observe is everything comes down to cycling it comes to rhythms and overlapping rhythms and patterns and it you get the right cycling and patterning in a system it learns how to do that itself and how to lift itself into being and so perhaps that metaphor that we know that the geology gave us that ability the moon going around the earth gave us Tides the rotation of the Earth gives us days and nights rainfall into these hydrothermal fields gives us geysers that are periodic and life still follows rhythmic [Music] patterns that perhaps it creates life [Music] most of us tend to think of things are either alive or [Music] dead but the transition from not alive the inanimate State the animate state is that transition only possible as a single step or is it possible as a series of steps if it steps then then the intermediate States would be partially alive now you might say well come on it would say well alive means it cells the cells are replicating the cells are doing this that and the other and you need all of that to be fully alive but the chance of getting that Allin one go seems a little bit remote so maybe we got one of the attributes early on and then it acquires another attribute and another and eventually it reaches the point where it is fully Alive professor John suvland is trying to retrace the steps in the origins of Life In Search of the processes that animate a cell into being of course the cell is more than just the chemicals that comprise it because a cell that the chemicals that are there so there something that energizes it that coordinates it and we don get that but that [Music] goal so what we the sample into an apparatus in which it will be irradiated by ultraviolet light in a series of experiments that simulated the conditions of a young rocky planet Sou souland successfully achieved stage one producing the basic components of a cell lipids proteins sugars and nucleic acids what we found is that you can make all of the components for life under slightly different conditions when you first see it happen it not as hard to make as we originally thought all the hardware of a cell can be created from a single base molecule that [Music] Stars but what about the next step how is that Hardware organized and energized into life if the conditions are the same elsewhere what are the chances that you can go from building blocks to life the chemistry of cells is unique in that it organized so one part of chemistry is actually controlling another and yet somehow that chemists are used to controlling the chemistry themselves and the idea of letting things run and go off of their own accord is something that goes slightly against your chemical education how can chemistry take place if you like with the experiment to just setting the system up and then letting it go of its own [Music] accord life is information that can reproduce itself not Hardware it genetic information that life is the information in the DNA and the ability of the DNA to express that information in proteins and propagate the information that way DNA is the blueprint for all of life on Earth an instruction book for how to make and maintain all living organisms encoded in the Twin coiling lines of a double helix is the genetic information that tells life to build a rose or a leopard or a blue [Music] whale if we find DNA on other worlds there there the characteristic molecules that life makes genetic molecules that contain information like DNA these molecules do not arise non-biologically they have to be built the shest as if we find a skyscraper on Mars we know that it was built and it assemblage of rocks that of life my Lander module prepares to Uplink the sample data from the hydrothermal [Music] field my Optical communication transmits via hybrid silicon laser at 12 gbits per second I receive the signal and ingest the data for analysis organic polymeric triple helic [Music] structure some consistency with terrestrial forms and yet unlike anything I before a biomolecule of alien [Music] life we outback of Australia looking for what we think is evidence for the oldest life on Earth astrobiologist Martin van crondon is traveling back in time to the dawn of life on Earth over 3 and A2 billion years ago conveniently recorded in the ancient rocks of Australia [Music] Northwest at this time in early Earth it was a very different planet to what we have today we would have had some shallow Seas but those Seas would have been green cuz they were rich in iron and if we looked up at the sky the sky wouldn blue that we see behind us here on early Earth without oxygen the sky would have been orange we would have seen black continents of fresh basaltic lava it would have been very active so there would have been faults and earthquakes there would have been bubbling geysers that were going off it was actually a very Alien Planet yet this alien Earth was already inhabited colonizing the shores of the Crater Lakes and the Seas that washed the ancient pilra land mass was a living skin of [Music] slime but but the bacterial communities that left the clearest fossil calling cart built up their homes in high-rise Mounds so the really wonderful thing about this outcrop is that you can look down and see the seaf floor so long ago and really you get this incredible view of the gentle undulations of the water moving across the surface but then popping up through are these domes and Cone shapes all irregular are different sizes different shapes these distinctive bumps are the fossilized dwellings of the oldest living organisms on Earth it was here over 3 and a half billion years ago that stratales first raised their heads above the water of an ancient Shore we can start to get a feel for Life grabbing a foothold in in the geological record and so this currently still is the oldest evidence for life on Earth it great great great grandmothers and grandfathers it precursor to everything that came later all the green bushes and the trees it all started here the prehistoric organisms that built stratales were so successful they ruled the Earth for up to 3 billion [Music] years life finds a way and somehow these crafty Architects found a way to organize water carbon molecules minerals and energy into a living [Music] cell is this what we should be looking for on alien [Music] [Music] worlds my drones survey the dried up Basin of an inland [Music] sea but what [Music] A Lone Survivor on the Arid plane zeroy succulent stem fican like pigment to absorb the Red Dwarf [Music] Sun a hybrid of terrestrial and Aquatic species [Music] around 500 million years ago long since stromatolites first took root in the shallows Earth animal [Music] life it was a very different world to the one that had made way for micro Gres with air to breathe now and a protective atmosphere under a gentler Sun we think microbial life is going to be very common that the conditions to produce microbial life happen over and over and over in many many different planets but that animal life is only going to be able to evolve and then stick around for any length of time when you have really stable conditions Professor Peter Ward is one of The Originators of the rare earth hypothesis the theory that the long-term habitability of Earth for animal life may be rare in the galaxy habitability is really the ability of a planet to have conditions that can allow life first to originate but secondly to stay alive habitable worlds can be just a short instant in time and then it changes and it gets nasty so what to us made Earth rare is the long-term habitability of the planet the fact that it has remained constant in temperature with the oxygen values we have that we don in climate that we that it my drones detect a disturbance in the

How Life Begins: The Miracle Unveiled | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EpSyHarIkU	SLICE Science	[Music] life begins to germinate from the first eye contact between a woman and a [Music] man it perceived image is transmitted to the frontal regions of the brain situated above the eyes where the sexual significance of the image is decoded the Corpus spongiosum of the penis then fills with blood but most of the time excitation is not followed by sexual intercourse the codal nucleus acts as an inhibitory block the brain also plays a role in the inhibition of sexual behavior monkeys temporal labotomy leads to sexual frenzy and in humans we know that the result would be the same without these inhibitory blocks there would be unrestrained sexual behavior known as hypersexuality our sexuality is in some way the outcome of a permanent conflict between two parts of our brains that battle for the control of our Behavior the Primitive animal brain that shelters the basic drives linked to the productive Instinct and a higher brain rational and influenced by education which regulates our social behavior if our brain decides that the sight of someone does US good then nerve cells stimulate the hypothalamus which transforms the nervous message into a hormonal message a cocktail of hormones is released their conductor the pituitary land orchestrates the ballet of the hormones these hormones diffuse a feeling of well-being and relaxation throughout the brain and the body via the circulatory system if the brains of a man and a woman are compared after receiving a visual stimulus more zones are activated in the male brain than in the female brain a finding that cannot be explained by differences in the brain architecture or education a men and women are primed to respond to these types of sexual cues now that doesn want to have sex because having sex is also dependent on how they feel psychologically and that is of course related to a number of different relationship and contextual factors [Music] so why do we fall in love with a particular person when an image hits the retina signals are then transmitted towards the back of the brain where we stalk information about our sensory [Music] past between the ages of 5 and 8 years we begin to build a map of Love A subconscious list of our Preferred Physical behavioral and cultural characteristics when we meet someone who corresponds with this map Sparks begin to [Applause] [Music] fly the emotion incited by The Voice the smile and the gestures of the partner provokes body signals that are more or less conscious and detectable glistening eyes pupil dilation lip swelling and endorphin is also secreted blood pressure increases and excessive sweating occurs as desire mounts in men the male hormone testosterone is transformed into a chemical substance called androsterone which is carried in sweat to the surface of the skin this substance is then devoured by tiny bacteria IA producing a more or less Pleasant [Music] odor these Vapors also contain odorless pheromones the pheromones are detected by our vomo nasal organ a little pouch situated in the nasal septum this primitive organ has no connection with our sense of smell it sends its signal directly to our primitive brain without passing through the higher brain so it could be that our subconscious perception of pheromones determines our choice of partner [Music] Beauty and [Music] hormona but what is the effect of kissing and caressing we have found that uh these sea fibers respond particularly well to a slow stroking of the skin and they do not respond uh so well or hardly at all to a rapid stroking of the skin perhaps we have underestimated the power or the importance of sensual touch for human wellbeing when a precise zone is stimulated certain nerve fibers react more than others the sea fibers stimulate the regions of the brain activated by emotion and sexual [Music] excitation stimulated in this way the brain begins to produce the hormone oxytocin often referred to as the cuddle [Music] hormone when we fall in love our bodies produce an amphetamine like hormone which provokes hyperactivity this explains how we capable of spending whole nights talking and making love to our [Music] sweethearts during foreplay the hypothalamus secretes neuro hormones that stimulate the pituitary gland which in turn liberates the hormones that stimulate the ovaries and testicles in a chain reaction the testicles and ovaries then releasee their own hormones the androgens and the estrogens under their influence blood flows into the Corpus cavum and spongiosum of the penis [Music] out of 500 million sperm only one can hope for victory when the ejaculate comes out into the vagina everybody thinks that the sperm swim immediately to the egg and fertilize it it doesn that at all when the ejaculate comes out into the vagina first of all it coagulates into a soft ball it takes time for enzymes to break this ball down and for sperm to be able to swim out of the ball into the pathway to the [Music] uterus only 1% of the sperm will cross the cervix after an exhausting 18 cm long race 1,000 ripples are necessary to cover just 1 cm [Music] to succeed in this Marathon the sperm have a secret their fagella are made up of strands surrounded by batteries the mitochondria which provide the energy for this major challenge that life that in April sh down in May each time I find my myself flat on my face I pick myself up and get back in the race that light I can myON the ovam is drawn into the fallopian tube moved Along by the tiny vibrating cyia like a fringe lining the tube then the ovam must wait a day or two for the marathon sperm to arrive [Music] if the sexual act takes place during ovulation a baby will result on average one time out of four as sperm still has to succeed in fertilizing the [Music] O the sperm perforate the no third challenge for the winner once inside the ovam becomes impenetrable to the other candidates the two nuclei male and female move together and fuse one contains the genes of the Father the other those of the mother you then have one chance in 64 billion of becoming the person that you are the newly formed diploid cell undergoes the first cellular Division and a new life begins [Music] the fertilized egg as it continues its migration will go through innumerable cellular divisions it divides into two cells and four 8 16 and it continues [Music] [Music] the embryologist Clare shazo studies the destiny of cells at first all the cells are identical and after several days they begin to differentiate the exterior cells begin to flatten and later they give rise to the placenta while the interior cells remain rounded and will give rise to all the different embryonic tissues such as the heart and the liver the cells communicate with each other about whether to remain as they are or to differentiate for example into heart or liver cells they talk through the means of thousands of receptors on the cell surface more than 10,000 receptors receive these different [Music] messages when the cell receives a signal it nucleus containing the chromosomes of the father and the mother synthesizes a very mobile messenger RNA which enables the cell to produce the materials based on this genetic information necessary for reproducing another cell [Music] [Music] why are the cells different each cell contains a computer the chromosomes and each computer has the same programs the genes the differences between cells are determined by which programs are turned on and which are turned off 5 days after fertilization the embryo has been sliding through the fallopian tube and enters the uterus at this stage the embryo consists of 100 or so [Music] cells the cells obtain their energy from the mitochondria that fill them the mitochondria are responsible for all our movements they are the cell stations to develop further the embryo must find its energy elsewhere thus it hatches out of its [Music] membrane 6 days after fertilization the embryo settles into the uterus wall through the use of enzymes this stimulates the production of a hormone that makes the pregnancy test positive [Music] a pregnant woman may experience the first symptoms as early as the eighth day after fertilization but why do women experience nausea and craving for certain foods plants contain chemicals that act act as toxic weapons against fungi and insects and we find these in high quantities in spices coffee in certain kinds of green vegetables and perhaps as an instinct and protective function for both the embryo and the mother this is the reason why pregnant women have aversions against these items now it chemicals are not found in bread or in pasta which may explain why women have uh cravings for these [Music] items we perception and your task is to tell which of these that appeal to you and which that do not 70% of pregnant women become more sensitive to tastes and odors two out of three women experience nausea with cooking smells cigarettes frying spices coffee and alcohol [Music] [Applause] [Music] Steven nordon has shown in particular that women who suffer from nausea have a lower risk of miscarriage nausea is most frequent between 5 and 15 weeks of gestation which corresponds to the period when the is especially [Music] fragile these oders will be either Pleasant or unpleasant and I want you that find them to be unpleasant to raise a hand [Music] over the months to come the body and the metabolism of the mother to be will change [Music] enormously a future mother is indeed a chemical Factory in 9 months she will produce as much estrogen and progesterone as she would in 150 years of life without pregnancy between the second and third weeks the future spinal cord and nervous system begins to form the embryo curls up on itself at the end of the third week the rudimentary heart begins to beat and has the special feature of being the only organ already indispensable for the embryo survival blood begins to [Music] circulate at the end of the first month of development the embryo measures 4 to 5 mm it floats in the amniotic [Music] fluid the upper part of this model represents the two halves of the embryo divide for a long time scientists had only these models made of layers of plaster for studying [Music] [Laughter] [Music] embryology since 1996 Professor Bradley Smith has has been working on the reconstitution of embryos with virtual images using MRI techniques the magnetic resonance scanner enables us to see below the skin and to witness the development of the brain the spinal cord and the vertial column [Music] [Music] [Applause] these images which provide a precise chronology of week by- week organ development constitute one of the researchers most valuable databases people have often asked me why I made this atlas of human embryos and as I think about it I realized that although topologists have done a wonderful job of mapping the Earth looking at it 1 centimeter at a time nobody mapping of the human embryo now with this Atlas uh we have these wonderful images that let us look into the human body at very early stages of development and see ourselves in ways that we never seen ourselves [Music] before at 6 weeks all the sensory organs begin to form the cells of the future eyes multiply by division and line up to form the long transparent fibers of the crystallin lens the eyes situated quite laterally and having no eyelids become increasingly visible because of their pigmentation [Music] the external earlobe already visible is completed towards 3 and 1/2 months the auditory cells organize themselves they will detect sound vibrations and transmit them via the auditory nerve to the brain the tongue gradually becomes covered with taste buds responsible for the sense of taste at the 8th week the embryo measures close to 3 cm it adopts a truly human appearance even if its fingers are still webbed and the end of of its body finishes in a tail [Music] this tiny little heart is beating at twice the rate of its mother the reason is because the embryo is growing so fast it in size and it requires huge amounts of energy and the only source of energy for this tiny embryo is from the mother bloodstream the heart is the first organ to develop completely it now has four chain and will grow bigger over the months to come the nerve cells isolated until now move around inside the brain to take up their precise positions the cells multiply at a rate of 250,000 per minute in just 1 hour the embryo have acquired 15 million new nerve cells the embryo activated there are nurse cells which react against any Intruder the embryo can be observed by endoscopy using an optical fiber 1 mm in diameter this technique is used for therapeutic indications under rigorous aseptic conditions it provides unique views of life within the womb the embryo development is astounding it grows 1 mm in length per day a fetus from the third trimester on will also increase in weight by 20 to 40 G per day and not only do these embryos and fetuses grow their organs which are present from the end of the embryonic period undergo transformation so that at each stage of the pregnancy the quality of the imagery and information gathered changes the embryo now has all its organs and will start to move very gently although its movements are not yet coordinated we are now at the 10th week of pregnancy the embryo becomes a fetus it has a human appearance floating in the amniotic fluid are numerous particles and its urine this aquatic medium is renewed every 6 hours [Music] the hands are now well formed the fetus rubbing by a substance called [Music] vermix at this stage girls and boys have the same undetermined genital [Music] tubercle the trans formation takes place at 12 weeks if it becomes the clitoris and the division in the genital folds deepens to form the labia in a boy the penis appears followed 2 weeks later by the penal head and the foreskin erections are known to occur the future sperm are already formed in the testicles while the ovary prepare their stocks of OVA 10 million which will decrease to 2 million at the moment of [Music] birth at 12 weeks it is still too early to determine the sex using ultrasound in a sitting position the fetus measures about 10 cm it is possible to observe it completely in its first amniotic [Music] bedroom so this looks great do you think we Ker everything for an ultrasound examination it first time they have to meet their baby face to face but ultrasound is difficult ult for a mother to understand so by taking ultrasound data we can make a sculpture and the mother can now hold her baby in her hand and relate to all of the developing Parts in a way that she can explain to her friends and her family and this helps her to bond better and in the future we think that this may be something that becomes a part of a routine ultrasound exam where you can meet your baby before it born I have a very nice surprise for you Jenny wow what what is that this is a sculpture of your embryo at 12 weeks we took the data from your 12we visit and we have a special machine that we send it to which is like an inkjet printer this is really I can hold my own baby in my hands and I think this makes me feel much more like I know my child before she this invention could one day revolutionize prenatal perception ultrasound information can be sent via the internet anywhere in the world so we could imagine a patient in South America or Australia sending their three-dimensional data to a specialized company that could make a fetal sculpture and that could be made very quickly and then sent back to them through the standard post [Applause] [Music] in the fourth month the limbs lengthen the fetus moves a great deal often punching its umbilical cord its first toy this is also a magic moment for mothers the first kicks [Music] [Applause] the red blood cells now form from stem cells in the bone marrow and ensure oxygen transport to the different tissues Under the Skin the adpost tissues containing fat cells appear these Brown fat cells transform fats into energy and maintain the baby at the right temperature smile you filmed between the 17th and 24th week a second ultrasound scan is carried out at this stage the baby discerned look he counting 1 2 3 just like his [Music] father at the fifth month while swallowing the amniotic fluid the fetus makes true facial expressions [Music] look he just made another funny Grimace you can certainly say it it corresponds to an expression of pain this is why 3D ultrasonography is so interesting it shows us all the fetal Expressions whether they be grimaces or smiles when shown images of such high quality some patients will look for family resemblances they grandfather uncle child they go through the whole family [Music] [Applause] tree I our photo albums before but look this photo is so real when you show me his nose like that has exactly the same nose as his [Music] [Applause] brother during the final month of the pregnancy the fetus stretches it finally forms a barrier to protect the body from the external environment the add cells stock more and more fat in just 3 months the fetus will gain the equivalent of 50% of its birth weight [Music] the fetus fattens its senses become more acute especially [Music] hearing here we have the baby tracing baby very regular so it the test now we put on these headphones so you can pick out the sounds we send to the baby on the tracing Professor grer def observes the changes in the fetus cardiac rhythm in reaction to the sounds you can see here when we send this piano Melody at 90 DB there nice little reaction of about 10 beats per the sound is quite loud like the sound of a truck all types of sound stimuli are tested from a conversation at 60 DB to a jackhammer at 100 DB the experiments have shown that at least 90 DB are necessary to provoke an initial fetal reaction the mother acts as a filter whatever their nationality voices are in audible except for that of the mother the laughter heard by the fetus is that of its mother a microphone is placed in the mother talking with friends only the voice and laughter of the mother are audible since they pass directly through the tissues here is music recorded using the same method through the [Music] womb hello baby it 3 the super fetus is in fact a myth it completely meaningless the fetus even to term hears like an elderly person in other words it there stimulations it doesn and during the critical phases of the development of the auditory system it could even be harmful for the ear development the ear recognizes the mother regularly in utero memorization takes place during sleep since the fetus spends 90% of its time sleep [Applause] [Music] sleeping the inner ear has two functions Hearing and Balance the latter function is what enables us to position ourselves in space this experiment has shown that the fetus reacts to large movements but not to its mother walking [Applause] [Music] we only these exceptional MRI images can provide us with a full view of the fetus most of its organs are already functioning the fetus has a brain that is only 25% of its adult size in fact the mother must provide energy to her own brain and is unable to devote more to the development of her baby [Music] I flavored sweets over the next two weeks of your pregnancy so that the aroma of aned will be transmitted to your fetus go ahead help yourself help yourself you can start eating them now the aim of this experiment led by Professor benal is to show that the fetus is able to perceive and memorize strong Aromas such as aniseed Curry and garlic in swallowing and inhaling amniotic fluid the fetus tastes what its mother has eaten we can State quite clear clearly that the baby shares its mother except that it doesn choice of menu so in fact the mother imposes her own preferences on the baby however the wider the range of maternal preferences and food choices the more we might expect that the child will develop a curiosity about new foods after birth but this remains to be demonstrated the 24 babies put on the anes diet in mudo show that they recognize the aroma and seek it out with pleasure after [Music] birth the experiment entails presenting them with the aned aroma on the right side of their faces and another stimulus on the left their reaction time is measured I see quite clearly that he is turning towards the anased pad that he makes more searching movements on the aned size within the amniotic fluid the baby savors a soup with 490 ingredients all with different smells and tastes po I do when the baby passes from its amniotic fluid bubble into air it takes with it this memory of prenatal smells and uses it after birth in its interactions with its mother to position itself against the maternal body and to accept to drink the maternal milk at full term when the fetus are finally ready to pass from water to air they secrete a great quantity of proteins called surfactant the fetus in regurgitating this chemical cocktail activates the maternal macrofagos a type of white blood cell in the amnionic fluid these macrofagos penetrate the uterine wall creating an inflammation which provokes the first contractions basically the timing of birth is decided by the fetus so maturity of the lungs at the time of birth is essential for the fetus to make the transition from an aquatic to an air breathing environment during development and late in development the fetal lungs begin to make surfactant which is a fatty substance that enables the little air sacs in the lung to remain expanded and prevents them from collapsing occasionally the baby is in no hurry to see the outside world in Professor melon has a good reason in particular immature lungs uterine contractions always correspond with a big increase in proteins from the fetus [Music] lungs with the first cry the baby respiratory system is activated and this is followed by a shunting of blood toward the lungs so that increased amounts of oxygenated blood can be carried to all tissues of the body in the following hours the digestive system is activated the acidity of the stomach and the secretions delivered by the liver and the pancreas break down the large food proteins into smaller molecules that the intestine is able to absorb with the arrival of the first germs the intestinal Flora proliferate gradually the kidneys become more efficient a few days later the immune system emerges the lymphocytes Patrol the blood vessels and eliminate harmful bacteria [Music] after just a few weeks the baby already has Visual and ol Factory preferences the baby is quite naturally attracted by the odor of milk and of its mother but also by the smell of its father it is said that the family has an signature the signature is also present in the mother and father who are able to recognize the specific odor of their [Music] [Music] offspring however babies are also endowed with a sort of sense of beauty as the experiment conducted by Dr Alan Slater shows we baby pictures of faces and see if they prefer to look at some rather than others the principle is to show photos of faces considered beautiful or ugly according to adult criteria to 100 or so babies Jackie change the pictures newborn babies even when they particularly attracted to faces and particularly to to attractive faces because attractive faces most closely approximate the proportions of the golden section that we know that babies and adults find [Music] attractive the golden section is a ratio or a set of proportions that dates back to ancient Greek times that acts as an aesthetic marker for judging the beauty and pleasingness of various objects because it represents Symmetry and Harmony and perfect proportions between the features of of [Music] objects all the neurons are already present although they are not yet connected the baby is still capable of making choices according to its preferences older inference or children between the ages of 4 to six are developing a map of love which is culturally determined this develops uh initially from the sensors of the newborn infant the newborn is born with all censors intact and able to make preferences or preferential judgments through all of its sentory modalities and even um aesthetic judgments in terms of face perception [Music] little baby look at the color of his little baby [Music]	Success
The Space Debris Crisis: Time to Clean Up! | SLICE SCIENCE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgtxzC2iRf0	SLICE Science	[Music] near [Music] Java it seems that sometimes the sky really does fall down since orbital debris poses a threat to the Earth cataloged the risk evaluated currently we estimate that there are about 36,000 objects orbiting the Earth we can add the 30,000 Oro objects that have already fallen back to Earth and they will stay there for some time since all rocket launchers including military operations are monitored it is relatively easy to know what is circling above our heads all the artificial objects in space satellites and debris orbiting above our heads represents a mass of around 9,000 tons to give you an idea the Eiffel Tower is 7,500 tons so a bit more than [Music] that in the vast area that is space an Eiffel Towers worth of small scattered pieces is more like a cloud of dust so in order to show a representation of the Dey we need to enlarge them in real life the pieces are considerably smaller the suburbs of our planet contain a mixture of working satellite surrounded by circulating [Music] waste but the suburbs are nonetheless organized satellites around our Earth use three different [Music] orbits furthest from the earth is geostationary orbit a thin layer 22,000 Mi [Music] away satellites in this orbit remain constantly above the same point on the equator and provide our telecommunications telephone and Computer Link and television [Music] broadcasts each satellite is spaced an average of 40 m [Music] apart with space at a premium satellites need to be removed when they have served their time their last fuel reserves are used to deorbit them to another [Music] area here the satellite is moved higher to a graveyard orbit further from Earth where it will not interfere with anything medium earth orbit situated between 1,2 22,000 m in altitude is avoided this vast zone is occupied By Radio navigation satellites like Galileo if one of these satellites breaks down it is placed into an intermediate orbit where it will not interfere with any others but if it runs out of fuel nothing can be done finally the closest orbit to earth is known as low earth orbit and is situated below 1,200 mi in altitude this is where the last 60 years of space exploration has left the most debris and the only way of getting rid of debris in this area is to send it into Earth [Music] disintegrates there are different areas on Earth where objects can re-enter with almost no risk because they are far from populations for example there is an area in the South Pacific which is very very big and where we tend to re-enter large objects if the satellite still has fuel it is possible to control its movements in low medium and geostationary orbits as long as it is still functioning that some satellites can hurtle out of control even if they still have fuel the problem one of the problems we have with satellites is that from time to time they break down and we don they worked on Monday Tuesday Wednesday and on Thursday bam broken and we no warning there anything was wrong satellite operators are loath to talk about malfunctions for fear of losing credibility yet most failures are caused by Nature interfering with safety measures when we analyze the cause of these malfunctions it can for example be a result of a solar [Music] flare during solar storms our sun releases huge amounts of energy that disperses electrically charged particles into space Earth as a shield Shield protecting us from particles visible during the northern [Music] lights but satellites are like sitting ducks solar radiation is capable of wiping out navigation systems and despite being protected with high-tech gold foil it is estimated that a dozen or so satellites are destroyed each year by solar flares turning them into orbital [Music] debris space is an infinite empty space with some junk moving around above our heads and these objects pose two problems first when they are in orbit they example an object at an altitude of 6 miles will stay there for a thousand or 2,000 years secondly during the course of these thousand or 2,000 years they are moving at speeds of 18,000 mph 18,000 mph for a, years is a lot so the probability of crashing into something during that time is very high until 2007 experts tracked around 12,000 large pieces of junk but since then three major events have caused the situation to degenerate the most serious involved Cosmos 2251 a Russian satellite in low earth orbit that suddenly stopped working the Russians could no longer communicate with it and were unable to deorbit it to Earth in a perpendicular trajectory at the same altitude a brand new American satellite called iridium 33 was in orbit [Music] the impact sent Dey flying in all [Music] directions around 2 and 1/2 th000 pieces larger than 3 in and many other smaller fragments were rejected Ed into space posing a threat to all the devices in low earth orbit this Collision proves that an out ofcontrol object in low orbit is a danger to all working satellites another event worthy of Star Wars took place when China decided to deliberately destroy a weather satellite that was no longer in use using a ballist itic missile armed with an infrared seeker and a [Music] warhead it was an arrogant show of strength by Chinese authorities with no concern for the consequences on the 15th of November 2021 the Russians returned fire with a Nall [Music] missile it satellite called Cosmos [Music] 1408 the resulting explosion scattered 1500 pieces of large debris into low orbit in all directions these events were arrogant shows of strength by Major Powers with no concern for the consequences everybody the events caused by the Chinese and Russian governments destroying a satellite on purpose we all now know that these types of events are the greatest source of a risk of collision to our satellites in space as a result there are now more than a million pieces of Dey larger than half an inch circling the earth and some of these pieces come not from satellites but from rockets in the fuel tank of a normal rocket that takes satellites into orbits you have one chamber with liquid oxygen and another with liquid nitrogen and I sure you remember from school that when these two gases mix it becomes nitrous oxide and it explodes and that what happens again and again in space not all the fuel is used to the last drop this Reserve fuel mixes and instead of having an intact upper level you have a thousand pieces of debris which remain in orbit like a pandemic this junk proliferates and risks creating even more debris this phenomenon is known as Kesler syndrome in honor of the NASA consultant who described analyzed and Quantified it we currently have enough objects in Earth orbit once every 10 years we expect two objects to run together and create a a major breakup Don Kesler proposed the scenario back in 1978 since then it has been proven multiple times like the cosmos idium Collision back in 2009 about every 5 years we expect collisions between some large object and a large fragment to also produce some debris Don Kesler also predicted that the collisions would have a cascading effect where each Collision increases the light likelihood of further collisions the issue becomes when this happens an object can come in and hit the satellite and produce a spray of particles that are very numerous in number for the smallest particles that those can go on and because they traveling so fast can damage spacecraft then you also produce about a 100 big enough fragments that will go on and hit another satellite in the same way and break that satellite up and so you have the slow cascading phenomena going [Music] on this theory was proven accurate in 1996 when Dey from an Aran rocket launched 10 years before crossed paths with a French military satellite called serice knocking out a 10t stabilization boom and causing C Le to Tumble out of control this incident is just one example of such a chain reaction in space nonfunctioning satellites and Rocket leftovers have created clouds of debris traveling around the world at 18,000 mph hitting working satellites and creating even more [Music] Dey this proliferation could endanger a huge range of activities on Earth it satellites are a major part of our daily [Music] lives we all expect to open our mobile phone and look for a place where we want to go and find the directions to get there we use satellite positioning technology in the same way when we go on a trip we withdraw money at an ATM in America and we obtain that money thanks to satellite telecommunications that connect with our bank in Europe it smartphones bank cards or GPS systems nowadays we wouldn without satellites yet the proliferation of debris risks compromising today is constantly diversifying satellite services so all space agenes have to take Serious risks each time they launch including the European Space Agency if we are waiting for a situation where our uncertainty volume is completely empty that would mean we could never launch so believe it or not we are launching despite of the possibility of having conjunctions with objects because otherwise uh there would never be a green light for launch the risk is now proven and even Quantified the odds of losing a satellite are 5% part of it is the risk of being hit by debris the other parts are simple there can break causing the satellite to be lost but the likelihood of losing a satellite can quickly reach 10 or 20% with the increase in orbital debris [Music]	Success
From Birth to Adolescence: The Incredible Human Journey | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0I4o2Epw_s	SLICE Science	[Music] what for the first time we invite you on a voyage through our bodies as babies Children and adolescents you will discover that a newborn has already developed numerous senses and functions in its mother womb smell hearing touch and walking we know today that babies rehearse facial expressions in utero and once they sleep because to communicate draw attention and even seduce someone they are as essential for babies as they are for us and the study of facial expressions and seduction is one of my specialities a few days after birth babies are already capable of imitating the facial movements of their mothers and other human beings looking at them it works eh it works with the tongue it works with the O but it works best when it but how do newborns see faces they see them out of focus they see the main traits the outline of faces and the hairline despite their imperfect Vision they look for our happy expressions and smiles this is one of the first functions that Delight [Music] parents more surprisingly newborns are capable of fixing their gaze for a few seconds even if it this is nevertheless the ability that scientists use in their tests to measure the duration of [Music] observation we have thus leared that babies fix on non-human faces much less than human [Music] faces scientists have even demonstrated that newborns prefer specific human movements babies prefer looking at things that are moving and most especially when that movement is so-called biological in other words any movement produced by a living being so we experiments the babies prefer watching the biological movement of a human walking rather than a movement produced in an artificial [Music] Manner and this has been confirmed for the hundred or so babies tested on the other hand newborns are not interested by things that don example a blinking light arouses little interest the live element such as grimaces and expressions is necessary to maintain the baby [Music] attention baby is now 4 months old at this age your baby can already tell the difference between my joyful expression of my neutral face but we must wait until baby is 7 months old before he can also recognize sadness he is now able to fix his Gaze on this new expression it will therefore take him some time to understand and assimilate all our facial expressions even though he started to smile and Grimace in [Music] uum but what about the baby abilities two plus two 38 + 6 equals 44 so some of the early abilities that infants have are um ideas about number number concept they know the difference uh between when you have one object and you add another object they they know that there should be two objects there and that if you know 1+ 1 equal 1 they would look significantly longer at that event compared to 1 plus 1 equal 2 and they do that as early as 5 months of [Music] age hi demonstration the baby sees two toys we take one away and yet there are still two remaining baby is surprised but how can we really be sure one of the things that infants is that they can they thing they have good control over are their eyes they tend to look at things they find interesting and when they get bored they look away another measure that we use is Optical Imaging we place uh optodes on various parts of their skull and we can track functional blood flow changes going on uh based on what they what they different patterns of blood flow in their brain and we can measure that with Optical Imaging the baby fused but its brain is highly vascular so every change in blood flow can easily be recorded and [Music] analyzed the abilities observed by scientists and babies do not however make them super Geniuses my little boy already been admitted to the halfred kindergarten that should get him straight into the bism boarding school so he can study diplomacy in oron well we Fencing Club which is the real secret of getting into Lun deur mine and he Greek Aramaic Judo town planning Information Technology [Music] stand I doubt that babies think about philosophy however babies acquire a knowledge at a very rapid rate in the first year of Life some of the things that they know are that an unsupported object should fall down so they developing a lot of detailed knowledge through interacting with the environment they of information even in uh just by watching so now she stage [Music] and baby is surprised to see that the blue substance is not dripping baby can already differentiate between solids and liquids this is Hannah we on her if you could get her out of her seat hello sweetheart look at this fun hat isn at this now you have to just look up a little bit thank you and we this to come around I this in front Sue has already demonstrated that at a very early age babies are capable of sorting between different categories of images projected on a screen here the baby remarks that this dinosaur is not a member of the same family as the fish the analysis of the stimuli in baby knowing the categories of animals baby is already able to classify any fish shape in the fish group baby may not have been counting in utro but she did already perfect her sense of taste and smell there indeed some of her future preferences are influenced by her mother pregnancy the fetus inspires and expires amniotic fluid Aromas are thus transferred from the mother to the fetus one question we might ask ourselves is whether eating a certain food during pregnancy will make the child like that food more or not is it because I eat fish during my pregnancy that my child will like fish more um at first sight this seems to work well this type of thing since our preliminary results go in this direction on the other hand eating fish during breastfeeding doesn have a positive effect on the acceptability of this food during weaning of the young child in fact if there there is one odor that is universally accepted by children that would be the odor of the mother breast and breast milk okay look here Liam I put a pretty bib on you and we to play the smelling game I give you some little smells look in this bottle little food smells well I couldn finding strawberries in winter is not that easy look here shall we smell it now here we have the third bottle can I have it back thanks I get the impression you like this one a lot okay now here bottle look I your nose can you smell it you can have it now you can do what you like with [Music] it it has been observed that the children who are the most difficult as far as eating behavior is concerned are generally those who are the most sensitive to food odors so if they are difficult Perhaps it is for a reason they are perhaps more sensitive to certain odors you do like Mommy taste and so this would explain the fact that they are um fussier about their food more selective the fact that they can pick out certain foods on their plates or reject for example new foods that are presented to them because of this pronounced sensitivity to the odors of the different food components between zero and 18 months conflicts are expressed through food swallowed or refused this is the oral stage pleasure is associated with food and all that accompanies it [Music] [Applause] [Music] after swimming about in mother flavored amniotic fluid baby also seeks [Music] contact he touches his face with his hand puts his thumb in his mouth and bangs the wall of the uterus with his hands and feet the first massage happens when the mother will kick and move around and the mother instinctively will start massaging her stomach so that she can calm the baby down and communicate with the [Applause] baby very often the mothers forget that this is something that is going to calm their baby that to massage the baby to continue massaging the baby is a very good thing we infant massage today because it critically important that you touch your baby every day in in a way like in Fit massage because babies have been known to not survive if they don [Music] touch very nice okay and you the head very good try to get a little more pressure Don be like this we know that moderate pressure is key to the massage when mothers touch their babies lots of things happen under the skin the vagal activity increases which is one of the nerves in the central nervous system the stress hormones go down heart rate goes down and growth hormone increases Dr Tiffany field works hard to spread the word about the benefits of touching especially in premature babies preacher memphs who received massage show lots of benefits they gain more weight their bone growth is better they get discharged from the hospital sooner and over the first year of Life their mental and their cognitive and their motor development is better we children and how much they get touched in Paris and children and how much they get touched in Miami and children in Paris are much more frequently touched than children in Miami children in Paris are not as aggressive so we think there connection between not getting enough touch and becoming very aggressive in the in the US we have a big tab Mo against touch to encourage physical contact and touching parents are now being taught in the USA as in Europe how to massage and dance with their babies long before they attempt to take their first [Music] steps Mar [Music] H well contrary to General belief walking does not appear so late in humans in fact it the fetus is already biologically prepared for walking it takes alternate steps with very good coordination between its arms and legs and this Walking is Still present at birth we know that because it has long been considered a reflex that disappears around the age of 2 to 3 months it has now been demonstrated in numerous studies that this is not so babies from birth never stop walking if you put babies in water they are quite capable of taking steps because in this situation their body weight is [Music] supported we have also shown that if we plunge three-day old newborns into virtual reality with little virtual treadmills below their feet giving them the illusion that they this triggers a walking gate with alternating steps to facilitate its walking movements baby is supported vigorously by the arms one of the difficulties is equipping it with these little gray balls markers installed on key points of the [Music] joints okay VOA now we see your knee using several cameras the markers are detected it is now up to baby no longer hindered by its weight to walk it magnificent this is not so easy for the uninitiated to see nevertheless stimulated by the virtual treadmill this 3-month-old baby makes walking movements as the cameras are C hey ho off we go well almost what does this mean it means that this walking basically is biologically prepared to adapt to any environment in which humans might find themselves it survival [Music] crawling is generally very common between 4 and 12 months scientists have shown that crawling enables the development of lateral vision and therefore of spatial awareness and so baby becomes aware of the Void the cliff experiment demonstrates that this child who has been crawling for several months is afraid of the hole avoiding the void is not an innate reflex contrary to what has been believed for many years but some children for reasons as yet unexplained will not crawl the child considered basically like a second birth it umbilical cord by itself this time to be able to explore distant places where until now it has not been able to go in an independent manner it is going to be able to reach objects that were until now forbidden it will be able to communicate verbally with its mother at a distance and this is truly a revolution reolution however this revolution will take place gradually through learning as shown by these movements captured by computer the child must Master separating its legs and it must above all learn to place its foot properly not flat but raising the heel as older children do [Music] as with walking babies start learning language inside their mother womb listen it heard by the baby in uo in fact the baby already begins to work on its mother that at Birth not only does it recognize its own mother capable of recognizing its mother tongue compared with a foreign language even when spoken by unknown individuals but these are not the only talents baby has up to the age of 6 months baby is a universal listener which means it is able to distinguish all sounds in all languages very good I experiment in Tamil the scientist has conditioned the baby to associate each new sound with the lighting up of a fluffy toy by turning towards the panda just before it lights up baby confirms that it has heard a difference an assistant then recaptures the baby attention before the next test in taml there are two types of L the law and the law and we French speakers can all well when we test very young children of around 6 months of age we can observe that no matter what their mother tongue is they able to hear all these distinctions take the test and try to hear the [Music] difference difficult isn it little by little during the first year of life babies specialize in the sounds of their mother tongue and this specialization is extremely useful because it means that they will be able to recognize the sounds of their mother tongue as quickly as possible and therefore they will stop hearing the distinctions that don own language babies have a predisposition for hearing the sounds but how do they learn the difficult structure of the [Applause] [Music] [Applause] language recent Studies have shown that from the age of 3 months a baby is capable of detecting the repetitions of words Rock a by baby on the Treet top when the wind blows the cradle will [Music] rock by observing the zones of the baby been possible to demonstrate that the little person is capable of breaking up the flow of sounds received and isolating words from it using cerebral Imaging techniques it has been possible to observe that the same zones are activated in 3-month old babies as an adults listening to the language and what same zones we see for sign language in the morning the morning baby wakes up oh he want he wants to eat these children can all hear but are too young to talk nevertheless with their parents they are learning a language that is once again in fashion sign language oh more oh he asked for more oh but children love to say more these are the signs that come up the most often more either for food or after a song that they enjoyed so we have the cake the cake chocolate sometimes a little bit later chocolate and then poo poo this new method helps parents to understand their children better in day-to-day life to avoid frustrations at a time when the child is able to pronounce only a few words okay he stopped sleepy by yes you learning a spoken language begin to babble by pronouncing syllables children learning sign language begin to babble with their hands from 18 months on we see the first phases in sign language as in spoken language and in fact it is quite possible for a child to grow up bilingual in sign and spoken language just as it is possible for a child to grow up bilingual in two spoken languages here for example with this child who obviously wants something she can makes the signs for cheese more and she able able she her wish change my nappy change my nappy I went pee PE I went poo poo change my nappy change my nappy I went poo poo I went too bad me I stct off to bed on time meals on time and here but now I explain to them the anal stage con stitutes an important structuring element in a child around the second or third year and it a time where the child discovers that with his stools he has a certain means of relations with the exterior he takes careful note that when he keeps it it not the same thing as when he offers it Jonathan finished and so a relationship is established between mother and child with by means of the Bal motion it gift offered to the mother or it gift that the child refuses to give her by retaining his stools it the end of establishing communication a mother suffers if her child can problem a real problem because first of all it and secondly because with respect to the outside world it because it shows that the child is not developing as it should it doesn conform to some sort of social Norm when often all the is need as a little more time Dr Pamela dalson has shown that from infancy our reactions to bad smells are conditioned by Society indeed when we are babies we pay no attention to the bad odors emanating from our nappies but little by little we imitate our parents who tell us yuck that smells bad for these experiments she has synthesized the odor of feces which she asks children of different ages to smell children probably learn a great deal about what is good and bad from their parents or the people around them but we know that by the age of three they start to look very much like their parents in terms of deciding what good odor imitation is a means of learning but it preferred by young children to demonstrate this Dr jacqualine Nal has carried out a filmed experiment in which she places different objects two of each in a room the children imitating each other in turn communicate without speaking there very rapidly one touches the same object as the other establishing a sort of toing and throwing between who is in charge who takes the initiative and who follows it follow closely to realize that in fact the children are taking turns to speak I it [Music] quiet imitation is a form of communication that precedes language it language becomes properly integrated in the [Music] child pleasantly discreetly they give the other child the possibility of being in the same situation this is a rare occasion for children to bring about an almost perfect synchronization like lovers of their actions and experiences of how they perceive their experiences wait wait wait wait the little girl is desperately looking for a way to be synchronized with her partner sh [Music] we have tried for a long time to identify the period in which the child becomes conscious of its identity using language the moment when the child says that of questioning the child without language was found the mirror test will the child understand that it has a lipstick mark on his [Music] face so here we can distinguish three phases the phase when the child Taps on the mirror and establishes an equivalence of sorts between its movements and its perception and then a phase when the child is disturbed by the mirror and obviously we can tell ourselves that doubts are starting to be instilled I front of me it looks like me Etc and then there is a third phase which is a test phase where the child will make movements before the mirror and make sure that the movements he sees are the same and consequently there is a synchronization that enables the child to determine that it really is [Music] him oh he boy now the child is aged between 16 and 24 months he knows that the face he sees is his own he touches the mark on his cheek and not on the [Music] mirror this is self-recognition which enables the later development of self-awareness and awareness of others however the child is already capable of empathy in other words feeling what others [Music] feel in this experiment filmed by Dr bishof ker a child plays with an adult who complains about her broken teddy bear her expression is unmistakable the child doesn to [Music] do then he looks to his mother but she does not react so he picks up this toy monkey and presents it as a substitute for the broken teddy bear then he looks at her as if to ask are you happy now this is the period when awareness of self and others develops where the reasoning process is active where stories are imagined the frontal areas of the cereal cortex make more and more connections with the rest of the brain this is the passage from infancy to Childhood with the development of the frontal cortex the child is quite ready to begin learning at school but emotions and social feelings are also developing in particular children show their attachments through friendship and very often by Declarations of [Music] Love do you have lots of friends tell me okay do you have lots of girlfriends or boyfriends yeah he ala just over there and you this is your girlfriend no oh really do you have one or not I like playing with the boys better that explanation what well yes he has to get married one day of course he has to get married one day tell me she sir do you have another and you yes you told me you had three boyfriends yes okay is there one you like best yes who is it Paul because he me and he then no sometimes with Luca n with Lucas too the boyfriends and girlfriends are the members of the opposite sex with whom the child plays and with whom a close relationship has thus developed this is the age when the girls sleep over at their friends houses and the boys are very attached to one another this is not a question of sexual attraction but a preference for a partner of the same sex an attraction For Those whom we resemble it is founded on the behavioral differences that exist between boys and girls when we look at children and we look at their behavior how they respond to frustration what toys they play with we see first that from the very beginning girls and boys differ in their behavior but how much is due to education to cultural conditioning and how much is biological to gain a better understanding Professor Michael Lewis has observed more than 200 children girls and boys and recorded the differences in their behavior in his tests Michael Lewis conceals himself behind a two-way mirror the child is separated from its mother by a [Music] barrier there against the barrier he over it he wants to push it down this is very typical of the boys in order to solve the problem you can see she is uh upset uh she cries uh doesn barrier this is very typical uh of uh girl children uh they ask for help they don look at boys and girls being frustrated we say that for boys they try to overcome the frustration by themselves but are these differences due to hormones which are visualized here using the crystallization technique testosterone in blue estrogen and oxytocin in pink there are two reasons and probably both are correct the first is about biological reason the second is a cultural reason it is probably the combination of both oxytocin is one hormone that we know of and we know it is related to maternal Behavior Uh to be nurturant uh we know that uh uh girls uh have more oxytocin uh than boys this difference uh may explain some of the uh differences between boys and girls shut up and sleep with me c why don sleep but above all there is the influence of education and the older the children get the more the differences are accentuated the principle of this test is to put a boy and a girl in a situation of failure using a puzzle that is impossible to finish time is up you did not finish before the Bell well I almost got it time is up you did not finish before the Bell you did not finish before the Bell when girls and boys uh fail in a task girls show more shame than boys boys do not accept blame for failure girls do time Bell he did not finish before the Bell despite the very biological Viewpoint of these researchers we must not neglect cultural influences on emotional expression and boys and girls in traditional Western societies we expect girls to express Joy anxiety modesty and shame as for boys they must not cry and are encouraged to show that they are dominating and more than 50 years ago separate classes for boys and girls were abolished the great majority of schools are mixed however over the past few years Single Sex schools have made a comeback in the United States according to Dr Kathy pichura cure Single Sex schools pay more attention to the different biological Tendencies of the two Sexes when you look at the boys you notice that they don traditional fashion we boys with the feet up feet swinging sitting in the chair they tends to be a lot more movement in the boys classroom so we actually planned for the movement and the girls classroom is much more of a traditional classroom that you would see true okay and it see as much movement in here not saying that they don not as much you are is it every oh my goodness we teachers definitely have to teach differently to an all boys classroom or an all girls classroom the boys teacher in particular boys teachers have to plan for movement if they don movement the boys are going to move anyway but girls teachers have to um plan for risk-taking they have to bring the girls out of their comfort zone and make them take academic and personal risks um which you normally wouldn in a classroom it use maps with the boys because of the part of the brain that they use they have good spcial relationship boys like using maps that makes them more interested when we look at biological differences the eyes are one of the most important ones because boys eyes are wired for movement so when even at age four months you know this isn construct they mobile where a young girls or baby girls will study the face girls are able able to read faces they expressions are and boys are able to track movement much better boys seem to be more skilled in spatial representation and numbers whereas girls are better at conversation and written expression according to neurologist Katherine Vidal the explanation is not biological but educational to explain these differences in aptitude is to show to what extent the educational cont differs between boys and girls in our society indeed little boys are more often pushed into outdoor team games such as football and here is the ideal situation for learning spatial orientation on the other hand girls are more in the private sphere in the home and this is a situation that favors language development for chatting and exchanging feelings a few years ago statistical studies showed that on average boys perform better in certain mathematical tests than girls in other words girls did not have the type of brain that made them capable of doing math at present new studies have been carried out and they show that from kindergarten to high school differences between boys and girls no longer [Music] exist in Europe Single Sex classes are decried by the scientific Community Michael Lewis however has a very personal argument there are many women who suggest that it is bad for the girls and that separate schooling they will pay less attention uh to boys uh and so will do better in school when hormones of boys and girls rise they are going to think about each other whether they are separate or together some of you here have boyfriends or girlfriends is it true not true it true I heard it who is it well it secret you need you need someone to confide in but at the same time you don what will happen afterwards well in fact there someone who is in love with someone in the class but they don it I want to say I but in fact my heart say it it secet and when he has his friends with him well the girl knows now he with her and he goes uh I didn anything to you in fact he doesn to admit it to his friends you have friends boys or girls whom you adore b a boyfriend the girlfriend that something else why is it something else what different my best friend uh I think he nice but I don looking King I look at them all the time in class too four I was like that all the time in fact I often want to look at him but I try not to show it and I feel my heart like beating and each time I see him I find him really attractive and I give him a sign to say hi and then afterwards I feel my heart bo bo go boom boom boom is that right the feeling of being in love is now well defined in both sexes even if girls think more about the objects of their affection than boys the seeking of heterosexual contact reinforced by cultural models is very common at this age it to attract the attention of boys so the girls going hello hi hello and the boys were alone it very often the girl makes lots of signs and looks like this you like this go yeah not bad but well the boys uh and the boys they see nothing you know [Applause] that I [Music] stuck it first kiss is given and received a spontaneous act tender and sensual yet tainted with embarrassment lips touch tongues seek each other and enter into action the heart rate then increases from 70 to 150 beats per minute knowing how to kiss well is one of the many concerns of teenagers who little by little discover their changing bodies in boys puberty begins around 12 to 13 years of age the Rhythm and extent of the physical Transformations are partly determined by genetics and therefore vary from one teenager to another and there it swells up in fact do you understand why the boy penis fills up with blood and gets hard then it sticks up it erection boy [Music] erection young boys have erections often accompanied by weak ejaculations that can occur during sleep under the influence of testosterone the testicles double in size in girls puberty starts around 10 to 11 years of age the action of estrogen causes a considerable increase in the size of the clitoris and L the menstrual cycle is activated by hormones the pubic area and armpits become covered with hair come on let do the go yes no no no just do it together let together there RI things there and there put this on her no no no no no it doesn there yes it does it there oh he caveman or what I a bit much go on close it okay now now during this great hormonal upheaval the bones lengthen the muscles and organs develop an adolescent will grow from 23 to 26 cm in height one of the Hallmarks of puberty is the increased secretion of hormones like estrogen and testosterone this is our first outward sign that puberty onset has occurred and in both girls and boys uh estrogen in girls testosterone and boys will increase 10 to 20 times compared to the prepuberal levels of hormone the circulatory system that physiological Road network is responsible for Distributing hormones throughout the body okay Sarah and Joanna I why don and we fat hello hi Sarah have a seat cheral cisk studies twins to determine the influence of genetics on hormone release at the time of puberty she and her colleague Kelly Clump have followed almost 200 Twins and discovered that entering into puberty too early can have negative consequences well we know that people who go through puberty earlier than others have different experience uh than someone who goes through uh puberty later and that this different experience can affect their psychological development so for example early puberty is associated with higher incidents of Eating Disorders It higher incidents of depression from saliva samples variations in hormone levels can be observed I think it to remember that pubertal hormones change the way we look and the minute that we look differently then our friends treat us differently our parents treat us differently our teachers treat us differently and therefore our experience is different oh my God going one of the first psychological problems linked to the physical transformation often concerns the voice so how old are you Matthew I so why have you come to see me today tell me about it well I feel my voice is going crazy one minut it voice the next it does that bother you well I have a boy do you think I Taekwondo it well you have to shout to affirm yourself as a man right yeah that Abbott ball is often consulted for breaking voices very good in The Trebles and in the bases so here these are the vocal cords of a child Matthew they your vocal cords and this one has already received hormones the hormones of puberty this one not yet and that why your voice is not deepened completely and it becoming an adult [Music] voice in boys developing into men what do the male hormones do they build up the vocal cord muscles for the vocal cord is a muscle like the biceps they thicken and become extremely strong and then associated with this is the Adams Apple in girls this is something extraordinary at the time of puberty she will start to have periods well the mucosa of the vocal cords also has a cycle practically the same as the mucosa of the cervix and why because hormones have a cyclical impact in a girl as soon as she becomes a woman and this continues throughout her life for 30% of women risk being a bit horse one week before their periods problems that disappear very quickly once their Cycles become regular the voice of puberty gives itself away on the telephone hello sweetheart it me what are you doing this afternoon hello uh yeah who I see more and more people who say to me I deep for boys and very high for girls because in this era of communication The Voice is not only a means of communication with others but a means of identity even the skin is affected by these hormonal attacks hi do you live with your parents you come here often this spot magnified 1,000 times is filled with acne bacteria that proliferate massively in adolescence hormones trigger the production of a fatty substance sebum which blocks the pores of the skin 90% of adolescents are affected acne is above all a condition of adolescence the period of life when you create your self-image and we must remember that we live in a society that is a society of communication where appearances play an important role and we must have a perfect appearance in this context acne is perceived even more negatively by the young person and has an even greater psychological impact what did you do to your face you you advise me to wash my face for my acne with this cream this cream here like this to address these teenage troubles dermatolog Bridget Dro has set up a workshop giving advice on makeup for acne sufferers we all these lesions that are embarrassing you as we discussed in the consultation the red spots and the scars afterwards when you go for a walk in town no one will see the difference and then you will make yourself up to see if you having any difficulties and we answer any questions you have and here we can see any red spots at all on this side and on the other side the scars have disappeared unfortunately it is essentially older teenagers who attend these train sessions so here are the photos before the makeup and just after oh yeah there difference a recent study of 12 to 15-year-olds shows that 64% of teenagers with moderate acne are sad and that 59% with severe acne feel aggressive so I have 15 lesions on the forehead there I mustn refus to accept it because he had a healthy lifestyle washed his face as he should we followed all the treatments but you get to a point where you can something you can think that you is a disease and the earlier you treat it the better your chances of preventing scarring but it your son is the proof that it difficult to treat how does this acne make you feel for starting the treatment how does it affect your daily life well I often see kids around 10 staring at me with white eyes mhm it always feels a bit strange so you really had enough of it yeah after two years it like us to find me to find a solution a solution Dr Bridget dreno takes part in an anonymous telephone help line to overturn a certain number of false beliefs about the causes of acne such as the sun or Diet so that disturbs you with respect to your environment that disturbs you there are no demonstrated links with diet in other words you can eat what you want as long as you don Foods too often as far as any links between acne and sexual activity are concerned quite clearly nothing has been demonstrated so it sexually active as you want and there no link with masturbation either [Music] so some people say that if you masturbate you blind you teenagers learn that through masturbation they will have healthier sexuality and they lover Dr Karen rain is a sex education teacher for teenagers it is true that the concept of the profession has changed greatly since the sex information films targeting teenagers in the 1950s [Music] today we will talk about the transformation of sexual anatomy from early adolescence and masturbation start here so take a look open them up see what inside I have the big vula all right so what is this up here um clitoris almost the clitoris is inside what hood yes so you have the clitoral hood and when you lift it up you find the clitoris right there so this is just kind of generally what they look like of course every person different inner lips of different clitoral hood all of there in color and size and all kinds of things here so what to expect when you vary quite dramatically from person to person and you need to take that into consideration when you figure out what little to say about what it for young teenagers particularly the question that they always ask is am I normal is my body normal so for girls they about their colors of their privates or their um their butts or their breasts you know are they growing at the correct size for boys it issues just about penis lay things along these lines what Christopher are you smoking in bed you with some vibrators who here has anybody held the Viator before nope no I have a jiggly gel pin take a look so funny bunny bunny these are primarily for the for the clitoris in clitoral area as opposed to something that of a vaginal orgasm which generally takes something up inside why are some of them longer than others because different people like different kinds of vibrators so it of decision what kind of vibrator to get there to play with these are hard plastic whereas the other one was is soft plastic and they have a very different feel to them this is a long it learn about masturbation and to practice masturbation because it helps them learn to orgasm for girls uh more quickly and more pleasurably and for boys it helps them to put off orgasming until it appropriate in a sexual encounter morning love cup of tea cheers grandma [Music] he [Music] teenagers are very sleepy these days uh largely due to getting an inadequate amount of sleep when in fact their sleep need is 9.2 hours or 8 and 1/2 to 9 and 1/2 hours and that whether they 10 11 year old or a 17 or 18y [Music] old so this explains why teenagers have such difficulty waking up to gain a better understanding of adolescent sleep patterns Amy Wolfson has undertaken the largest study ever conducted among 500 adolescents in different American schools [Music] so this morning you about wearing the actograph you to wear it for one week an actograph is a device that we use to estimate sleep we estimate sleep based on movement or lack of movement so in other words we know in theory that we active while you active while you actograph is programmed to estimate or measure sleep based on that concept of movement we also all need to fill out a diary while we [Music] after 3 years of research Amy has the latest statistics yikes Amy look the students livt only 5 hours that night oh that so upsetting and the majority of teenagers get seven and they actually really need nine many people wonder whether teenagers are lazy and I think a number of parents will often accuse their son or daughter of being lazy or Moody but they many teens are only getting s hours of sleep at night and so it that they appear lazy or appear moody or appearer difficult to handle but they not they deprived the Erica I your diary and you indicate you were on your cell phone before trying to sleep did it interfere with your falling asleep yeah but it wasn best friend called [Music] me Noah I Monday night you indicated that you got into bed at 10:30 but that you didn actually try to fall asleep until 10:45 what were you doing I was in bed on my lap top computer but why do teenagers have so much energy in the evening and so much trouble emerging in the morning not being sleepy at night is normal for adolescents their brains are not as sensitive to light as adult brains and this is due to a hormone called melatonin melatonin is a hormone that Peaks at our ideal time to fall asleep at night and troughs at our ideal time to wake up in the morning for the Adolescent in early to mid puberty melatonin actually Peaks at a later time in the evening and troughs at a later time in the morning delaying the timing of sleep the teenager therefore subject to the whims of a hormone but while we wait for science to find a hormonal Counterattack is there any solution to their problems in the United States certain schools have decided to pay heed to teenage biology by starting classes an hour later in the morning however until everyone can benefit from changes in the school routine what can be done first of all it televisions or get rid of the televisions get rid of the computers get rid of the cell phones take them out of the bedroom and second it important for the Adolescent to try to keep a regular sleep wake schedule in other words to try to go to bed and wake up as close to the same time as possible on school nights and weekend nights [Music] if young people are morose due to lack of sleep and unhappy because of their acne they also have problems with their heads for their brains are playing tricks on them when you go in right now part of the experiment you see pictures at the end of the time that we what what you move okay okay go ahead in Chloe we experiment now okay okay lie still now because we don motion could you hear me all right y we studied teenagers who were looking at facial affect that is faces that Express different emotions fear happy sadness and what we found was that teenagers who were looking at fearful faces had difficulty identifying them correctly several hundred teenagers have thus looked at facial expressions with MRI thanks to the mirror system in most cases expressions of fear were confused with those of anger embarrassment or sadness Chloe we series we did a great job so just continue staying still okay well there are a number of consequences that could uh occur because you mislabel or misunderstand a facial affect one of the most common ones is in the family environment where you might think your parent was angry or upset with you and in fact they a social situation it may be that you think your peer group friends or others that you meet are disapproving of you or making fun of you when in fact they just looking at you with a a non affective look running away without this child [Music] Chloe do you recognize these Expressions when you look at them yep okay tell me what you say um he looks angry and I not sure maybe he [Music] surprised to complement the study Dr Deborah yand Todd has also performed the tests with adults using functional MRI we completed some fmri studies that looked at brain activation during the labeling or identifying a facial affect we found that the prefrontal cortex activated more in adults than in the teenagers in fact in adolescence this frontal zone of the brain situated just behind the eyes is not completely connected one of the many consequences is that some teenagers don about themselves Professor Jay guide has looked further into this question for the past 10 years he has submitted teenage twins to MRI examinations at regular intervals thus putting together a photo album of their cerebral development Twins were chosen so that genetic factors could be taken into account when evaluating the differences for the teenagers a part of the brain called the frontal lobe is still under construction and it able to carry out many many complicated uh functions in fact it figuring out how computers work and and complicated math and and literature that is equal to adults in many ways but what is most different is when there are strong emotions and this ability to weigh decisions in the face of peer pressure or high emotions is the most difficult thing for our brains to do and this is the part that is still getting better during the team [Music] years uh do uh wait uh [Music] uh sometimes the teen brain is described as being like a big truck with no brakes so the passions and the and the drives are very strong very powerful after puberty but the frontal loes that part would be like the the brakes of the truck the ability to say whoa Let let about this before doing it that part of the brain that mature so this notion of kind of having a very big fast truck but the brakes not so good is often applied to routine brain yes I love the wrist no pain no game that yeah I love the risk that skate I love the risk the risk is crazy it keeps you going the risk keeps me going cuz the rush of it I like the risk cuz I skate every day and that do yeah the risk is pretty crazy know skateboarding is a new thing out there so yeah here we see the activity in the brain in a teenager confronting a risk confronted with the same risk the zones of an adult brain are solicited much more actively [Music] according to Jay guide connections in the zones responsible for judgment and morality those of the prefrontal cortex are the last to reach maturity around 20 years of age but are there any differences between boys and girls brains there differences between boys brains and girls brains but we by how similar the boys and girls brains are in terms of which one smaller what is most different is actually the path of growth and when we look at the trajectories of how the boys and girls brains grow the girls tend to hit their Peak gray matter volumes about 1 to two years early than the boys we don terms of of academics or social maturation or like it intriguing start but we have a long way to go to figure out the details the development of cerebral Connections in other words the gray matter is accompanied by the suppression of unused connections up to the age of 21 years at least a very important principle for the teenage brain is the use it or lose it principle and with this hypothesis is that the cells and connections that we use most are the ones that survived not only survive they flourish and the cells and connections that are not used are pruned away and so this gives us the ability to create our own brain in a sense by the activities of our day-to-day life the reason for their mood swings also lies in the teenager brain these are Professor Cheryl Smith conclusions the behavior of the teenager depends on the individual the moodiness could be a mood swing anxi xiety anger crying any of those would be a scene during stress in an adult it would take about 20 to 45 minutes for release of a stress hormone thp which would calm him down in a teenager this hormone has the opposite effect so they don [Music] this receptor in the brain acts to relax nerve cells in the adult a hormone is released during stress called thp it binds to the receptor and allows more chloride ions to pass this decreases excitability of nerve cells at puberty the same hormone is released by stress but now it allows fewer chloride ions to pass and this increases excitability of nerve cells this could lead to anxiety at puberty so what does Professor Cheryl Smith has helped a lot actually for me to understand that it now that I know that it and not just me being paranoid I think it emotion because I know that I can it [Music] [Music] if other teenagers knew about this perhaps they would feel more calm when they should be stressed what time do you co don don been ow what drinking no with your boyfriend no where are you going one might say that biology doesn explain all or not much hormones play their part but do not have the devastating effect that they are believed to have Al Al adolescence is represented as a sort of tidal wave hitting an unsuspecting unprepared victim destroying the calm path he following in the last few years of childhood in your opinion what is particularly dramatized um they say that things are tough for teenagers but I find that we find it too difficult what I can adults call it a dumb age because we not dumb it trying to find ourselves and we not quite sure who we are yet well I think it life even if sometimes there are a few arguments at home but it doesn um I think that I have a lot more fun now than when I was little it doesn really change much except that we get annoyed a little more often and that we speak differently but I guess it pretty good time of life we argue a little with our parents sometimes about nothing you know but some sometimes it fine they often say he crisis it crisis could be a positive change more people are happy to be teenagers than terribly unhappy right so it does appear that the sociologist from those of biologists we have to put the crisis and its hormonal flow back in their place for while 20% of teenagers feel terrible 80% of them feel fine scientific research does show then that adolescence can be a calm transition during which we discover extraordinary things in particular friendship and love which are the two big feelings at the crossroads of this second phase of life it moment which is experienced as true happiness despite all the negative images we continue to associate with this phase and yet Society tends to demonize the teen crisis it even devises tools to control teenagers and track them without their knowing this transmitting device marketed in the United States is effectively a black box for tracking teenagers with the Lander SE tracking key we can see where our teenagers are at all times let me give you an example where my son was and what time he came home last night and as you can see my son arrived Sunday May 25th at 4:50 in the morning I about that the method requires concealing the transmitter in an item of clothing or a car in the United States teenagers are allowed to drive accompanied by an adult as of 16 years of age as you can see this is the at my son we second and are able to to view the speed and as we that my son excess of 80 M an hour and this is uh absolutely unacceptable other inventors have exploited biological capacities specific to teenage ears to develop teenager repellants that buzzings unbearable help yeah you may not hear anything but they do that Tiny Box above the entrance of the building emits very high pitched sounds so you can see that these sound waves are changing very very fast these are very high frequency sounds and most teenagers can hear these sounds very well but as we get older we lose our ability to hear these very very high pitches you want to give a listen if you can hear it this is what you would hear by amplifying the signal so what do I think about using these high frequencies to keep teenagers away from certain places you know on the one hand there is absolutely no control over the levels the sound levels of these sounds and we know that loud sounds can cause damage not only to the teenagers but even to babies and children walking by moreover even for you and me we can you know if I punch you you can feel the punch and you know to move away if you don beat [Music] up identity crisis they can thus distinguish themselves from children and more importantly from adults whom they often consider to be oldfashioned when I see the we witness the emergence of Trends new trends but which compared with the old Trends it for example the tectonic or emo Trend with the rock and roll Trend or the rap Trend we structural level of the phenomenon the great musical genres are Timeless today because they around for 50 years 30 years the current movements seem to me to be more ephemeral these new trends succeed each other faster and faster but what motivates the teenagers who follow them it revolves around a music scene if I started to dressed like a prep and listen to emotional hardcore or punk music I think it would Clash completely with my style plus I feel more comfortable dressed in black and dark colors yeah it distancing myself or shocking people attracting attention in the street with respect to the people around me to feel better and look different from others to really be someone who isn else I mean there are loads of people who are fashion tectonic and all but there are way fewer people like this like in high school there are about a dozen of us at the very most and I being pretty generous here so so there really aren do stand out quite a bit the teenager uses codes that we find even on the other side of the world I believe we cultural globalization of Youth in terms of tribes or Urban cultures here photo from Mongolia showing a rather mixed selection at the same time in the lower section we can see something that resembles the gothic style and there Nazi emblem evoking the skined fashion the most important thing for everyone is that at a glance we can identify what tribe you belong to and thus adopt the appropriate codes of behavior for a member of this group I believe the difference between teenagers lies in details and tattoos and body piercings are a way to distinguish oneself from those who haven choices yet there to affirm an identity that is truly one own it the top of the list in terms of bringing out new fashions creating extreme Trends mixing genres and displaying great imagination in the emergence of new trends adolescence is a time when attracting attention is of the greatest importance so typical of teenage girls the parades in other words they can walk more or less normally but when they want to make a sign they do this did you get a good look at me gesticulating in an exaggerated and Theatrical manat to but like adult women who make obvious movements of Overture with hands tingles do this or that and there very very typical that smoothing of the hair but always looking to one side but pull their hair there typical of teenage girls who are attracted who want to attract this is a flash look very rapid eyebrow raising six to 3/4 of a second repeated she repeatedly licks her lips whereas the beginning it teasing the boy you know almost making fun of him but it is interpreted in all cultures as an invitation a solicitation no no no no no no no teenagers pouts are much more exaggerated however we don Partners who attract Us in fact the brain puts together a sort of mental love chart at a very early age which is a combination of the physical appearances and behaviors of all the people who have loved us parents of course but also friends social models Idols for example it has been shown that men and women prefer partners with the same eye and hair color of the parent of the opposite sex start by putting the photo of your father in the envelope then you male faces which will come up on the screen in front of you and I will ask you to list in order of preference the two faces which you find most attractive the test consists in presenting photos of boys considered attractive aged between 18 and 30 years of [Music] age so you were attracted to the two oldest boys is your father older than your mother yes by 11 years 13 years older than my mother he older chosen two younger boys your age actually what between your father and your mother none but can we evaluate the cerebral activation of love I photos of girls who are your friends and a photo of your [Music] girlfriend what is interesting about this type of experiment is that we can see from the MRI that different zones are stimulated when dealing with a friend like in this case or with a person with whom we are in love the feeling of Love causes us to react in a similar way to the effect of a drug in fact the same areas of the brain are activated by taking cocaine in other words we get high on love and we can also become addicted to love experiments have

Exploring New Worlds: The Search for Life Beyond | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqP0si7U3gM	SLICE Science	[Music] our star the son was born in one about 4 and 1/2 billion years ago so one of these clouds collapsed upon itself under its own gravity to form a globe this then spiraled into a disc becoming our solar system [Music] amongst the Spheres of rock and gas only one gave rise to life [Music] Earth but could This Magnificent living planet really be unique amongst the Stars we are an incredible Miracle stars died to create the chemical elements in us and somehow we Rose to Consciousness and asked the question why are we here where did we come from are there others like us this is the quest that we have been on from the moment we were conscious as a species it is our destiny to answer these questions we could not possibly have been forged in the dying throws of stars and created in that tremendous explosion and now turn our back on looking for other creatures that were formed the same way emus Artemus this is Supply shuttle Aurora x-ray Hotel golf guidance systems okay confirming request for dogging affirmative Aurora you are go for dogging

memory banks my mission is to guide this ship 4.7 light years to reach the exoplanet manura B my objective is to find evidence of life life first emerged on earth almost 4 billion years [Music] ago shaped by the everchanging forces of geology and climate life has evolved with extraordinary richness and [Music] resilience we have explored every corner of the earth and we have been amazed at the diversity of the natural [Music] world as our technology improved we inevitably turned our gaze to space looking for life on nearby planets but despite our Ingenuity we came back empty-handed but what about planets beyond our solar system could life of some kind exist out there amongst the Stars I was a graduate student when the very first planet was discovered Natalie Bala is part of a new generation of Planet Hunters looking for worlds like Earth but in other solar systems I would say my biggest Hope was that we find an earth-sized Planet orbiting a star very much like our own sun in a similar orbit where the conditions for life might be just right 5 4 3 2 engine start 1 zero and liftoff of the Delta 2 rocket with Kepler on a search for planets in some way like our [Music] own in 2009 NASA launched an orbiting telescope Kepler its mission was to search for earthlike planets it carried instruments sensitive enough to detect the infinitesimal dimming of Starlight as distant planets passed in front of their star the difficulty is that this dimming of light is very very small for a truly earth-sized Planet orbiting a sunlike star it analogy I like to give is to imagine the tallest skyscraper in a city and it nighttime and and every light is turned on in every room and one person walks over to the window and lowers the blinds by about a centimeter that of light that we have to be able to detect Kepler has surveyed just a small region of the Milky Way but its discoveries have been stunning the first light image was magnificent it was like champagne filling a glass just these millions of stars that I had been studying for years before Kepler even launched filling the screen and there were actually already a couple of giant planets that were in Kepler view we you see when you look up into the sky at night has at least one planet the other thing that we have learned is that nature makes small planets more efficiently than large planets the third thing we has to do with the fraction of stars that Harbor Earth siiz potentially habitable planets and we can make the bias corrections to determine that number and what we find is that it about 22 to 25% so every star in the sky has at least one planet and of those one in every four is a candidate for Life Kepler has revolutionized the way that we see the stars aramus log November 22nd 2157 day zer Mission

the right atmospheric conditions to support life although Kepler has identified thousands of earth-sized planets so far it appears that very few of them may hold the essentials needed for life at least Life as We Know It [Music] France for models the climate on distant planets predicting if it life to emerge our rivers lakes and oceans exist only because Earth orbits at an ideal distance from the Sun within a region called The goldilock Zone not too cold not too hot but just right it fortunate orbit that makes all life on Earth [Music] possible for [Music] bu [Music] [Music] astrobiologists now believe that our best chance of finding life on distant planets is to search for candidates that are just like Earth in the goldilock zone around a star I was a child around 10 years old and I was on a camping trip with my family and I Ste outside the tent in the middle of the night wandered out and I looked up and wow I saw so many [Music] stars thousands of stars I had never known this existed and I was thinking like why didn about this how do you convey to another person the Beauty and the Majesty of the night [Music] sky and I just wondered what what could possibly be out there in our night sky when I want to think I come here to the great lake and you know I look out on the water and I just think about how how wonderful life is how fragile life is it gives me hope that there planet out there where life could really Thrive 6 5 4 3 2 2 1 Sarah Seager is deputy director of Tess an orbiting Telescope launched in 2018 she leads a team of young Planet Hunters looking at a planet far away is the best way we have to find Signs of Life on another world because the gases that life produces here on Earth actually imprint in our atmosphere in a very significant way and so it that on another world we can do the same Tess wants to find stars that are closer right in our neighborhood actually so that we can study the planet atmospheres and get way more detailed information on those planets the camera has a lens assembly of seven lens elements that refracts Starlight onto a detector and together they make a giant strip when you think of the sky is a sphere from the bottom of one hemisphere all the way up to the pool after one year of doing that test will flip to the next Hemisphere and it will then do the same thing and so over 2 years test aims to study the entire Sky test will identify an exoplanet with an earthlike atmosphere and the one essential Factor we believe is crucial to Life water it is the search for water on other planets that inspired interplanetary Explorer Steve Squires it was only for graduate students and I was an undergraduate and I nearly got thrown out of the class the first day and got to be I don weeks into the semester I better start thinking about my term paper and there was this place then at the time called the Mars room and it was a place where the pictures from Mars were stored and I went in and I thought I down for 15 or 20 minutes and flip through some pictures and see if I can come up with an idea for a turn [Music] paper you know it pictures come down from Mars and bang they later there were only a few dozen people in the world who know understand what I was looking at in the pictures nobody did but then I would see in the pictures you would see these little valleys that just looked like they had to have been carved by liquid water and I was in that room for 4 hours and I walked out of there knowing exactly what I wanted to do with the rest of my [Music] life cra in 2004 Steve Squire led the NASA team that landed the spirit and opportunity Rovers on Mars SM they came with a 3-month guarantee but opportunity was still going strong 15 years later the thing that has driven the focus of exploration in this solar system has been the search for other forms of life and so I think the motivation is going to be the same thing I think the motivation when you go to other star systems is going to be fundamentally the search for [Music] Life atmus log December 8 2157 [Music] ahead of me is Mars the first planet explored beyond the shores of [Music] Earth Below is the baking Colony that has now been there for 90 years population [Music] 1,536 the brave pioneers of the colony sent me good wishes for the journey ahead I joining [Music] me navigation across 50 trillion km requires intricate calculations I have plotted my course from Earth I Jupiter then Ste for manura its orbital period is 39 Earth days it lies within the habitable [Music] zone spectrometry reveals an atmosphere that contains water carbon dioxide ozone and methane in promising concentrations my mission of finding complex life has every chance of success [Music] I get up each day with joy you know why because I know that day I learn something I didn that my picture My overall tapestry of Who We Are Who I Am what our species is and how we got to be that way will be lifted up NASA flight systems Gentry Lee is a pioneer of exploration he dedicated over 50 years of his life to exploring other planets someone asked me one time if I had to describe the excursions above the threshold of joy in my life life would there be a lot of them or just a few and I said I can give you the two categories right away the birth of my children and I now have eight and when a spacecraft that I had a major role in achieved something successfully there eight of [Music] those Gentry Lee and Steve Squire helped Forge the trail into the solar system but a new and even greater test lies ahead now we must Venture further into our galaxy and there we will confront extraordinary [Music] challenges the problem is just so far away you know you you have this wonderful notion that yeah we to the star s but they away to travel to a star that light years away in a time that is not immense compared to a human lifetime you spacecraft to a significant fraction of the speed of light and that that really hard [Music] it is huis on our part to imagine that we can sit today and Define all the steps that lead us to this plethora of Technology advances that we need in the future to build an Interstellar spacecraft rather let us do the following thing that spacecraft must communicate it must navigate it must have propulsion it must have the ability to take data it the king of Portugal had said I don even know yet what kind of ships I need to build or where they need to go let me just start with an idea what floats that exciting because at this moment with the Kepler discoveries there is a vastness out there for us to explore that will challenge us for Generations arimus log December 12th [Music] 2157 Passage through our solar system is progressing [Music] well the storms on Jupiter are intriguing I will now accelerate toward 20% the speed of light [Music] 216 million [Music] kmph shortly I will pass my Interstellar ancestor Voyager 2 it recently celebrated its 180th anniversary I will make the journey to reach the exoplanet manura B in 48 years in 6 months engaging Interstellar passage mode retracting transceiver our imagined exoplanet manura B is 4.7 light years from Earth or 45 trillion kilom the quest to design a ship that can Traverse such vast distances will test our next generation of explorers and demand of them the ultimate commitment for they may not live to see the fruits of their labor you their careers their lives to something they will never see to fruition now that has happened that has happened a few times in human history some of the great cathedrals of Europe took longer than a human lifespan to build uh people felt Guided by a higher power when they did that but it takes something extraordinary to motivate people to do that kind of thing people tell me oh how are you imagining Interstellar spacecraft and I say you have forgotten the fundamental precept of all engineering invention necessity and desire are the mother of invention once you set your eyes on a planet out there earthlike in the goldilock zone once we think we have a chance we will develop the techniques for inter s exploration and the payoff once we get there is beyond belief science fiction enabled Starships to enjoy high-speed Interstellar and even Intergalactic travel with their propulsion systems limited only by the imagination with a sprinkling of real science however reality has so far kept our own spaceships limited to admirable but impractical speeds Voyager 2 has taken over 40 years to reach just the edge of our solar system although it most adventurous spaceship yet it would take more than 880,000 years to reach our imaginary planet of manura B when I was about 10 years old I had one of these department store telescopes learned how to use it took it out one night and focused it on what I was told was the planet Saturn and when I lined up the viewfinder and held it still and I could see Saturn and its rings at that moment I felt a calling and that calling was to learn about how to get [Music] there Les johnon found his calling at NASA center for 20 years he researching Interstellar propulsion nature is kind to us in the regard to what options we have to get to the Stars Nature has said you you smart people you can figure this out it hard it was it was difficult enough to go to the Moon we the different planets in the Solar System but to take that leap to go to the Stars the distance is just so much further and requires so much more energy that it [Music] time chemical fuel Rockets like satin 5 have been the workhorses of space exploration they got us to the Moon in just 3 days but to reach another solar system in one lifetime we speed of light at that speed a trip to the moon would take just 7 Seconds now that kind of engineering is a huge challenge so scientists have imagined some wild propulsion technology including antimatter drug drives as any good Star Trek fan will know right uh on the Enterprise that what powered their warp drive of course warp drive is science fiction drive but if you if you think about uh antimatter it real when matter and antimatter come in contact with each other they annihilate and it essentially is the perfect e equal MC squar moment is released as energy and this is where it gets tough if you look at the total amount of antimatter produced globally today it on the order of nanograms you would need on the order of kilograms perhaps up to a ton of antimatter to drive a Starship that not something I want to do on the earth because the amount of energy released if that ton of antimatter met a ton of matter would be C [Music] catastrophic I look back at the history of Science and Technology and if you had asked my counterpart 200 years ago going to the moon the answer would have been that inconceivable we don to do that [Music] it it so no I don I think it yes I think it that we humans will ever have to do is that challenge of going to the Stars we may already have some potential Solutions at Princeton Satellite Systems Engineers are working on technology that could take us to the Stars my brother will tell the story that I actually doing what they thought they wanted to do in high school I identified aerospace engineering I picked colleges for aerospace engineering I aerospace engineering ever since because it this is cool the exhaust velocity that we have is only about 100 km/s and yet you can unless you got some meaningful thrust right so you Stephanie Thomas is principal investigator in a NASA funded program to build the world direct Fusion drive a combined energy source and propulsion system we want to chain neighboring star in the neighborhood of five Lightyear distance we want to bring 10,000 kg of payload that need to do it with an exhaust velocity that we can actually achieve with an engine the direct Fusion Drive runs on a dense isotope of hydrogen called dut terium and it can be found everywhere in water [Music] the Drive Unit is compact just a meter wide and 10 m long perfect for mounting in a Starship we think that we can build the Next Generation machine in maybe 5 years it will take at least another 5 years to build a prototype that you could launch but definitely 15 years at the outside we think we could have one and put it in space at some point we have to visit the Stars we and be content you know even when we visiting the planets because we want to know what there everybody wants to go to the Stars someday we have the motivation and now it seems we may have the speed to reach manura B but navigating the vast distances of interstellar space involves even more challenges some of them Beyond mere human capabilities when great distances in the speed of light get involved it becomes a very very different sort of experience simple words like now take on a kind of a different meaning I remember when we were landing on Mars from when you hit the top of the marshan atmosphere to when you surface takes about 6 minutes at that time the one what we call the one-way light time how long it takes a signal to travel at the speed of light from Mars to Earth was 10 minutes so we there in the control room and we watching the radio signal and we watching the spacecraft begins to slow down and curve down in the Martian atmosphere and it the atmosphere the reality is out at Mars it minutes and it may be a happy healthy Rover or maybe a smoking hole in the ground and I don reality at that moment magnify that so instead of 10 minutes is 10 years welcome to the Ops slab Franchesco m thanks for coming you ready to walk on Mars y we Mars Francesco you see the mountain over there I bet your dad can tell you the name about it so what is that I think it don in that same box what do you think we do with the laser well I don zap and hits one of the rocks and right at the end where it zaps it it turns it into a gas and then it analyzes what that gas is made of yep yep all right so what do you want to do now well let to mount shark okay let shark the first and most important thing a spacecraft that goes to another star to survey planets and look for Life must be basically autonomous it must be artificial intelligence raised to its highest level all the navigation would have to be on board all the algorithms the computations of the orbit the computations of the Maneuvers to get to the right place what stars to look at is for this year what stars to look at for next year what we would have to do is extend our minds to imagine all the possibilities that they might run into and we would spend literally years building this hierarchy of possibilities in into this artificial intelligent machine it would have to know at all times how well all its critical systems were doing and how to fix them if they weren them if they couldn [Music] challenge warning warning warning alter course warning warning warning microm meteorite field detected initiate Shield protection maneuver fire antill Thruster reposition warning warning warning there will never be an artificial intelligence system that we will be able to build that will be faultless so one of the most important characteristics of this autonomous

reboot asmus log January 20 2170 AI reboot initiation successful I back online analysis my self-repair systems should be able to fix the damage whilst fear was not part of my design I important fun function of self-preservation I will need to mimic it any further damage could be catastrophic ending the [Music] mission I course it will take me several days to reset my way points [Music] [Music] the great Marvel and the Paradox of Wide Open Spaces is that they make us look inwards confronted with the infinite we reflect upon the self where do we come from why are we [Music] here are we alone as a young child I was mostly interested in philosophy and I used to wander uh into the hills of the village where I was born I was interested in questions about our existence involving also the big picture which is us being in the universe the question is how did we come to be inhabiting this two-dimensional surface on a piece of rock that we call our home the Earth near a star like the sun that is one out of tens of billions of stars in the Milky Way galaxy that is one out of trillions of galaxies in the universe how did this all come about and are we alone in particular Ary lobe grew up but he never grew out of his fascination with the fundamental mysteries of Life today as chair of astronomy at Harvard University he seeks to understand our place in the universe by combining philosophy and science the most fundamental question that science can answer is are we alone the answer to this question could have implications to all all aspects of our life it could change people beliefs it could change the way we think about our place in the universe it could change philosophy Linguistics in terms of communicating if this other form of life is intelligent like us I answer is yes or no I think we should explore rather than have a Prejudice just like Columbus went out to discover the new Worlds the answer lies in [Music] space initiating staging separation of reactor propulsion unit [Music] firing reverse direct Fusion [Music] drives Asus log March 18th 2181 it is time to start slowing down it is 23 years and 2 months since I left Earth orbit [Music] [Music] [Music] manura C is a gas giant similar to Jupiter as I approach the system I will use its atmosphere and gravity to reduce speed and alter course [Music] all life on Earth is based on organic molecules centered around the element carbon scientists believe that this organic material was created during the birth of our galaxy from a carbon Rich dis of dust and gas this suggests that these building blocks of life may be present in the birth of all solar systems looking back at our own Earth and why we have this Rich you know biosphere uh well we think it all started with having all this organic material that we are made up of that that was delivered from space uh from comets and from asteroids so we likelihood of life elsewhere we pretty much thinking about the likelihood of having that same scenario taking place high in the Arid mountains of the atakama desert in Chile is a new telescope called Alma it Karen oberg is on the hunt for these precursers of life in the birth cloud of a distant solar system Al consists of 66 individual telescopes that together it operates at millimeter wavelengths and millimeter wavelengths is we can detect molecules some of this organic mole that we are so interested [Music] in in 2015 Alma star in the throws of birth wrapped in a disc of gas and dust from which planets were being [Music] born we see this dust and gas that surrounding this these young Stars and what that they often have little Lanes or tracks in them where it looks like plant formation is going on right now Elma revealed a stunning Discovery in that infant star so there are two things that are significant one is that first of all we molecules and we system where planets are forming right now and that immediately is telling us that when planets form there they will form in a bath of these complex organic molecules but I think was especially caught our eye here is that the chemical composition of this disc looks so similar to what we think that our own solar disc once looked like chemistry is awesome it that we are alive and that we the first place uh so far it know one system apart from our solar system where we have this chemical information but my intuition would be that it kind of chemistry is going to be almost Universal the same organic molecules essential to all life on Earth are out there amongst the [Music] Stars emus log March 19th [Music] 2206 the manvan sun lies ahead I was designed to explore to research to understand that time has come what will I [Music] [Music] find second staging operation initiated trans orbit position lock Earth signal position [Music] confirmed I can now see manura B it is [Music] beautiful it is time for me to take a close look at my new [Music] home there are many unknowns deploying survey on GPS satellites over the coming months I collect Telemetry for my satellites and begin mapping terrain and naming locations I must calculate atmosphere gravity and climate variables before selecting a favorable Landing site [Music] curiosity about the unknown is part of what makes us human it has driven our history and progress but exoplanet exploration will test Us in unique ways we cannot predict what we will find so our robot explorers must be prepared for anything exoplanets present a real challenge because there uncertainty so knowing whether or not you a desert versus an ocean versus an ice Tundra we may not know when we launched so you system to survive and operate in all of those uh possible [Music] conditions with Planetary Exploration we started with a large robot that was very stable very very safe um and now we beginning to take more risk we to get to new places uh trying to shrink down the the size of the platform do more with less it ledge over there just the sort of thing other Rovers can [Music] into we work on extreme environment robots so these are things that are meant to fall we want them to be crash proof so you can see this whole structure even the wheels are meant just to bounce some of our robots are designed to climb up different surfaces so we have a claw inspired robot that uses sharp hooks to grab onto the rough surface kind of like an insect or a rock climber would scale up a cliff we also use electrostatics to stick to surfaces so this is is like rubbing the balloon on your head and it sticks to the wall so this is a kagi structure which would be hard to fabricate through any other means than 3D printing uh what truly unique about this structure is the material we have created a material that has mechanical properties similar to that you see in biological tissues we have already with this system developed swimming robots there is a lot of work today in underwater Robotics and in uh robots that can go between dry surfaces and and water-like surfaces wherever we find water on Earth we find life so we have a strategy that we water I think we same strategy when we visit an exoplanet look for life in the ways that we conceive of life now and try and be be open to seeing versions of life that might be very different than our own version here on Earth I at landing on manura a storm front is cleared I located a favorable Landing site about 1 km from Mount Armstrong final Telemetry checks check deploying Lander one go e [Music] [Music] following the failure of my first deployment I measurements revised all calculations and discovered my mistake now I believe I am ready deploying Lander 2 [Music] ballistic parachutes [Music] [Applause] go firing retro Rockets [Music] Mission Control we have landed [Music] what kind of life could we find on another planet that long intrigued Chris McCay a planetary scientist my intuition is that the universe is full of life there might not look like Earth with vegetation and animals well the the question I is really the start of life and on Earth we see for a long time life was just microbial but all the essential features of Life were there nothing new was invented when life became trees and animals that was just morphological that dressing everything interesting with respect to biology was present when there were no trees and no animals and life was just microscopic the DNA was there the amino acids was there all the biochemical Machinery that makes life life was there so when we search for life in other worlds I tend to focus on this early simple step we the biochemistry we the molecules that life is made out of May 27th 2206 manura surface my Lander may now make autonomous decisions and is observing local terrain we have successfully deployed 3D printed drones and spider bots they are providing my vision of the planet it is Da rich and it is fascinating [Music] [Music] Mission Control we have confirmed a key objective there is liquid water on manura B significant quantities I am confident of further discoveries [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] sandling Amino Rich water [Music] [Music] depositing sample [Music] sample analysis alien amino acid detected samples contain complex biomolecules the structure is unfamiliar but appears to be analogous to DNA with a high degree of confidence I can confirm this is a life [Music] form I have [Music] succeeded we have succeeded [Music] life form detected this isolated determined little plant appears to be similar to a succulent this this is an important development evidence of the emergence of higher life forms we appear to be observing the result of evolutionary [Music] processes what are the processes that might drive complex life well we have only our own Planet as a guide but we can at least speculate about possibilities of evolution on other [Music] planets something amazing happened on Earth 540 million years ago life took a giant step forward and the evidence can be found here here in the Canadian Rockies amongst the fossils of the Burgess Shale these rocks contain some of the first evidence of multicellular organisms on our [Music] planet the first eyes the first hard body parts bones and exoskeletons the first lateral symmetry the first effic guts even the first brains sculptured in the finely packed sediment of an ancient ocean is the turning point in the evolution of advanced life on Earth the Cambrian explosion as far as we know life dates back at least to 3.4 billion years ago and it wasn million years ago that we have the Cambrian explosion and that fundamentally changes the planet it goes from a microbial world to one that is literally teaming with animals and not just small and simple animals as we would have originally imagined but instead we have a whole array of complex life still only in Earth of the major groups of animals appear geologically instantaneously [Music] it is apparent that evolutionary processes have been present on manura B There is evidence of historical climatic shifts similar to Earth [Music] [Music] ancient sedent [Music] survey minerial sample scan fossil and analysis [Music] reconstructing comparison evaluation suggests analogous to a commodo dragon amphibious or terrestrial origin is undetermined I shall name it archus [Music] problematicus perhaps an event such as an ice age has caused the distinction of these larger [Music] creatures due to the atmosphere being much thinner than Earth radiation levels are higher limiting what can survive in the daytime [Music] bioluminescent [Music] [Music] organisms Predator camouflaged predators a key indicator to the acceleration of [Music] evolution it is time to broaden our search we must follow the water we know that life is possible given certain chemical and physical conditions we know it it happened here I would expect to find life elsewhere astrobiologist Lyn rth child expects that the oceans would be the primary target for finding life on an exoplanet just as they were the Cradle of life on Earth much of the diversity of life has occurred within oceans like we have here [Music] today in a lot of ways water is a much better environment for life when the temperature gets very cold or very hot the water temperature stays the same and so if you water you changes in [Music] temperature say we could go to a planet that had maybe three times the gravity of the earth if we were in the water there it wouldn the water here [Music] maybe what we unusual and on other planets or watery worlds it happens in a completely different way however there are literally billions and billions of galaxies so if you start multiplying up the numbers even if the chance of Life evolving is fairly small there evolve surely life must be common in our universe I would be shocked if it weren my first month on manura B has yielded many discoveries it seasons are shorter than Earth remarkable but so far I found only fossilized evidence of advanced animals it surface [Music] water temperature [Music] 12° deploying swim Bots [Music] this is what we hoped for the oceans are full with complex life some familiar others strange sh [Music] [Music] [Music] early philosophers thought that the sun moves around the earth that we are at the center of the solar system took a lot of effort to demonstrate otherwise so then we realize okay we are not at the center of the solar system but perhaps the solar system is itself is at the center of the universe or the Milky Way galaxy turns out that it it of stars moving around the center of the Milky Way and the Milky Way is moving through the universe there is no Center to the universe nevertheless at this day and age many scientists believe that we are at the center of the biological Universe based on lessons from the past I I would tend to believe that we are not special primitive life exists and is very ubiquitous throughout the Galaxy throughout the Universe and even intelligent life is common there might be even Superior forms of intelligence and if we ever find them and communicate with them we might ask them to answer questions to which we don my mission has accomplished its objective finding life forms on the first planet we explored means that life is almost certainly plentiful throughout the [Music] Universe the discoveries have provided many answers to questions scientists have been pondering for gener generations and posed many questions that the next generation of explorers must answer the part of this that is thrilling to me is that our best attributes if done correctly exploration at its finest have been programmed into an extension of our species it belongs to no single individual it is more than anything else a symbol of humanity working together to create something whose only purpose is to gather knowledge what a beautiful thought and after after a long period of time finally the moment of truth is coming and more than likely the people that designed it originally are no longer alive this one and they have passed on this thrill this passion to their children and perhaps even to their grandchildren so would you like to take a hike here yeah let where do you want to go H let the hill okay we it be that they found life will it be that they found a planet where we could someday exist whatever it is it will be a historical Milestone unlike any [Music] other have wanted to find signs of life on other worlds for as long as we we know actually even back to the Greek philosophers anything is possible within the laws of physics and chemistry and any planet we we can imagine is probably out there somewhere nature is boundless like in its variety of exoplanets I definitely am an Explorer in many ways probably more than a scientist because I just love new things the desire to travel and to explore and to go somewhere new I think is so strong that someday someone will find a way to make it happen that moment when something new is revealed that no one that exploration and it when we go to other worlds around other stars in a very very very big way we be sitting back on Earth and that down link will come and the video or the pictures or the Spectra or whatever it is are going to come up on the screen everybody [Music] Mission Control this is emus we are not alone in breaking news the first transmission from Captain arimus pilot of the Starship rova has reached Earth along with with breathtaking images of extraterrestrial life the mission this has been a journey of the [Music] imagination but one day soon very soon artemis questions will be answered the possibilities for life are built into the very chemistry of the stars and we will learn that we are not solitary in the infinite Universe it will be the most profound moment in our history perhaps our science our civilization and our faith will be tested as we turn our gaze back to our own pale blue dot our home Earth we will find a new understanding of our place amongst the [Music] Stars will our differences and disputes suddenly seem trivial will we value the Miracles of life more than ever before [Music] so when you next go out and look up at the night sky take a moment to contemplate what you [Music] see for every Star there is a planet for every planet is a possibility you are now looking at something different at a sky that has a new meaning and

an earthquake followed by a devastating tsunami destroyed the Bay of Palo within minutes 4,000 people lost their lives and 79,000 others had to be evacuated how could such a tragedy happen again after the 2004 tsunami that already devastated Indonesia two tsunami Specialists Professor Costa sakis of the University of Southern California and Professor Herman Fritz of the Georgia Institute of Technology we Indonesian authorities to investigate the causes of the tragedy quite impressive to see the the devastation we event and then here we can kind of see why it as possible or at least once the emergency is over because a lot of bulldozing in this area already so a lot of evidence is already lost for those who know how to look these fields of ruins hold clues of the wave of Passage but time is running out the monsoon will soon wash away the remaining traces working as a tsunami scientist is very much like being a detective on a crime scene there is a multiple murders that have taken place you really have to piece like in a puzzle the sequence of events did the tsunami hit first and this made the houses collapsed or were they collapsed because of the earthquake and the tsunami finished them off what were the people doing why is it that some people died and some people did not both investigators want to understand how the disaster unfolded their goal to trace the tsunami back to the original event that triggered the [Music] wave in the small fishing town of wani Costa sakis goes to meet the survivors Abdul ath miraculously survived when the wave came he was on his boat 100 m from the shore Hey Hey sir get off the boat get off the boat at the time of the first wave when there was the big Tremor I went out on the deck of the boat did you feel the Tremors on the boat yes the boat shook because the water had gone down and the boat was grounded what did he do at the time he stayed with the boat did you stay on the boat in front over there I was holding on to the MK oh okay and then I saw the wave breaking in the distance it was very fast in no time at all it was next to the boat pushing us about how high was it I had time to see my house the top of it was almost at the same height as the boat where your house over there the wave was about 5 to 6 met High the height of my house for Costa sakis this tsunami is an enigma how is it possible for a 5 m high wave to crash through here when a bay is usually protected from tsunamis [Music] 20 km south of wani Herman Fritz is investigating in the town of Pao where thousands of people lost their [Music] lives with the help of two Indonesian scientists Herman Fritz goes to the parking lot of the shopping center overlooking the bay in order to understand the Dynamics of the wave he relies on another kind of witness mobile phone videos this is the exact spot that uh okay we saw on the video here you can see the billboard yes tsunami wave coming people running away people running away and that that one so now we can basically see how high the water is almost on top of the billboard here the wave reached over 4 m in height yeah so 1.6 here okay four up there okay [Music] [Music] to trace the source of the tsunami Herman Fritz needs to establish a model of the devastating wave determine its height at different points in the city and measure how far it spread Inland going to try to do some detailed surveying here so we get a full 3D scan and the purpose of that is so we get a 3D space uh basically liar scans all the point cloud and we can see how the waves go through it so can we measure how high the wave is at every given instance and how fast the wave is moving across through the houses washing away the houses and across the street Herman Fritz tracks the wave after submerging the parking lot the water penetrated deep into the city in this mosque which is only 100 m from the shore Clues bear witness to its power right this one this Grill here and we see this rafted debris inside so we know that the tsunami was at least to this height of this rack and then up here we see the actual primary tsunami line which is this one right here and we can also see it in the window if you look at the Blue Sky we actually see a mudline going through there and then we look it at over here we also see the mudline coming around coming around coming around so the tsunami is coming pretty much at the height of my head through this mosque um and that already because usually uh when the water is to this height you cannot stand anymore you will be uh thrown to the ground by the water so it can be difficult to survive [Music] after 3 days of fieldwork the two American researchers and their Indonesian colleagues are finally able to produce a first simulation of the tsunami that submerged the Bay of poo according to their observations the most powerful waves spread more than 300 M Inland but for coasta AIS and Herman Fritz the investigation has only just begun they now have to identify the event that triggered this murderous wave and determine how it could have swept into the [Music] bay Su the port Nami the waves the waves that destroy the port this word now Universal dates from the 17th century it comes from the other place in the planet most frequently affected by tsunamis Japan it was coined by fishermen who returned on a storm free day to discover their port completely devastated by the waves the most recent tsunami in Japan in 2011 caused the nuclear accident in Fukushima following a 9.1 magnitude earthquake the devastating wave killed more more than 18,000 people tsam tsunami has no meteorological cause primary cause of tsunamis are earthquakes and earthquakes at Sea the vast majority of tsunamis are generated by the planet activity the Earth into several large plates magma pushes them against one another a few Mill M to a few centime a year the oceanic plates slide beneath the continental plates forming subduction zones friction between the plates causes deformation of the continental plate which accumulates a gigantic amount of energy when the tension is released it generates a huge undersea earthquake the earthquake displaces all the water at once so if we are 4 km deep we have 4,000 M of water that moves at the speed of an airliner very quickly as we approach the coast the speed is reduced the wave gets bigger and we find ourselves on the coast with waves of 20 to 30 met as we saw in 2011 you cannot separate earthquake science and tsunami science the longer the duration of the earthquake gives a very good indication of how strong is the earthquake it basically it a small earthquake it area and that means the duration is shorter if it Sumatra magnitude 9 or Japan magnitude 9 plus events then basically you have a very long zipper that means the shaking will go on for several minutes Jesus Christ look at that Jesus Christ [\\xa0__\\xa0] H that W is a good 152 ft tall easy the longer and more intense the undersea earthquake the more powerful the tsunami it generates this is what happened during the terrible Earth Quake of December 26th 2004 in the Indian Ocean a fault located 100 km off the coast of the town of band AE on the island of Sumatra Indonesia broke on a line of 1200 km the earthquake with an exceptional magnitude of 9.1 lasted more than 5 minutes 15 minutes later 35 M waves hit the coast continuing across the entire Indian Ocean the tsunami claimed a total of 230,000 lives a huge human disaster captured live for the first time by hundreds of video [Music] cameras This Disaster revealed the devastating power of tsunamis to the whole world before it little was known about these deadly waves for the scientific Community it is a wake-up call it energized the science of tsunamis which until then was in its [Music] infancy numerous International Studies are launched the research of Indonesian geologist nasle Ismael will lead to a major Revelation here had the tsunami reached 30 m high up to the top of the hill over [Music] there people rushed to the mountains but very few survived surveying the coast for traces of the tsunami now as Ismael made an exceptional Discovery 30 km south of B AE after the 2004 tsunami this cave was full of debris full of pieces of wood this cave has a very particular architecture it is L-shaped and its entrance is parallel to the coast so every time the water of a tsunami comes to submerge this cave it is retained inside nasle Ismael had a hunch if this cave trapped the material carried by the 2004 tsunami it could also hold the memory of past catastrophes the cave had another particularity bats they have colonized it for Millennia tunami each tsunami is covered by a layer of guo you can see the layers of guano in Black here over the years layers of guano or bat droppings deposited between each tsunami have become fossilized they Mark a clear boundary that delineates each event a layer of tsunami then a layer of guano a layer of tsunami and mor guano then a tsunami then Mor guano tsunami then guano and the 2004 tsunami with the help of researchers from Singapore isma is able to date 12 deposits by carbon 14 they tell the story of tsunamis in this region over the last 10,000 years the upper deposit corres responds to the 2004 tsunami the next event is about 2,900 years earlier then four tsunamis occurred 25 years apart about 3,300 years [Music] ago the oldest was about 7,500 years ago from the data obtained here we have discovered that tsunamis are recurring irregularly this is a lesson for both the government and the people we have to be vigilant to be constantly ready because this disaster can happen at any time this exceptional Discovery is a game Cher now scientists know that where a tsunami has once struck another can strike again now the question is where have tsunamis occurred in the [Music] past since 2008 UNESCO has kept a worldwide tsunami map updated with scientist discoveries over the past three Millennia 1200 tsunamis have been confirmed the least destructive are in White and the most deadly in red any one of them might become a potential tsunami in the [Music] future 70% of tsunamis are located along the Pacific Ring of Fire where subduction zones are concentrated but they have occurred Elsewhere on the planet particularly in a region thought to be spared of this kind of disaster the [Music] Mediterranean in nice thousands of tourists enjoy the pleasures of the [Music] beach but a Stones throw away a team of scientists from the Geo aor laboratory are in search of the cause of a forgotten disaster [Music] digging through Regional archives researchers discovered that on February 23rd 1887 an earthquake followed by a 2 m High tsunami hit the coast of France and Italy from nice to Genoa 600 died and tens of thousands lost their homes today 2 million people live along the riv era can such a disaster happen again jer for the fault at the source of the 1887 earthquake to assess its condition Two Italian scientists taramelli and marali recorded at the time in a very precise way all the destruction that happened on the coast we have 2700 observations points between France and Italy Christoph L and his team used these photographs taken at the time of the disaster to establish a map of the earthquake intensity the more important the damage the closer The Source it led them to locate its epicenter off the coast of Imperia but identifying the exact fault responsible for this tsunami is a delicate task because this seismic zone is one of the most complex in the world the African plate in the South Rises toward the EUR Asian plate in the north pushing Corsica and Sardinia against the Riviera generating numerous seismic faults how can the fault responsible for the 1887 tsunami be identified we seismic investigation equipment which consists essentially of cannons which are a source of waves which will permit us to obtain a sonogram of the inside of the earth up to 15 km deep these waves will be recorded by the sensors we have with in the line a line that is 6 km long dragged behind the boat after 5 days at Sea the ultrasound reveals not one but three faults below the sea floor their location 30 km from the coast corresponds to the epicenter of the 1887 earthquake the morphology of the fault suggests that they are still active and allows the scientists to model two possible tsunami scenarios the first scenario is an earthquake equivalent to that of 1887 with a 6.7 magnitude which would break a fault length of about 30 km with wave heights of 2 m the second extreme scenario is to envisage a rupture over almost the entire length of the fault for example 60 to 80 km which would then produce an earthquake of magnitude 7 and wave heights that could reach 3 to 4 M the Mediterranean the world tourist destination is at risk but scientists cannot predict when such an event might occur since 2012 the region has been monitored 24 hours a day by senal a tsunami warning center evacuation plans have been drawn up with a focus on nce but the reality Remains the rupture of a fault located 30 km from the coast only allows a 20 minute evacuation time before the wave breaks M even a small tsunami can be very devastating a wave breaking on the beach with a speed of around 40 kmph will create extremely strong currents in which people cannot swim Mediterranean beaches just like many beaches in the Indian Ocean are very high risk the reason is that in the summer we can have tens of thousands of beit visitors on a beach with the possibility of a tsunami arriving you know within a few minutes coastlines are popular with locals and tourists all over the world this makes tsunami warning systems all the more [Music] necessary in Palo where Costa sakis and Herman Fritz continue their investigation a tsunami warning system was set up after the tragedy of 2004 so why were there so many victims 15 years later there were a lot of food vendors right here a lot of people there was a rumble like this people were shouting all over the place the water is rising the water is rising according to this witness the crowd in the streets along the beach was completely surprised by the wave no alert reached this area the investigation continues at the tsunami Monitoring Center in the Indonesian Capital Jakarta this control tower monitors seismic activity throughout Indonesia including the Bay of paloo here seismologists can detect any earthquake at Sea in real time Advanced algorithms allow them to simulate the formation of a tsunami and warn people before the first wave hits since its implementation in 2008 22 alerts have been issued and countless lives have been saved then why on September 28th 2018 was no warning received in poo that night seismologist Kean peros sinki was on duty at the time of the earthquake in paloo the magnitude was seven for 2 minutes then just afterwards the magnitude Rose to 7.7 at that time I ran to the toist table it table in the early evening an earthquake 80 km north of the bay was clearly detected by Jakarta the epicenter is here paloo is there according to the simulation this earthquake presented only a moderate risk of a tsunami never nevertheless an alert was triggered within the prescribed time limit 5 minutes after the earthquake so what [Music] happened costakis will discover the answer thanks to surveillance cameras Friday September 28th at 602 p.m. the earthquake hits the Bay of paloo it lasts a little over a minute how did you feel about the earthquake was it really incredible you couldn under camera 2 I was hanging onto the gate and then it calmed down and I came out that after the earthquake because he tunami will come they it doesn occur in the open sea and yet it did happen right here these these images provide researchers with crucial information time the clock displayed on the videos reveals that barely 2 minutes elaps between the end of the earthquake and the onset of the tsunami never before was such overpowering speed recorded the warning signal launched by the Jakarta control system was triggered after the arrival of the wave when all communication systems on Pao were already destroyed what is very alarming to me is that here the earthquake triggered the tsunami very quickly so we need to understand how this happens and also what is the timing how quickly after after the earthquake hits the tsunami comes in according to the Jakarta Center simulation a wave born close to the epicenter 80 km north of the bay should have taken about 15 minutes to reach Pao not 2 minutes this tsunami defies all known patterns how could the wave arrive so quickly to figure it out the researchers take to the air it bird because by being up on the air in a helicopter it allows us to see how this wave came in and see the extent of the inundation a first observation is surprising Devastation alternates with untouched areas but that all for on see get outside of the bay the wave disappears very quickly and you Indonesian beaches so that already allows to confine The Zone where to look for further for the sources to inside the bay if the wave that devastated poo had formed in the ocean the entire Coast would have been hit for Herman Fritz and Costa sakis the epicenter identified by the Jakarta warning center could not have directly generated the killer wave the sour of the tsunami must be inside the bay itself Herman Fritz and his Indonesian colleague gagar parasa returned to the West Bank to understand how the tsunami could have originated in this sheltered area gagar partia has collected new footage filmed nearby the BART is still over there the same position yeah so then you can see also the background of this uh events and then this is when they started the the land [Applause] [Music] slide yeah local Landslide uh co- seismic triggered by the earthquake you have a small semicircular wave that you can even see in the video yeah so I think this is going to be a localized impact from this Landslide tsunami uh you have a lot of ALU material here so I think once you shake it it will go for Herman Fritz the low intensity of this first wave film at the very moment of its birth suggests it was triggered by a very localized phenomenon a coastal Landslide here we have evidence because we have a coastal scarp okay so the scarp actually is along the shoreline the land went into the ocean and so we have a coastal Landslide I don tsunami is big enough to be the main source of the tsunami that wiped away Pao or vanani on the other side of the Bay surveying the entire Bay researchers discover several other similar landslides all sources of many tsunamis but it is by looking further Inland that the full story of the palut tsunami finally becomes clear look this is pretty amazing here rift the Tremors open it then closed it and opened it again a few hundred meters away a second witness points out the extent of the destruction it collapsed all the way down there all the way to the mosque in ikra all the houses collaps at the same time from south to North like the slope of the house an immense fault line cuts through the town and then extends into the bay for tens of kilometers researchers finally have the answer it is this fault that caused the Palo tsunami after 5 days of field investigation and months of data analysis the sequence of events is finally reconstructed on September 28 2018 at 6:02 p.m. a 7.2 magnitude earthquake occurs 80 km north of Pao the epicenter correctly identified by the Jakarta control center does not directly trigger the tsunami the seismic wave travels by land at an extreme speed of 900 km per hour triggering the fault that crosses the entire Bay within 2 minutes landslides are provoked all along the coast generating several mini tsunamis the energy of all these mini tsunamis accumulates inside the bay combining to form a powerful wave that sweeps across the town Herman Fritz and Costa cis investigation has come to an end their reconstruction of the Bay of Palo tsunami will help improve Warning Systems all over the world we used to think that tsunamis only strike in areas where you have subduction zones we now know just like what happened here that tsunamis can strike pretty much any place where you can have an earthquake we are very concerned about this because similar earthquakes could take place in Seattle they could take place in Southern California they could take place in the Caribbean and they could take place in the Mediterranean What walls of water what winds what Thunder what a horrible earthquake what a frightening sound of the sea and what howling of a great people these words by the great Italian poet petrarch describe a strange storm over the city of Naples in the 14th century it fear in the face of the destructive power of nature 700 years later the vulcanologist mara Rosie who works on emergency plans for the city of Naples was intrigued by petar fault ruptures cause most tsunamis volcanic eruptions can also trigger them pet was the exceptional witness of a phenomenon that struck the city of Naples he was sleeping not far from the port when he heard strange noises so powerful that he thought it was an earthquake petar ran towards the port like the majority of the population and saw with his own eyes the port completely devastated along with the destruction petar reports hundreds of deaths and dozens of sunken ships according to marosi this strange storm is clearly a tsunami at that time pet could not have known that it was a tsunami since they were unknown in the Middle Ages now today we know for sure that this phenomenon was caused by a tsunami to determine if such a tragedy could be repeated today the volcanologist is looking for the source of the tsunami that devastated the port of Naples in 1343 but there is no historical account of an eruption of the suus theous famous volcano that dominates Naples in the 14th century soara Rosie focuses his attention on another volcano one of the most active in the region stroli but it Naples in 2002 an eruption caused the collapse of one of its walls generating a 10m high wave all around the island the waves spread through the trinian sea and although very weak reached the Bay of Naples could it be that a much larger eruption on stroli triggered the tsunami described by petrarch 700 years ago on the slopes of the volcano archaeologist Sarah Levy excavates the remains of a small collapsed Church she provides Mara Rosie with his first Clues we know that a dramatic event occurred due to the sudden collapse of the building probably caused by a powerful earthquake because large blocks of stone were found inside on the floor of the church in order to date the past activity of strumble archaeologists examined three skeletons found in the remains of the church this skeleton was in a grave pit that was dug through the layer of collapsed tiles that fell down when the church collapsed so this person was definitely a witness um of the catastrophe possibly a victim possibly a Survivor this skeleton has been dated by carbon 14 in the middle Decades of the 14th century the date of the earthquake that shook the island of stroli coincides with a disaster in the Bay of Naples described by petar yet another detail reveals the magnitude of the event when the church collapsed it was not rebuilt which is surprising and indicates a major change in human occupation at this location it is likely that the island was abandoned until the 1600s this dramatic event was so violent that for more than 200 years 10 Generations the island of stroi remain unoccupied following these Revelations Mar rosi starts his own excavations he wants to find Clues linking the activity of the volcano to the tsunami described by petrarch in 1343 at a depth of more than 4 M the volcanologist finally uncovers a fabulous deposit this tsunami deposit is by far the largest we dated it to 1350 as evidenced by the materials in it look at the size of these perfectly round rocks they must have come from the beach the presence of such consistent elements proves that the tsunami was driven by an extraordinary force all the facts coincide the powerful wave that projected these rocks 200 M from the beach occurred at precisely the same time as the Earth earthquake that destroyed the small Church on the island for marosi there is a clear link between the eruption of the volcano and the tsunami Lara Del fuo it is on this impressive slope that all the volcanic material ejected by stomo accumulates 700 years ago following an eruption the volcanologist believes that the Chiara Del foko suddenly shed its millions of tons of accumulated debris causing a tsunami that spread to the Bay of Naples given the current activity of strumble it detritus on the Shara Delo would be comparable to that of the Shara at the time Petro describes the [Music] tsunami for Mara rosi the landslide caused by the 2019 eruption is a harbinger of a much more serious disaster to come the Chiara that foko could collapse into the sea at any moment the island of stroi is monitored 24 hours a day to alert the authorities inhabitants and tourists but what about Naples what would be the consequences of a tsunami hitting a city of 1 million inhabitants the population is completely unaware that a tsunami from strumble could hit Naples in the case of infrequent natural phenomenon people tend to believe that there is no imminent danger researchers at the University of bolognia have made a model of the path of the 1343 tsunami it gives an idea of what could happen today it would take barely 30 minutes for the tsunami to leave strum and hit the Gulf of Naples and here the consequences would be unbelievable all the boats in the harbor behind me would be thrown into the streets the water would rush into the subway and drown its occupants the streets full of people would be submerged it would really be an apocalyptic scenario if we weren to sound the [Music] alarm earthquakes fault slides volcanic eruptions all sorts of tectonic activity can trigger tsunamis research carried out over the last 15 years has made it possible to perfect Warning Systems and better adapt them to each risk Zone in Japan a country at the Forefront of tsunami science the technology is the most advanced here researchers know exactly where the next disaster will come from [Music] these images are not those of a disaster movie but a public service announcement from the Japanese authorities broadcast in March of 2018 it population for a tsunami that scientist give an 80% chance of occurring in the next 30 Years the film explains how to react and behave but also predicts the likely scale of the disaster 350,000 victims and widespread damage that would affect the Japanese economy for at least 20 years the cause the rupture of the nankai fault that runs along the west coast of the country for 900 km the threat of the nankai trough is very specific because it is located in front of all the economic centers of Japan whether Tokyo Osaka Nagoya all these cities are in vulnerable areas no technology can predict an earthquake but the Japanese have set up an extensive monitoring system to immediately warn the population it The Fault knowing when it will move and being able to sound the alarm as quickly as possible and for that we have the donet system which is just outside osako Bay the donet system is the most sophisticated seismic detector in the world 29 un underwater mini observatories pressure sensors seismometers accelerometers are installed directly on the fault line off the coast of Osaka to give the alert as soon as the first Tremors occur tsunami the tsunami would arrive between 3 and 5 minutes in the first cities with waves of 20 to 30 m then the wave enters Osaka Bay and floods parts of Osaka parts of coob and especially all the islands that have been artificially created depending on the scenario we expect waves of 3 to 5 m and that would take between 30 and 45 [Music] minutes in order to establish the most effective evacuation plans and test protective walls the disaster prevention center at Kyoto University simulates the effects of a nankai fa tsunami in a pool we will be an earthquake of at least magnitude 9.0 and that it will cause a tsunami Professor hiri recreates the arrival of a wave with an average height of 20 M the equivalent of a six-story building on a city directly facing the nanai fault in spite of seaw walls built to reduce the energy of the Waves Coastal buildings would quickly be submerged under several meters of water these pool simulations are supplemented by virtual simulations one developed by Professor hii progression of a tsunami in Tokyo bay although it is 5 km from the sea the area around the Olympic Stadium could be hit by a 9 M high wave simulation simulations are carried out to determine hazardous locations for example a road will be hit by a wave very fast so you should not take refuge there this building will have its entrance blocked by the current of the tsunami so you should not go there these models enable Koto University to create an interactive evacuation plan in the event of an alert a mobile phone application shows the progression of the waves and designates the nearest protected areas we our cell phones on the internet when you watch TV you have messages coming to you too and they tell you where you have to run to be safe fleeing and finding Refuge is essential but limiting the impact of Destruction is just as important as the 2011 tsunami demonstrated Port areas are among the most dangerous sites ships can become giant projectiles for Professor Hashimoto of the University of coob evacuating them quickly in the event of an alert is a priority Osaka Bay is very Lively every day and at any given moment there are 30 to 50 boats sailing there we have no guarantee that in the event of a tsunami a situation that may have never experienced everyone would keep their cool and that the ships would evacuate one after the other in an orderly fashion that is why we artificial intelligence system which will enable ships to evacuate or maneuver automatically despite technological advances Japan is living on borrowed time like Osaka a megalopolis of 8 million inhabitants and the country Center a City built over time on embankments below sea level surrounded by hundreds of kilometers of protective walls what happened in 2011 was that the earthquake had weakened all the structures part of the walls had fallen with the Quake so when the tsunami came what we thought was effective was no longer [Music] effective to date even the most sophisticated Technologies cannot predict earthquakes these artificial Islands reclaimed from the sea built with houses shopping centers and petrochemical industries could be destroyed in an instant faced with coming disaster only educ education and informed reactions of the population will make it possible to save [Music] lives we think we nature dominates us around the world the science of tsunamis is making great strides but each new disaster challenges the progress that has been made to better protect [Music] us if we build power plants hospitals public buildings houses in areas that there is a high Hazard we are adding layers and layers of vulnerability and with time what we world is that our vulnerability from disasters keeps increasing instead of diminishing the shoreline has always attracted humankind but its rapid urbanization creates more and more Danger while ever more sophisticated Technologies allow us to be alerted as soon as possible learning to read nature with common sense remains more vital than ever we say this worldwide if you near the coast and you feel any kind of ground shaking that lasts more than 15 seconds move away from the beach [Music]	Success

[Music] prolific in just 1 ml of fresh water there are a million of them in a single gram of soil over 40 million together they weigh more than all the plants and animals in the world [Music] humans may think they rule the world but in reality they planet whose first inhabitants were bacteria all living beings are covered with them on the inside as well as the [Music] outside in a human body there are 100 trillion of them we bacterial than human by about 10 to 100 fold we truly are are less human than we think bacteria are generally very misunderstood people think bacteria mean Illness but that fact very few bacteria are dangerous to humans the fact is the relationship that plants and animals have to bacteria is often beneficial to both these beneficial relationships are called [Music] symbiosis I can animal that us we couldn bacteria symbiosis has played a fundamental role in the evolution of [Music] life we found out during the course of the 20th century that associations between symbiotic species were more common than we thought and are definitely one of the greatest mtiv of evolution [Music] deep down at the bottom of the ocean lies The Mysterious World of the Abyss here in the greatest desert in the world there animals but when in the 1970s oceanographers discovered the first deep sea vents the phenomenal amount of animal life they found there in an environment hitherto thought hostile to all life forms raised a lot of questions could bacteria really survive in such extreme conditions were they responsible for this profusion of Life Could symbiosis explain these creatures extraordinary success to find answers to these questions the biob oceanographic Expedition founded and led by professor frois laer of the rosov biological station in Britany took us in search of Secrets hidden since the dawn of time many fathoms Beneath the Sea we SES out in the middle of the Atlantic there are 32 scientists on board and they [Music] biology the state-of-the-art

right here among all the chimney systems created by the geysers hides the first creature the scientists want to study the rarus shrimp these chimneys covered in cracks are the only ones that release

cm at the surface the atmospheric pressure is just 1 kilo per square cm [Music] we ourselves are organisms that contain gas if we are compressed to 300 Bars our thoracic cage is immediately squashed which of course means instant [Music] death fortunately these deep sea organisms contain no gases it fluidity of cellular membranes we know that if we vary pressure then fluidity varies too and membranes hold all an organism transmission neural transmission chemical transmission Etc from the moment you disturb any of an organism membrane passages if the variations and pressur are too much the organism will die [Music] at sea level pressure the Rari shrimps of the rainbow vent cannot survive longer than a few days but their Anatomy Still Remains intact enough to be studied [Music] dissection of their digestive tube reveals the first Enigma of these creatures strange way of life apart from a few morsels of rock that they their intestines contain no food at all the shrimp doesn their feeding habits so what then do they live on the researchers naturally turned their attention to the strange crustacean takes up half the creatur very big normally it third when they like ordinary shrimps and at a certain point in their development they metamorphose a bit like a caterpillar turning into a butterfly the head becomes so enormous and the shell too that the shrimp can graze anymore and can feed no wonder they digestive tubes almost empty as for the huge head that the terrific size of the chamber that holds the gills the animal organ when they take a look inside that chamber the biologists get a big surprise there are billions of bacteria living there the bacteria have to get into the Gil cavity so that creates really long filaments and they also get into the scaphognathite which is a kind of Blade that pulsates in the syph thoracic cavity to create a current of water and has long bristles on it that are covered in bacteria microbiological analysis shows that these resonant bacteria are always the same species in the absence of a true functioning digestive system the researchers wonder if when it comes to food there isn relationship between the shrimps and their vast colonies of bacteria a kind of symbiosis even but to find out more about this strange relationship you have to work with healthy shrimp specimens that haven decompression and that Chelo trip to the rainbow site with the help of a revolutionary new high-press aquarium system [Music] uh to thrive with such success in such different environments bacteria must have an amazing amazing ability to adapt the next step of the mission will be to verify this hypothesis at another [Music] site so the course is set for Lucky Strike another volcano discovered in 1992 down at a depth of 1700 m [Music] [Music] the deep sea geysers at Lucky Strike aren Rainbow so they haven spectacular tall black and gray chimneys [Music] over the decades they have Simply Built up a succession of little Hills [Music] [Music] the whitish carpets that surround the Lucky Strike geysers are actually vast colonies of bacteria visible to the naked eye the first thing you notice are these big layers of microbes like big yellowish white carpets that cover the sediments of the seabed and the ends of the chimneys and the extraordinary thing is that they that float in the current these carpets of bacteria are flirting dangerously with the scalding emissions of fluid probes placed by the team right inside the chimneys show temperatures of over 350° but as they mix with the seawat that of less than a meter the temperature of the fluids drops to less than 30° thus creating conditions that favor the development of most species of [Music] bacteria the chemical composition of the fluids though presents all the characteristics of an environment hostile to most life forms they are highly acidic and contain radioactive elements heavy metals and highly toxic molecules such as sulfurs from our point of view of course what with the pressure the temperature and the chemicals because there are plenty of compounds there that would be toxic to animal life the conditions look extreme for these bacteria it their habitat and they there researchers have discovered that the bacteria Feast on the volcanic fluids as if they were nectar all those toxic elements deadly poisons for us are for them a source of nourishment [Music] [Applause] obviously we find our human environment a more welcoming place than a volcanic Abyss but these bacteria have no need of a human body they here not many scientists know more about the role bacteria play in our lives than Laura Hooper in some ways we can consider the intestine and maybe even the skin an extreme environment in that these bacteria have to cope with an immune system for example that grenades at them all the time um they have to cope with shifts in PH as they travel through the stomach into the intestine and vast changes in [Music] diet bacteria remarkable for billions of years they were the only living creatures to colonize the deep sea geysers but across millions of years of evolution some enterprising creatures from the surface have adapted to the conditions here and even managed to settle in [Music] permanently so who are they these pioneers and how do they withstand the extreme conditions [Music] Jose Sara leads an animal ecology team that specializes in deep sea geysers to gauge the capacity of animals to colonize new ground around the geysers she has come with a system of artificial habitats made up of slate wood Muslim and even beef bones no the whole range of them is laid out close to the fluids and recuperated sometimes a few days later but more often the following year during the next expedition in the space of just a few days bacteria from the surrounding w water have managed to settle on all the different [Music] habitats in their turn they have soon attracted dozens of local species of a particular kind of animal the grazers the first animals fed directly on the bacteria just like cows at pure they came to graze the fields of bacteria millions of years ago thanks to the bacteria that formed the basis of their diet the very first animal species from the surface were able to survive in the vicinity of the deep sea geysers there are little gastropods little sea snails there are also little amphipods little crustations that graze on the bacteria [Music] colonization of the geysers of the Abyss could have ended there with the grazers content just to eat the bacteria they found without establishing any further relationship to them but the grazers have had nothing like the success of other species that have gone on to develop gigantic colonies species like the so-called aoran deep muscles which are particularly numerous at Lucky [Music] Strike one of the aims of the biob baz program is to find out the reasons for this exceptional [Music] success the next Dives of the robot Victor will be entirely dedicated to the in-depth study of the deep muscles way of life whereas ricari shrimp are only to be found at depths of more than 2,000 M deep muscles are present wherever there are hot geysers [Music] the Lucky Strike deep muscles are harvested a depths of less than 2,000 M and stand up well to the decompression the scientists can simply transport them in plexiglass boxes [Music] what deep muscle is the sheer size of its gills in this muscle we found bacteria in the gills and in great abundance too there are no bacterial filaments visible on the outside though unlike with the ricari shrimp the Deep Muscle bacteria live right inside the cells of the gills a very rare phenomenon the cells on the surface of the thousands of little filaments that make up each Gill have the specific task of grow growing internal bacteria it through a fluorescent microscope the nucleus of the cell is blue the hundreds of little red and green blobs are all bacteria comfortably lodged right inside each specialized [Music] cell so the bacteria pull off the amazing feat of foiling the cell immune systems to get inside them and and once in to stay [Music] there the animal has to be able to regulate the rate of growth of the bacteria within its own cells in certain types of cells the bacteria are allowed even encouraged to develop whereas in all the other tissues there are no symbiotic bacteria to be found at all but the muscles don the presence of the bacteria they make sure that their guests can eat their food muscles are in fact like filters they circulate water through their gills there sulfurs a bit of methane and a bit of dissolved carbon so everything the bacteria need is there and since the water circulating their environment is constantly being [Music] refreshed this relationship between the bacteria and the muscle is most peculiar it millions of years of an intimate relationship the bacteria were progressively becoming part of the very cells of the [Music] muscle to measure to what extent the Deep muscles are dependent on the bacteria and the cells of their gills the scientists at biob are going to try a little experiment 1700 M Under the Sea it consists of putting a few dozen muscles in cages at a distance from the source of the [Music] fluids when we take them out of their natural habitat the bacteria get no more sulfurs no more methane so they have nothing to live on [Music] away from the fluids the bacteria cease to multiply and eventually disappear and without their crop of bacteria the muscles only survive for two or three days what is the reason for this fundamental dependence the gills are like their Larder where they grow their bacteria astonishing as it may seem each of these specialized cells is constantly digesting within itself a small part of its personal stock of bacteria we also think the bacteria are capable of releasing compounds for example as a bacteria grows up it will release sugars around it within the cell of the animal by way of the blood circulation molecules from the intracellular bacteria in the gills actually feed all the muscle [Music] cells so it symbiosis between animal and bacteria and it have done so well in such extreme conditions an intracellular symbiosis like this is a very rare phenomenon in biology it Discovery since it demonstrates the fundamental role that bacteria have played in the most important phases of evolution as long as 2 billion years ago the symbiotic Fusion of two bacteria in a process resembling that of intracellular symbiosis was possibly at the origin of the first cell with a nucleus soon after that the incorporation of a bacteria enabled cells with nuclei to breathe oxygen and evolve ever more complex organisms all the way up to mammals and to the human [Music] species a few hundred minut million years later it was once again symbiosis with a bacteria that would allow cells to photosynthesize and enable algae and all the Earth evolve so two of the most easily recognizable characteristics of plants and animals come from bacteria that they breathe or in the case of plants photosynthesize these both originate from symbiosis with bacteria [Music] these huge populations of symbiotic muscles became an important food source for other animals coming from the surface this third type of animal was neither a grazer nor a symbiotic they were predators scavengers and bottom feeders they may be the spitting image of their cousins at the surface but these carnivores have adapted so well to the extreme physical and chemical conditions here that they have become species specific to the deep sea geysers take the mirari shrimp for instance a distant cousin of the rimicaris with its huge head or the Sean zasia crab both of them scavengers and bottom feers these native species spend their whole lives around the sources of volcanic fluids and are perfectly happy [Music] [Music] here but at another nearby site 800 M deep there crab the chassan this big crustation doesn the geyser to time drawn by all those muscles unlike the local crabs the chians can emissions and often Come Away with painful Burns [Music] but their daring is rewarded with copious meals [Music] [Music] those huge Banquets have their downside though all the creatures of the deep sea geysers have had to get used to the presence everywhere in the water and in their food of a lot of toxins top of the list hydrogen sulfide there fluids it so bad it with the air gives off a very nasty smell it for example is highly toxic because it replaces the oxygen in the hemoglobins so if you breathe in Sulfur it can asfixiate you so the local inhabitants have adapted to the need to detoxify these chemical elements but what is the strange hair that most of the crabs seem to be covered with well guess what it bacteria generally if a bacteria can Lodge itself on an animal that means it animal when the bacteria draw heavy metals or elements like sulfur they transform them in order to grow and so what they put back into the environment is less toxic than what they took in that detoxification the bacteria grow on the crabs because they like it there it like having their own chauffeur-driven ride one that keeps them neither too near nor too far from those nourishing fluid streams it is indeed a kind of external bacterial symbiosis [Music] we ourselves also wear an Overcoat of bacteria but ours is totally invisible our bodies contain 10 times more bacteria than cells the mucous membranes of our respiratory system and genitals as well as the insides of our digestive tube are carpeted and the surface of our body covered with them it a million bacteria per square centimeter of skin and interestingly if you wash your hands that will go down but only very temporarily so 30 minutes later they back they are making their home there so that other pathogenic bacteria have are less likely to be able to um successfully colonize um but they also stimulate the immune system of the skin and so that confers some protection as well our best friends are the bacteria on our skin in exchange we feed them with the dead cells that are the product of the constant renewal of our epidermal dermis just as with the crabs down in the abyss it of mutual [Music] Aid let where the ricari shrimp has carved out its little domain to further their research on the relationship between the shrimps and the bacteria they carry in their outsized heads the team needs to be able to observe some healthy specimens that haven brutal decompression Bruce shilo come up with a little technological Jewel made up of two parts Periscope and Bist that can bring shrimps up to the surface while maintaining the pressure from down below it only machine that can connect with a cell that can itself Harvest quite sizable animals of course we about giant squid but 5 cm shrimps is still pretty good with food preservation we talk about the cold chain but here we talking about the pressure chain from the place they were caught right up to where they pressure of the seabed and maintain the most natural conditions possible Bist the more complex part of the system stays on board the boat its impressive stainless steel structure weighs nearly 400 kilos and means it can recreate the extreme pressure conditions of the Abyss it works like an airlock a bit like on a space shuttle like a craft that comes and connects to the space station to supply it we pressurize the water lock the connection then once everything open the main valves just a quarter of a turn and we can transfer the animals just by tipping it all in the first into action though is Periscope the movable part it is placed on the elevator a freestanding module that shuttles up and down from the surface during Victor Dives which can last up to 36 hours the mission of the robots Pilots is to catch 20 ricari shrimps inside a sealed tube they call the periscop [Music] first stage accomplished [Music] Victor straight away takes control of periscop which is a few hundred meters away on the [Music] elevator fitting the periscoped full of shrimps into periscop steel cylinder is the most delicate maneuver of the whole operation [Music] [Music] now it powerful valve that will maintain the deep sea pressure all the way to the surface [Music] after a few minutes the elevator casts off its ballast and its buoyancy carries it back up to the surface [Music] back on board Bruce Shilo is preparing a cozy nest for his guests inside Bist the shrimps will be quite at home the water is at 8° and the pressure is around 230 kilos per square cm through the window of 3 cm thick Sapphire the scientists can observe the animals throughout the [Music] experiments that it watch the handle the last phase of the operation is to connect periscop up to B East without any loss of pressure one two three is that good for you guys on the trolley there put it down gently that it okay put it where it usually goes so it clear it almost almost a bit further onto the plate keep sliding more more slide it a bit more okay that now we unscrew it that it before we opens the powerful water lock Bruce has to balance to the nearest gram the pressure in both Bist and Periscope now I balance it with Bist so the water Lock okay now for this okay only now can they transfer the rimicaris but despite the sloping angle of the system the Periscope at refuses to go down it looks like one of the valves isn aligned I think I hit it I felt like it was going in there it going through it [Music] fine you got something going on your end right wait I it we messed it up once with Gerard and all three of us were banging on the tube there okay wait the shrimps can survive in side bast for up to 4 days in the aquarium we can control the temperature we can control the flow and pressure and that allows us to carry out a lot of interesting experiments the various experiments carried out using the Periscope Bist system will to a surprising discovery we shrimps grazed on the inside of their Gill cavity that it was like a growing chamber and that they scratched to the bacteria there to eat them but then we found out that the covering of bacteria was never actually scratched or damaged unlike the Deep Muscle the shrimp does not eat the bacteria in its Gill cavity on the contrary the research shows that the bacteria actually feed their host just by transferring molecules the bacteria produce organic molecules that are diffused by passing through the skin of the animal this must mean that the internal surface of the Gill chamber lets food molecules through directly into the creature news could it mean that there comparison between the huge head of the shrimp and our own large intestine which also contains billions of bacteria human intestinal bacteria help us to digest we have our gastric juices of course but they can everything we eat we think it less the same thing for the Remy cares basically it intestines in its [Music] head however the change between the ricari shrimp and its bacteria goes a lot further than that between our intestines and theirs a human being has to ingest a certain amount of vegetable or animal sustenance every day which helps to build up the body structure the main purpose of our intestinal bacteria is to help us digest our f food they we can utilize they down dietary substances like uh complex polysaccharides that we don enzymes to digest um so they very beneficial to our our digestion in that [Music] way but it Rari shrimps they don eat the molecules they need to survive are entirely Prov ided by their bacteria It organized [Music] anyway for True symbiosis to occur the relationship has to be beneficial to both parties so what here for the bacteria the shrimp provides a bacteria with a closed cavity where nothing else can get at them to eat them well the shrimp provides them with a home of course but it also invites them to dinner it provides constant access to the sulfur and other energy sources present in the volcanic streams the shrimp forth into the heat but not for too long like oh ouch that off a bit but the bacteria get their hydrothermal fluids that enable them to multiply and prosper and to provide the shrimp with its organic matter it though sometimes you come across shrimps whose shells are burnt and have bits of them damaged and this is certainly because they have been burnt by them our intestines too offer food and board to a vast community of bacteria they enjoy a safe environment and accept in very hard times all the food they can eat it turns out uh that it mutually beneficial relationship [Music] scientists have made enormous progress in understanding these remarkable symbiosis but there to learn how and when for example do the baby deep muscles or ricari shrimps first acquire their bacteria the researchers have just found the first seed of an answer to this with the ricari shrimps [Music] this is definitely a very mysterious creature and we don cycle they carry a few eggs under their abdomen until they have a young larvae that can swim and we find bacteria on the outside of the eggs it would appear that the bacteria are already there on their [Music] eggs the human fetus by contrast protected in its mother completely sterile the mother impenetrable barrier to any [Music] bacteria so for us the whole question of bacteria only starts at the moment of our [Music] birth early in life the bacteria that occupied the neonate are generally from the mother microbial Flora but the developing child in the case of humans quickly acquires its own microbiota and this develops into an adult microbiota during the the first years of [Music] life man is just one piece of Earth great biological puzzle where it bacteria who reign supreme that beauty of bacteria they can adapt to anything so to them from their perspective probably nothing is is an extreme environment bacteria may have been the very first living beings on Earth but they complex life forms on the contrary they helped stimulated and accompany the evolution of life [Music] the remarkable success of the bacterial symbiosis found down in the abyss have shed a lot of light on the fundamental importance of mutual Aid between creatures when it comes to maintaining life on Earth including our own here down in the Deep acidic burning geysers of the Abyss it itself had opened its jaws to show us how symbiosis is the key to the future of all life on Earth [Music]	Success

sleep how to open our front doors and even the rhythm of our heartbeats Alexa where are my keys your keys are in your bedroom at 8:30 a.m. you have a [Music] meeting the Internet isn now it limbs eyes ears and even a brain each device we connect to the internet becomes part of it now but are these devices at our service or are they secretly pulling the strings today the internet is everywhere listening to us influencing us becoming part of us but if the internet now has a body how far can it reach the internet is an intelligence amplifier but almost everything that you can think of a positive and beneficial use for there human beings they don of our biological tissue tools are appendages extensions of who we are and those tools shape our Behavior as much as we shape them as start to be on the internet and interconnected the number of things that could go wrong is just going to grow little robots are doing more things for us than we realize there are now billions of networked sensors they make up what is called The Internet of Things it develop a nervous system the merging of a lot of these Technologies is is going to lead to the first true machine intelligence and then what you never can be too careful it devices before the devices control us but we without the work of one man Doug angelart Doug angelart Doug angelart Doug angelart Doug angelart Doug was as monomaniacal as anybody I through his entire life he was focused on one thing intelligence augmentation the notion was that human beings were real pretty good but with computers we could be a lot better he imagined network computing in a way that was both highly Technical and highly idealistic even utopian if in your office you were supplied with a computer that was alive for you all day instantly responsive to every action you had how much value could you derive from that it was in the fall of 1968 when Doug engelbart staged what has come to be known as the mother of all demos come in menal [Music] park okay there Minal Park several thousand computer Engineers were in a hall and they saw Doug engelbart up on a screen using a computer to communicate with people who were not in the same room I to have us bring in Jeff rulon from Meno Park he been working independently hi Jeff and it was the first time many of them had ever seen computers as a true communication tool Suddenly at that moment that room full of people began to imagine not just computers but computer networks and art is actually the person who invents the computer mouse was kind of like um a little wooden box that you could move around with your hand you think about that for a moment it something that really accommodates the computer to the human body to the human hand you can see the devices that I using du a portrait mode display black on white so it looked like a piece of paper it so you could Point through things on the screen controls through potentiometer he invented hyperlink so that you could connect a document to another document if I want I can say the library what am I supposed to pick up there I can just point to that and oh I see overdue books and all this was a system which for all practical purposes was the worldwide web in a box thank you very much for coming to the dedication [Music] ceremonies engelbart and his lab actually helped humanize the computer the computer would bring us together and by bringing us together would let us be more fully human Steve Jobs was the first one to really get this we Builders and that to me it we equivalent of a bicycle for our [Music] minds three things a widescreen iPod with touch controls a revolutionary mobile phone and a breakthrough internet communications device are you getting it these are not three separate devices this is one device and we are calling it [Music] iPhone iPhone [Applause] I remember when the iPhone was first announced back in 2007 I could absolutely not wait to get one and when I finally did get my hands on one it felt like I was living in the future and now I can hardly remember what it was like to live without this it metal that has all the answers all the world can some summon cars that can move mountains that can make people do things all by rubbing a magic mirror and no place has embraced that magic more than Silicon Valley here you see the smartphone everywhere but it next generation of smart devices is currently incubating to see them I visit to Beta Palo alto store for digital devices hi welcome to Beta thank you have you been in before I have not I Katrina nice to meet you nice to meet you everything here is out of the box so you can touch it feel it interact with it see how it life it so you can create lightscapes a bright day a Sunset date night movie night you no longer have to carry your keys you can control it directly from your app 3D video viewing wo any command that you would be able to give your phone you can do through the button it will automatically water for you you can interact with it you can touch it and talk to it put it on your keys you can put it on your kid your dog your backpack whatever now we haven yet oh my goodness I want one the beta store feels like a toy store for grown-ups but as I was about to find out it research lab where they collecting data about you our store was made to bring the best parts about the internet to Brick and Mortar retail Although our Store does sell products we make no money from selling products which is very unusual on the in the brick-and Water World in fact we the only store like that how do you make a profit if you not making any money off selling products we have this really unique business model for retail where we directly rent space to companies and we partner with a company called retail next retail next has figured out how to use computer vision from overhead cameras to understand how people shop in stores at the beta store the most important sensor isn shelves it [Music] ceiling as you interact with products these cameras are watching you measuring how much time you spend at each station [Music] and learning what you like and the customers don necessarily that they or if anything like this is the most naive version of tracking out there I came to Beta to look at smart devices but I was surprised to discover that they were actually looking at me to learn more about how smart cameras help retailers like beta I paid a visit to the maker of the sensor retail next wouldn Shopper to know what catches her [Music] eye introducing Aurora by retail next the first all-in-one sensor designed specifically for the complex needs of retail the Next Generation sensor for Shopper measurement so walk me through this uh you know someone comes into the store what sorts of data could you tell about that person you can tell a lot about the type of person coming into the store male female approximate age and you can capture a lot of information about their path through the store can I just back you up how how can you tell age and gender of the people walking into a store yeah so it it works very simil to how human eyes work but it automatically if you want to understand the type of customer shops a particular store at a particular time you can do that quite well retail NEX cameras help retailers identify and Target their best customers but other analytics companies take facial recognition to a new level the system does not need an exaggerated expression the system can also detect micro expressions some use cameras that can tell how you feel about a [Music] product whether you like it or [Music] not but while cameras are very useful sensors for retailers they compared to the one we have on us all the time our smartphone they want to use the unique identifiers that are associated with your cell phone to find out where you shop how long you linger in which section of the store for retailers your smartphone is like your digital fingerprint it tells them if you visited their store before and when you were there last if 10 years ago someone said to you would you mind if I planted a little tracking device on you that would tell me where you are what you what you talking to and what you hours a day would that be okay you hell no you kidding I I would never let you do that now people sleep in front of the Apple Store for 3 days for the privilege of buying an $800 sensor that does exactly that and a lot [Applause] more retail next insists that while they don data is complet completely Anonymous unless you opt in if you opt in you know exactly who you are and they can now track and Target you in real time but this kind of tracking didn begin in stores it began online online retailers don cameras and sensors to track you they don better the cookie so what exactly is a cookie and how do companies use it to track US to find out I spoke to this guy that Lum manuli invented the cookie in 1994 concept like a fortune wrapped in a cookie a cookie is a file and the fortune inside is a unique string of text you can read it but websites can each time you visit websites Place cookies on your computer these bite-sized files help websites remember you this is what allows you to do things like shopping carts you get this fortune cookie and you hold on to the cookie and you don of it you really don care and when you visit the website again you give the cookie back and the website breaks it open reads the message says Oh I know who you are you guy who wanted to purchase the toaster and I will put that in your shopping cart that was the idea harmless right something unforeseen happened it didn advertisers noticed cookies and AD networks started using them to track US you start this really terrible arms race and the arms race is to know as much about you as possible they could Target advertisements in a way that never worked on TV because the TV is a medium that you watch the internet is a medium that watches you as you watch it

The Rise of Video Games: A Cultural Phenomenon | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMohbb4Odh4	SLICE Science	[Music] what do the following people have in common a Chinese hacker a world famous computer designer a psychologist who likes to unwind and a sociologist from one of the largest observatories in Europe they belong to the same world the world of video games it it has become the biggest cultural industry on our [Music] planet it spent all your funds when the past meets a present and the future I though you had a decent run had your fun let me grab a couple of guns a couple of Clips midnight when I bucking for fun and banging for kicks bring it y suckers maybe want some this I accomplish you lose it the observat Deon for the past 10 years he has been analyzing the impact of video games on society he examines things that we can or no longer see during the last century video games were simplistic and somewhat limited computer gadgets that were used as light entertainment at home or in Amusement arcades this all changed in 1958 when an American researcher called William Higgin bam invented a tennis likee game on his oscilloscope he invented it to entertain visitors during an open house at his nuclear research laboratory over the last two decades video gaming has emerged as the form of entertainment that represents Our Generation over the years games have become increasingly high-tech and easier to use they are no longer limited to the amusement arcades they are in our homes and on our television screens their characters have begun to look like us and we embody them it generated the artificial world that we live in today since the early days of computing games have been used in experiments to discover the power of machines of computers this new technology exists in many forms consoles laptops joysticks touch screens 3d motion sensors the video game industry frequently reports on our relationship with new products the most significant part of the Computing revolution occurred with the Advent of the internet it connected networks and opened the doors to a new world at the turn of the century the internet and computer networks transformed video gaming what changed and gave people the opportunity to meet other players and to create a parallel universe the internet has enabled millions of people in video game networks to connect players share their adventures and journey together through a world that is becoming increasingly vast this form of entertainment has evolved from playing electronic pinball machines in an amusement arcade to Collective conquests in Virtual Worlds [Music] this digital Big Bang has revealed a multitude of universes and this is the first time that people can experiment live in groups and play in real time in a universe that is simulated yet lifelike and credible in a fantasy world in universes that were previously unknown [Applause] Zayn is 25 years old he is one of the most sought after video game hackers in the world everyone knows who Zayn is yet he is invisible in China there are approximately 100,000 people doing his [Music] job Zayn and his team are known as gold Farmers Knight and day they make a living playing video games their job is to collect gold coins this virtual currency is essential to progress in most video game networks once they have collected the gold coins they sell them illegally to players around the world the most popular video game network on the Internet is called World of Warcraft also known as wow this gaming Network unites more than 10 million players worldwide each week they are both male and female and their average age is 25 years [Music] old for all players their Avatar their character in the virtual world must be constantly evolving gold coins can increase their power and also their Prestige among their brothers in arms to look for gold we need to play we play in the same way as other Gamers we extract materials from the video game Virtual World sometimes it and you can get a good price if I strike this monster I will either get one coin or all of a sudden a Super Jackpot of a thousand gold coins so whenever I strike one I think it the monster of the Super Jackpot that we monsters and I pray that I will win lots of gold when it happens it makes me really happy it consumes me it gambling the Chinese authorities turn a blind eye to this prospering illegal business that has a turnover of more than a billion dollars per year [Music] the gold Farmers themselves only receive a small portion of the money they are the workers at the bottom of the supply chain their salary does not exceed $300 per month they work 10 hours per day 6 days out of seven their online avatars are the equivalent of virtual laborers they are creating money that is very real our job isn it monsters strike strike strike again and again Vanessa is 28 years old she is a psychologist she specializes in the study of video game [Music] players there is a reason behind her trip to Tokyo she is here to attend the Tokyo game show the largest International gaming exhibition in the world it opportunity for her to do field research Japan has always been a spearhead of the game industry with companies such as Sony Nintendo and Square Enix the global gaming industry is closely linked to Japanese technological inventions they seem to be motivated by the ultimate quests to diminish the border between the real world and the Virtual World the game industry provides much needed enjoyment we live in a world that people are always looking for ways to escape we permanent flow of information that hard to filter it things in our everyday life and we need somewhere to escape to we need to find a world that values it play video games they stay focused for long periods of time time and forget everything else that time and geography and become immersed in the digital world they dive into the digital unknown using an object that responds to physical movements having the power to control part of our existence seems to be becoming more and more important [Music] when all your all your when the fun it you had a decent had your funck [Music] 31-year-old janova Chen is a world famous video game designer during The Last 5 Years this young and private man has become an international reference figure every time that he designs a new video game his competitor scrutinize it Genova Chen moved to Los Angeles 8 years ago to finish his studies it was the first time that he had left Chen in China video game is a medium it communicate with the players when I was working on flower it was kind of like an interesting experience I I went to the uh drive on the freeway and so it goes through a suburban area and it was the first time I see these endless rolling heels of green grass and a windmill farm when I saw that I was thinking man these are very beautiful scenes I wanted to capture it right I take photo of what I see but the lens is so narrow I only capture a small portion of the field but it I grassland in games it capture a scene like the beach or the grassland because the poer has autonomy you know in flower they are the helicopter they can fly and it individual flowers and see the details and they can fly as low as the grass which you know you can being but your nose is right next to the grass and you see each individual Place get pushed away in Genova Chen does not destroy anything and all that he wins is pleasure in flower the player is a pedal that moves through nature the aim is to make it more beautiful naive doesn 2012 his games for the the first time in the history of gaming were exhibited in the permanent gallery of the world famous Museum of Modern Art Moma in New York I think as a human being we have that craving we have this frontal cortex which all it does is to put ourself into someone else them it from I think what game is so far the closest media towards life you have agency you have choices you have relationships in in virtual games you know in cinema you can watch them but you don interactivity in the early 21st century gaming overtook film as society significant cultural industry it has an annual turnover of 560 billion this is far ahead of Hollywood which has plateaued at 12 billion Video Game Heroes are becoming the stars of today in Tokyo Vanessa returns every night with hundreds of notes that she has taken throughout the day she is passionate about the relationship between players and their avatars the Tokyo game show is a gold mine for her it can play the same game for years the games change every day and new things are constantly being added the game allows people to Build Destroy rebuild and recreate things stay the same and change all at once the experience had by Gamers who play games like Final Fantasy or wow is unique transforming into an avatar enables people to become Heroes and empowers them when faced with anation when they log back in they are the same as they were when they disconnected they create a Digital Universe for themselves where they can experiment and push their own personal liit she really enjoys it it allows her to manage stress and to really let go some people might find it disconcerting that certain Gamers want to get into the skin of their Avatar this is called cosplay the name comes from combining the words costume and play cosplay came about in the Japan at a time when gaming was fast becoming an important cultural phenomenon [Music] groups of tens of thousands of people who cosplay can now be found in cities such as Paris and Berlin my avatar comes from the game final fantasy I cosplay the character of SRA I think that I have a lot in common with this character my friends often tell me that I look like her this is what convinced me to become the character of when I cosplay this character who I love I feel really exhilarated when I get ready I really feel like I person it step closer to having special powers and living out their fantasies the line between the video games the virtual world the digital screen and reality starts to become very blurred I feel as if I have all of her powers the system against way system system system [Music] system the evening before meeting with the cosplayers Vanessa had the opportunity to talk with the creator of the character Sarah yoshinari kitas designed the most popular game network in Japan Final Fantasy he has played a key role in the evolution of game networks over the last decade I about my son he spends a lot of time playing in a game network on his PSP he loves developing his Avatar sometimes he plays for hours on end and completely forgets to work his mother often ends up getting angry she wants him to do his homework before playing games and recently she got really angry and started shouting at him stop gaming get on with your work and then bam she broke his PSP in half I said to my wife that this wasn he won like that since then every time he is disobedient I say stop or I of your data and since then anytime that I threatened to erase his Avatar data He says Dad I sorry so ultimately the digital data of an avatar has become important even for a child he the data and spent a lot of time on it it significant when I see the reaction of my son I realized just how important and Powerful the feelings and memor memories that he has attached to his Avatar are humans are nomadic and since the beginning of humanity migration has shaped our world we sedentary and are following a new form of migration a virtual one we pass from one world to another at any given moment entire populations might be migrating by the Thousand by the million to a different virtual Universe Gamers invent new avatars in different worlds that they strive to conquer for months or even years when hundreds of thousands of players decide to break Camp it means the end of many subscriptions of around €20 per month for the game publishers in order to keep their players game editors draw on several aspects they change the rules of the game modify them a little or increase the size of the universe by creating virtual square kilometers or a new region they also transform the environment by creating a disaster a new scenario that will enable players to revisit places that they already know they introduce new monsters or enhance social Relationships by making people more interdependent Zayn online video game Market that has exploded in recent years there are over 300 titles video game networks have a global population that exceeds a 100 million players per day to increase the amount of gold that they collect Zayn has invested in new software robots now run the avatars the gold Farmers supervise the robots that run on autopilot their pursuit of profit is real but they exist in a world that is increasingly virtual society today and Society in the 60s and70s completely different there are two different worlds I don that many people realize just how much money can be earned through video games people who don no idea about the modern world those who understand it are aware that they can earn money but often they don the gold farming Market has become so significant that a platform that resembles the financial markets has been created Traders manage real-time supply and demand and control the price of currency for different games and indispensable accessories for virtual [Music] avatars it changes hour by hour on their [Music] websites switching avatars is possible in all video game networ works the rules of The Gaming Community are somewhat intangible the gold Farmers make the most of this to increase their turnover the deal between a player and a seller takes place within the video game the seller sets up an online meeting with the buyer in a quiet corner of the virtual world after the deal has been settled by credit card the player receives gold coins that they can use to enhance their Avatar resellers often hack Game Network company servers in order to post advertisements they do everything they can to attract customers zann always works with the same Trading Company every day he sells them gold coins that have been accumulated by his team alone is the real winner of this business transaction as a distributor of virtual gold coins he Pockets 80% of the sale price players come to us because they want to become stronger and to enhance their magical powers they want to overtake others but often they don ability required to obtain the powers that they want or to get essential accessories for their avatars so they willing to pay to spend money on it enhancing an avatar is the goal of the game but it goes beyond that the player wants it with their heart and soul [Music] [Music] the game gives an internal sense of well-being it is designed to encourage the gamer to play on a long-term basis and to stay with the same avatar for years the players feel that things that are impossible in real life are possible in video games so they pay us due to the huge success of video game networks the companies that dominate the internet have become involved Google Facebook and apple have decided to capitalize and have their own video games online in order to attract millions of customers their intentions are often hidden but the methods that they use to attract players are identical to those used by the major video game Publishers while 500,000 people party all over Los Angeles goova Chen are living life at a different rhythm for the last 20 hours Genova and his team have been embarked on a video game marathon the challenge that all Geeks dream of a game Jam game Jam is very much uh kind of a behavior that is widely embraced by a lot of people in different industry uh it Gathering Together trying to make something really quick usually within 24 hours or 48 hours that game company working on game is very frustrating because we made any we this in the past so a lot of trial and error but then you know for game Jam it we let change of pace and also make you feel more Elite Nick is working on the networking stuff stuff like where the characters are and like their health and like all and their management their interaction with the networking Adam will be doing limbs control punch all right let great Jova and his team decided to use this 24-hour session to create a game that doesn philosophy they want to design the kind of game that they criticize their competitors for game of gratuitous violence and Primal Instinct most of the games today are about excitement sense of accomplishment sense of empowerment but there isn sense of relax it know know a sense of hope um and so I realized game is just very young it like the early stage of Cinema well you know these genres of Cinema started being very Primal emotion like oh a trend coming to the station Everybody scared people haven the power of cinematography and the language of Storytelling I think it games as well when game first started we just make well the racing is exciting let racing you know oh fighting is exciting as make a game you fight with guns creating a video game in 24 hours is not easy under normal circumstances it takes 2 to 3 years of work during a game Jam they go back to the basics the design is minimalistic and the character animations are simplistic dam is in like when you Collide um as in if I when you die you melt into this little ball to walk you have to like one got go forward and [Music] then the programmer reused computer codes that have already been used for previous games these are shortcuts to save time the game Jam is not just a fun activity goova and his team use it as an opportunity to test new Tools in a time efficient manner that have changed the industry during the last four years smartphones and touch tablets are now the most used game consoles video Gam fers are constantly trying to keep up with technological revolutions game Publishers need to move with the times in Tokyo Vanessa has decided to take some time out from the game show she wants to discover where the video game players go in their spare time Western tourists have long been fascinated by Tokyo arcades but as far as the Japanese are concerned the arcades will soon disappear due to the video game networks that dominate The Market in Japanese PP culture manga kisas manga Cafe are the current place to be the internet cafes are open 24 hours a day and are a place where people can go to Read Manga and where they can also hire individual boxes equipped with powerful computers they can play in seclusion for hours on end they can even sleep there without being disturbed Vanessa is sure that this is the kind of place where she will find the kind of Gamers who interest her Final Fantasy when I was a student I played every day in a video game network called um Final Fantasy 11 and I I was very attached to my [Music] avatar I have lots of memories I it but the people I played with well I fell very much in love with another Avatar but I was rejected when I was playing every day I identified a lot with my Avatar character and I even wrote A Blog about it it was like a diary I have to admit that the game played an important role in my life for a long [Music] time now my professional life means that I can don play in WoW I could help that bag is full I range I need to get closer far it touched I just happened to be the very first thing that made me [Music] cry was not a film was not a novel because my parents were so scared that if I read novel I get addicted to it so I won any like you know uh fictions my first access to a strong emotional medium was actually in games cuz they don me play whatever I want [Music] for clouds this is the first game I this is the first game where I start to get real players who play the game sending email to us and telling us how they feel about the game some people said that you know we should tell the team that everybody involved are beau people and uh that because nobody ever told me I beautiful person in my life so this is kind of very first time you wow what does that mean so it must be the game and what happened in that game uh that start to make such a strong emotional [Music] reactions so the characters uh is a kid in the hospital you know when I was young I spent a lot of time in the hospital there Freedom as as a young kid and there lot of desire for uh getting better when you [Music] sick as a spectator when playing a part the gamer can now manipulate everything at the same time as observing him or herself the player incarnates an external body and models themselves in a virtual mirror leaving only a trace of their real self in Tokyo Vanessa continues her study she is comparing the cultural practices of one continent to another in Japan as in Europe the average player is over 30 years old The Gaming Community is not just made of of teenagers nowadays games exist for all ages for all Ambitions for all occupations and for all Cravings Vanessa has consulted recent studies that show that video Gamers spend 12 hours a week on their hobby even in France this cultural revolution has completely transformed habits that we thought to be timeless we log into video games in the same way that other people start watching the 850 film on the television we don connect and play with our friends and to discuss our day with [Music] them we players who like to share with each other this is what led us to these gatherings I met my boyfriend who I now live with in this Guild and we ones I think this is a great way of meeting people the majority of us are couples who have either met in the game or who have discovered the game together we also have friends here from real life that we friendships that have been formed during the game do you meet regularly in real life with people from this Guild yes we call each other to organize getting together we meet up we go out for dinner or on vacation for me there between the people I and my friends whom I College you need to get that one too no there there there that it we can advance I regening Yan can you give me a collar it powerful it than nothing what an idiot excuse me sorry no worries I messed it up in many game networks people need to join forces to succeed to cooperate with other players groups are set up and Gamers commit to meeting in certain places at certain times if people miss those Rendevous then they can be removed from the groups an online society exists it keeps people connected and sometimes the only friendships that people are able to maintain are those that are formed with their online friends in fact a very real social life exists online in the game World it often also exists outside of the game on the internet I can spend an evening online with friends in the game and everything will go go well the next day I will tell people what happened for example I explain on a website what happened the night before I use screenshots photographs or videos it we world where we exchange information through the digital media and where we many different means of communication and where Gamers play using their communication skills and where they express themselves both inside and outside the game it existing and of entertaining [Music] ourselves in China hackers like zaye have a somewhat complex relationship with the players that they meet in game [Music] spe the players in the game network often kill each other for fun and turn points but the stakes are high when the person who has been killed is a gold farmer Avatar players progress in the game when they kill one of us they win Glory points this makes them happy most importantly they hate us we Inspire hatred whenever the time or place in the game they always come across hatred they always try to attack us or kill us it it the way in which the gold Farmers hunt for gold is often repetitive and the gold farmer robots are easy to spot there are videos online that explain how to kill gold Farmers Gamers who have killed gold farmers are proud of their Victory going to go up a level kill him stop him in half go that way go on go on kill him re the video game publishers encourage these virtual murder hunts they are aware of the extent to which the virtual economy generated by their games is continually increasing so what should we do when an avatar is killed or gold yield lowers in a normal situation I can generate a certain amount of gold if avatars die during a work day we lose all the gold that has been acquired our productivity collapses Zayn knows that his business is in danger the video game Publishers that are in networks are starting to offer free to play games the games are free to access but Gamers need to pay to buy accessories to access new levels and to progress into new and infinite worlds that are continually being created by the designers for this new economic model to be cost effective the creators must Purge the games of hackers like the gold farmers working on video games allow me to see that how by changing the system of a world you can influence people behavior in Journey in order to make player like each other we have to do a lot of changes you know we have to change the law of the world we have to change the physics we have to change the economy so that people like to be with each other in Journey at the beginning we want to create a world where people help each other on their pilgrimage for a while in the game we wanted to make the player to feel that each other is really existing in the game world so we added in Collision so the player can push each other [Music] I can touch you I can feel you existing wouldn to have a connection and then what happened is as soon as you can push each other then the players are seeking for feedback right they want to see what they can do to get the most feedback by pushing each other and very quickly they realize if they push each other off the cliff that get versus push each other against the wing which is what we want the player to do it all of a sudden all these pilgrims who are supposed to be on the same journey start to kill each other um and I was for quite a while quite dis encouraged because I doing that even including our developers um and then I realized that it feedback you offer um and So eventually we changed it we take away the Collision so you can you are overlapping on each other you gain energy you gain resources so all of a sudden people don like to stay together stay close [Music] what I learned by walking on games is that you know we are really not that different uh in the real world compared to virtual world we might abandon our moral values when we move from The Real World to the virtual world for example we don but in the virtual world we are okay to kill but by switching the system by changing the feedback we can make people also feel it [Music] when I the closest to God what do I [Music] mean it whether you are a game designer a player or a gold farmer a video game can serve in whatever way you wish this leading cultural industry has become more than just entertainment it has become an everyday tool for communication and education this continually evolving form of media is becoming increasingly powerful and is getting progressively harder to make the distinction between real images and virtual images playing at home is really relaxing really really relaxing in addition you spend very little money if you go to a movie you spend a lot of money it costs a lot to buy food you buy something and then you spend more but playing doesn much you can it [Music] dream w c game over you running out luck Give It Up game over it life you choose game over even when you win you lose Game Over You Living in a Dream wake up game over you running out of luck Give It Up game over it about the life you choose I jeans my mind still a teen screaming I ain the of things I in my own little castle I life face for [Music]	Success
Insects: Nature's Scientific Allies | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3qmxXgoH5k	SLICE Science	[Music] this man is a police forensic expert he entomology he uses maggots or flies to date the death of victims and determine the circumstances surrounding murders his diagnosis contributes key elements to investigations C by the time Marcel meets murder victims they are usually decomposed by studying the development phase of the maggots in the body he can determine the date of the crime [Music] Marcel helped solve many of the crimes which shook Belgium over the last few years particularly child abuse cases as the maggots found in the children nappies made it possible to determine for how long they had been neglected the way in which fly Lavi develop in bodies also makes it possible to determine cause of death by over doses of cocaine and [Music] heroin is a I was an expert witness in a case which had been dragging on for year 3,500 people had been questioned with no results and it was the Lara of a single fly found in the body of a partially carbonized adolescent which made it possible to fix the date of the murder exactly the killer who had also raped the girl was condemned for Life Marcel expert opinions have made it possible to wind up hundreds of cases depending on climatic conditions the the workers of death operate in different shifts the first one is made up of calora Alias the blue bottles which attack in the hours immediately following the murder the second fly Squad moves in 8 to 10 hours after death these are the layers the green flies and other squads include kopter aarans and other species of flies wa wa okay okay okay okay okay okay these are fly traps hunting with wet umbrellas Marcel and his wife have built up a huge collection look you can see it so well it superb just look at its wings can you see Marcel there are no flies on Marcel for him fly catching is not a hobby but the only way to be sure to identify all the different species is found in criminal cases although their brain is no bigger than a pin head calora flies can locate a decomposing body several miles away purely by smell its eyes can see through 360° which tell it the best way to land on the body Philipe is a forensic doctor working in Kosovo to find evidence about genocide for the international tribunal in the hag Marcel therefore vital marel these are the first flies which got to the bodies yes those are the blue bottles which are the first to arrive on bodies lying out in the open in the open that means that they were killed Out of Doors yes and what are these flies those are tiny flies which burrow into the ground to get to a body buried to one M down yes it was the clouds of tiny flies over the M Graves which helped me find the bodies underneath yes walls may have ears but bodies have [Music] transmitters a car Ian are real police informers for the forensic police in this murder case they can indicate like fly eggs very precisely by their presence and their stage of development the date of death they provide evidence while waiting for a full autopsy Dr James Webb is a m specialist working as Undertakers mites can turn corpses into mummies before mold starts to decompose them [Music] this time James has brought back a chiger a very rare might in California the chiger this monster loves places where the skin is thin the buttocks and zones tightened by underclothing like the breasts and the crotch a few years ago James solved the Ventura case one of the strangest criminal Affairs of his life thanks to chiger mites it was a one in billion chance that the suspect raped and killed this young lady in an area of high triger infestation and in the lineup with other suspects he was the only one who had sugar bites and with our research at the site and this information it was key evidence that linked him to the scene of the crime because chers were also so rare in this area because of the weightiness of our information I was advised to hire a bodyguard and I also bought a weapon your attention please this is an important announcement a black suitcase containing explosives has been detected by the anti-terrorist bees it will now be destroyed by the police this fiction is soon to become reality insects are being transformed into real indicators of elicit substances and pollution detectors for public services bees are the new Elite troops sniffing out letter bombs detecting bacteria and viruses in biot terrorism alerts and detecting mines on battlefields okay M now if you can sample that the inside there no problem thanks to the air inhaled via the tube trained bees enclosed in the blue box are able to immediately detect the tiniest particle of explosive John Wilkins a scientist at incense UK the company that developed the system gives a demonstration to the security services at the Parisian airport shalal in this box we have the soldiers of tomorrow we have trained the be bees to detect explosives they have an incredibly good success rate could you tell me what is the reaction of the bees when the detect an explosive when the be detects the explosive it extends its proboscis which is the scientific term of a tongue here that process when the when you see the extension that hit like this that means you must search the bag is there a risk that the passenger could be stun by the be no absolutely not the bees are safely harnessed within the be sensor [Music] unit these special agents operate as a trio each be is connected to a sniffer tube their reactions are monitored by a micro camera that sends the image to a computer the bees memorize a large number of different smells at very weak levels of [Music] concentration could ordinary domestic bees one day replace dogs in detecting explosives perhaps not but the cost of their training is very low compared to their four-legged colleagues and a single beehive could represent tens of thousands of winged security [Music] agents Dr minha f is the French woman who instigated This research she also trains bees to stick their tongues out to identify pollutants as with dogs the method consists of associating a smell with a reward like sugared [Music] water on contact with flowers bees naturally stick their tongues out to extract the sweet nectar after training in the laboratory the bee will do the same when it identifies a memorized smell right I with pollutant a okay she minha has found a much simpler method than training by using the numerous beehives belonging to beekeepers for biod detection every one of these hives can become a detector of pollution and in this way we of France and then extending to Europe and the world what with bees is that they represent a sampling method that chemical methods there that motorway and the forest I think we should be at an intermediate level as far as pollution goes there of 50 vehicles per minute during rush hour bees are genuine pollution indicators while Gathering pollen and pollinating minute samples of dust Water and Air from a very wide area are collected in the down of their bodies providing information on the presence of any pollution agents [Music] to send a sample of about 20 bees to the laboratory so we pollution levels in the Paris Opera neighborhood thanks to beekeepers who set up their hives even in the heart of towns bees will become biodetectors for air quality Italian scientists have been successfully experimenting with samples of bees to analyze lead-based industrial pollution following the shanable nuclear accident it was also found that bees and the pollen collected on the their bodies were very good indicators of [Music] radioactivity in Belgium in the anas region Frederick Hendrick and Debbie AR Ali use wolf spiders as a pollution bioindicator these researchers believe that the spider is even capable of adapting to strong heavy metal pollution my research on pollution and spiders is the use of spiders as a bio indicator for metal pollution the problem is that metal pollution you can measure it in the soil but it which part is bioavailable so it for the environment and that use spiders because spiders are able to accumulate Metals in their body and this gives an estimate of at least a small part of uh the ecosystem which is contaminated with heavy [Music] metals how many do you catch today I think about 30 maybe bit less I didn count them exactly today I had one m and I think it this is this was a female with quite a small EG cocon C to me normally we should see it in the lab that they have small egg cocoons because it one of the most polluted areas that we that we sample together with withan wheel and so on do you remember the concentrations over here I thought it was a few animals it was about 100 PPM of cadmium of cadmium only and of Z about three times as high as as on the other po 18.3 yes indeed that small small one h the research of Frederick it showed us that there polluted and nonpolluted areas in the size of the females and the female eggs so we were wondering if it also would lead like to evolutionary changes between populations will pollution provoke an evolutionary change in the species of spider to make it better adapted will the genetic mutations vary as a result this is what our two researchers are close to proving the eggs which are in the the cocon are of much larger size compared to eggs produced by spiders from a reference population and what those two populations in the laboratory and cross them and then we saw that the big eggs are genetically based so it appears that there is genetic adaptation going on in the spiders living in those polluted tidle marshes to better demonstrate the adaptation of these spiders to the pollutant surrounding them Debbie uses a simple test she identifies a non-polluted male that she puts in competition with a polluted male in front of a female taken from the contaminated banks of the Shel River the hypothesis in this experiment was that the female would choose a male from her own population so a polluted in polluted area the female would choose a male from a polluted area as well while a male from a non-polluted area would be chosen preferably by a female from a nonpolluted area the two researchers have uncovered the mechanism of genetic evolution of the wolf spider in a polluted environment initially to increase its resistance its DNA is modified giving rise to mutant subspecies then the individuals of these subspecies reproduce between themselves thus they transmit their mutant genes to their offspring who will be better equipped for survival while insects are good indicators of soil pollution they can also be excellent depolluting agents this was the case in Australia where an insect became a national hero in the fight against cow flap pollution it all started 2 centuries ago when cattle were imported to Australia for the very first time with time and the buildup of Cal flaps fly Lavi had ideal conditions for proliferation and an invasion began the fly Invasion made life unbearable for the Australians you had to uh spend time chasing the flies away away from your eyes and uh and face it was a great nuisance and one just had to put up with it because there was just no practical solution the Flies were such a problem that a law was passed in many Australian towns forbidding outdoor dining today this story is history thanks to the deductions of Dr boram Australia needed dung beetles but even though over 4,000 species exist none were Native to Australia dung beatles feed almost entirely on their little floral friends but they are highly specialized and each one is adapted to feed on a particular kind of poop so Dr boram had to find just the right dung beetles for [Music] Australia I traveled the world uh to select the right species climatically suitable for Australians conditions in Africa he finally found the dung beatles who were perfectly designed to eat Australian [Music] [Applause] cowpats and this feal eating Beetle set foot on the Australian continent for the very first time the results were incredible the cow Pats disappeared in a matter of days instead of several years and because the Flies had nowhere to lay their eggs they left [Music] [Applause] town operation dung beetle was a success and Dr boram mitah was honored at the highest level for his work [Music] the research program ended in 1985 but flies and dung is still a big problem in farming areas John FM a former colleague of Dr boram has come up with a solution he set up a company which distributes dung beatles the farmers are very keen to get the Beetles I can only Supply about one order in six dung beetles have adapted so well to Australia that they have become an important part of its ecological balance uh we need every helping hand that nature can provide to create a sustainable system in the farm lands of Australia the cattle are only removing about 60% of the protein from the grass they eat the other 40% of protein gets dropped on the ground and that on every year John identifies collects and redistributes millions of dung beetles a th000 beetles that are sent out to a farm would EV ually build up into tens of millions of beetles we have the species here they sitting in little pockets around the country I know where the species are and when they become abundant enough I able to harvest them and uh then distribute them to areas where they are climatically suitable we need some fresh [Music] dun how long have they been in this padic only today there you go come here fellas beautiful just flick them off your fingers put the lid back on too many under be be very pleased to get into that good quality dung as far as I know I person in the world Distributing dung beetles they have specialized mouth parts and contrary to popular belief use them not to eat the dung but to suck on the Bloom nectar adults aate the soil and take the extra down to a depth of 30 cm which fertilizes the lower soil layers of Australia much better than any fertilizer the chemical industry can produce laboratory experiments have proved that Millet plants grow better with cow Pats but even better with dung [Applause] [Music] beetles in Africa as well Farmers employ insects termites not just to clean the soil but also as recyclers and laborers is that him yes that okay that termites I time I termites usually Farmers here hate them [Music] he says that even his grandparents knew about using termites they used to say that men till the top soil and the termites till the subsoil they earth dries out but there is water 5 m down the termites bring up a little moisture [Music] the technique developed by the zy people uses the gluttony of the litter termites they are attracted by laying straw on ground as hard as concrete to get to it the termites tunnel up from their nests leaving small galleries when the rains finally come the water trickles down the holes to irrigate the Earth Abdullah Mando agricultural engineer is trying to rehabilitate the old African Z tradition but the farmers have got into the habit of thinking of termites as crop pests here we don termites here we have straw so we have termites you can see the result for yourself verdant vegetation in China spiders are taken on to clean the rice patties of all their parasites some of them wolf spiders even wait in Ambush for their prey which they take by surprise by overturning them they are excellent Hunters hence their name Professor hm Yen tries to increase awareness among the farmers about using spiders rather than systematically calling upon [Music] insecticides even though the method may appear rudimentary the United States and France have also begun to recruit spiders As Natural pesticides to protect their [Music] Vines okay let I that kill insects in other words we can use spiders to kill Rice Field pests and thus increase the rice harvest the first harvest is already finished this field is waiting to be plowed when the field is flooded with water we put hay down to collect the spiders look when the water comes the spiders take refuge on the hay and then we collect the hay full of spiders and we put them in the fields for the Second Harvest where the rice has just been planted in certain regions of China Farmers have thus succeeded in improving their harvests by hiring wolf spiders As Natural pesticides but even with films and propaganda the taboos stand firm I think spiders are very dirty and repulsive why do you say they good they kill for food especially the insects that eat rice so they are very useful First Step the spider injects its poison into the insect then it covers it with saliva to destroy the tissues today a practical [Music] [Applause] we the field for transferring the spiders do like me and then we the hay and put it in another field to protect the spiders Professor hang mayen has calculated that cultivated land contains no fewer than a million spiders of all sizes per hectare so why deprive yourself of these uncared workers look the spiders are climbing onto the hay this proves that this method is very effective we can use this method to protect the spiders and the Harvest do you understand I in the 1960s and70s our country began to use many pesticides to exterminate insect parasites the insects strengthened their resistance and pollution increased with the doses of pesticide we know that spiders can combat these parasites without harming the plants in addition the spiders are plentiful and varied so we must use them in China this technique has enabled a 50% decrease in the use of pesticides to convince the most reticent Farmers scientists have counted the number of prey captured over 8 months by a single arop spider the result 900 prey whereas spiders are excellent natural pesticides red ants are also real Predators for many invertebrates this special Convoy contains nothing less than an ant in Italy they move ants nests from one Forest to another not to send the wood ants on holiday but to set them to work if ants are sometimes a curse for Farmers they are very useful to man they are excellent exterminators of processionary caterpillars that ravage pine [Music] trees Pro meary caterpillars devour large quantities of pine needles but fortunately the ant lies in wait for them forest rangers know that the presence of wood ant colonies in the forest is a sign of good health an Italian law dating from 1880 imposes a heavy fine on anyone destroying an ant Nest take look at for pao bardini the Pines are already full of processionary nests it emerging from their nests and Indian file forming long processions but Pao bardini of the monteal bra Reserve is watching in Italy since the 50s forest rangers have been taking entire wood ANS nests from the mountains but such nests are becoming fewer carried in trucks these ants are introduced into areas overrun with pine eating caterpillers at the end of the summer poo collects the butterfly traps to check whether the caterpillars have completed the metamorphosis in spite of the ants 2 3 4 that [Music] normal Pao notes that certain butterfly have already managed to lay their eggs in the pine needles but fortunately the only worker around is an ant already busy filling her ladder with fresh eggs welcome to Disney World here the mites are helping the 150 gardeners here too man arranges real wars but at a microscopic level between the prey and their predators a whole fantastic World silently working for the pleasure of the [Music] public attacks by tetranoid cause major damage to crops their offensives are catastrophic as they move around in armies their objective to suck the sap from the plants but even tetranoid have enemies the phyto silus phyto silus are predators gardeners put on the flowers ready to Feast on their prey some even attack giants like mosquitoes and flies these predators are remarkably effective their saliva paralyzed the prey and kills it even if it is not always eaten to immobilize a large prey they often gang up most of the time the prey is emptied alive these Predators also attack the eggs of prey protected by webs a massacre [Music] this Predator another species is trapped in a web but once released it empties its prey in a few moments two against one is not always enough the prey escapes whose fault was that when we see webbing on a plant that means we do have a high infestation of mites but still we don there and use pesticides mainly for the safety of our guests and the children we all know how children are they like to get into the plants they like to taste them they like to play in them for that reason and that reason only we don pesticides we go through our predacious M program that mites to handle the problem the Predator prey ratio must be 1 to5 to check it is an obstacle course Disney World they employ over 50,000 people but I Pest Management we employ over 1 million predacious mites a year that work night and day to eat the harmful mites thus we have reduced our use of harsh pesticides by over 75% which is an astounding figure to save Minnie mites Mike Works gently Europe also uses mercenary mites England launched the first attacks on predators in 1874 today in France approximately 50,000 Predators per hectare are released on many Agricultural and vegetable species cucumbers zucchini strawberry plants fruit trees and Vines are protected by might helpers these biological methods compete with the chemical industry already 10 to 20% of the crops in heated green houses in France and Holland are treated with killer [Music] mites our new domestic pets will be massively used in farming in tomorrow world another original approach consists of giving insects a completely unexpected function thus in some green houses flies have replaced bees as pollinators for flowers bees are renowned for being hard workers but bees are too selective as for flies you can be sure that they will be satisfied with every type of scent even and and perhaps preferably when it is not as sweet as roses will pollen carrying flies put bees out of work bees help flowers to reproduce by moving pollen from flower to flour Albert Einstein thought that without pollination by bees man would have only 4 years left to survive on Earth for some German scientists Mars should be pollinated future space missions will last 2 to 3 years and it is impossible to transport enough food to plan the conquest of space and permanent settlement of numerous human colonies without producing food locally one solution would be to create giant opaque green houses in which pollination could well be feasible nasza favors the idea of using pollinating robots more reliable for the moment they have already successfully tested the impact of microgravity on bees and pollination appears to be possible perhaps one day there will be tomato and puppy Fields growing on Mars [Music] this scientist is not working on pollinating Mars rather on its Conquest using aircraft developed thanks to the bee knowing when the plane is up so don get distracted when the airplane is flying around keep your eye on it know what for danger here these Australian Specialists on be for several years with Naza on a project that is now in test [Music] phase where is it now where it is now okay I now okay that autonomous right Dean yeah it is 100 100 km an hour [Music] uhoh take control nose up nose up nose up oh [\\xa0__\\xa0] what happened I don respond the use of B robots on Mars is planned at least 10 years from now paradoxically bees will see the red planet in blue in in fact they can perceive all colors and ultraviolet rays except for red professor shason and his team are the fathers of the NASA sponsored project this doesn all man do you think it it so it km hour but it will fly if you were to fly an aircraft on Mars through radio control from Earth that would not work very well because you know signals take several minutes to come from Mars to Earth and by the time you see an approaching Mountain for example it have collided with the mountain so we are using principles that we have learned from the be about navigation using Vision to Pilot unmanned vehicles in Mars these principles also interest the Army one of the applications of This research is to use a small um flying vehicles that a soldier can carry in his backpack and launch them over a hill for example to see if there the other side rather than going out there and getting shot so these vehicles will help extend the eyes and ears of a soldier in the battlefield although the 5,000 facets in their eyes give bees a good perception of shapes and colors with a 360° range this this is not the feature that Professor shenny vasson is working on unlike our own eyes Bee individually in this condition uh both walls are moving in the same direction at the same speed so bees will fly roughly down the middle of the tunnel however if I now slow down one of these walls so the be thinks that surface is much further away so it moves closer to that surface to compensate so this we think is how bees fly down the middle of gaps by balancing the image motion on the two sides Professor Shen vasson just has to convince his financial backers that such an object can fly thanks to his studies on the bee Vision while the incredible capacity of Bee flight path during flight has been studied that of flies also has been the subject of many studies the eyes of flies are made up of 3,000 individual lenses which gives them 360° Vision only movements are perceived in an extremely precise way flies break down Movement Like a film in slow motion and can process 200 images a second whereas human eyes can only handle 12 that is why it is so difficult to crush flies on a window pane [Music] for 25 years this man has been spying on fly understand how they operate so he can copy the system with electronic circuits this hanging ball that the fly is rotating makes it possible to record the activity of the fly circuits and particularly those involved in Vision the noise you can hear is the work being done by the site neurons one by one Professor fres skini decodes them to find out which neurons help the fly detect movements and avoid obstacles by understanding how fly see it may be possible to develop a significant field of application including driverless vehicles and pilotless aircraft and satellite launchers all insects have an automatic pilot in their head to guide them this may be possible to develop and install in every type of vehicle that man is building today an amazing automatic pilot based on site [Music] Professor franches Skin very quickly in this huge Maze of obstacles without hitting anything most mobile robots designed recently do not use eyes but Sona ears that is why they cannot move [Music] fast Professor fres skini recently completed robofly 2 a robot fly which looks much more like a domestic appliance than a fly but he promises his next brainchild will have Wings lauron Keller is also trying to copy the talents of insects to build robots but this time is interested in the collective intelligence of ants this could be good you see there he here there are two of them pushing like rock ANS that robot breaks down but the others carry on working yes even house cleaners could be made redundant by robots with insect brains today we first humanoid machines these little robots are designed to work together like ants you can imagine all sorts of applications for a group of robots getting together for example to clean an apartment do the housework or a group of robots used to clean up a radioactive Zone and to do that we what we put you could say ant genes into robots to let them evolve to see if they can act in a collective Manner and do things a single robot can [Music] what that copy humans is the independence of ant decision making ants even with their very primitive nervous system can do several jobs without a boss in less than 50 years minuscule robot insects will invade our universe and work like ants do [Music]	Success
Unveiling the Hidden Senses of Plants: More Than We Ever Knew! | SLICE SCIENCE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6ujkIgqRWI	SLICE Science	[Music] seen up close and even very very close nature takes on a whole other dimension our eyes Delight in the Finesse of a branch we Marvel at the delicate nature of a flower beneath trees we are prone to dream if we could look much closer and plunge into the intimacy of plant life we would discover a disturbing yet stunning complexity this green chaos covered with what looks like the eyes of snails is in reality the surface of the leaf of an ordinary tree enlarged hundreds of times through digital 3D microscopes today scientific imagery enables us to see plants like never before and we find in awe that the world of plants remains largely a mystery to us [Laughter] humans have several common points with plants they have a vascular system similar to our veins and arteries which ensures fluid [Music] circulation plants have an electric Network resembling our nerves through which information travels plants secrete hormones and other points of similarity could be revealed on the other hand without a heart or brain absolutely essential for us plants throughout their evolution have developed some extremely original solutions for Survival Solutions we could learn [Music] from Stefano manuso a professor at the University of Florence in Italy founded over 10 years ago the first International laboratory of vegetal neurobiology which studies the interactions between plants and their environment [Music] plants are able to sense the environments in an Exquisite way they are much more sensitive than animals and they need to be uh more sensitive because they cannot run away from the danger plants are rooted to the ground this forced sedentary Nature has steered their sensorial organization to become accurate and highly efficient since itivity is not something that it linked to a brain the brain in itself it amount of cells that we have here and every animals have there is nothing mysterious or Supernatural about the cells of our of our brains they are just a kind a specific kind of cells called neurons but you don stuff you can have Al other kind of cells having the same function so means transmitting signals from one cell to the other humans must react instantly to their environment especially when confronted with danger transmission of nerve impulses spread throughout our nervous system at a speed of 100 m a second do plants need such rapid connections to calculate the speed of electric signals in a plant Bruno Mia and his team from the French national Research Institute for agriculture food and the environment in is placing electrodes on the stem of a shrub the flection here has triggered an electric current which spreads throughout the plant but weakens at roughly 20 cm when the plant receives a gust of wind or an insect bite there are two signals that spread throughout the plant an electric signal over some dozens of centimeters and a hydraulic signal that can even travel to the roots the conduction speed of the electric impulse seen in this image highly accelerated is only 6 to 8 cm per minute this slower conduction speed is logical with the sedentary life of [Music] plants to create the organic matter required for growth a plant needs light provided by the sun carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere and water light is absorbed through chlorophyll the tiny round Globes contained in plant cells thanks to chlorophyll light water and carbon dioxide are transformed into sugars which the plant feeds on this process known as photosynthesis releases oxygen into the Earth atmosphere and provides all the organic matter and the energy necessary for life on Earth the procedure seems simple but in everyday life plants are regularly confronted with vital problems water is capricious and plants don must fall at the right [Music] time Roots sees the water in the soil through a large number of little hairs under lack of water roots are the first to perceive the threat and action the close of the stamata [Music] stata are little mouth-like pores spread over the leaves it is through these that the plant breathes and releases the water vapor produced by photosynthesis when Roots send the signal lack of water the stomata pours shrink the plant captures less carbon dioxide and reduces growth Daniel shitz a Botanical genetics scientist discovered a gene in the hairs of plants that is similar to those responsible for the vibrating hairs in the inner ear of humans from a genetic point of view plants have the same genes that are needed for hearing that animals have this Gene in animals is a gene which enables the hairs of our inner ears to be formed and these are the hairs that vibrate in sound waves these are genes that are needed for us to hear plants have essentially the same genes which might lead us to think that plants here the same way but when we look more in depth of what these genes do they hairs at the tips of roots but these hairs apparently are not listening but they absorb water so while the genes cause the same structures to be formed hairs in humans that hearing and in Plants it [Music] drinking this unexpected proximity fascinates and drives Stefano mcusa we are quite sure that plants are able to use the information coming from the sound in the soil for example to detect the quality of the soils the amount of water in the soils the presence of obstacles in the soil so they are in in some way using information coming from uh sounds for to have an idea of the space around them so just put a a loud speaker close to these roots and you will see that if the frequencies are in the range between 100 1,000 HZ The Roots will turn toward the source of frequency if the frequencies are higher than 5,000 The Roots will grow against the source of the of the [Music] sound the plant desmodium gens was once thought to dance to music today the zone that gets the most light some may say that plants do better and grow quicker when their favorite music is played what is important for plants are is not the music but are the frequencies we found that there are a range of frequencies in the in the low in the low part of the spectrum between 100 and 1,000 Els there are many frequencies that we could say plants like they are completely uh insensitive to the the quality of this classical rock blues and so on of the music but they are able to uh detect specific frequencies and to react to these frequencies [Music] accordingly if there is one sound which humans find disturbing it of a mosquito in the dark could plants be aware of the buzzing of insects in Israel and in the global scientific Community the work of lilac hady is making a buzz her research backs up the idea that plants identify the sounds made by pollinators and take advantage of this flowers produce nectar with the sole aim of attracting pollinators that feed on the sugars it contains by harvesting the nectar pollinators bring pollen from other flowers and this pollen fertilizes the flower they visit researcher at the University of Tel Aviv she has recorded the buzzing of bees as they sip nectar she plays back the buzz through a loudspeaker held above a flower bed of PR roses lilac and one of her teammates then harvest the nectar secreted by the flowers and measure sugar levels with an [Music] analyzer much sweeter nectar this time [Music] it energy of the plant is wasted on nectar so to keep nectar high in all time is a very expensive process and also that attracts all sorts of H robbers bacteria fungi Birds if you can have have nectar low when pollinators are not around and increasing sugar concentration only in times where pollinators are around that could save the plant a lot of [Music] energy while the forms and shapes of flowers are diverse many are concave shaped like a bowl or a bell [Music] if we look at this flower uh it has this uh Bowl shape a bit like a small satellite dish so we suggest that the flower is the external ear of the plant an ear that has evolved to respond specifically to the sounds of the pollinators of this very plant bees or Moss this flower vibrates in response to the sound of beast but if we remove some of the petals this remaining petal would not be able to respond so much to the [Music] sounds lilac picks a few primroses to take back to her Laboratory she wants to check if the petals are receiving the sound of B flight she observes them under a highresolution optical microscope when she plays the recordings of bees buzzing along with other pollinators a laser beam measures the vibration of the petals to establish a scale of the flower with the laser fibrometer we were able to detect tiny vibrations in response to sound and we saw that indeed the flower vibrates in response to B sound but not in response to much higher sounds like B sounds sounds made by other animals bring no reaction from the flower but the buzzing of a bee leads the flower to produce a sweeter nectar If plants hear if plants sense sound waves they do it in a completely different way they didn should we listen to today but it did develop the ability to respond to the sound of a pollinator and then to differentiate between a pollinator and a non-pollinated and that makes sense also because if you wavelength then you wasting energy and making nectar for someone who will never drink it we are still thinking of the possibility of plant communication after hearing the B sound for examp example within the same Bush of the evening primrose there is one flower exposed directly to the bee but is the signal transmitted to other flowers on the same plant this is something we intend to study [Music]	Success
Is Information Overload Harming Your Brain ? | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLVjZf_BRh8	SLICE Science	[Music] 50 billion emails per day this Deluge of data submerges us on a daily basis causing unprecedented stress we much information to process this information arrives too fast and in volumes that is not humanly impossible to handle so all the conditions are combined for severe stress TI Vena author of a book on how to survive in the digital society believes that information Technologies are responsible for the increase in stress in the workplace nowadays Humanity produces as much information in 2 days as it did in our entire history before the Advent of the digital age the quantities are so vast that they become abstract to have an idea of the scale you need a comparison for example take France biggest in the world with some 14 million books every second the equivalent of double this library is distributed on the web or 63 million French national libraries a [Music] year I see that we of the wild west of Technology where we applications and devices and people people are switching back and forth between all these different devices and applications it west because it chaotic we situation in which the tools that should facilitate Our Lives seem to complicate them how did we get to this point how has digital technology revolutionized the workplace that information and communication Sciences wants to find out by interviewing managers on their rapport with the digital world my objective was to see how this was really impacting the workplace how it affects employees who use digital technology on a daily basis at the same time I wanted to find out if digital devices are creating new psychosocial risks in the workplace for her research Cindy fio interviewed around 100 managers since they are the first to fall prey to digital stress all these tasks of information management or processing encroach on the core of the job some of them spoke to me about a feeling of disqualification of being distanced from their real work in the end based on the analysis that I carried out it becomes clear that these Technologies mean work becomes more dense it is intensified through this race for urgency this time pressure the instantaneousness that these tools [Music] allow Bernard mananes is one of the managers interviewed by Cindy fio in his previous post he had trouble dealing with the pressure due to digital devices he chose to change jobs to reduce the stress let subject at 8:30 in the morning at 8:36 you receive an email marked urgent since almost 60% of emails these days are marked urgent because people think otherwise you won meanwhile you receive a text then a phone call then you return to the Dos you started on 8:30 and it 10:30 or 11:00 by now you lost the thread of what you wanted to do which means excuse me I back it constantly assailed by ringing beeps and alerts you lose your concentration you lose your concentration we can clearly see that when he pick up the threat of his thoughts and that these environments that I describe as electronic bombardment or water torture take for example the working groups that I run we have an interruption every six minutes and in the end this new digital working ecosystem is totally structured so that you can work that there these incessant demands Force us to provide responses a cycle that can eat up a lot of time experts estimate that just dealing with emails accounts for 30% of an employees [Music] day Matthew pedel works for a company that manages data networks he doesn have a choice he has to be permanently [Music] connected Francis yes Francis no go ahead I it quick I have to be reach for 24 hours a day weekends the nights whenever and I sometimes called in the middle of the night when there are major problems okay I to talk about it I to be able to breathe a bit and switch off from time to time I just saw the email and I happy about it in any case we meeting coming up even when and I the weekend at any moment if you receive an email you have to read it to see if it important which in this case it is so my walk is going to be cut short or else I either to take a call or to take the time to answer this email nowadays one in two managers do not allow themselves to disconnect from work in the evening in the modern Working World it has become almost impossible to do otherwise there an implicit rule to be permanently connected to reply to emails as soon as you get them because you with this phone and that this device is for being able to plug into your work at any time of day anywhere POS some questions in the private sphere there might be cases of divorce or arguments with Partners due to the excessive intrusion of the work smartphone in the family home and when work becomes invasive digital stress can lead to burnout Stephanie Lan experienced this in her previous job she now works on a wine estate I often used to get up in the night because I worked with China and India so I emails so things moved faster I thought it was being efficient it was good for the company I was not compelled to do so but it seemed to me that the company it but I totally overlooked my own life in fact I felt an obligation to be online all the time because it was a total addiction I wasn wasn online I had to keep checking in knowing what was going on even at the weekend on vacation I was looking at my email all the time even on my honeymoon vacation then there was a moment when I woke up I realized I had to stop the thing that triggered this was when my daughter lelu said to me one day Mom all you do is shout you mean you need an operation then I decided to take steps and stop checking in all the time con of course in her new job Stephanie still has to go online but now she keeps it within strict hours approved by her employers Stephanie narrowly avoided burnout but not everyone is so lucky I suffered from burnout myself a few years ago now I know how to handle it and manage things differently but I honestly think it these new digital devices which caused it the overload will inevitably lead to a state of fatigue mental fatigue and in some cases full-blown burnout that why is it fashionable because it also appeared with these new technologies since these Technologies are now part of our Lives we are going to have to learn to manage them [Music] better according to Tor Vena in France and Germany some 12% of the working population is at high risk of [Music] burnout this situation is closely linked to information and communication Technologies I go berserk when I feel that I haven what is expected of me in other words I can adopt this definition you understand why these technologies have a powerful impact because wrapped up with the fact that I can fact that I whether I wherever I working without these Technologies I couldn that I always have to go faster so all the time we come back to the effects of information and communication Technologies in this stressful ecosystem in France the cost of stress in the workplace is estimated 2500 to 3500 deaths so we extremely brutal cases of burnout several hundreds of thousands of sick days so the social cost of the work-related stress pandemic is extremely high we are only just becoming aware of the effects of digital stress but can we analyze the nature of this stress are we exhibiting new Behaviors new ways of working linked to these devices which threaten our equilibrium that Mark wants to understand researcher in Psychology at the informatics Department of an American University Gloria Mark focuses on the interactions between humans and computers for the past 20 years she has been carrying out field studies into how the growing role of digital Technologies is changing us when I began I would interview people and I would ask them about their experiences and everybody felt distracted from email so I looked for a field site that was willing to have its employees cut off email uh it took me 6 years to find an organization a unit of the US Army near Boston agreed to take part in one of her experiments the aim was to evaluate the effective emails on staff members to carry out her research Gloria Mark observes employees and takes physiological measurements Sarah yes hi I Mark and we very much for volunteering so I have some devices that I wear the professor equips the staff with a device that measures their heartbeat this gives an indication of the level of stress she adds a capter which measures the number of interactions between coworkers and so your other colleagues when they come in close proximity to you the signals from these badges pick up each other and it can tell when you with another person and interacting with them okay okay now we off your email for a period of 5 days wow by analyzing the results before and after blocking email traffic Mark observes an increase in direct interactions between staff members her study shows that email is the leading source of stress in the office what we found was that uh the more time people spend on email the higher their stress is we also found that the longer time on email the lower people assessed their productivity at the the day this was a very robust result because we controlled for people means no matter what kind of job you have whether you you researcher whether you irrespective of job role is the same result for the past 10 years Gloria Mark has been taking careful measurements of our concentration Span in front of screens she has observed a dramatic change in 2004 we found that the average length of time that people focused on any activity was 3 minutes in 2012 we found that on any computer screen people minute and 15 seconds on average so their attention shifting is happening more frequently I study with college undergraduate students these are the millennial generation these are young people that have grown up with the internet with digital devices with smartphones and their attention duration on any computer screen is even shorter it Kelly Mitchell I think people have multitask you know for a long time I mean we but I think what workplace is that people have access through digital media to more information faster than they in history people report burnout because each time you um Orient to a new task it multitasking uh and the consequent interruptions create stress and create a cognitive overload in our increasingly digital societies constant pressure and multitasking have become the norm but just how far can our brains deal with such overload that is what Stefan bua military doctor and specialist in Aeronautics is interested [Music] in he has been studying cognitive load among pilots in other words the effort their brains have to make to accomplish the tasks necessary during a [Music] flight the concept of cognitive load began to be formulated in the 1930s with changes in the factory from there the concept has been exported into other domains Aeronautics has driven developments since the stakes are very high in terms of safety so there is a strong demand to improve practices or in any case to understand what cockpits the first planes had no instruments and the pilots back then worked entirely using their senses then gradually the quantity of information grew reaching a maximum number of dials in the conqu there were so many dials they had to add crew members to manage the flight then there was a step change with the arrival of multifunction screens which brought a change in the way the information is presented this was a reorganization there not less information but it is structured [Music] differently to study the cognitive load among Pilots Stefan bufa measures electrical activity in the brain and heart rate and observes Pilot during flight using all these parameters we going to evaluate some of your internal activity which we can correlate with the cognitive load during the flight what measurements is that they give a dynamic reading of his State during the flight and the actions and we can then analyze these [Music] readings with this type of simulator we can simulate a flight and the occurrence of certain technical problems these have to be managed by the pilot who will have to deal with this increasing [Music] demand if we give him several competing tasks at the same time the pilot needs to mobilize all his resources in terms of both memory and attention he has to manage his priorities to execute his actions okay engine failure [Music] decision [Music] height okay we fine when the helicopter pilot has to deal with a mechanical failure in a power line he has to decide which is the most immediate danger you will probably treat the power line as an imminent emergency but switching tasks has a cost in terms of information treatment time and in terms of Errors you can observe this in a simulator Mission with this simulated engine failure the pilot has to deal with a sudden flood of information it is therefore crucial that he does not make any mistakes while he has several tasks to accomplish activation of the [Music] malfunction okay Dennis malfunction has occurred can you manage a conversation at the same time yes well can I ask you what is 3 * 4 uh I can answer 12 at the moment and can you recite the alphabet backwards just a moment let Zed y each time you switch tasks you will slow your response time and you become more tired the impression of dealing with multiple tasks is deceptive because in fact each of these tasks is dealt with with superficially the subject manages to give the impression of performance faced with these multiple tasks but when you look a little closer you can see that as he changes priorities he might modify his performance criteria downwards he thinks he has done a good job whereas in fact he has lowered his performance criteria so there multitask mode deactivation of all malfunctions after analyzing the data recorded on the memory card the experiment shows that the multitask mode reduces performance even for an experienced pilot thanks to digital devices many claim to be able to multitask but most of the time the impression of efficiency this gives us is little more than an illusion what is going on in our brains when we handle several tasks at the same time and what impact does multitasking have on our attention span that is what or kle Neuroscience researcher in Leon is studying the scientist is trying to understand how our different kinds of attention interact depending upon our environment I don one type of attention but that there are several types of attention and that these types of attention are based on different cerebral mechanisms different types of activity in the brain and that unravel among the different types of attention or B Kole is studying sustained attention which allows us to remain attentive for several minutes or hours and our selective attention which cuts out unwanted background noise in our environment the researcher wants to understand which mechanisms are working together when we perform dual tasks there measure brain activity in a dual task situation to see if it carry out two activities at once you is to count how many times you hear it so the number of times you hear Judith at the same time numbers will appear on the screen and you have to click using the mouse when you see the number two all right all right let start from the electrodes at the back of the head we oscillations appear which show that her vigilance is dropping and so she is less attentive towards the task in hand the analysis of Judith waves shows that trying to accomplish two tasks is leading to a conflict in her brain because she is using the same network of neurons when you try to answer the phone and write an email at the same time the brain tends to alternate between the two activities and what happens is when you go to write a bit of the email you will miss what the person tells you on the phone if we do two activities that depend on the same brain networks such as writing an email and speaking on the phone we for both and so the network becomes saturated inevitably at least one of the two activities will suffer in the workplace we often operate in a noisy environment with phones ringing and co-workers talking what scientists call non-pertinent information like the Beeps in this experiment these sounds interfere with our attention even though most of the time we are able to ignore them the brain has inhibitor mechanisms which reduce our responses to non-pertinent sounds it silent canceling them out and therefore stops reacting to that input these inhibitor mechanisms are essential since our brains are continually bombarded with sound and visual information from our immediate environment but the Dual task situation upsets these filters as Orel B experiment [Music] shows when we find ourselves in a situation facing dual tasks the inhibitor mechanisms are greatly impaired and we are far less able to filter non-pertinent stimuli from the environment like the sound of a nearby coffee machine or someone passing in the corridor the experiment shows that in a dual task situation we are much less capable of cutting out noise and our attention suffers the notion that some people are multitaskers is thus refuted by scientific studies the fantasy that consists of encouraging youngsters to think they might be more capable of multitasking than their Elders is not supported by any serious cognitive study and cost is a compulsive zapping that will do them a lot of harm what is quite remarkable is that we might expect the younger generations to automatically have a lower level of stress since they were born into a digital world and so they are supposedly at ease with digital devices surprisingly studies show that the opposite is true notably a major European survey among 30,000 employees which found that stress rates among the young compared to their Elders when it came to information and communication Technologies were significantly [Music] higher this survey carried out by The gfk Institute in 29 countries showed that 39% of under 30s suffer from work taking up too great a place in their [Music] lives because digital devices are continually calling for our attention it is becoming necessary to learn how to resist these multiple distractions and starting from a young age [Music] for the first time in France workshops to develop attention span have been designed based on research [Music] studies these workshops are the result of a collaboration of the neuroscientist Jean Philip lash and the education Administration in the Leon region L show is convinced that we can learn to resist the the siren Call of digital devices from a very young age I never thought I at school one day I thought I was done with all that then I started to take on the challenge of going into classes to design a training or education program about attention aimed at children oh look who are here how kids the program starts as early as Nursery School despite having attended one of France Jean Philip Leo is ready to come down to the kids level to explain the workings of the brain to them all through the year we learn a little bit about the brain how it works and how to use it best to control our attention this is called the ATL program at for attention and O for school the scientist can either stay in his Ivory Tower or he can get interested in society and try to propose some solutions a thousand pupils take part in this program which helps children prepare to resist the massive onslaught of digital content the aim is to show all children that they can Master their attention span with Benefits that will last into adulthood and working life if the experiment proves a success it will be extended to all schools in [Music] France what is the brain for put your hand [Music] for thinking for being attentive it stuff it fun what will be important and will create a difference between individuals is the value we give to attention if for one person or their family it attentive if attention is valued we have more attentive children if with an infant aged maybe one or two and you start to read the child gaze wanders you stop the child would sense that you level of attention from that point on there are lots of little things one can do on a daily basis to nurture attention in a child which can then be developed so we have to pay attention to our attention span it plays a central role in our lives and is increasingly under Threat by Communication in an attentive brain you have the involvement of the regions of the brain which are responsible for the high level cognitive functions for example memorizing planning and understanding those regions will suddenly start being active they will react whereas when the brain isn attentive on the contrary they will remain silent or simply occupied with something [Music] else the attention training exercises continue on the beam the children must continually refocus their attention to stop themselves from falling the mental picture of the beam will accompany them throughout their [Music] apprenticeship staying balanced on the beam means managing to remain stable despite the forces which are tending to pull me to one side or another it same idea for attention I try to remain concentrated I have an exercise to perform there start and the end of the exercise and I even if there are forces that are distracting my attention I might want to talk to my friends or have an idea I might lose focus on my exercise it about learning to resist these forces by remembering there body that I set off I and try to hold it all together stabilization of the body of the mind and of the attention Jean Philip Le has come up with other techniques to help stabilize our attention to better manage their capacity for attention the children are learning to divide up their activities I have to tidy my room tidy my room tidying a bedroom is a complex task for a child but if it is broken down into small missions like putting the dolls in one box the cars in another then making the bed attention does not wander all too often children try to do everything at once that reasons they lose concentration what we things out into a series of small objectives that way the room is quickly [Music] tied what about us can we divide our working day up into many missions the key to maintaining good attention is establishing a sequence of tasks setting one objective after another on the face of it that hard but few of us managed to stick to this because we think we tackling mult objectives one of the problems for children and even adults is that often we let ourselves get distracted because we haven what we several objectives at the same time you have to think that in such moments the brain must make decisions several times per second about what what isn become awfully complicated if we trying to do several things at once if you intention on top of that we the digital environment makes great claims on our attention instead of having two or three potentially interesting things I have 15,000 I looking for an answer to a particular question I have in mind then suddenly I see an advert or a link which says click here so I click and that I and I intention when you try to do lots of things at once even if you like this multitasking mode you have to keep a very large quantity of things in your memory you have to remember everything involving task one task 2 3 and four and it ends up getting too crowded and becomes very difficult on a cognitive level it missions Each of which can be concluded leaving you entirely available for the next mission Jean Philip BL show has no doubt that attention can be learned and that it needs to be developed like a muscle although digital devices have invaded our daily lives and are continually seeking our attention some people handle this better than others jubin aimi runs a digital marketing company in colog for him hyperconnectivity is not a problem his solution is to compartmentalize his activities when I travel I make every minute profitable here I can write emails I can make phone calls simply find out some new information it doesn there it doesn all you can forget the outside world when you concentrated on something at the head of a digital marketing company juin Raimi considers information as the essential raw material for his area of activity and he has his own method for managing it you mustn information you have to set a clear amount of time to deal with it for example you have to say I one hour to handle the information on this or that topic that way you put yourself in a position to act and you are not overwhelmed if you been ha knows how to conserve his attention amidst the noise and multiple distractions it thanks to chess from a young age he received High Level Training in some surprising methods we pushed the training so far that we started to do some insane things like playing chess in the middle of a football stadium when two teams were playing each other and the joke was that people playing football had to play as close as possible to the chess board to upset the chess players but obviously they couldn the ball into them otherwise that counted as a goal for the opposition so you had to try and stay concentrated on the chess game when there was a lot of noise around you when you might get hit by a ball that type of training taught us to concentrate even in a noisy environment and the result is that I concentrating in the middle of an airport while completely blocking out the [Music] rest the example of juin Raimi shows that attention training can help people deal with the pressures of digital demands [Music] but even if we know how to filter out noise and concentrate can we continually stimulate our brains without them suffering in the long [Music] term that is the question that Francis ustach a neuros pychology researcher in Kong is trying to answer he thinks it is essential to give our brains the possibility to disconnect [Music] the new information Technologies are a fabulous means of access to knowledge but at the same time I think we have to think about their impact on our day-to-day lives and also on the workings of our brain the incessant siren Call of digital devices stops the brain from having the brakes it [Music] needs our brains have a network of neurons for which a period of downtime is indispensable the default mode Network it when the brain is at wakeful rest when we not in asleep mode when our thoughts wander and we don carries on working just in a different [Music] way a special network of neurons becomes active the default Network this is what does the work when we are not concentrating on a specific task like calculation or writing an email this network involves several areas of the brain we can see these red zones and that anterior part of the brain the prefrontal CeX and the posterior part here called the posterior singulate cortex schematically this corresponds to for the front part the areas here over the forehead and then the areas at the back which are in the folds of the cerebral hemispheres this network becomes active when for example we familiar Road in good weather conditions and the traffic is fluid it vigilance we are attentive but in a diffuse way and if there react right away that cerebral Machinery while staying alert we to do something else this might seem quite simple but it for our mental equilibrium FIS aachi that the default network plays a fundamental role for our memory it is however fragile a fact that can be observed in certain neurological illnesses which means the default network doesn correctly it in memory and which enables us to process memory including the connection between what is old and what is new and projecting into the future it also plays a part in our connection with other people so it extremely important Network both for our wellbeing and for integration in the world around us [Music] so to look after our memory it seems essential to take care of our default network and to do that we have to be capable of taking breaks far from digital [Music] stimuli I think the work of the brain the work of processing memory is also about allowing moments to ourselves which allow our brains to process and to reflect to not be simply responding or simply at the mercy of external stimulation memory is not just a matter of having lots of memories it synthesis hence the importance of looking after it but the attraction of digital information is such that the desire to be connected often takes precedence people can urge to to check email to check Facebook to uh switch to the Internet so people report uh when we interview them that they just feel compelled to check I been in areas with no network coverage of my cell phone and I felt the stress starting to build up to the point where it felt like Civilization forgotten me I was out of touch and I couldn reach anyone else if I needed to spending half an hour or an hour in an area without any network whatsoever made me feel stressed genuinely really stressed where does that urge to be in touch and always have access to information come [Music] from are the mechanisms the same as an addiction to alcohol or drugs in your brain you have a circuit called the reward system which is made up of neurons whose main function is to memorize the things we like in other words each time we derive pleasure from doing something eating something seeing something they will record a memory of that and that us to drink when we when we reward system is that it reacts to lots of other things not to mention addictions for example it reacts to fresh stimulus it reacts to information so if you have one of these little devices called a smartphone which is continually bombarding you with information and new content those little devices are acting as a very powerful stimulus on the reward system in the same way as drugs the digital environment activates the reward system but in the absence of serious mental or physical harm we cannot talk of addiction in the medical meaning of the term it behaviors in relation to these Technologies what we want to find out is what this intensive use actually means is it a social problem or is it a family problem what I would recommend in any case is opening up a space for discussion on these issues since this now forms an integral part of employees work [Music] if we want to survive the stress of Digital Life we have to question our use of computers and smartphones but in the interaction between humans and machines perhaps we might look to the machines for Progress improving it Technologies to lighten our cognitive load is the focus of computer science researcher Professor Robert Jacob and his team their objective is ambitious to make the computer adjust in real time to our cognitive load when we are carrying out a task the idea is that the computer will send us lots of information when our brain is available and less when it is tired we think of the person and the computer as two powerful information process processors connected to each other by a narrow bandwidth very limited connection which is the user interface the screen the keyboard the mouse whatever so we amount of information that can be passed across that in our particular work we trying to improve the information from the user to the computer because that seems like the one with the the lowest bandwidth with current technology it is not yet a question of the computer reading our thoughts what of knowing our workload at any given time thanks to an imagery technique software analyzes the oxygen in the blood flow in the prefrontal cortex the more oxygen the brain consumes the harder it is working the computer is then able to vary the quantity of information it sends us according to our mental [Music] workload here tests are being carried out on air traff traffic control tasks the user is controlling several airplanes at once they have to time share between the different airplanes first I have to adjust this airplane then that airplane then go back to the first airplane what we did in this system was we tried to adjust the number of airplanes that you control based on your workload we don want to give you too few airplanes or you you too many or you can we your mental state we can also use this kind of measurement to decide when and whether to interrupt the user if the user is in the middle of doing something difficult and intense that they little bit of a lull with less short-term memory that interrupt so our goal is to make what we call implicit user interfaces that pull information out of the user without taking any of their attention in order to do it 3way Professor Jacob initially be applied to air traffic controllers who are subjected to a vast influx of information resulting in permanent stress in the long term he plans to extend his work to other fields of activity and if you airplanes but doing office work this also applies your workload may go up or down and we can adjust um adjust what you have to do based on it Robert Jacob has also come up with a system that filters the information we receive on our digital devices for example emails depending on our cognitive load if we are very busy we would receive edited versions when we have more time we would get the full information if the kind of research Robert Jacob is undertaking proves successful our information overload should be reduced but is that good news or just an additional intrusion of digital devices into the private workings of our minds it is too early to answer that question it is also hard to say just how far we can adapt our Behavior to our insatiable technological inventiveness these devices shape us which show they of their relationship with people and that they do have an influence if we simply say digital technology is like a hammer I can smash in my neighbor the day the hammer is not to blame we are limiting our capacity to control its effects we we keep inventing you know Wonderful technology and keep throwing them at people and people are at this point where they how to use them and so we have to think how we can design technology to adapt better to how humans think we want to design Technologies to promote productivity for people to be effective but also it should not infringe on our well-being the digital Deluge which is flooding our world challenges our place in society it is up to us to limit the harmful effects of information overload to not allow our attention span to be undermined by the demands of technology and to reclaim the right to be disconnected [Music]	Success
Overcoming Darkness: Wu Jing's Journey to the Symphony | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfaSnalkXFY	SLICE Science	[Music] my name is Wu Jing I was born in China but I now live in Stockholm in Sweden at the age of three an illness left me completely blind my flute and I have been Inseparable since I was 8 years old very early on I wanted to become a professional flautist but lacking money or a suitable facility for the blind there wasn I could do so at age 14 I put all my energy into Athletics and even participated in the 2004 par Olympic Games in Athens I finished sixth in the 100 meter final and became a celebrity in my hometown at the Olympic Village I discovered that people with disabilities in Europe and America had a far better chance of achieving successful lives than a blind Chinese girl so I did everything I could to get a scholarship to study international relations in the United States that playing my flute again one year later after falling in love with Frederick a Swede I moved to Sweden where I started a career as a professional flautist I dreamed of being able to play with a symphony orchestra but because of my disability it was impossible how could I perform without being able to follow the conductor like dreaming of becoming an airplane pilot yet one journalist along with musicians and inventors believed in my dream and everyone pulled their energy and their talents to make it come [Music] true a new life started for me when I moved to Sweden living far away from my parents far from my culture I started by learning Swedish it wasn a blind person living in a country where you don problematic than for someone who can see huh [Music] Mama hello become before s sing [Music] byebye how long does it take for you to memorize a new piece of music oh a long time a long time if I want to be satisfied with the result in any case it takes me well it know my life as a musician is complicated because I have to learn all the scores by heart it read Braille while I [Music] playing I don a perfect ear that five notes here but I can all sh I have to memorize this passage yes but compared to the time you spend learning Swedish come on don me please it either I meant go to what [Music] note but I was extremely fortunate a few years after I got here one of the greatest flutists in Europe Yan bson agreed to become my teacher hold the first note a little bit longer in the first Motif here his confidence gave me a huge boost and then okay three 4 what are the next notes ah okay I [Music] see I often played marching band music when I was in China in our school orchestra we played a lot of marches and that affected the way I play the flute it ends up I can feel it in my fingers yes you have the rhythm of marches in your fingers right exactly you have to relax as much as possible when you play to showcase the unique aspect of the music think about the notes as if they formed horizontal lines because if you only play them in ually your musical style May lack feeling my life as a Young musician also totally changed when I met a journalist Rick vosman a Chinese colleague told me about wuin she said I know a really interesting person you should meet she blind a musician and has an impressive career as an [Music] athlete I had never yet met a journalist who was interested in my musical goal in my dreams usually after an interview I never hear back from the journalists I met I thought this time would be the same thing but when Rick showed up it was really interesting I felt like he wanted something more than just a single article what doesn what doesn stronger what happened with Rick was pure magic I was able to tell him about my dream I never imagined that he would pay so much attention to [Music] it when I asked Wu Jing what she dreamed about doing she said just think what it would be like Rick if I could play with the symphony orchestra I as a soloist for years and I to get tired of it it would be tremendous if I could be part of a musical family and perform just like everyone else despite my visual disability and then a second miracle happened Rick heard about an amazing invention which let blind soccer players [Music] play shortly after I met Ellen Sun a programmer what we have is a tracking system with 16 cameras covering the entire pitch we can get the position of each player in real time the information is then fed into an iPhone placed on the player head and converted to surround sound each player can hear what happening and get a sense of distance between things [Music] this technical invention really impressed me and so I wondered what would happen if these two women met Rick had a feeling that Ellen soon ideas could help make my dream come true he also thought it would be fantastic to do it with the help of philarmonic Orchestra musicians I didn react to us even though my teacher yet bson was a member I so much want to perform here you know you do want to go in don you we have a rehearsal at 11:15 tomorrow you can join us if you want you could attend a rehearsal to get an idea of how things work and also hear the racket we make [Music] the biggest challenge for Wu Jing will be learning how to follow the conductor to understand the directions the conductor is giving with his [Music] movements honestly it would really be magical if the conductor could be translated into another form of language because it and [Music] complex Jan and Andreas one of the Phil harmonics conductors were extremely skeptical about my chances of being able to play in a symphony orchestra but even so they agreed to come with me to meet Ellen for the first time I was hoping with all my heart that Ellen would believe strongly our project and that she could convince them to continue working with us welcome my name is Ellen hi wujing hi I to come today I have all kinds of questions to ask you about the type of signals a conductor uses to transmit information visual contact is a fast and silent sign of Mutual comprehension it that musicians can indicate to the conductor that they know where they are and they reassuring each other and after there an entire range of other elements that play into it sometimes it mystical I see Bas but what remains essential is the tempo and the Rhythm and this information is usually indicated by the conductor battle so what we have to do is try to find another way to transmit the conductor see to wujing we could try something similar to what Yan does during your classes or an entirely new kind of device right away we did a few tests to find out how I could perceive the conductor replace eyes it was pretty fun Bravo so we could think about transmitting the conductor this way right you think that night Ellen showed us just how much she was willing to work to make my dream come true it something that Wu Jing can feel the closer you get the more it vibrates you can try it with just one hand what a huge support for me she had tons of ideas but you can never play that fast afterward I went back to Ellen out what part of my body would be the most sensitive to receiving the information that my eyes couldn [Music] see we tested a vibrating belt on my hips but there was a time lag in my reaction we also did some tests by putting the vibrating belt at neck level that the sensitivity of the human body some spots are more sensitive to signals than others [Music] our primary challenge was the time lag in transmitting the conductor to the musician ideally we could develop a transmission system that say fast as the human eye maybe even faster we Signal trans but that that the Prototype is not yet fully operational and the vibrating systems don transmit the signals none of the vibrating systems we tested was fast enough so we contacted an engineer Runo who found an alternative to the vibrating systems the most sensitive parts of my body like my tongue or fingertips won work because I use them to play my instrument so he suggested we try my feet to convince us he built a model to show us that transmitting signals to the arch of a foot would be the best solution okay let so now I as well is that it touch it with your hand to see it so this means that I play barefoot yes you can wear pretty socks yes thin ones nothing when I joined the project they had already been working for a while on systems with a vibrating motor but had been unable to solve the problem so I thought we could try to recreate a sort of finger that would be in permanent contact with the skin transmitting the movements to her it seemed simpler provided of course that the information could be transmitted fast enough what do you think shall we try it yes of course what do we have in 44 Time 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 wait a minute okay I [Music] [Laughter] ready for example great it works really well yes and after we just how fast we can go but we also have to develop a type of language so that Wu Jing and I can understand each other by the way how is that going to work the communication between the conductor and the Machine that to attach a small ball on the tip of the conductor infrared light okay I understand I understood that the system helping me to become the first visually impaired person to perform in an orchestra was starting to take shape first of all a small infrared transmitter was attached atted to andreas Baton an infrared camera picks up the movements of the Baton a program created by Ellen will analyze these movements converting them into instructions for a small machine that will reproduce them under my foot with it I will be able to follow the tempo of the music indicated by the [Music] conductor my dream of performing with an orchestra now seems more real than ever will The Impossible truly become possible according to Ellen and Runo however the machine is a long way from being operational so Runo consulted a friend who runs a company specializing in electronic devices let main problem it it were someone else already would have done it maybe we should try to velop a prototype that advanced personally I believe in this project plus we have an entire Factory available here so we can make as many prototypes as we want if necessary my dream would be to find a philanthropist like Bill Gates who you need yes of course we can connect the camera too to see and uh this is an infrared transmitter receiver it transmits infrared signals and when I move my hand closer like this the light reflects off it but the transmitter will actually be placed fairly far away from the conductor and you small reflecting tip on his baton is that it that move it quickly it seems like there slight time lag you think it ction time yes it must be the screen this type of camera is used in movies to capture movement and if you Place several trackers on a costume for example you can get a 3D image but I afraid that initially the image will jump a lot after it makes sure the system can function correctly the project is making slow progress Ellen tells me it to develop a prototype and everything takes a lot of time given our small [Music] budget the solution we is a conductor infrared diode that sends light signals to the cameras and which can operate at different angles but if the conductor moves or makes very wide gestures the diode moves out of range and the camera loses the signal that be very problematic what do you say Runo do you agree with Ellen on this yes it main problem right now that and the motor noise and you installed everything in the other room over there right yeah well let then stand here where you usually do you have to be right in front of the camera there must be something that reflecting the light it interference that what we camera so that it can than those coming from the Baton it should only pick up a single object and ignore all the [Music] [Applause] [Music] rest oh that Carmen that a question of settings the noise comes from the settings yes the signal is probably just as strong for the controller which is here so can we say that our problem is solved it would be a good idea to check with Andreas now so far we worked with theories but we have to check it out in practice it may not work at all that why we have to check it out with Andreas the conductor and also check out how it feels on the arch with the machine we haven yet at this point I say we go to a concert hall with a tape recorder or some kind of recorder and um check it out on site yes check out everything on site get the orchestra to play their classical music and then we see what happens of course we have to check the basic elements like the sound levels and how much we can reduce the noise the machine makes exactly today thanks to my teacher Yan bankson we have a very important meeting Rick and Runo to convince the board of this major institution to participate in the world premiere of our project and your machine it works to be honest we still working on the details we still have a few problems with Reflections it everything that room but it bigger than this ideally the audience shouldn that could really be a problem a big problem [Laughter] not to mention jewelry worn by members of the orchestra but no all joking aside everything seems okay to me it that if we have the slightest technical problem yes you have to realize that we work right now so we need to be sure that everything works properly don worry everything will work absolutely so if I understand correctly we now have to do a real life test is that right you going to be performing right in the middle of the orchestra yes naturally but you can only perform one piece you know that right and you were thinking about brahs right yes brahs Hungarian Dance the one that you selected with Andreas right yes that other questions Rick yes I have a few questions about the media and the press releases personally I can really see doing an international press release it would create a lot of publicity around the event any publicity that promotes the orchestra and the philarmonic is a good thing I very much appreciate your offer we media interested another thing Wu Jing also asked me if it would be possible to invite the Ambassador and the cultural of China yes they told me they were interested of course it would be an honor we could also mention in your press releases the names of the people who provided financial assistance for the project okay but let technology for now I agree the cameras Etc and see how it all works sure good do you have anything else to add no I think that turns out and you wujing I you to spend a lot of time rehearsing the Hungarian dance at home okay I was incredibly excited with the decision by the Philharmonica director I shared it with my dear blind friends Maria and Ida there those symbols indicate which octave you play but what that means a f then there should be words I can read slight Accent on the first note then hold it but but it Swedish algo [Music] wait what does that mean gibberish that it cook I of all give me back my notes I never let them go did you go out today Wu yes I went for a walk with my dog where microwave uh let you fingers too late she cutting the vegetables give me the knife here the Hungarian Dance will have to wait a bit I in China with some Swedish musician friends I finally I cause of the visually impaired in China a cause that heart how do you feel about the idea of going back to China I have to say I to it but at the same time it there still lots of things to plan and do before I leave Al I just hope that um that you won yes I [Music] crossed it and Rick behind but they have a lot of work to do without me and I can amazing adventure with my visually impa Chinese musician friends they need this kind of Hope [Music] [Music] too my first visit was to my grand parents tomb they died when I was in Sweden and I hadn their funerals I was very happy to be able to show Frederick our customs he was completely [Music] intimidated what did you say I was telling our ancestors that we have come to bring them them money it an ancient tradition in China grandfather grandmother if you need money help yourselves we miss you Frederick please you can just say hello you said me [Laughter] [Music] H they hope to be able to use this technology in sectors other than music as well for example blind people who would like to learn taii and other disciplines okay for those who want to do sports or martial arts that kind of thing so that blind people could feel the teacher movements so that people who can his hands could still feel the rhythm and know if the movement goes up or down yes that it and the premiere will be in Sweden yes can you bring it to China I to try it of course I have always dreamed of playing my flute in a symphony orchestra and um I always wanted to be able to uh do the things like everybody else and um I met this in Sweden I met the inventor Ellen sunnd and told her about my dream and then she said to me it should be possible to do do you plan to bring this new technology back to China so that the visually impaired in Young Sue and even more widely the community of the blind in China could use it of course I want everyone who needs it to be able to have access to this progress [Music] [Applause] [Music] how did you find the courage to contact a foreign teacher and move to a school abroad even though you didn English the best way to succeed is above all not to overthink things when you get an idea or want to do something it important to act if there you really want you have to do it because the more you think about it the less you chance and tonight Wu Jing is with us let I had planned this trip myself but all sorts of unexpected events happened because in China you can invitations I was starting to get really tired thank you thank you wujing for sharing your music with [Applause] us s thank you thank you wene that was so great so let bouquet I okay that vase you want to rest a bit yes I pretty tired I think that maybe wait what underneath yes I think I few minutes so now that the concert is over are you happy relieved oh yeah oh yes of course now I can really well I think that I sleep well tonight once again I and very worried I still have to do a TV program with my mother and project the image of a heroic blind woman who despite her disability can travel around the world changing her life and making her Chinese compatriots proud [Music] for [Music] [Applause] [Music] I to crack I don working on the Hungarian dance that we philarmonic every time I pick up my flute I feel like it out I told Frederick that if I die he should bury me here in China where I was [Music] born all these concerts TV shows conferences and family reunions had taken me to the verge of a breakdown fortunately Frederick is taking care of me we back to Stockholm but I don keep going on like [Music] this as soon as we get back doctors prescribe a rest cure for me in a hospital they don have to stay I imagine that Rick and the entire team are extremely worried [Music] how come or well she really okay yes well let makes an appearance this is the place for wujin foot oh okay it is that right yes more or less Rick check how high he can raise the bat on please okay and that out of the field if for example I go this far can you recover the beton signal when I move it back I replace me for the first tests in the concert [Music] hall D we lost a connection again [Music] the connection is lost there I think it there some reflection somewhere well when it works it works well yes but the signal interrupts when I stop that yes the device loses the connection it on standby and sometimes blocks it would be great to be able to use it as soon as the device is completely operational that would give us a more effective overview especially on the limits of the system exactly we could see how it operates and Wu Jin could get an idea of how much work she still has to do we should be getting the new spare parts from Switzerland soon to replace certain elements of the machine that were not reliable enough I think that should solve some of our technical problems you ordered them last Friday right yes and they Express once they of the old parts that were causing problems we really need Wu Jing she the only one who can test this invention assess its potential and determine whether the device operates well for her problem is she here the doctors have allowed me to start playing again so as not to jeopardize the concert it and the others again everyone is relieved that I can come back to work and I the first time [Music] hi hi Runo welcome thank you so what do you think about taking your spot oh do I dare of course come on here if you put your hand there it will give you an idea of how it feels I going to start the machine oh I can feel the small dot here okay go ahead with a 3 four let see what it one two three 4 the one corresponds to a downward movement it goes down on the one right one 2 3 4 the basic Tempo okay got it 1 2 3 3 4 One Two Runo this thing is truly amazing plus it fast does that work do you get it when I do one two three yes now I just have to learn how to use it Runo it a successful test right Runo yes absolutely it cool you it works or not but seriously Runo how did you manage to do this it works amazingly well one one one one the reaction time is also very fast it extraordinary my feet have become eyes now I just have to learn how to use it oh let one measure oh yes it right does it tickle a little it feels very strange tickle tickle I told you it was going to be fun didn I no it body and my hands that are working even my feet are starting to play music which goes to show that you more tricks up your sleeve I can feel small bumps move under my foot from right to left and up to down the machine works perfectly it we come for a fullscale test in the concert hall all this is not really very solid I I need some tape tape everything okay Rick yep I connected the device yet no not yet damn I didn ethernet cable is too short we need a longer one the technician will bring us another [Music] one it seems like there here can you check y [Music] no connection no I can camera while Runo and Rick are struggling with technical issues Jan is filling me in on every detail about the symphony yeah so you then you have to take off your shoes Okay one second I thought of something if you have to make wide gestures to give instru to musicians other than muu Jing it would be better not to do it with the hand holding the Baton remember that the Baton always has to stay in contact with the camera but if the Baton leaves the camera range for a second do you think the camera will pick up the signal again yes I don be a problem so the first violin is going to get up and he wood instruments okay and it that starts [Music] and then then come the string instruments I may have already heard that at a concert and once all the instruments are tuned up then everyone focuses on the conductor and then it can start at any time okay error error I else the final rehearsal was cut short because of technical hitches it alarming that new problems are showing up so close to the end and if you try something else do you get the same signals we see we get the we we have Wi-Fi here what working and since it wireless has this happened before no no we just tested it hey Charlotte hi Charlotte it project call me back okay I left their message [Music] after 2 years of work the big day has finally arrived for all of us for the first time I symphony orchestra something I would never have even dreamed of when I moved to live with Frederick 4 years ago so you feel the movement of the Batton in real time is that it yes exactly in real time in real time huh as if someone was drawing it for you exactly I can wait but do you have the same sense of feeling in the left foot as the right foot abute as I important information that the conductor transmits concerns the tempo and I must say that we did it thank you how did you happen to work on this project before any of this there was a dream I had for a long time so does it tickle your foot Yes actually it tickled at first but not anymore after a while you get used to it how do you see the future of this project well something new comes up every day I think that this system could be very useful in education for example we are in constant touch with the national Federation for the Blind and the visually impaired this concert is going to be something amazing right it won anything you going to be a great event you start at quarter after right yes here for the musicans it for me this concert is like my 100 meter final at the Athens games I have to be focused 300% fortunately I can count on my friends Maria and AA to cheer me on okay I good idea even my mother would have liked to be here [Music] [Music] byebye okay say cheese it looks like a wedding photo looks like the theater to fill up that right yeah there won us it think wow that whoa [Music] [Music] okay we screen I told you there would be a surprise for you tonight all right it we never been done before and I want to tell you a bit about it beforehand all zeros yeah tonight we making a dream come true for Wu Jing by giving her the opportunity to make her debut performance as a solo flutist with the Royal philarmonic Orchestra of Stockholm with which she will play the Hungarian Dance by Brown we brand new technique there infrared camera over there which will pick up the movements of the conductor Baton the end of it is fitted with a small lamp and thanks to a highly sophisticated device Wu Jing will be able to feel on the arch of her foot the gestures that Andreas makes wait there something happening we don zeros here anymore and now I ask an extraordinary person to come on stage ladies and Gentlemen please welcome wuin hey guys we hear a sound when we stage it tick tick tick sound but the box is off yes we haven see what happening yes there be coming from the lighting go see the technicians and ask them to turn down the lights the problem might be coming from there that suddenly the situation is fairly tense and Rick is more stressed than any one else enjoy the concert [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] looks like it [Music] you see that there where from I hadn one is it it should be okay what don [Music] go [Music] [Music] it [Music] works turn in on [Music] [Applause] St people seem to like it that fantastic great I have to admit that I got really stressed when the signals seemed to fade oh there congratulations thank [Music] you you know I didn measure I know I saw it all on the screen backstage Wu you proud of you that was really amazing where hand [Music] with the help of Technology eyes can now be open to new Creative Solutions that can change the [Music] world the winners of the city of Stockholm Innovation scholarship are wuin alen Rick vosman Runo Anderson Yan Bon and Andreas Allen it come true a door has opened up so that dreams all over the world can become a reality a glass wall has sh shattered that was preventing millions of visually impaired people from joining those who are lucky enough to have sight Bruno that

this happens right from the beginning take a seed it must be able to interpret temperature variations or the plant may never come to life nature sends seeds a host of signals sometimes contradictory in the heart of Winter a few days exceptionally warm and sunny might let it believe it is the start of spring if the seed was just a mechanism with no flexibility it would be taken by surprise with such mistaken signals in reality it is rare that premature growth is killed by the cold how is it that most seeds resist the temptation to sprout during a series of warm winter days at the University of Birmingham George Bassel is studying how and under what conditions the seed of thil a star plant in Laboratories germinates and decides when the moment has come to push its Sprout out of its protective shell to start the adventure of life to make its decision does the seed rely on the equivalent of an internal meteorological station giving a reliable forecast of upcoming good weather typically in a plant decisions are reached broadly across the body body of the plant and unusually in the case of the seed there is a small subset of cells within the root tip that are deciding whether or not to germinate a small subset of cells that we call the decision making [Music] Center when the weather is getting warmer the de prision center of the seed colored in red here is on permanent [Music] alert the seeds are receiving many signals from the environment and they have to condense all of these signals into a single decision do I germinate or do I not so the solution seeds have found is to produce two hormones one which is the sleeping promoting dorcy promoting hormone Abid acid and the other one which is the Awakening germination promoting hormone gibberelic acid so you have these two hormones and the seed has an antagonism a fight between the two in whichever one is the dominant one is making the decision for the seed the cells of the decision Center are on the outer edge of the seed here colored in blue and sensitive to Cal as long as the young sprouts risk freezing these cells secrete sleep hormones and the seed stays dormant when the ground gets warmer the peripheral cells stay passive while the interior cells at the center produce growth hormones here colored in Orange which push the seed to wake up contradictory signals grow don can succeed ceed each other for days on end without any action until the growth hormone is durably predominant and the Sprout will form some seeds need unpredictable and cataclysmic events in order to [Music] germinate we now know the the molecule produced by smoke is perceived by seeds and we also know that this molecule is leading to the stimulation of the germination promoting hormone gibc acid causing the seeds to wake up many indigenous peoples have known about the Dynamics of fire for thousands of years they like controlled burn-offs which give a boost to Nature [Music] Australian Aborigines periodically Burns Pacific Land the fire cleans the ground and the seeds of 30 or so species of plant quietly waiting for the signal immediately spring to life and another benefit is having had those that plant material be burned there will be more nutrients in the soil for the plant to then grow in some climates seeds wait silently for the right conditions to sprout and they can wait for a long time a very long time the ability of a seed to stay dormant and not germinate depends upon how long it can stay alive so a seed could stay dormant for a year 5 years even 5,000 years is possible recently we have an example of a 32,000 year old seed coming back to life the only limiting factor is whether or not the seed is able to stay alive so within the soil the seed is in fact still alive it is still breathing albeit at a very very low rate you can imagine like a hibernation [Music] tough able to patiently wait centuries for a fleeting moment sorting out the true from the false are seeds intelligent I don geniuses plants are receiving signals from the environment and Performing computations not unlik a computer might do and Performing logical operations in order to make their decisions so I look at a plant more like a computer than I do a genius [Music] if seeds aren intelligent they are logical Evolution has given them extraordinarily ingenious systems to extend their field and colonize new territory for plants to produce their seeds they have first to be fertilized by pollen Evolution has found extraordinary Solutions these red capsules are Fern pollen highly magnified by an electronic microscope pollen is male seed equivalent to mammal spera since ferns are immobile minuscule arms catapult their pollen into the air they drift on the wind and fertilize other ferns which can can be far [Music] away to avoid rapid dehydration and death during their trip towards the plant they will fertilize these organisms although microscopic fold in upon themselves like [Music] origami the folds and furrows form a shell which retains the water they need to arrive at their destination alive during spring flowering pollen forms clouds of dust which carry and spread life being sedentary is a constraint but hasn land where life is possible how can they reproduce and mingle their genes to avoid degeneration when they are rooted down many take advantage of those who can move freely insects birds mammals and all of those we call pollinators but for a pollinator to go from one flower to another it needs some kind of motivation to attract the keyh holders of their lives plants deploy resources that are extraordinarily diverse some flowers have flamboyant colors others release irresistible perfumes yet others produce delicious Nectars and it works as soon as the flowers open pollinators mass in numbers loaded with the fertilizing pollen harvested on other flowers of the same species [Music] Orchards don into the air the offre displays the colors forms and even the scent of female bees it is so convincing in its disguise that male bees believe it and copulate with the flower thinking they are copulating with females of their own [Music] species since they are covered with the pollen of other office that they have visited shortly before the male bees really fertilize but they fertilize a flower and not an insect to resolve complex problems some plants such as wild tobacco don pollinator but two species which come one after the other according to the state of the [Music] plant the unexpected twists and turns of the pollination of wild tobacco attracted the attention of the researchers at the max plar Institute in Germany for his research Ian Baldwin cultivates plants that originally come from tropical American regions wild tobacco is pollinated by a specific pollinator this moth visits the flowers at night and nectar on those flowers but when it nectar it also lays an egg and that egg turns into a voracious caterpillar that devours the plant our research has been focused on trying to understand how the plant solves this difficult dilemma of having both a good guy and a bad guy as its interactor tobacco flowers open at the end of the day they Point their aromatic petals Towards the Sky to attract moths called tobacco moths or Hawk moths the precise placing of the flower petals allows the Long Horn of pollinators easy access to the sugary pistols during the visit the Horn of the hawk moth is loaded with pollen ah Denny looks like they ready for a good night of pollinations Wonderful Ian and Dany are raising Hawk moths at Sunset they watch the behavior of the moths in the greenhouse where the tobacco plots are in flow when the Horn of the hawk moth slides into the petals to siphon off the nectar it leaves grains of pollen harvested in visits to other tobacco flowers the flower is fertilized but instead of leaving the moth sits on one of the leaves of the tobacco plant and lays eggs Ian has counted up to a dozen eggs on each Leaf of some of the plants available to the moths from his breed with the hawk moth wild tobacco has an efficient pollinator unfortunately the eggs turn into voracious caterpillars which immediately Devour the very plant that fed their parent the black growth on their back has led to their nickname of horned caterpillars strangely these very hungry caterpillars don the poisonous nicotine in the tobacco leaves they double in weight each day everything is eaten even the [Music] flowers the scientists consider the plant endangered after a week of constant attack by the caterpillars and when 20% of the plant damaged if danger is present the wild tobacco plant dramatically changes its Behavior the flowers open by day instead of at night when the hawk moth makes its nightly rounds the flowers are now closed the moth leaves without drinking the nectar and without laying eggs a second step moves into action just as surprising as the first first wild tobacco finds a replacement for the rude moth the elegant [Music] hummingbird the logic is if it can switch to the hummingbird why doesn always stay with the hummingbird cuz the hummingbird doesn it lays hummingbird eggs and the hummingbird eggs don caterpillars that eat the plant while tobacco takes its Chances with the dangers of the hwk moth because the moth offers something that the inoffensive hummingbird doesn offer hummingbirds fly in short distances and only bring in pollen from a small number of plants nearby the hawk moth fly it it flies 500 kmers a night it can pick up pollen from all over the you know the E the western United States and bring in pollen mixtures that are diverse wild tobacco risks being eaten to death to take advantage of a genetic pole that ensures its strength this risk benefit evaluation proves that some plants take the longterm into [Music] account plants are a banquet for many species from the microscopic aphid to the tallest giraffe how to defend against these hordes of teeth jaws and beaks that are constantly trying to eat them Evolution has equipped plants with all sorts of defensive weapons from the most basic to the most sophisticated These Fine growths which spring from different parts of the plant and look like hairs are called triom [Music] some tricomes form an impassible barrier highly dense they prevent pathogenic microorganisms from Gaining access to vulnerable parts of the plant other tricomes like those that cover the leaves of beans are like planks full of nails for adventurous attackers to impale themselves upon cannabis tricomes have a ball-shaped head which contains a repulsive substance for unwanted visitors the Thorns of The Acacia discourage large grazing Animals by inflicting painful wounds to the lips and mouth for the ACAA the problem is that giraffes and kudu don razor sharp Thorns when a kudu or a giraffe comes to graze on it the acacia develops a defense in depth which is even more surprising and efficient than the Thorns its leaves release ethylene a volatile gas that immediately triggers the production of Talon not just by The Acacia which has been attacked but also by neighboring trees tanon is a chemical compound that drives off pathogenic microbes and upsets the herbivores kudu and giraffes can graze how does the occas know if a giraffe or kudu attacks its leaves recent scientific Studies have revealed that any wound to the plant triggers an electric signal as we can see in this exceptional sequence filmed at very high speed the speed of propagation of the signal is approximately 6 cm a minute far below that of humankind where the speed can reach 80 m a second it may seem surprising but plants and humans share a neurotransmitter glutamate plants are different to us they don don they produce glutamate and plants produce that molecule and others when they insects the glutamate and other molecules activate electrical signals that travel through the veins of the leaf from one leaf to the other more surprisingly the plant can identify which type of attacker is at work the alert reaction is far more intense if the leaves are eaten by a caterpillar than if they are cut by a blade or ripped by a tool The Secret of this distinction is that plants react to the saliva if the alert is stronger it because the plant has been taught by Evolution that ravaging caterpillars are many and forever hungry Edward farmer is studying the function of electric signals emitted by plants under attack by a predator he places electrodes on the leaves of thalis whose scientific name is arabidopsis taliana we use a rabid opsis in our laboratory because it grows very quickly and we can share what we learn in a rabid opsis with hundreds of other Laboratories throughout the world g under attack fail CR undergoes stress which in turn triggers its defense system detailed understanding of the electrical activity of an injured thil Crest will help us understand its defense system Edward farmer needs an agent that will measure electrical activity in the plant common aphid the researcher will transform the aphid into a living mobile electrode to do this he attaches a very thin copper wire to its back put the electrode on very good up a bit and the aord becomes a guinea pig move it up a little bit more on top of the insect over it yeah y good that yeah that [Music] good an earthing wire is buried in the pot when the connected aphid perforates the leaf cells the aphid will transmit the electrical signals of the plant these are C Ed by the copper wire attached to the aphid the ordinary electrical activity of the plant appears clearly okay Jing the aphid plant number one it looks really good we can go ahead and inflict the wound this is where the experiment really begins the plant reacts to its wound by sending an electric signal this is the peak on the recording this signal spread to other leaves of the plant and this triggers the secretion of a hormone known as [Music] jasmonate when an insect bites a leaf and glutamate is made electrical signals travel to the other leaf and they cause the other Leaf to produce a hormone called Jasmin the hormone is active the plant becomes defended the leaf is no longer digestible insects can and they leave [Music] jasmine8 is more concentrated at the plant Center where new tender leaves are form these are more attractive for insects and need higher levels of protection a priority because they ensure the plant growth levels of Jasmin are lower further out from the center of the plant the older leaves are less crucial for the plant comparing two groups of thil Crest confirms the role of jasmine8 in the plants defense system so these plants here are normal wild type plants perfectly capable of Defending themselves they make Jasmin a they have been attacked by insects but they box here these plants have been mutated they lack the ability to make jasmonate and they [Music] damaged jasmonate secreted due to an attack triggers the production of a bitter taste and unbearable odors for ravaging insects this flood of Aromas is not unsimilar to what grass exhales when being mowed who would have thought before the recent research of Ted turling revealed it that good old country sweet corn also uses chemical defenses but not to repel its aggressors when threatened our familiar corn is so Machiavellian that it sense Shivers up your spine and has inspired writers of horror and science fiction movies corn is regularly attacked by spodoptera the caterpillar of a moth that is invasive and never stops eating bopa has a predator a little wasp called euplectrus whose fragile appearance hides a killer with horrifying methods Korn knows this and when spodoptera attacks it calls the Killer in the blink of an eye the WASP injects a droplet of eggs into the caterpillar body the eggs quickly hatch and give birth to larae which grow by devouring the spodoptera from the inside out in space no one can hear you scream says one of the characters in the movie Alien here the WASP answers the call of the Corn when we started this research we thought it what the would be the feces of the caterpillars that is attracting these parasitic wasps but when we started looking at this in more detail we found that it that are actively starting to produce Volo compounds that form an odor that is very attractive to these parasitic wasps it takes a few hours for the attacked corn to produce and liberate in the surrounding air these wasp attracting sents neighbors to the plant under attack perceive the warning signal and in turn reproduce it and the signal travels to the Wasps lying in Ambush these olfactive signals TI Target caterpillars with the Precision of a GPS smaller plants are most vulnerable to these caterpillars in fact one caterpillar can completely destroy and kill one plant so that plants will benefit the most from these signals small plants emit many more compounds larger quantities of these compounds than larger plants to test the efficiency of this defense system corn has been genetically modified to not react when attacked by caterpillars the result is spectacular the Field of Corn that cannot call the Wasps for help is eaten right down to its roots Plants release volatile compound BS specific to each pest that attacks them and surprisingly these Airborne molecules also attract the specific predator for that pest in this way plants can count on wasps but also on ladyb birds and bugs which swallow up aphids in large quantities [Music] the more and more that we start to understand the language of plants each different insect induces a different response in the plant a different bouquet of volatiles that means that they that we can tap into we should be able to develop sensors that can then perceive these odors and tell us what is going on with the plant Ted turing artificial nose which identifies the principal Airborne substances released by plants under attack this prototype will be improved and reduced in size before practical field use [Music] and we hope that eventually we can put on robots that then go through the field smelling the plants and tell a farmer which plant is under attack by a cater the fight between plants and their pests is like a a never- ending Series in the game of if you attack me I call your enemy who will kill you other insects have found surprisingly unusual answers in this way Ted churing and a Chinese team have recently discovered that little white flies the Orioles can alter the message sent by the plants they [Applause] attack it adaptations in insects that allow them to circumvent the defenses of plants by making the plant think that they under attack by something else the alert message that they send out suggest that they not by an insect and that neighboring plant will start defending itself against the pathogen and not against white flies [Music] [Applause] [Music] white flies may seem insignificant at First Sight but they attack and damage over 600 different species of plants so they this is what they call the co-evolutionary arms race between plants and insects and obviously in this particular case the insects are ahead of the game but we can expect that certain plants have already adapted to that and they launched the right defense we haven the future in nature the plants that are now being fooled will have evolved different mechanisms to launch the correct uh defenses against white flies as well it played out between plants and insects what partner being constantly forced to evolve and adapt by diversifying and improving their tactics it they serve as laders hiding places for love making and for nesting but it well less known that trees also use birds as corn calls in killer wasps for help trees Infested by colonies of caterpillars call Birds to their aid when the leaf is fully developed they attacked by caterpillars that are already quite large birds are attracted in search of food at this moment the large caterpillars are an important source of nutrition but we different context we earlier in time at a stage when the caterpillars have only just hatched they inside [Music] the freshly hatched caterpillars are less than a millimeter long the tree must have extremely good sensors to detect their presence and send out a warning [Music] [Laughter] [Music] signal Samuel Caro has built an Avary in a fire shape at the end of one of the corridors he places a healthy Young Oak [Music] Tree on the other Corridor he places a Young Oak Tree on which he releases 20 just hatched caterpillars the two trees are hidden by a white cover so they cannot be seen Samuel places a bird in the nesting platform of the third Corridor of the AY and actions the fans which send the Airborne compounds produced by the two trees toward the bird off you go hop the bird takes flight and chooses one of the two trees Samuel Caro repeats the experiment a 100 times and almost all the birds fly blindly to the Oak infested with caterpillars this isn chance the infested tree is secreting chemical compounds that signal to the birds that it has food these micro sents attract the birds to zones where there is a future abundance of caterpillars they are more prone to build their nests in the area and reproduce more reproduce earlier lay more eggs and in that way act as a pressure on the caterpillars and get rid of the Predators for this tree by encouraging the birds to move into the neighborhood The Oaks ensure long-term protection with each Invasion the buds produce an AR atic call and the birds fly in Samuel Caro has synthesized the Airborne compounds released by The Infected Oak [Music] buds we took this aromatic bouquet into the wild spreading it about the nesting zones where the birds might reproduce and we saw that in total there were more eggs laid in the zones with artificial Aromas no doubt because they thought there would be a large amount of food two three or four weeks later for a long time science didn know about the complex links and signals that plants have between each other but also with insects birds and perhaps with mammals industrial chemical pesticides were a simple answer efficient and profitable for getting rid of pests today the continued degradation of soil is bringing agriculture towards finding other Solutions we can imagine that in the future we can combine the presence of these nesting platforms with alarm sense produced by the trees to strongly attract insect eating birds and so act as an integrated biological defense system and avoid the massive use of pesticides If plants use several surprisingly efficient strategies of Defense above ground what is going on underground in The Roots the Earth is crawling with life worms aari springtails centipedes bacteria and many other species still yet to be discovered all of this busy World tirelessly moves between the roots of plants and the melium of mushrooms that weave beneath our feet a dense and interwoven network fungi appeared 450 million years ago and have colonized all terrestrial and Aquatic environments it them the first plants could not have conquered dry land plants and fungi have been partners for a long time here we have an incredibly diverse range of decomposers degrading fungi which represent 40% of the forest biodiversity they break down tree trunks branches and Dead Leaves and thanks to that decomposing activity of degrading they feed the soil where the micro risal fungi absorb the elements necessary for tree growth seps Amon mascaria Chantels rousi milkcap fungi Boles and many others because the family of micro isal fungi is large they are the fruit of underground organisms called Mycelia a network of filaments that explore vast surfaces in search of [Music] food microbiologist at the French enry Research Center fris Maran studies how plants benefit from underground ecosystems here we have a very nice sep it probably connected via a melion system underground to this young Oak here it the micro risal root lightly colored red and then we have one here orange probably another micro risal fungus installed on the root system so this Oak is interacting with dozens of different symbiotic fungi forming micro risal structures with different forms and colors with probably different functions one of the essential functions of these sleeve likee structures is to protect the roots of plants from springtails round worms and other tiny little creatures that seek to eat them [Music] the other function is to weave a dense network of filaments uniting fungal Mycelia and plant roots this network Bond prepares the soil as it contains nutrients necessary for both plants and [Music] fungi what is surprising is that the health of this Forest surrounding us depends on this little structure we call Micro Riser symbiosis between plants and fungi through micer fungi Supply plants with Rare Minerals like phosphorus and nitrogen which they capture in the soil along with other nutrients in exchange the fungi received sugars from plant photosynthesis which not having chlorophyll they can themselves look laboratory observation by con focal microscope allows us to understand the symbiotic Fusion of the melium filaments and plant [Music] roots here we of micro risal fungi all these green filaments colonize the whole of the root surface in red and end up by forming a micro Riser cap here in green here we can clearly see the fungi filaments which surround the root forming a kind of sock and then this network of filaments which penetrate the root and burrow between the cells to the heart of the [Music] root through this fusional connection with the microa plants make close and fertile bonds with many fungal Mycelia and with very many and varied colonies of [Music] bacteria in green are the bacteria that jump twitch and run along the highways of fungal micro risal filament this allows the bacteria to move a long way which they couldn fungus [Music] the bacterial population that proliferate in the soil are to plants what intestinal microbes are to humans two plants have similar relations with the bacteria which surround them as we do to our own soil is like a digestive tube there is Flora in the soil made of microorganisms and the plant is able to search out and select use useful bacteria for itself useful especially to improve soil fertility but also useful to protect itself from diseases and climatic changes to appreciate the influence of bacteria on the development of pulses like for example corn or beans the French en Center has built an entirely automized experimental platform plant development is measured in highly controlled conditions Leonel rer and his team grow corn plots in pots filled with soil where the number and diversity of bacteria is precisely dosed through very high definition cameras the pockets of bacteria are easy to quantify and qualify in the images [Music] [Music] here we truly discover the root of the plant and on that root if we look closely we can see little balls called nodes in these nodes are millions of bacteria which are raised by the plant and in return these bacteria feed the plant because they are capable of capturing in atmospheric nitrogen nitrogen in the air and transform it in a way that the plant can assimilate it it feeds the bacteria and the bacteria feed the [Music] plant the more variety and quantity of bacteria the more prosperous the plants the shape and dimension of the pockets vary according to the type of plant in the same way that the microa secrete hormones to attract fungal Mycelia the root nodes secrete hormones to attract [Music] bacteria once the bacteria are enclosed in the nodes or capsules of the roots the plant modifies them they change shape grow longer and their metabolism [Music] Alters instead of feeding on diverse substances the encapsuled bacteria now only feed on atmospheric nitrogen which they turn into nitrogen the plant can assimilate as a fertilizer at inra France we have shown that if the microb biodiversity is reduced in the soil plant development is reduced we fertilizer is added to the soil where there is less biodiversity the plant still won if there was more biodiversity so if we compare fertilizer to biodiversity it Diversified soil than to add [Music] fertilizer these win-win Partnerships between plants and bacteria are already used in agriculture especially for pulse cultures and that allows us to bring nitrogen in a natural way and limit the use of chemical fertilizers in agriculture systems which are poorer less fertile notably in Africa this simply allows agriculture to happen to develop plants where they couldn survive before because the soils weren fertile enough and one of the first applications is the development of the great green wall in South Sahel which has allowed a whole Zone to be reforested limiting the expansion of the desert [Music] [Applause] [Music] in the heart of the forest there are thousands of species of mushrooms interacting with the trees it permanent dialogue unfortunately in the farm just beside it massive use of pesticides has eliminated all microbiol life the plants are alone and no longer talk it for the first time in the history of industrial farming harvests of cultivated crops have stopped increasing confronted with environmental constraints and the limits of selection our agriculture is at a dead end a new biological approach offers A New Perspective for Progress one that remains to be fully explored hopefully in the future micro risal symbiosis and nitrogen fixing symbiosis will be developed by humankind to help plants adapt to climate change the discoveries over the past few years have considerably improved our vision of the Plant World the closer we look at them the more plants become familiar to us perhaps one day we stop seeing them as objects that can be infinitely cut exploited and transformed and see them for what they are precious allies without which we would be lost [Music]	Success
Planet Power: The Journey of Electricity and a Sustainable Future! | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob_SqW_u2XM	SLICE Science	[Music] this technological Wonder generates its own electricity from the light of the sun Bing Picard and bosberg the worthy Heirs of the Pioneers who tamed and domesticated electricity [Music] in less than two centuries electricity has become indispensable to our lives and impossible to live [Music] [Music] without it has changed our world for the [Music] better but so for the [Music] worse our incessantly growing needs threaten the environment and are changing the climate of our planet yet the planet itself offers the means of producing electricity in a cleaner way with renewable energies every minute everywhere in the world renewable energy sources are producing phenomenal [Music] power the sun alone sends the Earth more energy in an hour than Humanity consumes in a year by flying day and night without Fuel theard and borberg carried a message of Hope around the world [Music] [Music] it all started with a dream berron bicard the father of solar impulse grew up surrounded by pioneers and explorers as far as I can remember I always been fascinated by exploration and scientific [Music] Adventures his grandfather AUST invented the pressurized cabin and was the first man to fly into the stratosphere and see the curvature of the Earth his father jacqu used a pressurized cabin in a submersible to descend to the deepest part of the world he found life at the bottom of the [Music] sea the adventure today is not about returning to the moon it achieving other just as incredible Feats like freeing ourselves from our dependency on fossil fuels or resolving environmental problems but in a cost effective way otherwise no one will ever support Environmental Protection but what is absolutely essential is allowing ourselves to dream the pioneers of electricity held onto their dreams and change the world before them without electricity life was very [Music] [Music] different the ancient Greeks believed that lightning was made for the Gods Zeus by the three [Music] Cyclops Greek philosopher mathematician and astronomer theis knew that Amber had strange properties the Greeks called it electron when rubbed with an animal skin electron attracts dust and produces tiny electric shocks 23 centuries of different civilizations came and went with hundreds of inventions that improved human [Music] life yet electricity was not part of this progress by 1749 electricity was still thought of as a strange fluid and a fashionable curiosity that was shockingly amusing the true nature of lightning remained unknown until Benjamin Franklin this science loving American theorized capturing lightning would prove its electric nature no one took him seriously until his experiments were tested and he was proved right his lightning rod became a huge hit around the world ultimately Benjamin Franklin demonstrated that electricity is a natural [Music] phenomenon betron is an incurable adventurer in 1999 he and Brian Jones completed the first non-stop Trip Around the World in a hot hair balloon when they landed at the end of this 20-day Adventure their fuel tanks were almost empty when I saw what was left in the fuel tanks I promised myself that I would make another flight around the world but this time without a single drop of fuel and symbolically solar impulse was born that day betron would pursue this dream for the next 16 years [Music] to fly around the world without fuel but how a blimp is too sensitive to wind load so is a glider which can take off on its own you need an airplane with an electric motor powered by a battery that can be recharged in Flight covered with photovoltaic cells the plane can generate its own electricity from sunlight a photovoltaic cell converts sunlight into electricity it is made of a thin slice of semiconductor material usually silicon chemically treated the slice shows a negative and a positive layer with an electric field in between exposure to light forces silicon electrons into action when the two layers are linked by a circuit electrons move from one layer to the other this is electric current as long as they cells produce electricity previous solar planes have shown the limitations of solar power as they had to land when there were clouds or at Sunset so how can a solar powered plane keep flying at night in 2002 brron found the answers at epfl in Switzerland one of Europe science and engineering schools Andre borberg entrepreneur MIT graduate and ex-fighter pilot took the lead in conceiving and designing an Innovative solar powered plane when there is not enough light a solar plane has to switch to its batteries to continue flying the first battery was invented by Italian scientist alesandro Volta his compatriot Luigi galvani believed electricity was of animal origin after hanging dead frogs on a copper Hook from an iron ballustrade and observing the Frog contract but BTA proved that electricity came from the contact between different Metals making a pile of silver and zinc discs he obtained a direct current for the first [Music] time in 1800 the world still had no knowledge of electricity but volta the beginning of a new era the SAR impulse feasibility study took one year of calculation simulation and design one year to invent the first Perpetual flight airplane and bring it to life on paper in theory it could fly day and night with engines powered by both sunlight and batteries four batteries for four especially Efficient Electric Motors the principle behind the electric motor was discovered by Michael faray this self-taught English chemist and physicist combined magnetism and [Music] electricity he succeeded in transforming electric energy and Perpetual mechanical movement Paving the way for the electric [Music] motor solar impulses engines are almost 97% efficient while the efficiency of a gasoline powered car engine is only 30% this means we waste 70% of the fuel we put into our cars bolstered by their feas ability study betron and Andre approached the major aircraft manufacturers but the response was always the same impossible Andre took over the responsibility of building the airplane with the team he set up it took 10 years for Michael Faraday to reverse the principle of the motor and invent the first electric [Music] generator soon these experiments would leave the laboratory to rapidly conquer the world [Music] the first practical application of electricity that really changed people lives was the telegraph information could be sent in seconds instead of weeks and I pronounce you man and wife Samuel Morse a New York artist was responsible for this leap in progress when he found a way to transmit electrical signals over a wire laid between station in 1844 the first telegraph was transmitted in mors code between Washington and Baltimore very soon Telegraph lines crisscrossed the United States and Europe by 1858 the first undersea cable was connected from one side of the Atlantic to the [Music] other crossing the oceans in their solar powered plane was the biggest obstacle Picard and borberg had to over come because the aircraft manufacturers refused the project bertron and Andre oversaw the construction of the plane structure in a Boatyard only boat Builders had the skills to make the airplane light enough for the best Energy Efficiency its structures and cling would therefore be made of carbon a skin four times thinner than paper and applied with an iron the first electric iron was invented in New York City in 1882 at the time its star innovator was Thomas Edison he had a number of inventions to his name but it was his electric light bulb that brought him International Fame totally covered with photovoltaic cells solar impulse was the result of the perfect ratio between weight size and electric motor power each square meter of Soul cells provides enough energy to fly 8 kg to carry the heavy batteries necessary to fly through the night the wings had to be gigantic late in 2009 solar impulse embarked on its Maiden flight with test pilot Marcus shardell in an unfinished cockpit [Music] solar impulse had just completed its first flea jump but the plane was dangerously unstable dangerously unstable this was precisely the problem of the direct current supplied by Thomas Edison his first coal fueled power plant located in downtown Manhattan delivered direct current electricity but only over a very short distance his solution was to build a plant every 2 miles Nicola Tesla also dreamt of supplying the world with electricity but by using an alternating current which is easier to distribute over long distances Tesla was hired to build an entire alternating current power grid by George Westinghouse for several months numerous tests were carried out on solar impulse to gauge structural strength aerodynamics and vibrations speaking of Vibes those between Tesla and Edison were not very good there were such high commercial stakes in supplying cities with electricity that they sparked the current [Music] War Edison orchestrated a campaign that tried to show how dangerous high voltage alternating current was [Music] Tesla closed the argument with a demonstration he sat inside a faraday cage that shielded him from a strong alternating current that Lit the light bulb he was [Music] holding as a result westing house was awarded the contract for installing the United States entire electrical infrastructure and to this day almost all the electricity across the globe uses Nikola Tesla [Music] Technology power plants were built all over the world today there are still only two ways to produce electricity with photovoltaic cells or by driving a turbine that generates a current like Faraday generator turbines can be powered by renewable resources provided by Nature like [Music] wind waves and Tides or waterfalls and dams or driven by heating water to obtain pressurized steam using heat from the earth in geothermal power plants or from the Sun and concentrated solar power plants non-renewable energy also Powers turbines using the heat from the fision of uranium atoms or the burning of coal gas and oil in fossil fuel fire thermal power plants summer heralded the ultimate test for solar impulse the first day and nightlight for a solar airplane Andre would have to rise to nearly 30,000 ft Before Sunset [Music] the higher the altitude during the day the longer the plane can glide at night with its batteries fully charged Before Sunset solar impulse would idle its Motors and glide for about 4 hours the time it takes to descend to 5,000 ft in altitude at this height the engines would switch back to cruise power using the energy stored in the batteries until [Music] dawn then a new cycle would begin with the sunlight recharging the batteries and powering the engines at the same time after 26 hours of uninterrupted flight and without having consumed a single drop of fuel the dream of Perpetual flight had come true now bertron and Andre truly believed that solar impulse could take them around the world [Music] imagine imagine a flight around the world powered entirely by the Light of the [Music] sun solar impulses departure for its round the world flight was approaching with an improved version of the aircraft being assembled in Abu Dhabi the Winks were now watertight the engines were a little more powerful and Battery efficiency had been [Music] optimized the cockpit was slightly bigger but not yet pressurized the pilot could put the seat back and there was a laboratory as well with the wingspan of two Airbus a320s but 60 times lighter solar impulse weighed as much as a car but had the power of a motorcycle a truly exceptional aircraft very large it very light this makes it extremely sensitive to turbulence and difficult to fly the two pilots simulated countless flight hours to better understand the plane characteristics originally I Explorer not a pilot so learning to fly solo impulse was terribly difficult it took me 2 years of sweat training and tears to get there when turning a passenger plane can Tilt at a 30° angle for solar impulse anything above 10° the plane would go out of control and the pilot would have to parachute [Applause] out there are basically two situations where you would have to jump off the plane when there is not enough energy to get through the night and then you have one or two hours to prepare to jump but it would be heartbreaking because it means abandoning the plane that is still flying very well and there is the absolute emergency where the engine or the batter is on fire or a wing is melting because of the Heat and you have to jump to save your life then there is no time to say goodbye to the plane solar impulse is very sensitive to wind in Flight a 30 mph headwind is enough to slow it down and almost push it backwards it doesn make Landing dangerous as for the sun if the temperature is too high all the epoxy in the plane can soften like chewing gum solar power is on the way to becoming one of our main sources of energy in 45 minutes our planet receives energy from the Sun equivalent to our annual consumption the potential of solar power to produce electricity is therefore enormous four times that of all other sources of energy combined all the parameters of the flight were transmitted by satellite link to the mission control center in Monaco just like a space mission the plane and its pilot would be monitored Day and Night by 25 people meteorologists air controllers flight engineers and doctors Prince Albert of Monaco gave the signal for takeoff on the first leg of the trip from Abu Dhabi to the sultanate of Oman [Music] the first flights went on without a hitch in Earth from clouds and carbon dioxide are the main greenhouse gases they naturally maintain heat on the Earth surface without the greenhouse effect the climate would be freezing greenhouse gases are equivalent to the glass walls of a Farm Greenhouse the sun heats the ground which reflects this heat as infrared Rays invisible to the naked eye but the glass of the greenhouse blocks some of these reflected Rays trapping heat inside while a balanced greenhouse effect is beneficial to life on Earth this Natural Balance is Fragile with room for Only One Pilot Patron and Andre flew alternating legs of the flight each used his own relaxation technique self hypnosis for betron and yoga for Andre for the first time ever a solar plane flew over China Patron arrived in Chongqing a megalopolis of 35 million people here the message carried by solar impulse took on its full meaning if all the efficient Technologies used solar impulse were implemented today everywhere in the world we could already cut Mankind and by the same token CO2 emissions now China is using its technological knoow to reduce its huge carbon footprint at present most of the world electricity is produced by thermal power plants these factories burn coal oil or gas emitting tons of CO2 into the atmosphere since the industrial re ution human activities have drastically increased the amount of CO2 naturally present in the atmosphere the more CO2 there is the greater the Greenhouse Effect and the higher the temperature of the Earth surface what makes it so hot inside a car in the summer is an extreme greenhouse effect on the Pacific coast the weather had deteriorated resulting in weeks of delay for the most dangerous leg of the journey to fly non-stop between China and Hawaii required 6 days in a row of favorable weather over the Pacific finally on May 30th taking advantage of the first possible window of good weather Andre took off for Hawaii but the weather over the Pacific had deteriorated again and solar impulse was grounded in Japan for another 21 days while weather is local for hours or days climate is defined by average patterns across the entire planet over long periods of time climate has always changed naturally but gradually over thousands of years a change of 5° C in 10,000 years is the difference between the climate of the Ice Age and that of today this was enough to raise the level of the ocean by about 400 ft at the current rate we could see a 5° C increase before the end of the century at last Andre got the green light to begin his non-stop flight of 5 days and nights over the Pacific Ocean to Hawaii bertron was at the Mission Control Center for takeoff this transpacific flight was the Moment of Truth for the entire solar impulse team Andre was relieved to finally be taking off on the flight of his life however his wife wife Yasmine was anxious aware of the risk Andre was taking we all support you Andre from all our heart we wish you all the best and absolutely great flight and the it well although I Tred to make it subber I really moved you cannot imagine all day Andre prepared himself and the plane for their first night over the ocean but just one objective to stay in the air until morning the key to Perpetual flight is Energy Efficiency that Optimum combination of ultralight materials optimal thermal insulation LED lighting High motor and battery performance and computerized Energy Management all of the technology developed for solar impulse can be used in our everyday lives we absolutely need to replace all the outdated and polluting systems with clean efficient technologies that are more profitable that create jobs and economic growth because today the goal is not to be ecological but simply logical the pioneers of electricity would no doubt have loved this idea but it took bertron and Andre to harness electricity to fly around the world flying 5500 miles over the Pacific Andre was about to complete the longest solo non-stop airplane flight in history preparation planing it can I knew it people was nothing gble it it I mean I about morning had barely broken over Hawaii but everyone was waiting for the plane and its heroic pilot [Music] as it landed in the Hawaiian Dawn solar impulse became the indisputable demonstration of the efficiency of clean Technologies and a wonderful message of Hope For Humanity [Music] by completing the first round the world flight without fuel the solar impulse team made history what was absolutely magical was to fly continuously for several days and nights looking at the sun looking at my four electric motors and huge propellers turning with no noise no pollution no fuel and then I was saying to myself I in the future I in fact not at all I what today and it in the past as our energy needs increase Adventures like that of solar impulse Inspire us to look to the future with hope because real solutions already exist and they work even though we don access to the same renewable resources the power of nature offers enormous potential and by using Smart Energy grid technology each community and Country can find its own Solutions [Music] [Music] Today industrial and technological opportunities that are profitable and will improve our lives and boost local and global economic development so because at the same time we protecting the environment it makes me very optimistic [Music] inspired by the examples of pioneers like Benjamin Franklin Nicola Tesla bertron bicar and Andre borberg today generation of adventurers will work to improve our lives by ensuring the future runs on planet p [Music]	Success
Volcanoes of Doom: Predicting the Next Eruption in Naples | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1knLDUKUKGY	SLICE Science	[Music] but the calmness of the sea is deceptive as this is one of the most dangerous places on the planet the volcanic activity is one of the highest in the world the reason for this is the presence of volcanoes such as vvus whose imperious cone looks down over the bay everyone here is aware of the cataclysmic eruption that killed thousands of people in the town of Pompei for the time being the volcano seems to be quiet and beneath it 3 million inhabitants live in normal existence in a bustling 21st century Metropolis amidst the Grandeur of the city that the monster could spit out its angry poison at any time we don when nor with how much force but we do know for certain that it will happen but the city is surrounded by another threat which comes from a network of gigantic but almost invisible volcanoes over which part of Naples lies any future eruption could destroy the region and half of Europe and yet for centuries this Mortal threat has not prevented humans from settling close to these Giants where some of the most fertile land is to be found and these are the only dangers which weigh heavily on Naples in Sicily Mount Etna regularly spews out magma down its slopes and it too could destroy the whole of the region and not far away stroli could at any moment trigger a tidal wave swallowing up the city and its surroundings a wave would reach the port of Naples in around 20 minutes scientists are in a race against the clock to bring the convulsions of these fiery monsters under control Etna is one of the volcanoes producing the world sulfur both under the sea and on land day and night scientists analyze the slightest variations which could be the signals of imminent eruption using the most up-to-date technology will their tireless persistence enable them to foresee the volcanic rage millions of lives are depending on it [Music] [Music] vvus is the most famous volcano in history for the wrong reasons dating back to Antiquity its destructive Flames engulf the city of Pompei and killed its inhabitants several eruptions since then have occurred in the [Music] region but today Vesuvius is not the most potent threat on the other side of the Bay of Naples a lesser-known fatal danger hangs over an area where 350,000 people reside beneath this enormous expans of lowland lies a group of developing volcanoes historically named the Fagan Fields meaning the burning Fields this network of 72 volcanoes extends over a huge surface area of 100 square km to the west of Naples on land and Under the Sea compared to Classic volcanoes with their recognizable cones these ones are atypical and more or less invisible on the surface they volcanoes of which there are only 18 in the world it because of the volume of eruptions that are produced today this sprawling volcanic network is showing early warning signs of a massive eruption among the many craters in the Fagan Fields it being the most closely examined by the world intense activity from this steamy bubbling sight more than 2500 tons of CO2 and sulfur are released from the depths of the Earth every day Maro deito is a volcanologist from the National Institute of geophysics and volcanology in Naples the ingv he is particularly concerned about this area four years ago a whole family died here in the middle of this crater when they were walking on its unstable surface if you walk on the crater floor can actually feel the chasms because the molten rock is porous and chasms are created underneath by the emission of gases under concentrated high pressure the gases can erode toine particles of The Rock and create chasms below the crater level nevertheless despite this permanent danger thousands of people live on the edge of the sulat Tera [Music] just behind the sufara site in the hollow of this Cliff another volcano is also bubbling away this is pelli 10 years ago the owners of the tennis hotel nearby had to leave the premises extremely hot and intense steam is being emitted the temperature must be above 100° and these emissions are what all this the walls and floors are being covered like octopus tentacles in a burning gas which leaves a thick whitish coat and an acrid smell of sulfur in the air the smell is particularly strong here a bit like rotten eggs a smell which gets into the nose we mustn here long pelli was only a small Hall a few few years ago today it square m and emits more than 600 tons of gas and steam every day creating these striking ferals if for example there increase in one component compared to another this could mean that magma is moving towards the surface so any variations will give us an indication about how the system is evolving and whether an eruption is after detailed analysis the scientists come to a cast iron conclusion the flagan fields will very soon erupt this will be catastrophic for the inhabitants the campan ignite eruption was the most spectacular eruption in the history of the flagan fields it spewed out more than 300 cubic km of magma a formidable amount never equaled in the region and ejected millions of tons of porous volcanic rock called pmus Stone scientists also discovered that 15,000 years ago this monster produced a second major eruption this time ejecting a volcanic rock called the Neapolitan yellow tough these destructive byproducts were nevertheless used by the Greeks and Romans to build their cities the whole of the city of Naples was constructed with this material which is what gives it such a unique character Claudio scarpati is a professor of geochemistry and volcanology here we have some Blended examples the Junu church is composed of fragments blocks of stone extracted from the campanian ignimbrite whereas behind me is the Santa Kara Church which you can see is entirely built from blocks of Neapolitan yellow tough to some extent you could say that thanks to the extraction of this material from beneath the city the outline of Naples is the positive image of a negative for Claudio scarpati there spot which highlights Roman Ingenuity situated on the other side of the city it from volcanic rock [Music] we Reservoir it technological feat the pillars are 15 M tall the reservoir contained 12 million lers of water which helped to keep afloat the Roman Fleet based nearby at cap this was the only reservoir of this size built entirely into the Rock in the whole of the Roman Empire but the Neapolitan yellow tough does have one major drawback its porous in order to waterproof the walls they had a clever idea they made a special kind of mortar it kesto it elements brick fragments Limestone and the most important element hsan volcanic a of which there is an abundance in this area they mixed these three things together and once set it made the walls totally waterproof this then enabled the reservoir to contain such huge quantities of water today the imminent erruption of the flagan fields threatens to destroy what the neapolitans spent centuries constructing and in this zone of everpresent danger there and more familiar which continues to worry the inhabitants vvus has been a brooding presence for centuries reminding neapolitans that its strength is intact and its anger can still rain down on the city its last eruption in 1944 has stayed fresh in people memories its Flames destroyed whole Villages over a period of 11 days with a death toll of 26 Vesuvius has been dormant since then but this deafening silence is a source of worry for many scientists who have been examining the volcano in detail since the middle of the 19th Century Modern volcanology was born on the flanks of vvus Mau defo comes from a long line of illustrious predecessors and continues to watch the potentially explosive volcano which is capable of ejecting tons of ashes in a matter of moments for us neapolitans vvus is the ultimate volcano it has dominated our culture and I it and for those of us who work a lot in this domain it that we find something new about it every day Maro DeVito studies the strateg graphy the geological layers of the volcano nicknamed The Exterminator when volcanologists study stratigraphy it written account Turning Page after page of the history of the volcano eruptions the accumulation of the different layers enables the volcanic activity to be retraced a long way back the oldest eruption dates back 4 100,000 years and the most recent was the one in 1944 the reddish gray layers correspond to an eruption plume which rose 6.7 km into the sky and deposited Ash over a huge area as far away as Calabria the Final Phase is shown by this light gray layer which is where the magma chamber was virtually emptied followed by water that entered the system entailing other extremely strong explosions today the seemingly calm vvus does not fool the scientists they know that it remains dangerous and very much alive registering over 700 seismic Tremors every year 600,000 people live in close proximity to the volcano so it must be watched 24 hours a day this instrument measures the flow of CO2 and the temperature of the gas emissions it also enables us to have a more en idea about the evolution of the volcano it understand the system because it can give us an indication about the possible movements of magmatic currents this is one instrument among many others which enables us to listen to the volcano breathing the volcano gases dissolved in the magma when they rise to the surface of the crater the pressure drops and the gases expand they form bubbles which spread over the surface it this bottle which contains a gas-rich liquid as soon as you alter the pressure by removing the cap you can see the gas separating from the liquid and rising to the surface in order to understand the origin of volcanoes and magma we have to go back to the beginning of the Earth history 250 million years ago the continents that we know know today were all one the Pangia but as a consequence of geological activity this supercontinent broke into a dozen tectonic plates which separated and drifted apart to form the continents of [Music] today the geological cause of these movements can be found beneath the earth crust this layer is 30 km thick which is nothing compared to the 6,000 km radius of the planet between this crust and the Earth whose temperature is a furnace likee 5,000 de C there is an upper manle 650 km deep this mantle consists of molten rocks whose currents circulate around each other they act like moving walkways and displace the plates of the Earth crust this is called convective movement over millions of years these plates drift apart by several cenm per year they slide separate and collide in Italy the African plate slides under the Eurasian plate in the geological Wars of the titans the contact points can reach such high temperatures that part of the Mantle about subduction the molten rock magma builds up in the crevices of the Earth and forms magma Chambers eventually magma combined with gas will rise to the surface and form a volcano when an eruption occurs the magma discharges accumulated heat and energy thus helping to balance the structure of the Earth crust but the release can also cause the destruction of life on the Earth surface Theus and the flagan fields are the two most potent threats which inhabitants of the Bay of Naples have to live [Music] with but they other volcanoes cast their Shadows on the region only 500 km south of Naples in Sicily is Mount Etna one of the most active volcanoes in the world with over 80 eruptions in the last century alone this 3,340 m High monster nicknamed the Mello the mountain of mountains is a volcano which erupts more or less all the time in contrast to its Neapolitan cousins eugeno privera has been visiting the site to examine and analyze the volcano years we can find all these lapili which are debris from explosions they light this is because they air bubbles or originally gasas we can also find volcanic ash and as you can see it sand and here is a lovely volcanic bomb it Sun produced by Etna some bombs can be the size of small cars this rock was produced from within a magma column and when the gas bubbles reach the surface and expand they project into the air the part of the magma situated above the gas bubble the phenomenally strong giant volcano is constantly creating new craters ban NOA is the most recent of them it was spewed from the bowels of Etna in 1968 and is one of four craters on the summit which permanently emits burning vapor from the depths as you can see here the activities of the ferals are very visible the yellow of the sufur too Etna is the largest producer of sulfur of the world volcanoes it produces on average around 4,000 tons of SO2 per day which is around 10 times more than any other volcano but why is Etna a volcano impermanent eruption in contrast to its Neapolitan cousins nearby what geological properties make it so [Music] dangerous unlike the volcanoes of the Bay of Naples Etna is situated on the crossroads of several tectonic plates it Eurasian and African plates as in Naples but also with the micro plates of the terranean and ionian seas these geological confrontations produce huge quantities of magma which in turn generate this intense activity the magma is relatively fluid and the gas bubbles move freely they therefore rise to the surface quicker than the magmatic liquid this is a major difference with vvus and the flagan fields for the latter the magma is much more viscous and sticky it the bubbles to move as freely and they rise at the same speed as a magma once at the surface there are so many of them that they form a foam which is unstable and breaks up generating explosive eruptions whereas with Etna the small gas bubbles join together to make larger ones which rise in the vents quicker than the magmatic liquid when they reach the surface they burst creating Min explosions which project the magma into the air once separated from the gas the magma spreads and forms lava flows which we call effusive eruptions but today the volcanologists are very concerned because edma is showing symptoms of a fever that is hitherto unknown one of the most recent discoveries we made about etma is that the chemical composition of the magma has been changing over the last few decades there potassium compared to before when there was more sodium this chemical variation could explain the rise in explosive activity that we last few years and the fall in effusive activity this change in Behavior which has worried scientists has led them to perfect a new technological tool adapted to Mount [Music] Etna so how is it today hiu I signals but for the moment I can any important variations the variations in the earth gravitational fields are one of the parameters which help us to examine and study the activity of the volcano this is a gravimetric station and this is a gravimeter what we are measuring are the variations due to the distribution of the magmatic mass beneath the crust we position and depth of the source and also to define the mass at stake and work out how much magma is on the verge of erupting for example despite the huge 1200 squ km surface area Edna is the most monitored volcano in the world and the volcanologists are constantly on the lookout they series of Laboratories situated all over the mountain so that no activity goes unaccounted for but these measuring instruments are not enough to understand the behavior of this imperious Dragon which is over a million and a half years old scientific study is never ending and ugo other side which Bears the scars of the ancient history of Etna the B Valley on a scientific level it an open air museum on the geological level it huge depression 5 km wide and 10 km long the formation of the B Valley has enabled us to understand the inside of volcanoes that were active between 160,000 and 100,000 years ago before being transformed into this huge depression the B Valley was an enormous volcano when the volcano collapsed into itself magma deposits were produced in the shape of huge blades sticking up from the rocks called [Music] dkes imagine that we volcano around us there is only volcanic rock and at some point the pressure of the magma inside increases it starts to break up the rock making the split wider and even filling in the split so the magma rises up and up and causes an eruption on the surface that which now looks like it frozen the dkes are just extra Clues which help to reconstruct the internal behavior of the volcano during its eruption thanks to the constant activity of Etna the volcanologists can follow how the volcano Works day by day and spot even the tiniest variations which could be precursors of an imminent eruption alert s are frequent in this zone so close to Naples several kilometers north of the Sicilian giant can be found underwater monsters such as marcili the largest European volcanic area situated at a depth of 3,500 M nearby in the iolan island chain off the island of panoria another Colossus is Reawakening it scientists who are tracking this submerged volcano closely the first indications of this underwater activity were observed by chance in 2002 by the volcanologist Franchesco Italiano and the National Institute for Environmental Protection and research araldo can you see look you can really see the bubbles that are rising to the surface these are the most intense hydrothermal emissions that we pania it of hydrogen sulfide you can smell the sulfur in the air that we noticed when we came to study panoria what we didn time was that Under the Sea there was a whole world we couldn this activity is not good news for the researchers because they thought this under sea volcano had been extinct for more than 600,000 years and absolute eternity it was a huge surprise to discover that the fluids were rising to the surface in chimneys 3 to four met high it was such a surprise because it meant that the fluids were finding their way upwards through these ancient structures all fed by a volcano so we deduced that there was a major hydrothermal system that we needed to look closer at over the centuries these hydrothermal fluids have painstakingly forged more than 200 Chimes chief out of iron oxide which is what gives them this red orange color this mineral Forest is only 70 M below the surface which makes it an exceptional observation site for scientists elsewhere in the world this type of geological formation is only found in the deepest of chasms this extremely handy spot enabled Franchesco Italiano to make a most extraordinary discovery these are grains from iron oxide shells which form around each other creating what we call oids it has been photographed on Mars we know that on Earth the origin of life is linked to hydrothermic systems in which life forms use chemical elements to survive seeing that we have the same underwater hydrothermic system on Mars mean that there are forms of life on the Red Planet Too the under sea volcano of panoria has today become a giant laboratory and the scientists are only just beginning their investigations all over this section of the terranean sea volcanic activity bubbles away constantly just opposite the aisle of panoria another volcano feared by humans for centuries Rises out of the sea strum buly it volcanoes on the planet it spews out its incandescent lava day and night earning at the nickname the Lighthouse of the Mediterranean 926 M High it belongs to the category of Strat volcanoes it was built up by many layers of hardened lava but recently volcanologists have been above all preoccupied with the north flank of the island the Shara Del fuo the stream of fire it 1 km wide and 1 km long with a very unstable 45° slope in December 2002 what scientists feared would happen took place the stream of fire was the scene of a spectacular event on that particular day 20 million cubic M collapsed in one go and slid down into the sea generating a 6 M high wave over more than 40 km around the island and setting off a tsunami scientists now know what caused this geological catastrophe when the magma reached the surface it caused this part of the volcano to be deformed and to start swelling when the elasticity of the rock reached its breaking point it started to crack in numerous places causing landslides which when reaching the sea brought on a tidal wave ma rosi is a volcanologist he has developed with his team new technology enabling this extremely unstable flank to be monitored what reading all stable on this sh thanks to this high resolution radar the scientists can now Track image by image the slightest movements of the terrain 24 hours a day to produce images of the movements of the shiara the machine works like a photocopy if there have been any shifts of land these will be picked up by comparing two images and it could mean that there collapsing ma rosi is still haunted by the memory of the 2002 tsunami when he was carrying out research on IDU the other name for stromboli he was reminded about the terrible events that occurred in Naples in the 14th century as described by the Florentine author petrarch there was a huge Tremor in Naples a loud noise during the night which woke every everyone up in the morning down at the Port corpses and wounded people were scattered in the water he wrote broken like soft eggs floating on the water when the theory was put forward that edu could have been the cause of this deadly tsunami that stroli to look for evidence that a tidal wave had indeed taken place at that precise time it was in the village of stroi 4 M buried under the ground that he found the tangible traces of This Disaster that was written about nearly 700 years ago what we found was this brown colored substance which is a volcanic origin the most interesting part was this layer which also contains these big round Pebbles discovering the stratum is irrefutable proof that the origin of the disaster was indeed a tsunami Carbon 14 dating enabled us to date the layer just underneath to the middle of the 14th Cent this would make it totally compatible with a tsunami that petar observed in Naples by measuring the thickness of this layer and its distribution across the island maosi was able to prove that the tidal wave reached a height of over 20 m in 2019 some holiday makers were nearly drowned by a similar wave [Music] since then the whole island has been under a permanent Tsunami alert after years of Investigations maroe is now convinced that the deadly tidal wave which hit Naples in the 14th century could easily happen again if another tsunami was to be formed because of a landslide on the shiara Del foko the w that would be created would travel northwards and reach the port of Naples in about 20 minutes in only 20 minutes the port of Naples and surrounding areas would be completely destroyed by a giant wave triggered by an eruption on Stromboli this would be one more potential catastrophe for a region already living on Boro time between the flagen fields vvus Etna the volcano of panoria and stroli the 3 million inhabitants of the Bay of Naples have had to learn to live with this permanent threat they it especially as they all know about the cataclysmic eruption that destroyed the city of Pompei 2,000 years ago in the year 79 CE during the night of October 24th and 25th Pompei a city 30 km south of Na was consumed by the fires of Hell at the time Vesuvius was thought to have been extinct for 800 years but that night the volcano woke up today after many centuries of excavation the remains of Pompei are a unique treasure trow for scientists this exceptional archaeological site has enabled clodio scarpati to decipher on the spot the evolution of the eruption and its destructive impact on the human [Music] population the geological Clues found at the end of this Roman Road have helped clodio scarpati to make a detailed analysis of how the catastrophe played out what we can see here is the whole sequence of events that occurred in 79 CE there are two main layers a lower layer which is made up of pus with stones of different sizes then there clear separation and the upper stratum is composed of layers of Ash these are the two main phases of the eruption these observations have enabled scientists to partially reconstruct the first phase of the eruption a massive column from deep inside the volcano Rose at an average speed of 400 m/s it contain thousands of tons of Ash and pmus the magnitude of this rapid eruption was 50,000 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima according to the scientist calculations 10 billion cubic M of pmus and gases were ejected by the eruption the plume of smoke reached 32 km into the sky which is more than 30 times higher than vvus the eruptive column in high altitude took the shape of a pine tree as witnessed by the writer plen these types of eruption now carry his name plen in eruption during the first phase pmus Stones rained down on the inhabitants of pompe who had no time to flee instantly Frozen in Time these corpses bear witness today of their moving and desperate attempts to escape the deadly breath of the monster in the 19th century during archaeological excavations the scientist JPI feli perfected a brand new technique which enabled petrified bodies to be kept intact when digging down into the 5 MERS of Ashes which had covered Pompei fiorelli came across Strang looking cavities by examining them closely he realized that he remains of a victim fact over the centuries the body had decomposed leaving its negative imprint in the ashes which had compacted around it fi these empty spaces once the plaster had hardened the surrounding ashes were removed and the body could be seen in its exact position at the time of death you can see the expression on the face and the position of the body this is vitally important because it allows us to fix the person moments and to understand what actually caused their death after 19 hours of this devastating Ash rain the nature of the eruption changed and entered into its second phase which was even more deadly the pressure of the gas dropped and can no longer maintain the plume of smoke 32 km in the air the gigantic Mass collapsed into itself and an avalanche of fire called pyroclastic flows spread out of the [Music] volcano the speed of this delug of ash clouds is estimated at 240 kmph in the ruins of this Roman villa the archaeologists discovered victims from the second phase of the eruption this couple remained United to the end one of them seems to be desperately protecting the other as if their arms could act as a rampart against the volcanic Flames these victims found themselves inside a cloud which was probably dozens if not hundreds of meters thick a cloud of Ash pmus and Volcanic gases probably reaching temperatures of 100 de they were undoubtedly suffocated by the density of the ash which was found in the pyroclastic flows and they would have died within minutes Claudio scarpati approach is to examine the remains of the past in order to anticipate the future and he to ask the worrying question will Naples become a second pompe what Generations born after the last eruption in 1944 have never seen the volcano erupt have never seen the famous plume of smoke above vvus and so they see a volcano which is calm dormant and which need not be feared but on the contrary it active volcano which could erupt intensely at any time we don nor with how much force but we know for certain that it will happen in the Bay of Naples the highest priority Remains the surveillance of the flagan [Music] fields scientists often wait for Sunset to begin their task of tracking the slightest tremor from the monster which could alter the fate of millions of people tonight armed with their thermic camera enri Morata and her assistant have come to observe the seething volcano of Pisha r it influence the temperature of the magmatic chamber so that night at the moment we can see the maximum temperature is 85° if we move the camera and focus on the feral Zone we can see that there is a huge amount of energy and considerable gas emissions something which wasn happening 10 years ago it to go there now so that drones this drone can fly up to an altitude of 100 m and cover the whole pelli area it which is gaining ground on the city here for example we have a surface area of around a kilometer we can see straight away which are the zones with the greatest thermic anomalies over time we can work out if these abnormal zones are rising falling in temperature this then gives us an idea on the situation of the magmatic system enri carries out these monitoring procedures every month since the signs of volcanic activity are more and more concerning the proximity to inhabited zones could lead to disaster and as if the threat of eruption is not enough there are other dangers linked to volcanoes the town of patsi is right next to the Pirelli volcano in the 1980s a movement of panic overcame the inhabitants due to a very rare geological occurrence brism brism is a phenomenon linked to the change in the volume of gas in the magma chamber when the chamber is saturated the mix causes a gradual uplift of the chamber deforming The Rock this deformation creates cracks which can reach the surface and bring about small Earth Tremors the hot magma can then escape from the ferals inversely when the chamber is emptied of gas the pressure drops this then causes the rock to be deformed in the other direction and the ground collapses it breathing in and out of the volcano for ma DeVito The brism is not something new to pooli by observing the ruins of an old Roman market near the port he discovered in the temple of sarapes proof of this uplifting he was particularly intrigued by the presence of small holes 6 M high up on the columns what does this column tell us that certain organisms in this case by valves who live in the sea made holes in the columns this means that the sea was one at this level and putting a date to these mollusks thanks to archaeological dating we realized that the temple was submerged for a long time it started in the Roman era and carried on up until the 12th or 13th century of course when the temple was built it was on dry land but because of the fluctuating activity of the volcano the land sank and the Sea flooded the area centuries later gases slowly accumulated again and lifted the crust back to its original level in the flagan fields it sea level which changes but the ground level for Maro one thing is sure and that is since a major body seism crisis of the 1980s things are evolving in a dangerous fashion in the PSI region a very slow uplift began in 2006 stage by stage accompanied by seismic ity and then from 2018 the Rhythm has been more or less constant with an important increase which is still going on today the total deformation from 2006 to the present day is around 70 cm in the central zone of quw this is certainly one of the reasons that I worried but I can we cannot know or say if the next eruption will take place tomorrow in 6 months or in 20 years if an eruption did take place it could look like this according to the scientists an eruptive column of around 15 to 20 km high would be created ejecting huge blocks of magma and tons of Ashes which the wind would carry to Naples and [Music] Beyond 30 minutes to evacuate the region that the 3 million inhabitants a ridiculously short amount of time at the pooli Civil protection Center security teams are on maximum Alert in the event of an eruption of the flagan fields this zone is the most under threat in the region thank you everyone for your assessment of the situation ma rosi the stroli volcanologist is also responsible for the monitoring operations in the region every 2 months he comes together with experts in civil protection and volunteers to organize evacuations in a zone of 120,000 inhabitants obviously if the conditions were such that we had to pass to a level orange alert the evacuation plan for the whole of the fan Zone could happen in two ways either autonomously using their own vehicles or by assisted evacuation for those physically incapable of leaving by themselves everything is ready on paper but for the moment nothing has been tested on the ground in towns of often jumbled cluttered streets the problems here are not just logistical but also sentimental these inhabitants are extremely attached to their land even if it represents a danger to their existence I prefer to die here where I was born and where all my ancestors were born because I it you here what the scientists say is both true and worrying but we and what will be will be humans have lived here forever alongside the volcanoes which are an integral part of their culture people know that the Wrath of the volcanoes could bring about their destruction but they don them from living their lives Neapolitan culture is based on this ambivalence which is rooted in Tradition and in religion the people are at one with this land which is blessed by the gods and nothing or no one will ever separate them today scientists know that the countdown has begun and they everything everything they can to avoid a human disaster the battle is being waged on several fronts and it make an unexpected Discovery concerning the activity of its under sea volcano in the worrying panoria Zone we fault line this time the volcanologists have given way to the biologists Simon Simon can you see where we are we should be there shouldn we yes this is the zone of the Chim that we saw in 2015 to better understand this Zone with 200 chimneys scientists are using a ro with its High defition camera and articulated arms a robot just like those sent to explore planet Mars remotely controlled from the surface it can get right up close to the hydrothermal chimneys which have never been much explored these are the chimneys that we discovered five years ago what is striking is all the living creatures surrounding them because around the chimneys there are fairly extreme conditions for example a very acidic pH level and CO2 emissions which are higher than in other zones the whole of the zone is full of life and so it seems the organisms have adapted to their environment [Music] it such extreme conditions with very high levels of gas life ought not to be viable the biologists explain this by the presence of bacteria which feed on the minerals produced by the gas and by transforming them into energy the bacteria sustain the whole area this is a clear sign that life can exist in a volcanic environment where an explosion can bring destruction but also create [Music] life the progress of science is vital to enable researchers to pierce the mysteries of one of Nature paradoxes for millions of years in the region of the Bay of Naples living in the shadow of volcanoes means living in one of the Earth zones where the end of One World could bring about the beginning of a new one

Do Animals Get Drunk? The Surprising Science of Alcohol in Nature | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW86G9HTZcg	SLICE Science	[Music] it all comes down to a seemingly insignificant microorganism s myis a yeast that was discovered by Pastor in the 19th century and that holds the key to understanding how alcohol is made sacy is responsible for the chemical reaction of fermentation that leads to ethanol the most famous member of the alcohol family the alcohol made and sold for consumption when yeast cells come into contact with glucose they use it as their main source of fuel ethanol and carbon dioxide are byproducts of this cellular digestion process this procedure is employed in the production of all alcohol that is made for human consumption billions of liters of alcohol are produced per day a wide variety of animals feed on ripe fruit nectar honey and sap glucose can be found everywhere and is a food source for many animals yeast can be found in almost every habitat present in nature it can be found on fruit and leaves and on animal fur and shells animals transport yeast when they move around yeast was one of the first living inhabitants on our planet it can be found everywhere in all climates in all attitudes in all types of habitats the consequence of this is that ethanol is present in virtually every natural habitat any animal that eats fruit or that consumes nectar is potentially being exposed to alcohol on a regular basis via dietary ingestion so that would include lots of mammals lots of birds there are even some reptiles that eat fruit and of course hundreds of thousands of insect species this finding is far from trivial man is a member of the animal kingdom observing animals can provide Vital Information and help us to understand the human relationship with alcohol what is the attraction of alcoholic beverages is it the taste of the ethanol molecule that makes alcohol irresistible the reaction that mice and rats have to alcohol has been studied in more depth than the reaction of any other mammal Dr Pierre vinchenzo pza studies small rodents in his laboratory in [Music] Bordeaux if we give a mouse a bottle of sugared water then it is immediately drawn to it if we give a mouse that has never drank alcohol a bottle that contains sugared water with 15% alcohol content then it refuses to drink it until it [Music] thirsty if we give a bottle of each liquid to a mouse then it will not be interested in the alcohol solution whilst the sugared water remains accessible the facts are clear in the first instance rodents do not like the taste of alcohol even when it sugar there has not been much research done on the reaction that different animals have to alcohol in nature dropil flies are the exception and for good reason they like alcoholic environments and are attracted to very ripe or rotting fruit which can contain up to 2 or 3° of alcohol it where larvae develop unlike mice we can assume that this insect likes the taste of alcohol since it consumes significant quantities of it all year long hi Norman hello how what relationship between fruit flies and alcohol for over 20 years in her life laboratory in San Francisco my eye it seems that it actually shift the curve to the left so it what we can do in the laboratory is we can give flies a choice to drink food which contains sugar or food that contains alcohol during the tests 20 to 50 fruit flies are placed in tubes they have had no prior contact with alcohol the Flies are so small that it glass straws that are less than a millimeter in diameter as bottles The Green Solution is sugared water the blue solution is sugared water with 15% alcohol content will the fruit flies be attracted to the Blue alcohol solution given the natural transparency of their abdomen there breathalizer to detect the presence of alcohol in the Flies the test result is 100% green as with the mice at first Contact these small flies have an aversion to alcohol what about human beings the Eternal drinkers are they the exception to the rule in the animal kingdom if you give wine even a mut Ros Shield to a 14-year-old child who has never drunk alcohol or to a 10-year-old child they will tell you that it gusting people are not attracted to the taste of alcohol it is always combined with other elements that give it an aroma and a taste so that it pleasure to consume people do not drink 40% pure alcohol an industry has developed wine whiskey armac cognac the taste of alcohol is transformed initially most people have to force themselves to drink alcohol intake even in humans is a learned behavior we start drinking socially even if we don at first if alcohol doesn almost everyone consumes it then this tiny molecule must have a secret power its power is evident in nature hundreds of thousands of different animal species play a role in the reproduction process they involuntarily transport nectar and seeds alcohol plays a part in this process it is present in Sugar juices and evaporates in the wind this gives off a scent that attracts animals to a food source whilst animals don taste of alcohol at the outset they drawn to its odor people have mimicked in the laboratory plumes of ethanol emanating from a source of ethanol and it clear that flies fly and steer to maintain their flight within that plume which is really just a high concentration of ethanol order and they follow that to the source and that they find the fruit German scientific researcher Frank Vin has made Amazing Discoveries concerning the role of alcohol in the relationship between plants and animals his studies take place in the Malaysian forests in Southeast Asia it started 20 years ago when the scientists stumbled almost accidentally upon some rather unusual wild palm trees the buram Palm a tree that doesn necessarily need to be visible for its presence to be felt first of all there smell that is actually uh sensible from quite far apart and that resembles the smell of a brewery the he scent of fermentation comes from the flowering tops that Blossom and in all seasons each flowering top has approximately 1,000 Brown shell-shaped flowers they are prickly and tough it didn long to find the source of the odor the flower bot is shaped is built is designed like a brewing chamber a rich and sweet nectar accumulates inside ins the buds as soon as the slightest crack appears between two petals yeast that is found on the exterior of the bud kicks into action an intense fermentation period starts inside each flower it lasts for around 3 months carbon dioxide is produced and this creates compression and Nature equivalent of champagne animals are attracted to the odor of the fermented Palm nectar the animal consumers do not have a choice if they consume the sugary nectar for fuel then they will also swallow large doses of alcohol the alcohol content can be up to 3.8% which is within the range of a of a normal beer for nectar uh this is the highest alcohol content ever found [Music] the flowers on the buram palms are extremely popular there swarm of insects around the trees even geckos come to the tree to consume its Delicacies [Music] the researcher makes his most fascinating discoveries during the night as well as being surrounded by insects the blossoming tops are the scene of a ballet composed of seven species of nocturnal mammals it the researcher uses discreet infrared lighting for his nighttime observations the first animal to visit the tree is the common tree shrew a mammal that is active during Dusk and Dawn it visitors to appear as the hours pass at least four species of rats and mice come to the tree the slow loris is a primate that weighs around 500 G and is closely related to the Lemurs of Madagascar it is the largest of the animals that regularly frequent the tree to consume the nectar the most fascinating night visitor is the pentail tree shrew it is a small tree shrew that weighs less than 50 g the researcher filmed this species for the first time in its natural habitat the pentail tree shrew is a loyal customer he spends more than 2 hours per night drinking champagne in his local bar to verify the quantity of alcohol that is being consumed fun Vin regularly conducts chemical analysis on hair taken from the animals that drink and the tree today he is analyzing hair taken from a common tree shrew the concentration of the biomarker in the hair indicated excessive drinking similar concentrations have only found in very few excessive drinkers in humans Burton Palm regulars don any choice if they want to consume nectar then they have to drink alcohol Frank V decided to investigate the link between the production of alcohol and the presence of seven different species of mammals as he predicted animals play a key role in the palm tree reproduction process the Burton Palms produce alcoholic nectar non-stop throughout the year and various mammals populate the trees and the surrounding area nectar is produced on a daily basis for 3 months before the flowering tops externalize their stamin and then produce the fruits mammals in the area carry pollen in their hair from flower to flower and from tree to tree [Music] this process is one of Mother Nature Secrets the incomparable scent of alcohol discreetly connects the animal world and the Plant [Music] [Music] World so that modern man does not have an inbuilt desire for the taste of alcohol and there is no scientific evidence that people are attracted to the smell of alcohol how can we explain the global success of this molecule what makes it so popular the popularity of ethanol is linked to its psychotropic capacity when consumed it induces changes in perception sensation mood and Consciousness oh wow very refreshing the ethanol molecule passes quickly through the stomach wall and as soon as the blood flows leads it to the brain it affects certain receptors and modifies and boosts or decreases nerve messages even when consumed in moderate doses the state of intoxication caused by alcohol can be felt within minutes of consumption [Music] what exactly does being drunk mean most people have their own definition of the difference between being a little tipsy and completely [Music] drunk scientists however find the term drunk far too vague a concept clinically speaking the consumption of alcohol causes four different phases of intoxication the first phase is disinhibition and is pleasant and enjoyable first of all people experience early disinhibiting effects then antic effects this causes a type of social disinhibition people tend to become more talkative and to interact more [Music] easily phases 2 and three are aren quite as pleasant then as consumption increases motor behavior is disrupted as well as the ability to perform certain tasks there is a progressive state of sedation until a person will find himself or herself in an alcoholic coma the fourth and Final Phase is better known as The [Music] Hangover what about animals do they get tipsy do they get drunk in order to find out more we head back to see our rodent friends at the laboratory this time the mouse does not have a choice each bottle features an alcoholic beverage the mouse starts to drink when its thirst is greater than its instinctive aversion to alcohol the mouse perks up immediately it explores every corner of the glass cage with vivacity and determination as the dosage is increased it becomes difficult for the mouse to coordinate its movements when it is increased even further the mouse slips into a deep sleep it speaks less but a drunken Mouse is remarkably similar to a drunken human [Music] what about the minuscule fruit fly is it possible for a fly to get drunk It fly for the first time I thought oh my gosh this is what I study the fruit flies are not given a choice during the experiment this time the alcohol is not given to them through a straw it is pumped into the tubes in Steam form their movements are filmed and analyzed by a computer program the phases of inebriation in the fruit fly are remarkably similar to what you or I or any animal would uh display in terms of behavior the first reaction is that they will start becoming gradually more and more hyperactive which is believed to be a reflection of the disinhibition that humans and other animals display when given relatively modest concentrations of alcohol then after a while they become uncoordinated and they bump into each other they bump into the walls they try to fly they [Music] can more alcohol they become slow down they fall over they try to get up essentially their motor coordination becomes very poor and eventually they just fall asleep there is no doubt that all phases of human intoxication are once again represented I would say that all animals that have been studied for alcohol behaviors so show some of these same phases this sort of hyperactivity or disinhibition that is Then followed by loss of coordination and sedation it it Universal the psychotropic effect of alcohol is universal it is tempting to imagine that even animals appreciate being tipsy from time to time after all the initial effects of alcohol are far from unpleasant there reliable observation of true drunkenness in the animal kingdom there are anecdotal accounts of drunken parakeet drunken monkeys but they however a study on wax wings a migratory bird which took place in North America in the 80s found that they affected by alcohol there is actually a really nice study showing death by alcohol in some birds called Cedar Wax Wings where people actually measured the blood alcohol concentration of recently deceased birds and showed very high concentration so these were fermenting fruits that the birds were eating and they overdosed on alcohol they couldn fly and they died it alcohol in the blood or in the in physiological levels of alcohol that correlates with with death by alcohol Research indicates that drunken behavior is uncommon in animals it to have an alcohol content of 4 to 5% the vast majority of these natural food sources contain less than 1% alcohol as a result the probability of consuming the dose required to get drunk is very low even though some animals ingest up to 10% of their body weight of ripe fruit each day they don big bout the way we drink for example large bottle of whiskey very quickly it [Music] day in order for someone to become intoxicated a certain amount of alcohol must be consumed during a short period of time a technique that many people have hone to Perfection what about the animals that frequent The buram Palms in the Malaysian for Forest the alcohol content of the nectar can reach up to 4% but the average flour contains less than 1% if a human consumed a large quantity of an alcoholic beverage that has this level of alcohol content then it would cause psychoactive effects do the sparkling nectar of fonos end up drunk after their nightly visits to the tree or do they become resistant to alcohol none of the visitors of flowers actually show signs of ination or drunkenness so they seem to be all fine that visitors and also for the vegetates [Music] the pentail tree shrew weighs only 50 g and is a living enigma it spends over 2 hours every night longer than any other animal consuming the alcoholic nectar that constitutes the main part of its diet if we compare this to a human it is the equivalent of consuming nine glasses of wine that has an alcohol content of 12% during a period of less than 10 hours each night does the pentail tree shrew take its alcohol better than you or I our data show that the Pentel trishu would be be drunken every third night several years of observations have shown nothing not one tree shrew has been caught in a state of inebriation the finding that they have high intake but show no signs of drunkenness um is linked to a more to a higher metabolic tolerance and that means to a more efficient alcohol detoxification given its Zoological position the pentail tree shrew could have passed on its alcohol resistance to humans the Pentel Tru is considered the least derived living mammal that represents our ancestors 55 million years ago our ancestors were a variety of tree shrew that resemble the present day pentail tree shrew throughout Evolution they have consumed a highly alcoholic diet ethanol is a primary food source for the pentail Tre shrew and they digest it easily we are descendants of tens of millions of years of evolution preh humans came after our ancestors the Apes they were no longer dependent on the highly alcoholic buram Palm nectar but they regularly consume ripe fruit and therefore alcohol in small [Music] doses modern man has also lost the ability to digest large Quant quantities of alcohol the alcohol molecule has marked tens of millions of years of Zoological Evolution our instinctive behaviors can be traced back through time why are we so intrinsically attracted to alcohol so one possibility is that we have built into our brains this historical association between consumption of alcohol and nutritional reward it could be said that the most enjoyable moment to consume alcohol is as an appetizer humans have a rather unique relationship with alcohol man does not consume alcohol for nourishment he consumes it in order to reach a state of inebriation [Music] the revolution regarding the use of alcohol came about during a period of thousands of years at the end of prehistory a variety of alcoholic beverages are now available in concentrations and quantities that our ancestors 55 million years ago could have never imagined this progression signaled the start of a new era on planet Earth according to Patrick McGovern and our archaeologist who specializes in the origins of alcoholic beverages humans began practicing alcoholic fermentation long before the start of civilization in the Neolithic age I think that because humans and all animals are interested in alcohol that they would have been fermenting right from the beginning and they would have been fermenting anything they could get in their environment hunter gatherers produced a variety of wines they did this by fermenting ripe fruit or honey we know that some of the plants such as barley uh rice and so forth were domesticated going back to 10,000 BC right after the last ice age and the purpose was likely to make uh beer it was not until 6,000 years before Christ in parallel with the development of Agriculture and the beginnings of civilization that the systematic extraction of alcohol in large quantities became common Engravings from Mesopotamia Egypt Greece Italy and China provide evidence that this was the case aor and other Pottery enabled the long-term preservation of liquids and this meant that alcoholic beverages were available for consumption at any time of the year these receptacles were also used to transport the beverages when necessary this was the start of accessible alcohol consumption however unlike our tree shrew ancestors we can only digest alcohol in moderate doses today more than 2 billion people worldwide regularly consume alcohol is it considered a food source alcohol in lower moderate doses can be good for us alcohol drunk in moderation is good for you it um your cardiovascular system it may even be good for your brain The Beneficial effects of alcohol have been observed in many animal species including fruit flies if you give them a little more alcohol their lifespan increases their fecundity of the females also increases compared to no alcohol or very high levels of [Music] alcohol unlike in nature a variety of high content alcohol is readily available and easily accessible to us the fact that alcohol is so accessible has meant that we are subject to the negative side effects caused by the ethanol molecule excessive consumption and the serious issue of [Music] addiction unlike animals certain people have a tendency to drink excessive amounts of alcohol and to go largely beyond the stage of feeling good for the most part animals do not adopt this type of behavior their natural instinct is to stop consuming alcohol just before they become drunk and they do not often reach the same state of as [Music] humans when considering animal alcohol consumption we should disregard accidental ingestion that occurs with domestic animals when the taste of alcohol is masked by the taste of the [Music] beverage well known vet Eve Lani and his parrot coko celebrate Shabbat every Friday night with a small glass of Port after just a few sips the parrot starts [Music] whistling be careful if you Vetinarian the slightest overdose can be fatal for humans as well as animals excessive consumption is dangerous every day the loss of vigilance reaction time and motor coordination is responsible for thousands of accidents worldwide alcohol and drunk driv is responsible for a quarter of all recorded Road accidents that result in fatalities alcohol is also responsible for certain psychological problems Advanced drunkenness is often accompanied by a marked increase in aggressive behavior and is the source of many incidents or accidents at home and in Social or professional environments it is easy to imagine why animals don state of inebriation Birds would not be able to fly and monkeys would fall from their branches in a natural ecosystem it doesn drunken around in their home ranges so that would be heavily selected against because it would just increase the risk for falling prey to another species a population of drunken animals would soon become extinct [Music] but for humans the harmful effects of alcohol do not prevent excessive casual consumption the ethanol molecule has a dangerous consequence addiction addictions are a very big problem today and alcoholism is the most dangerous and damaging of all the addictions [Music] as with nicotine cocaine or heroin alcohol has the capacity to engulf its consumers and to deprive them of their freedom of choice alcoholism is a worldwide problem and they can destroy their lives and their families and [Music] everything alcoholism affects 140 million people around the world the consequences are horrendous alcoholism is the source of more than 60 diseases curosis of the liver cancer and injury by alcohol rated accident or violence 4% of all deaths worldwide can be attributed to alcohol this is more than AIDS or tuberculosis the consequences of alcohol rated problems relates annually to hundreds of billions of [Music] dollarss people who are addicted to alcohol no longer benefit from the small Pleasures that moderate ingestion can provide the transition to addiction occurs when a person is controlled by alcohol he or she does not use alcohol to function but stops functioning in order to drink [Music] alcohol this phenomen on that we consider unique to man could also affect animals since they too have unlimited access to alcohol fruit flies are used to test this Theory these flies are given unlimited quantities of one type of liquid a sugared water solution that has a 15% alcohol content after 5 days the small insects are already in an advanced state of alcohol dependence [Music] the alcoholic flies will do almost anything to access their daily ration of ethanol including encountering painful electric [Music] shocks during this experiment the Green Tube contains sugared water and the red tube contains sugared water that has a 15% alcohol content the researchers have added a small amount of quinine to the red tube under normal circumstan es the fruit fly have an aversion to [Music] quinine within a few minutes all of the addict flies have turned [Music] red in another series of observations researchers INRI hein that alcoholic flies drink increasingly more alcohol over the course of a few days they drink twice their body volume of 15% ethanol which would be the equivalent of WS and wine in a day twice their volume this is the equivalent of a 176 lb man drinking 160 L of wine per day we have monitored the levels of internal alcohol of flies that are self- administering and we were shocked they were like severely intoxicating concentrations of alcohol if alcoholism affects creatures as different as man and insect then this means that the ethanol molecule affects an area of the nervous system that they both have in common the area that controls certain instinctive Behavior this observation allows us to understand a crucial component of human alcoholism the difficulty in halting the addiction process the idea that addicts do not want to stop drinking is completely false they want to but they can doesn drinking it is not about willpower we cannot stop something that is automatic yet more than often alcoholics are initially judged as weak and has having no willpower people such as myself not just think but know that addiction is a behavioral disease similar to depression or schizophrenia Society often defines addiction as a vice what is a vice what does that mean that it is your own fault that you can stop and if you don don but also weak so why should other people have to look after you for a long time people thought that alcoholism was a personality disorder or linked to sociocultural background in truth this is only half of the problem the other half concerns genetic predisposition in humans there are a variety of genes that contribute to alcoholism the contributions of the genes is about 50% of the risk the other 50% is the environment and everything else we cannot measure considerable research has been done on animals and the results demonstrate that genetic predisposition can lead to alcoholism a well-known study was carried out on the vervet monkeys that live on the island of St kits in the Caribbean groups of vervet monkeys became regulars at tourist beaches where it was very easy to steal liquor with 15 or 20% alcohol content and they were getting drunk in the space of a few minutes a study of more than 600 monkeys in the 9s clearly demonstrated that they have varying reactions when given easy access to an unlimited quantity of alcohol 15% of monkeys are naturally abstinent they prefer sugary drinks and they avoid alcohol 65% are occasional drinkers they only like alcohol at low concentrations and in moderate [Music] quantities 15% are daily heavy drinkers they become four times as aggressive and are less friend friendly than before the behavior of the remaining 5% of the monkeys is somewhat intriguing they consume a large amount of alcohol during short periods of time several times a day they fall into a state of alcoholic sedation or they become aggressive and antisocial the monkeys that consume alcohol in this way do not survive more than 3 months the percentages have no link to the different lifestyles of each individual monkey the only plausible explanation is genetic predisposition it that the percentages observed when studying monkeys and alcohol are very similar to those that occur when studying alcohol habits in humans they spring having a drink with friends or a good meal does not mean that you are an alcoholic it means that you are someone who voluntarily consumes Al 10% of the population is addicted to alcohol they are [Music] alcoholics it is thanks to studies on animals and the relationship with alcohol that the neurological functioning of alcoholism has been decrypted it this research could someday lead to treatments that could reduce or cure the problem of alcoholism and yet what you um providing a drug that restores the balance to the brain because the addicted brain is essentially changed in many many ways our brain has become rigid it has lost the plasticity that enables it to switch from one Behavior to [Music] another who could have imagine that a study conducted on fruit flies that from a Zoological point of view are very different to humans could potentially lead to a treatment for alcoholism Ora hein in San Francisco discovered that male fruit flies that have been sexually rejected by a female tend to drink more alcohol than those that are sexually satisfied the researchers found that sexual frustration in a fly causes a reduction in the rate of the nerve transmitter neuropeptide f it controls food regulation sexual function and has a calming and cative effect the researchers found evidence that demonstrated the part played by this neuropeptide in the males that were attracted to alcohol when they were not sexually satisfied an equivalent regulatory nerve transmitter neuropeptide Y is present in human brains the the goal is to develop a drug that can control the amount of this neuropeptide and prevent alcohol addiction we for some reason I don know alcoholism is a very neglected disease when it comes to development of Therapeutics I feel that if we are successful in providing potential targets for therapy this could have a huge huge impact both in medicine and Society modern man is the only member of the animal kingdom who is intellectually conscious of himself and therefore of his own death alcohol and drugs are used to artificially soothe angst and in the search for Liberation from Fear anxiety and pain however the consequences are often dangerous the alcohol molecule is certainly valuable in the natural Kingdom man-made technological inventions have meant that the alcohol industry has developed extensively over the past two Millennia however genetic Evolution and Humanity have not yet caught up [Music]	Success
Next Stop: Mars Â Exploring the Red Planet's Mysteries | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyyde7xsMPw	SLICE Science	[Music] every 26 months the Earth approaches a close point with Mars This Is The Logical time to launch probes to the red planet for a brief period in mid 2020 a launch window opened the Europeans in collaboration with Russia had planned an exomars rover mission but problems with the Descent stage and its parachute meant the mission would be delayed for a further 2 years the first mission to launch toward Mars was from a new entrance into the space business the UAE in collaboration with the University of Colorado at Boulder built an Orbiter which was launched on a Japanese h2a rocket from the tanegashima launch Center China was also Keen to launch its first independent Mission to Mars the country exploration was in 2011 as part of a Russian mission that failed to leave Earth orbit thean one Mission carries an Orbiter a Lander and a Rover the most ambitious Mars mission to launch in 2020 was NASA Rover [Music] [Music] NASA been designing and building spacecraft since the earliest days of space exploration in 1997 jpl Mission used an airbag system to deliver the Carl San Lander to the plane of Aris valis in Mar the Lander was essentially a weather station with a stereoscopic camera but it carried a technology demonstrator sjena which became the first vehicle to Traverse the surface of Mars it found evidence that in past eons water had once been plentiful on the surface of the red planet it appeared that Mars had once been a very different place in 2004 jpl Rovers spirit and opportunity landed in opposite hemispheres these were much heavier vehicles yet the bounce Landing technique still worked well both had been targeted at craters that appeared to have been lakes in the distant past the two solar powered Rovers had been designed to operate for a period of 90 days 10 years after they landed although the Rovers had sustained damage they were both still functioning again they discovered water had been abundant and had left distinct patterns of streams and rivers clearly Mars had been much warmer with large areas of standing water it must have had a thicker atmosphere astrobiologists began to wonder if the planet could once have been a home to Life Next JPL began preparation for a more ambitious Mars mission using a much larger Rover for launch in 2012 the Mars science laboratory ultimately called curiosity was almost 1,000 times heavier than sjena and it did not have to rely on solar panels it carried a radio isotope power source 5 4 3 2 one fire a new Landing system was developed as curiosity great for the previously used airbag [Applause] technology curiosity continued the accumulation of knowledge about the role of water in Mar past with each stage of Mars exploration Searchers began focusing on the idea that it might be possible to find traces of past microbial life perseverance is jpl its basic design and its Landing system are very similar to curiosity but there have been some important refinements to its scientific payload and to its objectives its instruments will match chemical promising rocks with an analysis of the patterns within the sample structure that may hold Clues to past microbial development like its predecessor curiosity the new Rover has a robotic arm fitted with drilling tools and Sample analysis instruments in terms of robots that go into space the sampling and caching system on the Mars 2020 mission is the most complic at most sophisticated thing that we know how to build this is a system that allows us to take core samples of Rocky material on the surface of Mars carefully seal them in very sterile clean vessels for eventual return to Earth in 2027 a Joint Nasa e submission will land near perseverance a European Rover called Fetch will collect all the sample tubes this is a much lighter Rover than perseverance and is powered by solar panels it can travel at 10 times the speed of the larger Rover and it must be able to navigate accurately to the areas where the sample tubes have been [Music] [Applause] left fetch will deliver the samples to a NASA built Lander this includes a small solid fueled rocket that will take the samples to orbit the sample tubes now contained in a capsule transfer to a waiting European Orbiter this craft has the ability to wait in Mars orbit indefinitely should there be some unforeseen delay on the ground the return craft built by Airbus features iron propulsion that has huge weight and cost benefits to the mission as it nears the Earth the spacecraft releases a re-entry capsule that will land in the United States sometime in the early 2030s as the samples are robust the capsule does without a parachute system [Music] with a limited amount of space available for specimens it is crucial that the samples selected are finally targeted toward the detection of Bio signatures the mission focus inside the Rover a second robotic arm receives the [Music] sample its volume is measured the sampling tube is sealed and then it is stored with each stage being photographed perseverance will not select samples autonomously images relayed to Earth will help scientists decide which specimens to collect so that the astrobiologists understand what to look for a NASA Isa field trip to the remote regions of Western Australia was organized it convincing fossilized remains of microbial life can be seen this is one of the most important places on the planet geologically speaking the Rocks you see right in front of me here these wrinkly layered structures that we call stromatolites structures like this actually represent fossilized microbial mats basically fossilized pwn scum in a sense micro bacteria living in a shallow water environment and we believe that if life ever existed on Mars it would have been purely microbial when we say with Mars 2020 we ancient Life on Mars This is precisely the kinds of signs of life that we seeking but Mission planners had to decide where the most likely area of Mars to search for these bio signatures would [Music] be selecting the perseverance Landing site was an exhaustive process that relied upon the detailed survey work carried out by the Mars reconnaissance Orbiter the mro which began mapping Mars in 2006 since then it has returned the most detailed images of Martian topography this has been one of our major uh discoveries is the variety of environments of water environments that occurred very early in Mars history we think that gives Mars a much better chance for instance to be not only a habitable place but a place that might actually where life might have gotten a start because there were many choices of environments that could help support it several Landing sites were promising but in 2018 jezero crater just 17° above the Martian Equator was chosen it contains a 20 km open flat area ideal as a landing Zone it appears to have once been a lake with a Delta region where an inflowing River dumped its sediment the Crater Rim is rich in clay-like minerals on Earth Clays tend to concentrate and preserve organic materials but landing within jezero crater presented new challenges in an hour across easy ground perseverance will cover around 152 M so inaccuracy in landing could cost the Rover as much as 12 months in driving time while perseverance looks similar to its predecessor curiosity it is heavier which meant designers had to completely rethink The spacecraft technology since the Viking Landings in 1976 all marscraft had used variations of a supersonic parachute designed in 1972 the Martian atmosphere is far thinner than Earth traveling at supersonic speeds after the scorching entry previous parachutes had been tested in the supersonic wind tunnel at NASA with the extra weight of perseverance the wind tunnel was just not big enough this is a really good view not since the big budgets of the 60s and70s had Massa tested in the earth parachute more than 21 m in diameter there was no other way a two-stage black Brandt 9 sounding rocket lifted the payload and parachute to a height of 50 km where they separated and began falling back to the [Music] ground in the Martian at atmosphere the parachute will release 11 km above the surface the density of the Earth atmosphere is of a similar thickness at 37 km which is the height at which the test parachute was [Music] deployed a parachute is the most economical way of slowing the craft down the developers continued with the ring Gap Band design known for its stability monitoring the behavior of the three variants being tested there were mixed results Ultra high-speed photography was used as designs were exposed to forces exceeding the worst expected at Mars by 40% perseverance has three cameras looking up to record parachutes deployment unlike previous Mars missions that saw the parachute deployer a predetermined speed perseverance is equipped with a range trigger that will release the parachute according to its position relative to its Landing Target this will increase Landing accuracy by 50% when the landing craft breaks free of its parachute another Landing Aid called the terrain relative navigation system will already have compared camera vision to its internal map to fine-tune the targeting to fine-tune the terrain relative navigation system members of the entry descent and Landing team went to Death Valley in California preserve the area was selected because of certain similarities it has with the jezero crater region an Airbus h125 helicopter was fitted with the Lander the first task was to plot the Death Valley region so the system had an internal map to work with a trailer served as the Monitoring Center the team here could see how well the system matched its internal map with what its cameras saw the first images made by the navigation system are from a 4 km altitude as soon as the heat shield is jettisoned after it has made 15 Landmark matches it changes to a higher resolution to refine its path toward the desired Landing location Alan Chen is lead engineer for Mars 2020s Cruise phase and for the Craft and he held similar rool for the previous curiosity Mission part of the guided entry what that allows us to do finally is land in a safe spot next to some of the uh dangerous stuff that people want to go look for science in and actually be able to drive there our driving capability of the Rover because it have a fairly long lifetime is on par with the the uh The Landing error uncertainty how far we the target um or miss the desired science Target so we can at this point go to places on Mars and say we want to go there we drive there jezero crater was rejected as a target for the Curiosity Mission because the landing constraints were too tight terrain relative navigation raises the probability of an accurate Landing from 85% on the previous mission to 99% with [Applause] perseverance Mars is not like Earth while images of the surface of Mars can bear striking resemblance to arid deserts here the temperatures perseverance will meet during the course of a Martian summer day range from highs of 20° C to lows ofus 78° C while analoges on Earth can be helpful to researchers looking for signs of life there are some aspects of the mission for which Engineers had to draw upon previous Mars experience while the perseverance Rover is built to the same template as curiosity there were improvements the development team knew they could make periodically the Curiosity Rover uses the Marley camera on its robotic arm to record a self-portrait the camera is designed to capture close images of rocks and has a reasonably narrow angle of view but by taking a precisely align Ed series of 84 separate images staff on the ground can build up a complete picture of the Rover the very similar Watson camera on perseverance has already started performing the same task from such pictures the Curiosity team realized that in its first year of operation its Wheels were sustaining damage the extremely low temperatures on Mars rules out rubber as a form of traction designers opted for a machined aluminium wheel with raised ridges called grousers for perseverance the wheels have been made with a slightly greater diameter yet they are slightly narrower and with a different pattern in the grousers while the Rover can only travel 152 m in an hour its Advanced navigation system will have it covering twice the ground that Curiosity could Traverse meaning that the new wheel design will have to take greater punishment perseverance can handle surfaces that slope 45° in any direction though drivers will not negotiate anything in excess of 30° all Rovers made at JPL have been built with a rocker and bogey suspension system that allows the wheels to rise over obstacles while keeping the weight even evenly distributed each wheel has its own Drive motor and the front and back wheels are steerable enabling perseverance to turn 360° on the spot for Science and to monitor the health and behavior of the Rover perseverance has a total of 23 cameras the most prominent of these are in the Rover Mast the single large diameter super a science instrument that combines a camera with a laser can vaporize a tiny area of a rock from as far away as 7 m and analyze its composition using spectroscopy beneath the super cam are four cameras that work in stereo pairs the two outer units are of fixed focal length and function as navigation cameras they perseverance drives autonomously two more cameras with square lens hoods are known as the Mast cam Zed that Zed meaning they have zoom lenses these are the primary eyes of perseverance they can capture high resolution images in 3D and they can record video at 4 frames a second they will also be used for looking up at the atmosphere and in the positioning of the robotic arm to protect its cameras from Airborne dust during the nights the Mast folds down into its Transit position the Watson camera mentioned earlier has a primary function of capturing close detail of rock types but its position on the robotic arm gives it great versatility it is the only way Engineers have of seeing the underparts of the Rover and at full stretch it has a higher viewpoint than the Mast cameras in self-portraits the arm cannot see itself and appears to be missing from the final image other cameras closer to the ground are used for hazard detection with four at the front and two at the rear the arrow shell that protects the Rover during the cruise phase and through entry and descent has three cameras looking up to observe the unfurling of the parachute another camera on the Rocket Power descent stage records the separation and lowering of the Rover to the surface with a further camera beneath the Rover looking down at the surface perseverance is cameras along with all the information collected by the science instruments and the Engineering Systems generate a lot of data for data storage the Rover computers have 2 GB of flash memory hardened to tolerate extremes of radiation though this may seem small the limiting factor is the speed at which perseverance can send the data to Earth the fastest link is with the ultra high frequency antenna via the Mars reconnaissance Orbiter though it was launched in 2005 The mro Remains the most advanced telecommunications platform in deep space but its backup amplifier has failed the Orbiter has 20 GB of flash memory and with its 3M dish it can relay data to Earth At 6 megabits per second much faster than its UHF link with perseverance that transmits at a maximum 2 megabits per second the Rover also has high gain and low gain x-band antennas that can communicate directly with Earth but at much lower data rates Mars Odyssey in orbit since 2001 can also act as a relay satellite but it of Mars generate data faster than the relay satellites can return it to Earth Europe signals from the surface to Earth but it too is getting old NASA has made studies into a new generation of Mars communication satellites but this remains a weak Link in the agency for a man expedition to the red planet across the Rover six sets of sensors monitor air temperature and pressure humidity solar and Cosmic radiation as well as dust collectively known as MAA its job is to record variation in the environmental factors that affect life not just ancient microbial life but human life now NASA makes no secret of its ambition to send astronauts to Mars perhaps in the 2030s and part of perseverance is brief is to explore habitability the agency has committed to a series of moon landings in this decade and has been working on an expedition space suit that will also be used at Mars but there are still questions to answer life on our planet is protected from both solar and Cosmic radiation by the Earth thickness of the atmosphere the surface of Mars has far less protection at some point Mars magnetic field died allowing the solar wind to gradually strip away the atmosphere humans on Mars will have to limit their exposure to sources of radiation at the the front of the Rover samples of the different materials from which NASA makes space suits are attached as part of the calibration Target for the Sherlock instrument spacit designers are Keen to observe any changes during prolonged exposure to the Martian environment the Sherlock instrument mounted on the Rover spectrometers and a camera to make detailed analyses of geological samples the instrument was calibrated on the ground but it is regularly checked against known samples on the calibration Target as well as the five space suit materials the samples include a slice of Martian meteorite and a sapphire [Music] disc a different unit called Moxy is also looking toward a man landing on Mars Moxy is a demonstration technology that uses solid oxide electrolysis to separate oxygen from from Mars CO2 atmosphere essentially NASA is sending an oxygen Factory to Mars the unit draws a very substantial 300 watts which is why it will only operate for around an hour every few months NASA obviously feels that mox huge power drain combined with its 17 kg mass is worth taking to Mars making the huge volumes of oxygen for a man Mission to Mars will be far cheaper and less complicated than carrying it and Moxy is an important first step in testing the technology where it [Music] needed perseverance carries another technology demonstrator a small helicopter known as Ingenuity it will stay tucked beneath perseverance for 2 months while the Rover seeks a large flat area suitable for test flights building a drone to work under Martian conditions was not easy while the planet roughly 1/3 of the Earth atmosphere that limits the effects of the landing parachute also makes it hard to fly all flight tests were carried out in jpl Martian condition the first and foremost challenge is to make a vehicle that then the second is to generate lift the rotor system has to spin very fast 2, 2200 2400 2600 is that balance of a very light system coming under 2 kg in fact we weighed in under 1.8 kg we have to be light to fly at Mars Ingenuity has to function autonomously flighting instructions will be sent to it via perseverance and at the end of each brief flight the rotorcraft will relay performance data back to the Rob for Relay to Earth all simulations went according to [Applause] plan though the team has every confidence in the Craft qualities an extra level of complexity was involved in stowing the helicopter for Transit and for safely separating it from the Rover onto the surface of Mars at the appropriate time the protective carbon fiber Shield beneath the Rover will be jettisoned and the Rover backs away to leave clear space the transit latch is released and the helicopter to the Rover is severed then it upright position this mundane deployment must be Flawless any glitches could render both the helicopter and the Rover useless 2 1 Z the Ingenuity team has an experimental window of 30 Martian days five flights are planned for this period as a safety margin perseverance will back away 100 m before the helicopter attempts its first flight this is scheduled for late morning the craft should have warmed after the bitter marshan night and yet the atmosphere should still be cold and slightly more dense which will assist with the lift the first flight will be straight up to around 3 m with a brief hover period followed by a prompt return to the surface [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it has to be fully autonomous from the time it takes off to the time it lands what we do do on the ground is we plan the flights and so we determine from here where we want the helicopter to go the information gathered by Ingenuity is solely related to its performance future Mars missions will benefit from the flight experience accumulated by the rotorcraft after each flight Ingenuity solar panel requires a full Martian day to recharge it six lithium ion batteries 2/3 of the charge is used to keep Electronics warm during the Martian night most of our flights will be at the 3 to 5 m height we will be going horizontally again at a few MERS per second probably go out you know 50 70 M and come back in successive flights we go further so our priority will be to get back engineering Telemetry and not so much images but I a few you know because they look a black and white navigation camera and a higher resolution color camera are the only instruments on the [Applause] craft the wasac range and the dry Walker Lake in [Music] Nevada here a team of seven Mission Specialists and their instruments were standing in for perseverance even before the mission had been launched planetary geologists were a ble to gain experience in using the Rover right in locations around the world 150 scientists were monitoring the instruments in an exercise called Rover operations activities for science team training over a period of 2 weeks the science teams were practicing how to interpret what they saw and issuing instructions to the mission Specialists about what they want to investigate further the Rover adjacent color navigation cameras were represented by a cluster of conventional digital cameras the main investigation team initially requested a 360° Panorama but they soon realized this would generate 10 times more data than could be transmitted in one day a more modest plan soon emerged for a low-resolution mosaic of the bank in front of the Rover Thea volume a wheel mounted frame housed a ground penetrating radar unit that imitated perseverance rimax subsurface experiment a handheld x-ray analyzer to determine Rock chemistry stood in for the Rover experiment it using just the information relayed to them by these instruments the science team name specific features and formulate plans for further investigation plotting moves for the over to make for the next day observations for what the end of Drive should look like it looks like it a rotation um and that where the wheels would fit in um the the science teams that drive the investigation are reliant upon the engineering team that drives the Rover and learning how to operate together smoothly is an important part of the training we don Fidelity than that in February 2020 the engineers at at JPL in California who had handbuilt perseverance began methodically packing their work into Transit cases for its Journey to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida the Rover its rocket powered descent stage and the cruise stage that will protected during its Voyage to Mars would be integrated at the launch site but one vital component the power source had not yet seen the Rover perseverance is designed to work with the multimission radioisotope thermoelectric generator it had been built for NASA by the US Department of energy at the Idaho National Laboratory inside the unit eight pellets of plutonium 238 dioxide glow with a red heat thanks to radioactive decay thermac couples clustered around these pellets convert the heat to electricity because there are no moving Parts the system is very reli viable but the conversion rate is inefficient some of the excess heat is tapped off to direct the heat the Rover remaining heat dissipates via eight cooling [Applause] fins in April 2020 the unit housed in a specially cooled protective Cask arrived at the Kennedy Space Center at the start of the mission the plutonium generates about 2 KW of thermal power which is converted to 125 wats of electrical power after 14 years of operation this will dwindle to 100 watts of electricity soon after its arrival at the launch Center the power unit was briefly connected to the Rover for a fit check because of the heat it generates it would not be reconnected until the Rover was on the launch pad during testing the Rover was fitted with a dummy power supply without its plutonium heat Source at various stages of the build the Rover and its spacecraft were put through punishing examinations vibration and high volume sound tests subjected the craft to conditions it would experience during launch the Rover was exposed to extremes of heat and cold greater than could be expected on the surface of mass at various stages during its construction and particularly in the final few months before launch the major components were weighed and spin tested to determine the distribution of weight across the [Music] configuration because the craft rotates during its Cruise phase balance is important and just as a car tested for balance and corrected with weights so too are spacecraft balanced balance of the Rover separate from its delivery system is also important particularly as it is lowered from its descent stage to the Martian surface the Rover more than 6 kg in supplementary weights added to bring its center of gravity to within fractions of a millimeter of its design specification other weights in the backshell will be jettisoned just before entry into the Martian atmosphere throughout the building and testing of perseverance and its spacecraft all staff wore clean room suits affectionally known as bunny suits they protect the electronics and Precision Engineering from contamination a hair or even a flake of skin can cause serious difficulties if it gets into the wrong place because this mission is searching for evidence of life it is crucial that all components are not just free of particulate contamination they must be sterile the planetary Protection Team regularly swabbed surfaces and tested for bacterial spores to verify that the craft could not contaminate the Martian environment panels on the space craft are regularly wiped with alcohol while parts that cannot be cleaned this way like the central processors are sealed behind a microbial filtration system other components like the parachute were sterilized by a prolonged exposure to high temperatures the required standard says the Rover and its spacecraft should carry fewer than 500,000 bacterial spores given how small these spores are this is a very limited number it was after the 1969 Apollo 12 landing on the moon that NASA realized biological contamination would be a problem there it is son of a gun right down the middle of the road outstanding 42° Pete hang in there coming down at two he ft contact light roger copy contact the Luna module touched down within walking distance of the surveyor 3 spacecraft that had landed in 1967 Engineers wanted to understand what prolonged exposure to space did to their Hardware so the astronauts returned to Earth with several pieces of the surveyor including its camera subsequent analysis revealed the presence of the common bacterium streptococus mtis on the the camera while moonrock examinations were scrupulous the hardware tests were not to this day it remains unclear whether the spores had survived on the moon for more than 2 years or if the parts had been contaminated after their return to Earth the Rover Hardware received special attention to guarantee the Integrity of the material collected on Mars the Rover carries 39 sample tubes and five witness tubes standards here far exceed those for the Rover and spacecraft generally organic compounds inside the tubes must be less than one part per billion when it tube is inserted behind the hollow drill at the end of the Rover the drill penetrates to a depth of around 5 cm and its core sample weighs about 15 G after the percussive drilling the core sample inside the tube is snapped off inside the Rover the sample is handled by a second robotic arm before the tube is sealed it is weighed and then photographed staff at JPL hit a major snag when preparing the sample tubes the intention had been to subject the tubes to sustain temperatures while this sterilized them their surface was subtly changed causing a loss of smoothness leading to problems with the ceiling system ultimately a combination of heating rinsing with solvents and Ultrasonics gave the required results the sample tubes were one of the last items fitted to the Rover since the outbreak of the covid-19 virus there has been a third completely new reason for engineers and technicians to wear masks JPL site in Pasadena has seen stringent viral protocols implemented with those who can working from home a narrow launch window meant work on the Rover could not slacken though it was made more complex by the pandemic in June 2020 it was decided that a plate should be affixed to perseverance to acknowledge the challenging work carried out by Frontline medical workers even the staff and serpent was swab to test for bacterial spores the plate is intended to remind future explorers of the Year 2020 and the global pandemic an Antonoff 124 landing at Cape Canal Runway it carried the atlas 5 Launcher that would send perseverance to Mars it window approached components of the Mars 2020 Mission were delivered to the Kennedy Space Center most of the Rover and its spacecraft had arrived at the cape several months earlier where it had been unpacked and thoroughly checked but final assembly could not begin until the sample acquisition system was delivered also in May the atlas 5 Core stage and its boosters were conveyed to the Ula vertical integration facility known as the vi adjacent to Cape Canaveral launch complex for 41 here the components are raised to the vertical and bolted together it is interesting that while Russia was unable to meet its launch commitments for the European exomars Mission its dual nozzle Rd 1880 engine is providing the primary first stage thrust for Mars 2020 Atlas Rockets have been using the reliable and very efficient Russian engine since 2000 but us political considerations are pressing the United launch Alliance to develop an American replacement for the Mars mission the atlas 5 was configured with four solid propellant [Music] boosters made by aerojet rocket dine these boosters have fixed engine Bells so the atlas 5 is completely Reliant upon its core engine for Direct directional control at the Kennedy Space centers payload hazardous servicing facility the Rover and its descent stage were United then sealed inside the back shell and the heat [Music] shield other elements of the cruise stage including the disc of solar panels were attached before the complete spacecraft was sealed inside the payload Fair Ing and red for transport to the [Music] launcher in June the Centaur upper stage arrived at the vif this would Propel the Mars 2020 craft beyond Earth orbit the thin skin of the centor relies upon the pressure of its liquid fuel to keep it stable while empty the centur is filled with pressurized nitrogen to prevent it collapsing in early July the spacecraft in its fairing arrived for integration with the now complete Atlas 5 there remain several weeks before the commencement of the launch [Music] window from July the 30th to August the 5th 15 there would be roughly a 3-hour period in the Florida mornings in which the Mars 2020 Mission could be [Music] launched any technical setbacks at this late stage could see the launch delayed for 26 months however there was one crucial piece of Hardware still to be [Music] fitted months earlier when the vif was still empty a special test run had been staged perseverance is power supply is Mission critical but it manage while the RTG is radioactive at this early stage of its nuclear Decay the overwhelming portion of its emissions are alpha particles that have difficulty penetrating a sheet of paper they can easily be shielded the problem with the plutonium power source is the huge amount of heat it constantly radiates sealing it in a confined fairing without some way of dissipating this heat would damage the spacecraft only after the rocket has been erected with its payload in position can the power plant be connected technicians gain access through hatch is in both the payload shroud and the Rover times the RTG is cooled by a heat rejection system that remains functional until cooling Loops within the Rover take over the task 2 days before the launch window opened the atlas 5 began its move from the vif to space launch complex 41 Feed lines were attached and the upper and lower stages began taking Fuel and oxidizer on the morning of July the 30th the countdown reached its final moments engine ignition 2 1 Z and liftoff as the countdown to Mars continues the perseverance of humanity launching the next generation of robotic explorers to the red planet the launch was perfect the Centaur upper stage for it second time to push the cruise stage out of Earth orbit toward Mars at this time both the cruise stage and the centur were on a path that would see them miss the red planet several weeks after separation a coarse correction brought perseverance onto the correct line leaving the upper stage to follow a path that would see it orbit the Sun during its six-month cruise to Mars several more course refinements ensured the craft would arrive at Mars on February the 18th 2021 when the landing day arrived team members at JPL were intently watching their consoles at this point any signals sent to the perseverance craft would take 11 minutes so the precise sequence of Landing instructions had to come from the craft itself standing by for cruise stage separation Cruise stage SE we have confirmation of Entry interface at the top of the atmosphere the craft was traveling at 19,000 kmph its thrusters were keeping it positioned blunt end first with the heat shield protecting the Rover from the extreme temperatures we are starting the straighten up and fly right maneuver where the spacecraft will jettison the entry balance masses in preparation for parachute deploy and to roll over to give the radar a better look at the ground the navigation has confirmed that the parachute has deployed and we are seeing significant deceleration in the velocity our current velocity is 440 m/s at an altitude of about 12 km from the surface Mar heat shield set first Advance has now slowed to subsonic speeds and the heat shield has been separated perseverance is highdefinition cameras began recording various aspect aspects of the landing procedure they could recognize surface features and the craft began plotting a course for jezero Crater soon the Rover cradled in the rocket powered descent stage Broke Free from the back shell and parachute when it was close enough to the surface and kicking up dust the sky cran began lowering perseverance gently to the ground this was the first time a spacecraft had called it its own Landing Tango Delta touchdown confirmed perseverance safely on the surface of Mars ready to begin seeking the stands of past life NASA had landed the most sophisticated Rover yet built at a precise location in jezero Crater its investigations will continue for at least 10 years [Music]	Success
NASA's Artemis: The Return to the Moon with the First Woman! | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y30TPVIkrdo	SLICE Science	[Music] our moon is unique its gravitational influence keeps the Earth regular meaning our planet stable its crated surface preserves an important record of the Solar System history a history that weather and tectonic forces have AR raised from the Earth in the 1970s with the last Apollo moon landings everyone expected that New Missions would follow the preliminary lunar investigations the idea that 50 years would pass without further lunar exploration was Unthinkable NASA had plans for a Luna base an orbiting space station and ideas about mining Luna resources had also been moted instead the space shuttle was developed as a way to cut costs but it meant man activity would be confined to low earth orbit eventually a space station was completed but only when the International Community was persuaded to join the project and to share the cost exploration of deep space became The Preserve of robotic missions but safety issues meant the space shuttle was withdrawn from service prematurely the long lead times in developing a replacement meant that the American space agency was left flat-footed NASA finally decided that Private Industry could take over trips to low earth orbit with the agency shifting its focus toand exploration of deep space while NASA had ambitious plans to return to the Moon Washington was slow in releasing funds NASA had been developing a human rated spacecraft called Orion along Ong with the new Aries launch vehicle this was the constellation program tailored for ambitious missions beyond Earth orbit 3 2 1 Aries flew once but serious problems led to its demise Orion was reconfigured and the European space agency was asked to join the project and design an accompanying service module in an attempt to reduce costs in 2014 Oran was ready for unmanned flight testing and temporarily a commercial launch vehicle would replace the Aries the mission known as exploration flight test 1 featured a dummy service module and an incomplete launch Escape system it was carried at top a Delta 4 heavy launcher and liftoff at dawn the dawn of Orion and a new era of American space exploration the flight was needed to test the Craft capability after 6 minutes the launch abort system was jettisoned the spacecraft was boosted to an extremely high apery of 5,800 km so that its re-entry velocity was similar to what it would experience returning from the Moon after a 4 and 1/ half hour flight the Iran capsule was floating in the Pacific Ocean where a team from the USS Anchorage recovered the craft for detailed analysis the mission was a success but in 2014 the only real plan was for the craft to be used in conjunction with an asteroid retrieval Mission which was soon dumped now almost 7 years later the Orion spacecraft has not made a second flight it had been waiting for the space launch system the US budget authorization Bill signed in 2010 allotted money for the big new rocket but the primary reason politicians had approved it was to appease various branches of the space industry and to preserve jobs Washington made funds available with preconditions corporations that had supplied components for the space shuttle should Supply components for the space launch system Utah senator Orin hatch wanted the big new rocket to use solid fueled boosters like the shuttle because they were built and tested in Utah senators from Alabama and Florida knew that upgrades to existing shuttle facilities would see dollars continuing to flow into their states [Music] the SLS is described as a shuttle derived vehicle it is fitted with upgraded versions of the shuttle engines and the core stage draws heavily on the shuttle tank the design directives were Justified as giving NASA a launcher grounded in mature technology but critics and the were many began calling the SLS the Senate launch system it was argued that the expense would mean slow development and at best two launches per year rather than deliver mature technology it was saddling NASA with an outmoded [Music] system and while NASA had plans for the space launch system its development costs meant the agency had no funds to do much except build the launcher it was a big rocket with no to [Music] go in 2017 president Trump threw NASA a Lifeline when he signed the White House space policy directive one the directive I refocus America exploration and Discovery it marks an important step returning American astronauts to the moon for the first time since 1972 for long-term exp exploration and use this time we will not only plant our flag and leave our footprint we will establish a foundation for an eventual Mission to Mars and perhaps someday to many worlds Beyond this dire there was no new money associated with the directive but NASA ran with the idea and soon came up with the AR program which was spearheaded by an aggressive public Rel [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we go in my short the NASA administrator at the time Jim brightenstein knew he had to get the public on side a way of of popular enthusiasm for a return to the Moon would pressure leaders in Congress to unlock the vast sums needed to execute the president directive I I heard that loud and clear he backed it up after at a meeting with NASA staff he was candid about the difficult ities in realizing the directive we means I don this level of commitment seriously unless there are additional means uh and so that support as we go forward it is also my commitment to make sure people understand the history here and that we can have a great ambitious goal but without the resources it won accomplished a detailed plan emerged a new space station the Gateway positioned in a highly eccentric lunar orbit would serve as a transfer point for astronauts traveling to the moon surface The Eccentric orbit would make it easy to reach almost any point on the lunar surface and it would give NASA experience operating in deep space necessary for long-term excursions to Mars because the directive encouraged collaboration with Private Industry NASA began asking for concepts for various parts of the Luna Gateway and for a Luna Landing system the agency was aiming for a landing in 2028 but in early 2019 the deadline shifted US vice president Mike Pence made a speech at the Marshall space flight center in Huntsville Alabama it is the stated policy of this Administration and the United States of America to return American astronauts to the Moon within the next 5 years it was immediately obvious to both space and political observers that this new deadline fitted neatly into the second term of the Trump Administration should there be one but know this the president has directed NASA and administrator Jim brightenstein to accomplish this goal by any means necessary in order to succeed as the administrator will discuss today we must focus on the mission over the means you must consider every available option and platform to meet our goals including industry government and the entire American space Enterprise the vice president even invoked the spirit of the Cold War now make no mistake about it we we were in the 1960s and the stakes are even higher last December China became the first nation to land on the far side of the moon and revealed their ambition to seize the lunar strategic High ground and become the world fairing nation and for more than S years without a viable human space launch program of our own Russia has been charging the United States more than $80 million a seat every time an American astronaut travels to the International Space Station even at the following public meeting of the National Space Council the vice president gave no detail about funding or how NASA could meet the technical challenge just pressure to conform to a new capriciously imposed [Music] timeline work on the space launch system continued at its modest pace Cas NASA crunched the numbers and said the accelerated program would need an additional $35 billion this was not forthcoming the Trump Administration proposed siphoning funds from the Federal pel grant an education resered for college students of modest means but Congress would not [Music] agree next NASA announced that the Luna G Gateway would no longer be necessary for the 2024 landing and asked corporations to develop concepts for a Luna Lander early in 2020 dtic SpaceX and a team led by Blue origin all received varying amounts of seed money for initial design work on a human Landing system this was important because NASA was introducing the private sector to their lunar program in a similar way that Boeing and SpaceX were used for the development of services to the ISS but it seemed that the schedule was now more important than the long-term lunar strategy and NASA was caught up in a political hijack it atmosphere existing in the 1960s when US President Kennedy laid down a deadline for the Apollo program the Soviet Union had been making rapid scientific advances with the detonation of the country 1949 it matched the United States as a nuclear [Music] superpower in 1957 the Soviet Union launched Sputnik the first satellite [Music] Cold War paranoia swept the United States American leaders seeing the Communist Nation pull ahead in space research demanded a quick response in 1958 the Eisenhower Administration established NASA who recruited test pilots as their first Seven astronauts immediately these men became superstars [Music] Congress delivered the funding for America understood the urgency and swiftly authorized the expenditure however in April 1961 the Soviets continued to press their advantage Colonel Yuri Gagarin became the first cosmina his spacecraft bosok 1 orbited the earth once and he returns safely to the ground triggering a new wave of American humiliation 3 weeks later NASA responded the Redstone Rocket that carried Alan sheeper did not have enough power to reach orbit his capsule was named Freedom 7 in the spirit of the Cold War 2 1 Z ignition left off left off and 34 minutes after the hour Shephard made a 15minute space hop but everyone knew it was a poor second to gagarin flight Freedom 7 reached a height of 150 km and splashed down in the Atlantic experts at Nasa helped the new US President Kennedy understand that while the Soviets had an early lead in heavy lift Rockets the us could outspend the Russians in achieving an ambitious goal if it was beyond the current capabilities of the Soviet rocket program in May 1961 Kennedy delivered a special message to Congress I therefore ask the Congress above and beyond the increases I have earlier requested for space activities to provide the funds which are needed to meet the following National goals first I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of Landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth no single Space Project in this period will be more impressive to mankind or more important for the long range exploration of space none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish NASA just 3 years old at the time was delighted although there was surprise that such an ambitious Target had been set just weeks after Alan Shepard American people were behind Kennedy idea and so were the legislators at the time NASA was led by James Webb a canny administrator who understood that most of his work would be in lobbying politics itions to make sure that funds continued to flow for what became known as the Apollo program throughout the Mercury program and the following Gemini program Webb made sure that the astronauts were treated as national heroes and that political leaders could bask in their reflected glory and continue to fund the huge Enterprise [Music] [Applause] under web that NASA still relies upon today was built and the disperate group of research centers that had been combined to form NASA coalesced into a unified [Music] entity the injection of funds into the Hightech area of the US economy changed the world spin-offs we still benefit from today [Music] despite President Kennedy assassination and many developmental difficulties the first moonlanding happened in July 1969 12 11 10 9 ignition sequence starts 6 5 4 3 2 1 Z all engine running lift off we have a lift off 32 minutes P the power off on apoll 11 the deadline was met

the long term with a subsequent objective of putting astronauts on Mars but without political backing little can happen with the change in the US Administration early in 2021 many at the space agency were worried that the emis program like many before it would not survive the political [Music] transition while the new president has been very busy it has been made clear that the emis program will [Music] continue when Bill Nelson was nominated as NASA mixed while a serving Congressman he had flown as a mission specialist on Space Shuttle Colombia for the deployment of the satcom K1 communication satellite Nelson is enthusiastic about the emis program yet he building the space launch system through traditional Cost Plus Contracting methods which are proving to be timec consuming and expensive comparisons with the new directions being taken by corporations like SpaceX are compelling the company recently completed development and flight testing of the crew Dragon system that now fies astronauts to and from the International Space Station Boeing a company accustomed to working with NASA using conventional methods was commissioned to develop a parallel system system their Starliner is more expensive than the dragon and it still hasn flown with a crew the key to understanding how SpaceX works is in not understanding the conventional approach to Rocket building the company has invested time and money in developing a falcon 9 F stage that can safely return to the ground and be reused The Guiding hand behind SpaceX Elon Musk has often declared that the ambitious space missions of the future can only happen if the cost of access to space is drastically reduced and that Expendable Rockets are an extravagance that can no longer be afforded since 2017 reuse of the Falcon 9 booster has become routine allowing SpaceX to drastically undercut its commercial rivals in the launch business stage one is transonic start the competition has been slow to react with the Europeans seeking government subsidies and United launch Alliance beginning its own development program [Applause] even greater savings were made with the introduction of the Falcon heavy which is essentially three Falcon 9es strapped together it formation originally SpaceX had intended that the Falcon 99 return to the ground as well but it was soon realized that the design could not be stretched that far a completely new concept emerged at 118 M spacex huge and it reusable it has two stages the first stage known as the super heavy will return to the ground in similar fashion to the Falcon 9 first stage while the upper stage the Starship will plunge back through the atmosphere belly first the new system has a new engine called the Raptor which itself is revolutionary most first stage engines use flight grade kerosene as fuel with liquid oxygen as the oxidizer the Raptor uses methane which has big advantages for reliability and reusability both stages will be fitted with varying numbers of the Raptor at a presentation in 2019 SpaceX founder Elon Musk revealed his motivation in building the big rocket I think we should really do our very best to become a multiplet species and to extend Consciousness beyond Earth and we should do it now we future do you want do you want the future of we become a space bring civilization and are in many worlds and out there Among the Stars or one where we are forever confined to Earth and I say it is the first and and and I hope you agree with me yeah it interesting when someone speaks on behalf of civilization Elon Musk is embarking on a quest and his stainless steel Starship is his solution for colonizing the Moon Mars and Beyond [Music] since this makes it a direct competitor to NASA asking why NASA is still bothering SpaceX has plans for a crude version a cargo version and a tanker version of the Starship if the development of the system goes according to plan SpaceX will have the ability to deliver roughly 100 metric tons to Earth orbit but this will be just the first stage of the longer missions for which the Starship system has been designed the booster will return to the ground minutes after launch ready to be refueled fitted with a new upper stage and fly again within hours prompt on orbit refueling of the Starship is essential for long duration flights this is where the methane and oxygen propellants have a clear advantage over hydrogen often used in Upper stages liquid methane does not need the extremely low temperatures required for liquid hydrogen SpaceX is confident that the problems associated with long-term storage of these cryogenic propellants can be solved Elon Musk has said he build a thousand Starships clearly this is some way into the future for development and testing SpaceX purchased land near Brownsville in Texas beside boka Chica Beach work here is proceeding rapidly with prototypes being fabricated in the open air while buildings are still being planned the star Hopper was the first flight prototype it looked like a water tank it flew four times in what was a series of tests for its single Raptor engine and the new autogenous pressurization system traditional designs have used helium or nitrogen to fill the increasing space within the propellant tanks as fuel and oxidizer are depleted this system uses gaseous propellant instead in what represents a huge weight saving on its final flight the star Hopper reached a high point of 150 M providing designers all the data they needed to modify the next prototype for a more demanding series of flights at the end of its tests the star Hopper was partially dismantled and it components recycled 12 months later the next flight article serial number five made its only flight it looked like a silo because of the low speeed nature of these flights nose cones and streamlining were dispensed with after a month the very similar sn6 made its flight both prototypes were still fitted with only one engine but they featured full-sized fuel tanks and were used to refine launch procedures the single Raptor engine was slightly off center in the position it would occupy as part of a cluster of three [Music] as the frequency of the flight tests increased crowds were drawn to boa [Music] chica because of the open nature of spacex observers with cameras began recording the technicians and Engineers work much of which was happening in the open air while SpaceX live streams its test flights they do not advertise and provide very little little in the way of running commentary about plans these Outsiders realized there was an appetite amongst space fans for news of anything happening at booch Chica the current testing program is unfolding at such a pace that groups like The Everyday astronaut lab Padre and Cosmic perspective have formed the nucleus of an expanding SpaceX observation industry that shares information via YouTube [Music] sn8 represented a new phase in the development of the Starship this prototype presented the starship aerodynamic profile and space Watchers were Keen to see the belly flop maneuver that was such an important part of the spacecraft and its reusability it was fitted with three Raptor engines while the final Starship will have six engines the three outer units will have larger engine Bells optimized for operation in the vacuum of space and they will not be used for propulsive landing 3 2 1 ignition after a 24-hour delay sn8 was launched on December the 9th 2020 the test article would climb to an altitude of 125,000 M then adopt its side-facing re-entry profile without engine power the craft was controlled by its body and nose winglets SpaceX Engineers realizing that this was the most complex part of the return operation were Keen to to perfect this new maneuver at every point of the flight huge volumes of data were fed back to the ground nobody expected the flight to be perfect less than 2 months later serial number N9 was ready for flight sitting near the Launchpad was sn10 which was being ready to take its turn the speed at which SpaceX was building testing and then modifying the Starship led to comparisons with NASA system the SLS had been in development for at least 10 years and the more conventional rocket still had not flown like the previous test flights the launch went smoothly and the sequential shutdown of engines happened as planned soon after the 4-minute Mark sn9 had reached its 10 km High Point it began hovering on one engine and dumping oxygen 4 and A2 minutes we are handing off to the locks tank we this is an important transition point for the spacecraft not just because it flips to the horizontal but because when the engines restart they will draw propellant from spherical header tanks designed to deliver fuel evenly regardless of the starship to hold the vehicle stability as we descend back to The Landing Pad to deliver maximal payload design parameters call for the craft to use as little fuel as possible during the landing sequence and the engines must work reliably at very short notice the freeall phase has presented no problems in any of the test flights but flight controllers knew that reignition of the engines and transition back to the vertical was the hard part due to a problem with an oxygen pre-b burner only one engine had started but with reduced thrust the damaged Landing Pad would be repaired and improvements made to the next prototype as a stop Gap measure sn10 had introduced helium for pressurizing the header tanks like the previous test flights engines were successfully closed down one by one and transfer to the belly flop attitude was uneventful as a fail safe all three Raptor engines would ignite for the flip maneuver a quick decision would then be made to shut down any unit that displayed problems as only one fully functioning engine was needed for the soft Landing it bounced when it hit the ground hard it had a slight lean and there was a small fire at the the base but sn10 was in one piece and SpaceX terminated its online coverage the helium pressurant had mixed with the fuel and reduced thrust but it was so close to success sn11 flew on March the 30th 2021 it was something of an anticlimax it took off in heavy fog and cameras could not see it when it exploded in Flight with wreckage raining down across the launch site a hard engine start destroyed the test article because all the SpaceX test data is proprietary it is difficult to know much more in April NASA announced that SpaceX had won the contract to build the Luna Lander it had been expected that two companies would be selected to introduce dissimilar redundancy but with a smaller than expected allocation from Congress cost became the major problem A variation of the Starship that can dock with the Orion spacecraft will be developed time to come back several days later the US Senate Commerce science and transportation convened a hearing for several presidential nominations among them Bill Nelson as the next NASA administrator Senator Nelson again formally welcome to the Nelson served in the senate for 18 years and enjoys good relations with senators from both sides of the aisle responsib among his political colleagues his appointment is not controversial and his confirmation was regarded as a sure thing uh as it was explained it was a preliminary meeting but interesting facts still emerged the timetable for 2024 is still there with with the uh award e and um I think we all have to recognize that space is hard uh and it timetable but that is what has been stated the 2024 moonlanding date announced under the Trump Administration has generally been dismissed as wishful thinking because development of the a launcher was so far behind schedule the 2.89 billion dollar NASA will inject into the starship program for a Luna Landing version certainly ease the financial burden on [Music] SpaceX Elon Musk seems to have a firm grasp on the financial side of the Starship program at the 67th International astronautical Congress in Mexico he was candid about the projects sources of funding so funding uh we do expect to generate um pretty decent uh net net cash flow from launching lots of satellites and servicing the space station for NASA transferring hogo to and from space station um and um and then uh I know that there the private sector who are interested in helping fund a base on Mars um and then perhaps there the government sector side to also do that um ultimately this is going to be u a huge uh public private partnership um and I think that United States was established um and uh many other countries around the world is a public private partnership so I think that right now we much progress as we can with the resources that that we have available um and just sort of keep keep moving both forward um and hopefully um I think I think as we as we show that this is possible that this dream is real um not just a dream it can something that can be made real um I think the support will snowball over time in another Financial scheme that doubles as a public relations exercise is a special Mission announced in 2018 Japanese entrepreneur yaku maawa will pay the entire cost of a circum lunar flight on the Starship due to fly no earlier than 2023 most love and respect for with him will fly between six and eight artists I named this project dear moon at the moment I have not decided which artist I possible I artists that represent our planet from various Fields including painters sculptors photographers musicians film directors fashion designers Architects Etc thank you when taking questions Elon Musk didn Zara far yeah here definitely like made a significant deposit on the first on on the price which is a significant price um and will actually have a material effect on the um on paying for the cost of development of VFR like I should probably you should probably think of a different name but this was like kind of the code name and it kind of stuck uh but we might change that name in the future this was the moment when the Starship name became attached to the project unlike spacex launch system does not have exotic means of raising funds all cash flow into the SLS comes from the US taxpayer and that money comes with [Music] preconditions development of the space launch system has been slow but for mainly budgetary reasons beyond the control of NASA [Music] for slightly more than a year starting in January 2020 the core stage of the SLS was undergoing tests at the stennis Space Center in eastern Mississippi set in the center of Woodland and with access to a navigable Waterway stennis is one of the NASA Test Facilities originally built for the Apollo [Music] program the new stage had to be validated in a series of tests known as the Green Run where all aspects of the new hardware are exposed to conditions beyond the limits that could be expected during flight the engines the propellant tanks avionics and thrust Vector controls were all tested individually and then finally working in concert the final hot fire test had to be run twice as a problem with conservative software caused was the first test to shut down prematurely when testing was complete the core stage was loaded onto a barge for a leisurely trip along the Pearl River to the Kennedy Space Center different parts of the space launch system began converging on the Space Center for final assembly but the launchers continued to to slip the uncrewed emis 1 mission to orbit the Moon was due for late 2021 and claims that it will launch early in 2022 are regarded as unlikely at the same time work on spacex work on the boka Chica facility was progressing rapidly flight testing on the heavy lift first stage could not begin the Federal Aviation Administration is conducting an environmental review following spacex plans to expand its boach chica site and major testing is on hold the area is part of the lagona Madre hypine Lagoon system home to threatened or vulnerable Shorebirds and turtles environmentalists are alarmed by the number of explosions that Reign Deb across the fragile region Elon Musk says the program delays are regulatory not Technical and that plans for 12 launches throughout 2022 are still in place but this launch Cadence is beyond the scope of the company FAA and there is one technical problem the Raptor engine which Powers the Starship is not being produced rapidly enough to meet the program requirements [Music] regarding the Joint Nasa SpaceX moon landings both organizations have lost at least 5 months due to a legal battle with blue Origins Jeff Bezos the company mounted a legal challenge against NASA after its unsuccessful tender for a moon landing craft the challenge failed but while the case was under consideration NASA and SpaceX were prevented from developmental work on the Luna Lander NASA conceded that this litigation along with delays associated with the covid-19 pandemic will make a 2024 moon landing impossible the agency cited a new 20125 date however NASA Inspector General recently made a comprehensive review of the program and stated that development and testing of the human Landing system and of the exploration space suits were still in the early stages an Aluna Landing date was unlikely for several years Beyond NASA estimates these issues should not affect the first unmanned Flight of the space launch system which had until recently been scheduled for a November 2021 launch clearly that did not happen and the latest information suggests NASA is experiencing difficulties with the controller for one of its rs2 5 engines despite exhaustive testing the communication problem between the engine 4 controller and the Central Computer did not show up until after the rocket had been stacked the controller is incorporated into the engine so the best course of action will be to replace the complete unit but though that should take 6 weeks it will probably lead to a six-month delay with a mid 2022 launch now being flagged the SLS for the emis 1 Mission has been assembled and work continues on hardware for the artamis 2 mission the first carrier crew but there are only firm plans for four Aramis missions so much has been committed for infrastructure for what exploration ground system the historic pad 39b first used during the Apollo era has been upgraded with a new flame trench and water Deluge system the three lightning towers that protect the rocket and the launch site have been extensively refurbished and new fueling tanks have been built the pad can now accommodate a variety of different launchers but the mobile launch towers that feed each rocket are unique and expensive and so far no commercial rocket Builders have shown interest in the new infrastructure leaving the space launch system as its only user the crawler transporter Vehicles were introduced in 1965 to take the satin 5 to the Launchpad and from 1981 to 2011 the space shuttles these were rebuilt with one specially modified to carry the SLS the crushed rock crawlway was also refurbished with River Rock NASA and the US Navy have been practicing for capsule recovery the spacecraft will Splash down in the Pacific around 100 km off the Californian Coast it will be met by a recovery crew from a San Antonio class amphibious transport dog weighing in excess of 9,000 kg the capsule is too heavy to be lifted by a helicopter it will be hauled into the ship area again this is a very expensive operation it looks primitive compared with the SpaceX plan to have its Starship land propulsively NASA will not directly release the cost of the Orion SLS combination but estimates have just over 1 billion US per launch are regarded as modest launch Cadence will be around one per year which Compares poorly to the 10 Mann Apollo flights in just over four years with spacex a similar capability it understand why NASA and SpaceX cannot cooperate for their Mutual benefit perhaps us politicians who are reluctant to release funds for more than four aramus missions agree with just four certain artamis missions it achieving its stated goal of establishing a permanent base on the moon [Music]	Success
Rio: Paradise Lost or City Reborn? | SLICE SCIENCE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijVYyOz2tcA	SLICE Science	[Music] Rio de Janeiro is not the only major city on the Brazilian Coast 84% of the country concentrated in Rio San Paulo Salvador de Baya and reif they have transformed the whole coast and destroyed 97% of the Atlantic Forest once more rich in biodiversity than Amazonia this Galloping urbanization siphons all the resources from the interior of the country without the Coast been disrupted but aside from its climatic problems Rio is undergoing a general disruption of the environment the poorest districts are at the heart of this ecological crisis people here build their houses on top of each other with no help or urban planning and are thus exposed to Serious Urban pollution there are no sewers the former streams and riverbeds are all cemented over and that wastes of 800,000 families all crowded together end up the inhabitants have lost all contact with nature there are a lot of territory of the city where live more than two million people and special poor people of the city they don Grim they don don service about waste and and Sanity everybody deserves to have and then this is also a social question Rio can no longer hold back what is now an inexorable process the city may be just months away from hosting the World Cup but its famous beaches are fast succumbing to pollution and nobody seems to care it all the [Music] beauty how could this beautiful city the Envy of the world have gotten to this point Rio has turned its back on nature yet it is the fruit of its environment shaped and conditioned by geography like no other huge City on the [Music] planet to understand its history you have to grasp this powerful wild and Monumental geography what is Rio nature first of all there guanabara Bay it square kilm and was once the most beautiful Bay in the world home to mangroves and whales right up until the 1950s it was was also the home to the very first settlers who were fascinated by its unique geography it was from the bay that the city expanded threading its way through the natural obstacles south of the bay Rio curves around the Majestic Mount tzuka and its Forest to reach the Atlantic then spreads further contained only by the famous moros those gigantic needles of granite that give the city its striking appearance [Music] for centuries Rio continued to hug the [Music] coast but in the 20th century the city broke loose for the first time it outgrew its geography straddling mountains and forests to gain new territory on their way the new districts devastated lagoons marshes estuaries a whole Mosaic of ecosystems only three big far fors still stand protected by their steep [Music] hills Ario is a very singular city in the world because uh we have a an incredible quantity and quality of natural aets three rainforests two bays lagoons and spectacular Oceanic literal and uh it and a half people and we are together rich and poor people we don center and an outside we are everybody mix and mix with this na Rio is held back by the ocean to the South but another sea borders it to the North a human sea whose waves keep breaking day after day against the city build and up there where the city reaches its limits the forest takes over this forest and the water it produces are Rio three massive wooded areas that together make up the world the last relics of the extraordinary natural world that for century was Rio they bear witness to the powerful ecology that reigned here before the Portuguese colonists arrived they were the first to declare war on nature Jose Padua is an environmental historian he has written several studies of the evolution of Brazilian society and Rio holds no more secrets for him when the Europeans arrived here at the beginning of the 16th century they saw a landscape that was very different from the European one we had a continuous rainforest from Northeast to south Brazil at that time had more than 1 million square kilomet but they they were were not able to perceive that the most precious thing the most precious knowledge the people here had was the knowledge about what they call now biodiversity amans living in small villages of five 500 600 people living a what they what they saw as a simple life uh they were a little bit disappointed because they did not see here in Brazil what the sies or mines how how like the Spanish uh saw in Mexico and Peru no legendary cities no gold no matter the Portuguese were skilled merchants and they decided to settle Europe was in great need of wood and the tree they called po Brazil was so abundant here they named the country after it when the trees which they used to make dye were all used up they turned to Coffee easy to grow on deforested soil wealthy ever more opulent The Colony soon had 7 million inhabitants all busily cutting down the forest and growing first coffee and then later sugar cane what I call the meat of andless nature this view that you can use that you can burn Forest here because uh far away you forest and this was not good for the establishment of sustainable ways of life because gives this impression that you don you do not need to care for the natural resources because they are so so inexhaustible that you you can use them caress in the 19th century it wasn just the forest that seemed inexhaustible of Brazil inhabitants the huge majority 5 million of them were slaves after abolition a huge population was left looking for housing for work and for an identity to this population of slaves were added in the 19th century fresh migrants drawn from around the world by Rio promise the abulance of the 20th century especially in the 70s radically transformed the city the wealthy built the city of skyscrapers against the backdrop of Virgin forest and with views of the sea the poor just lived wherever they could with the mechanization of agriculture in in Brazilian Countryside in the 1960s and70s thousands of people had to live the country and and came to the cities so they went to the hills they went to the mangroves and created what we call the the favelas who has not heard of the favelas the dictionary translation is slums or sometimes Shanty towns in reality the first time the term was used was in a district called canudos there was a little square there with a tree called a favella a community group grew up around the tree and took its name from it ever since whenever a group of families finds an uninhabited spot and builds houses there they call it a fava true story or not the fact is there are today 2 million inhabitants of a thousand favellas spread out across the city with no urban planning or politics originally the FLL nobly gave shelter to the poor and the water that ran down from the mountains was pure today those Forest streams run through kilometers of favellas with no purification plants or sanitation the water that flows into the Bay of Rio is polluted toxic even biologist Mario moscatelli is a key figure in nature conservation in Rio above all though he spokesman for for all those who like him are tired of the city powerlessness of the state he by residents associations and real estate companies and once a week he flies over the bay in the lagoons of Rio to monitor the pollution and denounce the polluters in the 80s you could still find 40 different species of fish in this Lagoon but there species left the tilapia there used to be hundreds of species of birds reptiles mammals today there species left but you do find sofas TVs chairs bodies anything it no more water it contaminated not a drop of oxygen and with all gases it gives off the sulfur and the methane it makes your eyes stinks the smells unbearable it stinks in this 130 hectare area we had to install about 2 km of fencing I think I must be one of the world men I spend 95% of my time me a biologist stopping rubbish getting into regeneration zones and clearing rubbish out of them it garbage and the civilization that producing it all and chucking it into streams and rivers observing Rio 1997 Mario muscatelli has seen Urban and industrial pollution poisoning ecosystems in the Bay from the lagoons the marshes and even the Lakes throughout the whole of Rio and its [Music] suburbs is it irreversible no there magnificent virgin forests at the Heart of the City there are still true ecological Treasures it is thanks to these forests that Rio could one day Get Back To Nature up there the forest is Nature barometer there are species of animals that have been there for more than 25,000 years the force of nature is still strong 3.6 CM Venus is one of the rare Urban biologists to take an interest in Rio surviving animals like this frog that only found here on a 100 meter stretch of river deep in the forest folklore says that these are magical creatures but this one looks so small and fragile IIA nus is endemic to this region amphibians are the Sentinels of the environment the presence here of this individual indicates that this park has an excellent level of Environmental Quality even of the water in the park in well preserved areas covered with forest and little streams the quality of the environment attains a level that favors the presence of these animals the further down you go in the forest the more Wastewater you find emptying into the rivers so when you get near the houses these amphibians tend to disappear [Music] no princess has ever kissed it but all the same this little frog proper name elosan nasus is still proof of a

James Webb: Unlocking the Secrets of the Universe | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMRh3xYwBMw	SLICE Science	[Music] [Music] December 2021 and an Aran 5 lifts off from Karu carrying NASA Space Telescope [Music] the new Space Telescope is headed for the second Earth million km beyond the Earth Side during its 4-we journey to L2 the folded telescope unfolded in gradual steps soon after separation from the Rocket unfurled and the spacecraft began charging 2 and 1/2 days into its Journey the four and after sunshield pallets were lowered and the mirror assembly extended 2 m above the body of the spacecraft then the four layers of Capon e that make up the sun shield were unfurled and tensioned this allowed the observing section of the spacecraft to cool down to - 233° c 40° Kelvin this is important the web telescope is optimized for near and mid infrared light which cannot penetrate the Earth atmosphere it is designed to see stars and galaxies forming in the early Universe any warmth in the telescope would inhibit its Vision in the red end of the spectrum finally the secondary mirror and the two wings of the primary mirror swung into place the James web Space Telescope is the most complex instrument to be flown yet its design owes much to its famous predecessors both in terms of engineering and in discoveries that change the way we understand the universe in the San Gabriel mountains Northeast of Los Angeles is the Mount Wilson Observatory it was with the 100in hooker telescope that Edwin Hubble proved that the Universe extends beyond our own Galaxy and that the universe itself is expanding but such large groundbased instruments were reaching size limits 5 4 3 2 1 and lift off of the space sh Discovery with the h space telescope in 1990 a space telescope that was named in honor of of Edwin Hubble was launched well publicized difficulties with the Hubble Space telescope primary miror was solved via a subsequent servicing Mission and the orbiting telescope went on to refine estimates of the age of the universe at 13.7 billion years and its rate of expansion Hubble established the prevalence of black holes is especially as the center points of galaxies the telescope the discovery of gnz 11 the most distant known Galaxy the light from very distant objects is shifted toward the red end of the spectrum gnz11 was at the limits of Hubble [Music] in 2003 NASA launched a telescope sensitive into the far infrared it became known as the Spitzer Space Telescope it was the first spacecraft to be placed in an earth trailing orbit around the sun it was planned to have a 5-year operational life but the engineers at JPL hoped that with careful management this could be stretched to 10 [Music] years Spitzer carried 360 L of liquid helium to cool its observational components its great distance from Earth reduced the amount of heat radiated from the planet to operate effectively it needed to be kept at 5° Kelvin and its designers knew that its sensitivity in the far infrared would die when the helium coolant ran out communication could only be maintained by NASA antenni by comparison with Hubble Spitzer 85 CM across although this limited its sensitivity its observations deep into the low end of the spectrum gave researchers a completely new view of familiar objects the Helix nebula in the constellation Aquarius is the remnant of a midsize star that has exploded expelling its outer layers of gas and dust that glow under the influence of the Stellar remains here it the visible [Music] spectrum in the far infrared from Spitzer areas of the opaque dust and gas are now transparent at these wavelengths vast areas of the sky can now be [Music] penetrated even while Hubble was still being built astronomers had been planning a Next Generation telescope to replace it as their experience grew they were getting a clearer idea of the properties the new instrument should have the trend in telescope building has always been toward bigger instruments that have greater light Gathering Power and that can see in Greater detail but Hubble as the current generation of launchers could carry to [Music] orbit terrestrial telescopes have much larger mirrors but their designers realized that huge slabs of glass would sag and distored they came up with radically new Solutions at the the European Southern Observatory at paranal in Chile four identical telescopes with four smaller auxiliary telescopes are collectively known as the very large telescope or VT they can be linked together via interferometry but the four main units are generally used individually each of the large telescopes has an 8.2 M mirror which is only 17 1/2 cm thick classical designs hit a limit at around 5 m at this diameter the glass had to be meters thick to make it stiff and resistant to Distortion as the telescope was pointed the VT takes advantage of the thin mirror distort beneath each mirror 150 axial Force actuators dynamically control the mirror shape in a technique known as active Optics other New Generation telescopes had solved the large mirror problem in a different way a group of hexagonal mirrors could be made to function as a much larger Mirror by making use of actuators to align them Hawaii the first major instruments to use this technology each telescope has a 10 m primary mirror made of 36 [Music] segments by 2002 NASA had settled on a design for what had be known as the Next Generation Space Telescope it was an amalgam of Lessons Learned From orbiting and terrestrial instruments and its primary mirror made up of 18 hexagonal subm mirrors measured 6 1/2 M across it was a huge Advance on Hubble whose mirror is two 2.4 m in diameter with very limited sensitivity into the infrared end of the spectrum and while it occupied more space than Hubble its segmented mirror allowed it to fold up into a small configuration for [Music] launch NASA provide launch services on an Aran 5 in 2002 the telescope was renamed the James web Space Telescope scope James Webb was NASA Apollo program he was instrumental in giving the agency a Science Focus establishing the Mariner and Pioneer programs that began exploration of the solar system the James web Space Telescope is the beginning of a new age in astrophysics with with it astronomers will be able to see light that has been traveling since the earliest years of the universe providing answers about the formation of the first galaxies to achieve such ambitious goals required the new telescope to incorporate at least 10 completely new technologies this is not without risk having an onp paper plan for a new device is not the same as tried and tested Hardware NASA well remembered sending the untested Hubble to orbit with an incorrectly ground mirror every piece of the jwst would be tested individually before the complete Space Telescope was tested as a whole we sound at it heat it cool it and make sure that everything is working exactly like it should in order to discover the things that we have never seen before we need the best equipment we can possibly have so the telescope that we building has no substitute there other way to get that this scientific discoveries that it really find that we don don these telescopes with great confidence that we will open up new Mysteries of the universe whenever we build them it happened Time After Time After Time for centuries the jwst primary role is as an infrared telescope with its very large mirror and its enhanced sensitivity at the low end of the spectrum astronomers are hoping to see light generated 13 billion years ago but the telescope can only achieve this if it functions at very low temperatures this is why it at the L2 Point 1 1/2 million km Beyond Heat radiated from the warm Earth Here its large sunshield will protect it from solar radiation allowing its observing side to cool to 50° Kelvin even so its mid infrared instrument will need its own cryogenic refrigerator to cool it further to just 7° Kelvin while other probes have ventured much further from the Sun such as the New Horizon been designed to function at low temperatures in the outer reaches of the solar system satellites are equipped with radioisotope thermoelectric power sources nuclear decay of plutonium oxide is used to generate electricity and abundant Surplus heat is channeled around the spacecraft to keep it warm [Music] the extreme cold environment in which the jwst must function meant that all its components had to be tested at cryogenic temperatures from the beginning Engineers knew that building the mirrors for the James web Space Telescope would take them into Uncharted Territory they had decided to make them from brillium a rare metal that behaves well at low temperatures when machined the fine particles of berylium are toxic and the metal must be worked with care a number of hexagonal blanks were brought to a uniform thickness then the rear side was hollowed out to reduce weight leaving a rib structure that maintains stiffness brillium is lighter than aluminium yet stronger than steel Tinsley Laboratories the company that fabricated the corrective Optics which saved the Hubble Space Telescope was given the job of providing the optical finish to the mirror segments designers knew the Precision curve would change when the mirrors were brought to their cryogenic operating temperatures so the grinding and polishing process was carried out in two stages after their initial polishing the first batch of mirror segments was sent to the Marshall space flight center for testing in the X-ray and cryogenic facility all air was removed from the chamber and the mirrors chilled to 40° Kelvin testing of the individual segments resulted in a hit map used back at the polishing laboratory to refine the segment accurate at its deep space [Music] temperature the testing lasts around 10 weeks the individual mirror segments were then polished to their final curves while the primary mirror consists of 18 different segments these are made up to just three different specifications the a segments the B segments and the C segments depending on on their position in the layout the finished hexagons must then be individually cleaned before getting a final surface layer Less Than 3 G of pure gold will cover the face of the segment via vacuum deposition a process that takes about an hour the final gold layer less than 1,000 the thickness of a human hair provides maximum infrared reflectivity several other mirrors not part of the large primary array are crucial to the telescope functioning the convex secondary mirror sits at the focus of the primary array and directs light down to the tertiary mirror inside the shielded structure at the center of the large array finally an optically flat fine steering mirror also within the central structure directs light to the instruments before the finished mirrors could be integrated with the other parts of the telescope there was one final test a 3axis sign vibration test would verify that the mirror could survive the rigers of launch short bursts of vibration at varying frequencies duplicated the environment a satellite experience es during the early phases of flight on an Aran [Music] 5 it had taken 11 years for all the mirrors plus spares to be completed another major challenge was the folding back plane structure that would support the mirrors and most of the scientific Hardware a simplified Pathfinder unit was constructed first every part of the fabrication handling and testing would be practiced on this item before the final flight back plane became available and Lessons Learned with this unit would inform the way Engineers would handle the flight article two spare primary mirrors were fitted to the Pathfinder as well as the spare secondary mirror designers needed to know how the Optics would behave at cryogenic temperatures in the 1960s NASA had constructed chamber a a thermal vacuum chamber big enough to hold the Apollo command and service module this is where the optical telescope element of the web was to be tested but it needed a serious upgrade before that could happen the area outside the big door was made into a clean room and contamination from lubricants present in the chamber was expunged the refrigeration unit was replaced with a new system that could chill to 35° [Music] Kelvin when the James web Space Telescope left the Earth solar panel and its dish antenni were rapidly deployed this gave it power to function and the ability to communicate with the ground by the end of the sixth day web sun shield was fully unfilled allow allowing the Shaded side of the craft to begin Cooling in the vacuum of space Plastics lubricants epoxies and other materials begin to out gas this release of constituent molecules can settle on and degrade Optical surfaces outgassing diminishes rapidly as the craft cools and the timing of the telescope deployment was largely based upon results observed in chamber a at the John Space Center early in 2015 chamber a had been fitted with Optical test equipment ready for the first exercises in aligning several mirror segments under simulated deep space conditions at several places inside the chamber sheets with a molecular absorbing coating known as Mac panels had been fitted these are designed to capture outgassing contaminants that cannot be eliminated from the chamber two separate series of optical Pathfinder tests were made with this configuration a third thermal test was conducted on the Pathfinder fitted with two spare mirrors and a set of dummy aluminium blanks to duplicate the thermal mass of the flight telescope these tests each lasted months in January 2007 nine of the 10 pioneering Technologies being developed for the jwst passed a critical design review the cryogenic cooler required by the mid infrared instrument passed 3 months later but the project was behind schedule and over budget around this time the public became dimly aware of the James web Space Telescope because its famed predecessor Hubble was in grave trouble it was feared that space-based observations would go black until the jwst was launched after the Colombia broke up during re-entry with the loss of all crew the space shuttle was only permitted to fly to the International Space Station Hubble designed to be serviced on orbit was no longer Within Reach of the shuttle the Aging telescopes much needed final upgrade had been cancelled public pressure and intense lobbying from Congress caused the NASA administrator Michael Griffin to reconsider we are going to add a shuttle servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope to the shuttle be flown before it [Music] retires it was a popular decision but it took a while to happen as the space shuttle Atlantis was being prepared for launch in September 2008 the hubbles science instrument command and data handling unit [Music] failed so important was this unit that the flight was suspended for 8 months while a replacement unit was prepared and and Mission Specialists could be trained for the extra task tus 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 and lift off of space shuttle Atlantis a final visit to enhance the vision of Hubble into the deepest grer of our universe Atlantis finally lifted off in May 2009 the repair mission was a success but it would be the last any subsequent breakdowns could mean that Hubble would go dark this added pressure to the team building the jwst Deep In Space there could be no missions to repair it so this extremely complex new telescope had to be flawless the idea that there would be a seamless Handover from Hubble to James web was also less certain as slow progress meant the launch date had now slipped to 2015 with the acknowledgement that it could slide further soon funds from other NASA projects were being diverted to keep the observatory afloat and James Webb was being referred to as the telescope that ate astronomy in 2010 the US president visited the Kennedy Space Center we start by increasing NASA budget by $6 billion over the next 5 years by doing that we will ramp up robotic exploration of the solar system including a probe of the sun atmosphere new scouting mission to Mars and other destinations and an advanced telescope to follow Hubble allowing us to peer deeper into the universe than ever before work continued on the telescope and while there was relief among the James web team at Nasa political scrutiny of the way in which the space agency managed such elaborate one-off projects became intense in July 2011 11 the US House of Representatives Appropriations Committee on Commerce Justice and science moved to cut NASA funding effectively killing off the jwst the committee issued a statement saying the program is billions of dollars over budget and played by poor management ultimately the move was blocked but an $8 billion cost cap was set so much had already been invested in the project and politicians were reminded that the very popular Hubble had met similar resistance during its development it thought to build this amazing telescope partly because we never built one before like it it is enormous the sun shade that we have to build is as big as a tennis court it has to be folded up really small so when we get it up there it can unfold properly in outer space we have to rehearse and practice uh and we have to find those little mistakes that people always make and fix them so it difficult but it astronomers and Engineers were happy that the James web project had survived this would not be the last political obstacle that NASA and its contractors would [Music] face toward the end of 2015 almost all the web spacecrafts components existed as separate pieces in different locations with the arrival of the fully tested back plane structure at Nasa godard Maryland final assembly of the optical portion could begin the sunshield and propulsion elements were being assembled at Northrop grumman Beach in California at Nasa Godard a large jig had been constructed in the clean room to cradle the mirror array as it was being integrated the back plane was one of the new technologies that had to prove itself before final work on the telescope could begin it had to be light strong and stable to nanometer scale at 50° Kelvin the lightweight mirrors were another new technology that went through exhaustive verification before final assembly while each mirror segment has been delicately machined down to just 20 kg an actuator fitted to its back doubles that weight a centrally located motor attached to rods stretching to the corners of the mirror can change the curvature of the individual segment while six more Motors can adjust the tilt of the segment along three axes once ins space and after the complete structure has been deployed Engineers Will Wait approximately 40 days until the telescope has cooled to its operational temperature they will then begin aligning or phasing the telescope primary mirror segments via the [Music] actuators the segments can be moved in increments approaching 1 billionth of a meter after pointing the jwst at a bright star its near infrared camera will be used to ascertain how much each mirror segment will need to be shifted so that the individual Parts can function together as a whole [Music] mirror after the phasing of the primary mirror segments the small secondary mirror must be aligned then the tertiary then the four science [Music] instruments fine-tuning using the near infrared spectr graph can be done with exquisite accuracy the initial alignment is expected to take several months and when the telescope is making observations it will be checked regularly for a telescope to function with such Precision in deep space its assembly had had to be carried out with equal Precision a robotic arm known as the primary mirror alignment and integration fixture can position each segment with an accuracy measured in fractions of a millimeter a team working below the back plane use a laser to judge the exact position of each mirror segment before fixing it in place and then connecting the actuator it took several months to attach all 18 mirrors the Integrated Science instrument module or isim houses the web fine guidance sensor before it could be United with the telescope it had to be subjected to the extreme stresses it would experience during launch so it was brought to NASA godard centrifuge [Music] during the test it was exposed to forces seven times greater than gravitation here on Earth the lightweight structure passed with flying colors and was fitted with its cameras spectrographs and Associated Electronics now the whole unit needed testing just like every other piece of the web Observatory the isim had to be subjected to extremes of cold as well as jutting vibrations before it could be United with the mirror array the instrument module went through three separate sessions in godard simulator this replicates the same cold vacuum environment as chamber a at the Johnson Space Center but it is smaller this chamber entered service in 1964 for testing satellites in very hot and very cold conditions a helium shroud had been added to duplicate the extreme cold at which web must function the space environment simulator is like a giant pressure cooker with a lid that fastens at the top during the first test there were problems the layered semiconductors that make up the infrared detectors expanded and cracked with the extreme temperatures NASA and its Consortium Partners had to redesign these crucial components rapidly or risk adding yet more delay to the project back in the clean room new detectors were fitted in all three near infrared instruments and were proven reliable during the final cryogenic test another problem arose during the the shake test of the instrument module one of the new technologies developed for the web is the micro shutter assembly it 250,000 small doors each about twice the diameter of a human hair used in conjunction with the spectrometer the micro shutters allow researchers to sample individually selected astronomical targets each tiny door can be opened magnetic Ally but the early version of the micro shutter array did not survive the shake tests and also had to be [Music] redesigned the isim is sometimes referred to as the payload this is the brain of the telescope converting light from the mirrors into Data that can be transmitted back to [Music] Earth it was delicately positioned behind the primary mirror array and by November 2016 the telescope structure was complete but before it could be United with the spacecraft element again there would be more [Music] testing this was the first time that the telescope had to be moved as a single unit it had taken shape in NASA godard clean room and while a special traveling case had been built for it the telescope the clean room would be just down the corridor to the vibration testing facility to see how it behaved under launch [Music] [Applause] [Music] conditions it was protected from contaminants by a plastic tent the web telescope tent and all was lifted onto a shake table and fitted with monitors tests began in December 2016 but anomalous sensor readings led to an automatic shutdown it took experts a while to understand that small motions in the launch restraint mechanisms for one of the folded mirror Wings had happened because the restraint latch had not been closed properly it was a valuable lesson for the team and testing procedures were modified coming to a successful conclusion the following month the next test required the web telescope to make its first journey to do this a specialist group of Engineers packed the telescope in its launch configuration into a plastic shroud to provide an added layer of protection this in turn was encased in the custombuilt Stars container stars is one of those peculiar acronyms of which NASA is so fond it Telescope transporter for air Road and sea in May 2017 the telescope was on its way to Houston Texas and NASA Space Center for for testing in chamber a 2 years previously this transport and testing procedure had been pioneered by the Pathfinder unit that had allowed technicians and Engineers to learn the problems they would encounter with the flight [Music] article at the Johnson Space Center the Stars container was wheeled into the the newly created clean room adjacent to chamber a while this clean room is Big there is only just enough room to unpack the telescope and to configure it for the cryogenic testing the telescope had to be mounted upon a large steel platform which slid upon rails also mounted on the platform were the various pieces of the telescope though this is the biggest thermal vacuum chamber in the world there was just enough room for the deployed telescope once inside the chamber it was suspended from six steel rods that isolate the unit it from vibration caused by Refrigeration tubing and vacuum pumps the internal helium shroud was another modification to chamber a by passing liquid helium through the tubing within the Shroud the jwst can be cooled to the temperatures it will experience in space it was July 2017 and it had taken the engineers more than 2 months to prepare the telescope for these tests a team from NASA Johnson operated the chamber while Engineers from NASA Godard conducted the tests everyone it took close to a week to evacuate the chamber and a further 30 days to bring everything inside down to 40° Kelvin I as the telescope was nearing the required temperature Hurrican Harvey hit the Texas coast though it degraded to a tropical storm it lingered over Houston flooding some areas NASA staff stayed with the telescope around the clock to make sure that the tests were not disrupted the two main areas of Interest were the ability of the individual segments to be aligned and perform as a single giant mirror and for the telescope images that they were receiving everything functioned as intended and by late September 2017 the team began allowing the telescope to return to room temperature after 93 days the door was reopened and the web telescope began preparation for its next Journey at the Northrup Grumman facility at Rondo Beach just outside Los Angeles the spacecraft element of the observatory had been taking shape independently of the telescope element but problems with the sun shield had led to delays rips in the capton layers and difficulties with the cables designed to tension The Shield needed more time to resolve managers had decided to delay bringing the telescope element to California for final integration while technicians at Rondo Beach fixed the problem hold that just lost a cable the telescope had been scheduled for a clean at Northrop Grumman but this now happened at NASA Johnson where there was more space for the painstaking examination of the individual segments the delays had eaten into the reserve schedule and the launch date had been postponed several more times with planners settling for March 2021 another big problem was the budget in 2011 Congress had set an $8 billion ceiling on the project and it was now clear that this could not be met in February 2018 the telescope element arrived at the Redondo Beach facility this was the first time that all pieces of the James web Observatory had been in the same room the remaining work involved the uniting of the telescope element with the spacecraft element followed by yet more testing however there would be no more testing at low temperatures with the two halves of the observatory required to to function in such different thermal environments this was not possible the sunshield continued giving problems to avoid the risk of snags a decision was made just to tighten the Locking nuts on the Fasteners till they were flush with their bolts as work proceeded NASA set up an independent review board to assess progress on the web telescope and its ballooning cost the was sympathetic to the problems associated with building a one-off instrument of such complexity but they were critical of human error that resulted in costly delays the wrong solvent was used to clean spacecraft propulsion Valves and improper test wiring meant excess voltage damaged several transducers The Cost Plus nature of the agreement signed with contractor Northrop Grumman saw no disincentive for these mistakes which could be seen as a conflict of interest but work on the James web Space Telescope was so Advanced and so much money had already been committed that there was no danger of Congress withholding funding for the remainder of the work the spacecraft was folded into its launch configuration and then several practice deployments were executed uted it is impossible to duplicate the zero gravity environment present when these deployments are made in space so support cables and counterbalances were connected to the moving parts to approximate weightlessness the sun shield was deployed and it appeared to be working well but then there was the inevitable testing the craft was folded up encased in another plastic tent to protect against contamination and moved to Northrop grumman facility now the complete structure was subjected to the heavy vibration it would experience during launch back in the clean room technici discovered that dozens of bolts had shaken loose and it took the team 3 weeks to locate each part some lodged deep within the telescope structure this incident was also included in the report of the independent review board it concluded that NASA had a culture of optimism and that conforming to a budget was not how the space agency judged success it was argued that since its early years during the Apollo program this culture had taken hold at Nasa then Money Was No Object beating the Russians was the overwhelming public support for Apollo made it easy for politicians to keep signing the checks everyone is aware that the telescope had be named in honor of James web who governed NASA at that time today projects like web tend to starve other programs of resources the Nancy Roman telescope is a planned wide field highdefinition survey telescope able to complement web observations components are being fabricated but the telescope exists only as an animation the problem of Fasteners parting comp with the sun shield was resolved by tightening 570 nuts to a new torque specification and was verified with more Shake tests this had not been a serious delay but with the onset of the Corona virus pandemic in 20120 the launch date slipped again to no earlier than October the 31st 2021 now a new issue arose the Aran 5 that launches the jwst to orbit had been returning data about excessive vibration happening when the fairing was jettisoned while the two launches that showed this data successfully deployed their payloads NASA was worried what this might do to the web of shielding the Aran 5 is a tried and tested rocket with an enviable safety record which makes it ideal for a very expensive spacecraft like the web telescope but the European Space Agency is about to replace it with the Aran 6 Swiss company ruag which makes the fairings for the Aran has started providing new Aran 6 fairings for the remaining Aran 5 launchers a fairing is fitted with valves that gradually release Air as the rocket Rises through the atmosphere but it seemed that there was residual pressure in the payad space when the fairing was ejected Engineers building the web thought that air trapped within the layers could damage the shield with the sudden drop in pressure changes were made to the Fairing and there were two Arion 5 launches before Webb was due to fly that allowed technicians to be certain that the new fairing was behaving properly the final major testing happened over 17 consecutive days the comprehensive systems test had all electrical system systems working as if the telescope was operational more than 1,000 scripts or sequences of instructions were executed and software amendments were sent and verified the telescope was even connected to the deep space Network as it will be when it clean room in California looked quiet staff at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore were busy making certain that all systems were working harmoniously the telescope Builders were now confident that the largest most complex Space Telescope yet made was functioning as expected but there remained doubters who felt its complexity was a problem Thomas Young chair of the independent review board cited 307 single point failure items a malfunction in any one would Doom the mission by contrast the recent Mars rovers had 75 single point failure items yet they were still seen as high-risk missions both curiosity and perseverance landed successfully and are fully functional to this day the board made 32 recommendations for actions that NASA could take to minimize failure and the agency accepted all of them when the final testing of the telescope had been completed it was prepared for shipping to Kuru a shroud of secrecy was drawn around the schedule for transporting the jwst mission planners worried that such an expensive piece of Hardware might attract hostile intent it was only after the event that pictures of its Passage through Los Angeles were released [Music] inside its special container the telescope had been fitted with a series of shock detectors to determine whether in transit it had received inadvertent jolting web complete with the truck that hauled it was loaded into the MN cbri for its final Journey to the European space agency French Guyana [Music] the shallow Kuru River at parako had been specially drenched and the ship arrived at high tide to ensure there were no surprises the web telescope is the single most valuable payload that the Aran 5 will launch and everyone at the space complex was aware of the significance of this [Music] Mission several months earlier components for the web also arrived by ship to cover the last 3 km of the journey behind a similar truck roughly 55 days had been allowed to prepare the telescope and its launcher once back inside a clean room the telescope was unboxed and brought to the vertical it was m to the launch vehicle adapter that ultimately connects to the aran tension band maintains the connection till it is in space and ready to be set loose but the band malfunctioned sending a jolt through the telescope this delayed the launch by 4 days while technicians looked for damage meanwhile various parts of the Aran 5 were converging on the Aran assembly facility while the rocket is essentially a standard Aran 5 the upper stage has been been modified to carry out a gradual rolling maneuver to protect web solar radiation after its preparation web was moved to a separate facility for fueling the telescope needs its own propulsion system to adjust its orbit around the second sun earth lran point and to facilitate accurate targeting fueling is a Precision exercise as the hydren and nitrogen tetroxide propellants are extreme ly toxic next the telescope was moved via a mobile clean room to be M with the Aran 5 while the James web Space Telescope weighs less than Hubble it occupies more space mechanical handling of the telescope called for great delicacy as clearances were narrow clean room conditions were maintained throughout the stacking procedure to protect the exposed mirror [Music] segments connection to the upper stage was [Music] straightforward the large fairing was now fitted with 24 pressure release valves to make certain that early problems with residual pressure when the fairing is jettisoned had been eliminated laser guide devices had been introduced for the encapsulation procedure to monitor the fine clearances a minor communication problem between the telescope and the rocket delayed the launch by several more days but finally on Christmas morning in 2021 the countdown was nearing completion [Music] no one knows what it will discover but astronomers have high expectations [Music]	Success
The Precision Behind Satellite Launches | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAvFbuS42v4	SLICE Science	[Music] of modern science is linked to Humanity the planets and the way they [Music] move Newton building on the work of cicus Kepler and Galileo was able to demonstrate mathematically the orbits that the planets [Music] followed the sun and the planets did not orbit the earth and orbits were generally elliptical rather than circular using the newly developed calculus astronomers were now able to accurately predict eclipses and transits it became clear that comets were small objects traveling in highly elliptical orbits in 1772 lrange predicted that smaller bodies could be trapped at very precise locations near much larger planets more than 100 years later Trojan asteroids were discovered sharing Jupiter orbit in the 19th and early 20th century several mathematicians working independently had calculated exactly how fast a body would have to travel to break free of the Earth into orbit but these were exercises in theory in the 1950s the Soviet Union and America had become very interested Ed in missile technology at the end of the second world war both countries had salvaged what they could of the remaining German V2 rockets and began duplicating the technology these were the early days of the Cold War an interest in Rockets had nothing to do with space the superpowers wanted missiles for military purposes the V2 had a range of around 300 km and it followed a ballistic trajectory but military leaders wanted greater range a different team from California jet propulsion laboratory had been commissioned by the US Army to repurpose a small scientific rocket as a battlefield weapon at this time the Army was thinking of missiles as a new type of artillery but jpl Corporal proved practical for field [Music] use in 1948 Major General hulga toftoy a driving force behind the American V2 program decided that the big German rocket could be tipped by the smaller wack Corporal to make the first two-stage rocket known as the bumper program it launched eight Rockets with mixed success [Music] there were problems getting the upper stage to fire yet when everything worked it set a new altitude record of 400 km although this was well beyond the atmosphere its up and down trajectory meant it could not orbit just like the Americans the Russians began by mastering the V2 and then scaling it up the R1 and R2 missiles were stretched versions of the V2 the Soviets were also experimenting with multiple stages the R7 was a radical departure from previous designs the difficulties associated with igniting a second stage in Flight were eliminated by clustering four boosters around a core stage with all engines igniting on the ground [Music] the R7 was the first intercontinental ballistic missile and while it could deliver a nuclear warhead with reasonable accuracy its liquid fuel meant it required extended preparation making it vulnerable to attack as a weapon it was of limited value [Music] [Music] it began testing in 1957 but problems with the boosters had to be corrected before a successful launch in August 1957 in the early 1950s America longrange nuclear capability relied on Air Force bombers like the b36 and the B52 the Army had focused on short range Weaponry but their V2 team now working in the Army ballistic missile agency had developed the intermediate range Redstone missile though it was much smaller than the soviet designed for a nuclear [Music] warhead the the US Navy was also developing a rocket not as a weapon but for purely research purposes known as Vanguard it used an arobe second stage and a viking lower [Music] stage because it had no military application this rocket was favored by US President Eisenhower to carry a satellite to orbit as part of the international geophysical year since since 1955 Eisenhower had called for an open Skies policy where reconnaissance aircraft could freely collect information about an adversary military installations this had been flatly rejected by Soviet leader Nikita Kristof concern in the US Administration was that the Russians would regard the overflight of satellites in the same way as aircraft then came a surprise although the Soviet Union had also declared its intention to launch a satellite for the international geophysical year few in the United States have taken this seriously on the fourth of October 1957 the Russians launched the first artificial satellite it was an 83 kg sphere called Sputnik its purpose was to prove that it could be done and to prove to the rest of the world that it had been done Sputnik carried a radio transmitter its distinctive beeping was easily picked up by amateur radio operators Sputnik was meant to fly in a highly elliptical orbit but a fuel regulator had malfunctioned 16 seconds after launch resulting in extra thrust and an early engine shutdown it was not not the flight path intended but this was of little significance as long as people around the world could hear it the only data it returned was via the duration of the beeps coded to indicate temperature and pressure within its sphere while its 83 kg Mass was much heavier than the Americans could launch its components were heavy too sputnik dual radio transmitters relied on power hungry vacuum tubes which needed a cooling f and three bulky silver zinc batteries it the equator took it across the world populated areas including the United States Americans were stunned that the Soviet Union had the ability to orbit a spacecraft and they expected their government to respond President Eisenhower reassures the nation that Russia first satellite does not indicate a serious lag in American rocket research I consider our country satellite program to be welld designed and properly scheduled to achieve the scientific purposes for which it was initiated we are therefore carrying the program forward in keeping with our arrangements with the international scientific community Vanguard for the reasons indicated has not had equal priority without accorded our ballistic missile work Eisenhower invited the non-military Vanguard team to launch America completely sidelining the more advanced Redstone [Music] program working with JPL the US Army had added solid fueled upper stages to the Redstone to boost the Warhead beyond the atmosphere called project Orbiter both the Army and JPL understood that this tested configuration could easily reach orbit JPL was and remains a branch of Caltech the California Institute of Technology their team had far more enthusiasm for scientific research than it did for weaponry and without authorization they quietly designed and built a research satellite [Music] but the next orbital flight was again made by Russia with a dog called Leica Sputnik 2 was a much larger craft it had a life support system and an array of monitoring instruments it would only return data for 10 minutes of each orbit saving battery power when Ground receivers were out of [Music] range it launched on an improved approved version of the R7 in November 1957 unfortunately Leica died when her capsule overheated after several [Music] orbits after this second unmatched Russian space flight there was more Jubilation across the Soviet Union but Americans were getting impatient with their president response the mere fact that this thing orbits involves no Duty Discovery to science they knew it could be done at least they say so and they had for a long time so that it imposes no additional threat to the United finally in December 1957 Vanguard had its chance and Americans were watching it livek test vehicle 3 was a spherical satellite weighing less than 2 kg it was transistorized and designed to return data about its thermal Behavior 7 6 5 4 3 2 one ignition LIF off it was a humiliation and it heightened fears within the American public that they were technically inferior and [Music] vulnerable almost immediately the Redstone group was authorized to launch a satellite and they were given just 90 days to achieve it the upper stages built by JPL are known as the tub had no independent guidance system while the rocket now called the Jupiter C was guided after the tub separated it would rely upon spin to continue along its line there was no time to develop a more sophisticated system satellite Alpha was equipped to investigate the radiation environment beyond the atmosphere and it was able to register impacts from microm meteors physicist James Van Allen had been working with sounding rockets and was Keen to provide an experimental package to go into orbit early in 1958 the Jupiter C was being Reed all military personnel associated with the mission remained at Cape Canaveral 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 2 1 bye command the launch was perfect 8 minutes later Explorer 1 reached orbit but at the time no one knew the first tracking station it would encounter was in California at the designated time there was no sign of the satellite it was far more eccentric than intended like the Russian craft before it departures from the expected flight path were of minor importance the fact that the satellite was in orbit was enough initially readings from explorers gy counter seemed random until it was understood that they varied with altitude James Van Allen realized that concentrations of radiation encircled the Earth they were named the Van Allen belts and the orbital anomalies of Explorer 1 had significantly aided their Discovery a successful American launch to orbit marked the end of the first round in what was already being called the Space Race a competition fueled by Mutual distrust and fears of nuclear attack in the US a crash program to match the Soviet R7 was already underway the atlas concept began testing in 1957 its lightweight propellant tanks were also the Rocket needed pressure in the tanks to stop it collapsing at the time us leaders talked about the missile gap an overwhelming belief that Democratic America was far behind its common adversary while it was clear that the Soviet Union had an advantage in heavy lift capability it was less obvious that the US had far more advanced electronics and much deeper Pockets she goes it took time to perfect the atlas but eventually it was deployed with nuclear capability but its liquid fuel gave it the same drawbacks as Russia seven in 1958 NASA the civilian space agency was established rapidly recruiting seven test pilots for its man space flight program instantly these men now called astronauts were Front Page News the same year the Soviet space effort recruited 20 cosmonauts but this was a more secret [Music] exercise there were secret plans taking shape in the United States too President Eisenhower set up ARA the advanced research projects agency intended to push the boundaries of science for possible military applications it was generously funded up until 1959 the United States succeeded with 25 satellites and a further 17 failures most of America flights were made by early spy satellites as part of the corona program which received very little publicity in the same period the Soviet Union successfully launched five satellites in 1960 President Eisenhower accelerated the corona program developing veent satellites they were called discover emissions pretending to be scientific investigators the true nature of the corona program remained secret until 1992 a collaboration between the US Air Force and the CIA Five series of these Satellites with a KH designation were [Music] developed they were the first spacecraft to have stabilization in three axes rather than being spin stabilized or just tumbling aimlessly the later series had an engine that could be restarted in [Music] orbit launched from the vandenbberg Air Force Base in California they were the first satellites to be put into North South or polar orbits a set of rules emerged for launching to Earth orbit they were prompted by the rigid laws of physics and concern about the neighbors a launch site close to the equator allowed the rocket to benefit from the Earth launched to the east the Soviet Union chose a site at dur in a sparsely populated region of Kazakhstan 46° north of the equator that is now known as the bonura cosmodrome the United States adapted the Atlantic Missile Range at Cape Canaveral Florida just 28° north of the equator both these sites remain in use today give gimballing engine Bells allow a rocket to follow a precise course yet the path to orbit is complex it will differ according to the intended orbit the type of launcher and the kind of [Music] payload initially a launcher will rise vertically to clear the denser regions of the atmosphere and reduce drag before it begins to pitch over pitching in an easterly direction will save on fuel however other factors must be considered following a due east heading will only result in a due east orbit if a rocket launches from the equator otherwise it will follow a path that has the center of the earth as its focus and its angle to the equator will be the same as the degree of latitude of its launching Point launching due east from Cape Canaveral see is the rocket heading Southeast over island nations it is not acceptable to drop stages along this [Music] line by launching from the cape on a more Northerly course a rocket will have nothing but ocean below it until well after its payload has reached [Music] orbit from boner Russian Rockets have a narrower northeasterly path above Wilderness that they must follow an orbital incline of 51.5 De is standard for orbits launched from this site there are designated Drop Zones for the stages which are kept clear at launch times since the breakup of the Soviet Union Russia has had to lease this site from the kazak government okay we free in the 1970s both Russia and America became interested in orbiting space stations the US with Skylab and Russia with a series of salute missions lack of in soon put an end to Skylab but the Russians continued AC crewing experience in long duration space missions in 1986 the Soviet Union launched the first piece of the miria space station and the first crew took up residence a month later new modules continued to be fed to orbit on the heavy lift proton rocket in 1988 the European Space Agency began collaborating with the Soviet space agency starting with French cosmina Jean L cran arriving for a 22-day surgeon in November NASA had plans for its own space station one of the primary design requirements of the Space Shuttle was the lifting and assembling of an orbiting research platform the concept became known as space station freedom but again us politicians would not release the funds the Soviets also had plans for a bigger better Mir 2 and had begun building modules but after the dissolution of the Soviet Union the new Russian Federation had its own budgetary problems in 1994 NASA saw an opportunity and began working with the Mia program a port was fitted to Mia to allow the shuttle to dock Russian cosmonauts began riding to orbit on the shuttle and American astronauts began working on board Mir the United States began learning about building and maintaining a long-term presence in space and the extra funding allowed Russia to continue its Mir program in 1997 a progress cargo craft collided Ed with the space station raising concerns about safety aboard Mia and NASA and Ros Cosmos began looking to a replacement space station Mia limped on for a further 2 years before it was deorbited it had been continuously occupied for close to 10 [Music] years late in 1998 a proton launcher was being prepared to deliver the first piece of a new space station it was called zarya the zarya and zvezda modules originally intended for the Mir 2 would form the nucleus of what was now known as the International Space Station a collaboration between the United States Russia Europe Japan and Canada finally the space shuttle would be used to its full potential but there was a problem while the shuttle had visited Mir in the same orbital plane as the core module of the new space station it had not fed anything like the very heavy components to this particular orbit for the shuttle being launched from the Kennedy Space Center it required a much more Northerly launch azoth to reach the steeper orbit this made more fuel and less cargo only the later versions of the shuttle were light enough for Missions to the ISS and improvements to the engines meant that when carrying a meaningful load this orbit was just feasible the launch window was much narrower for these missions with launch times being limited to just 5 minutes when the shuttle was able to make the correct orbit position on course for a 51.6 de 136 by 36 statute mile orbit to achieve Rondevu the shuttle had to lift off when its launch site crossed the orbital plane of the space station the three main engines on atlan have now been throttled down to 72% of R delays due to poor weather were frequent pass through the area of Maximum Dynamic pressure on the vehicle in the lower atmosphere usually Rondo and docking would happen 2 days after launch while the mathematics associated with his complex maneuver had been mastered the practicalities of getting a spacecraft to perform to the required Precision were pioneered in the Gemini program by 1965 the US was squarely on track for a moon landing and Gemini was tasked with perfecting orbital rendevu and docking given that early satellites often missed their expected orbits by as much as 100 kilm Rondevu was seen as a challenge future Moon missions would require rendevu in lunar orbit the new Gemini capsule was equipped with maneuvering thrusters controlled by the crew via an onboard computer the later Gemini craft were powered by fuel cells for long duration flights astronauts rode to orbit on a refinement of the Titan 2 missile it had a ground controlled radio guidance system because it was lighter and a long list of modifications to make it more reliable on Gemini 4 the second manned Gemini Mission astronauts Ed White and James MCD divit attempted to approach the spent upper stage of their Titan launcher both were experienced test pilots but by thrusting toward their target they found it became more distant the complexities of orbital mechanics required a different approach the Triumph of this mission was Ed White moon mission would require astronauts to leave their spacecraft and complete tasks in the vacuum of space that right from the spacecraft just 3 months earlier cosmina Alexa leonov had already done this and NASA was Keen to master the technique okay I out as the Gemini program progressed missions were planned that would see the launch of aena Target Vehicles equipped with Docking collars crew spent long hours in a variety of simulators practicing docking Maneuvers the nose of the Gemini craft could lock into the aena and the crew could control both craft Gemini 6 astronauts Wally Shira and Tom Stafford would be the first to attempt to Rendevous with the [Music] aena this would be a dual launch with the aena lifting off slightly more than an hour before gini [Music] I6 while the astronauts were being strapped into their capsule launch control was entering the final stages of the countdown for the aena it would launch to a 298 km cir circular orbit as it passed above the launch site after its first orbit the Gemini spacecraft would launch to a lower orbit at least that was the plan without a Target the mission was scrubbed while NASA decided what to do next a replacement of Gina would not be ready for months and NASA was in a [Music] hurry the next scheduled Mission Gemini 7 was intended to be a long duration exercise with astronauts Frank Borman and Jim Lovel orbiting for 2 weeks more than enough time for a return trip to the moon this flight would continuous planned but several days after their liftoff shirar and Stafford in what was now called Gemini 6A would launch and attempt a rendevu on December the 4th 1965 the gini i7 astronauts began their Marathon flight Gemini 6A would launch from the same pad and technicians had only 9 days to prepare for its launch the following day a new Titan 2 was moved into place and Engineers began working around the clock readying it for flight work proceeded well and the spacecraft was ready for launch on December the 12th at 9:54 just 26 seconds before gimini i7 passed over ahead for the rendevu Gemini 6A would be the active craft making all the orbital changes while Gemini 7 continued along its predictable path 6A would take a lower circular orbit and catch up on its Target from behind Gemini 6A made a perfect launch in less than 6 hours on Gemini 6a were beside each [Music] other future Gemini missions would perfect more complex and Rapid rendevu techniques but the first ever space rondu was a huge advance in orbital practice [Music] today Rondevu is a routine part of space flight the International Space Station relies upon visiting craft to replenish supplies or to exchange crew [Music] members The Sentinel 1A satellite was delivered to a sun synchronous orbit in April 2014 this is a precise polar orbit 693 kilm above the surface that takes advantage of a slight bulge at the earth plane to the east by about 1° per day its job is to observe changes in sea ice changes in land use and movement in the Earth attributes to the accuracy of its measurements it always passes above the same point on the Earth surface at the same local [Music] time its twin Sentinel 1B was delivered to this same orbit in 2016 the two Sentinels work in tandem separated by 180° while a launcher delivers its satellite as accurately as possible there is always some degree of orbital fine-tuning required its attitude control system ensures the craft holds steady to establish contact with the ground and for its solar panels to collect sunlight its orbital speed and thus its orbit altitude is adjusted via the satellite even when it path its orbit requires regular adjustment by operational staff on the [Music] ground being in a north south orbit the Sentinel satellites communicate via the polar communication Outpost in spard signals are relayed to the European space operations center in darhat and operational commands are sent via a return Loop irregularities in the earth gravitation the influence of the sun and the moon radiation pressures are random forces that will make a satellite drift low earth orbits tend to Decay through friction with the upper atmosphere and the satellite propulsion is needed to reboost its orbit a satellite how long its fuel will last and judicious use of a spacecraft propulsion and attitude Control Systems can greatly extend a satellite [Music] life one spacecraft that has no propulsion system at all is the Hubble Space Telescope the telescope Precision Optics would be contaminated by Thruster emissions to control its attitude Hubble uses electrically powered inertia Wheels it can point with an extremely high degree of accuracy the Craft drifts in a way that is not entirely predictable at an altitude of 340 km its orbital Decay is minimal [Music] when Hubble was visited by the space shuttle for regular servicing its orbit would receive a boost with the end of those missions it has been losing height but it will re-enter the Earth atmosphere launching a satellite from the European space board close to the equator in South America offers advantages for spacecraft that need to operate in geostationary orbit when a rocket launched from higher latitudes needs to deliver its payload to geostationary orbit it must use extra fuel to change its orbital plane geostationary satellites are released into an elliptical transfer orbit the satellite used to circularize the orbit at 35,7 186 km Communications and weather satellites and geostationary orbit appear to be fixed in the sky they orbit above the equator at the same rate as the Earth rotation ground stations do not need to follow a moving Target which is a huge cost-saving for commercial Comm Communications operators wether satellites are able to have a constant view of one face of the Earth again external factors will cause these orbits to drift so regular adjustments are required the international Communications industry is the most profitable area of space business and there are strict rules governing the geostationary orbits as a satellite nears the end of its life it must retain enough fuel to lift it out of this crucial orbit to what is called a graveyard orbit where it becomes space junk currently there are 562 satellites in geostationary orbit and it while an interplanetary probe may not appear to orbit anything it is still governed by the iron rules of orbital mechanics in August and September of 1977 the two Voyager probes were launched they were headed for the solar systems giant planets all of them their Titan 3E Rockets were just powerful enough to send the craft to Jupiter from there they would rely on assistance from Jupiter [Music] gravitation gravitational assist had only been done for the first time 3 years earlier when Mariner 10 used the gravitation of Venus for its flyby observations of Mercury timing of the Voyager missions was dictated by The Peculiar planetary alignment that happened in 1977 it will not happen again until 2150 trajectory designers studied 1100 different paths their two probes could follow while Mission plan has understood that it should be possible to fly past Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune there was doubt that the spacecraft could survive what would be a 12-year Journey what time was the last medium rate the two Voyager spacecraft were identical but they were given different tasks Voyager one was to focus on Jupiter and Saturn alone with great stress from Mission planners to observe Saturn the launch first would attempt to fly past of all four outer [Music] planets the ambitious Grand Tour was at the limits of the technology of the day computers on The Identical probes have less than 70 kiloby of memory the size of a modest JPEG file data is stored on an eight trck tape machine and the central processor is around 8,000 times slower than today smartphones but JPL the group that built Explorer 1 assembled the best spacecraft possible in the 1970s 3 2 1 we have ignition in a plan that confused the Press Voyager 2 launched first and we have liftoff we have liftoff of the Titan Center carrying the first of two Voyager spacecraft to extend man farther into the solar system than ever before Voyager 2 was on a slower path to Jupiter Voyager 1 launched 2 weeks later would pass its twin after 3 months it went into a heliocentric orbit at a speed relative to the sun of close to 130,000 kmph this highly elliptical trajectory would reach its high point somewhere between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn without any other influences the spacecraft would then begin falling back toward the Sun the paths of both probes were timed to take them close to Jupiter where the giant planet would accelerate the spacecraft and put them on a new orbital path towards [Music] Saturn navigation in deep space was reliant on the deep space network not just for communication with the probes but for accurate radio ranging assessment of their positions during the latter phases of the mission newer more accurate methods evolved oh this is regular refinements of the voyager through course correction instructions relayed to the craft and then executed with precision timing via the onboard [Music] clock in January 1979 Voyager 1 began sending back images of [Music] Jupiter Mission Specialists who had been waiting for more than a year were flooded with new information almost everything they saw was unexpected it was thought that would be cold and crat like our own moon but each was unique the inner Moon IO is pitted with active volcanoes spewing sulfur across the Jovian system and Europa is smooth its surface of ice is etched with peculiar lines as Voyager 2 3 months behind was approaching Jupiter trajectory Specialists were able to retarget the spacecraft for closer scrutiny of the moons precisely timed nudges from the thrusters allowed the craft to make fine alterations to its flight path when Voyager 1 was leaving Jupiter the giant planet acceler ated the craft by 36,000 kmph at Saturn researchers were stunned at the complexity of the planet and its ring [Music] system the spacecraft returned data about the planet temperature and its magnetic field the Rings were more complex than imagined and new moons were discovered [Music] observations of Titan were frustrating its thick atmosphere obscured even a glimpse of the moon surface Voyager 1 then passed beneath Saturn and curved upward above the orbital plane of the planets leaving the solar system had it failed to return information on Titan Voyager 2 would have been diverted to complete the [Music] observations Voyager 2 arrived at Saturn 9 months after its twin it would pass closer to the planet than Voyager 1 yet even from a distance of a million kilometers detail within the Rings was clear it observed changes in the brief time since Voyager 1 had visited the probe returned pictures of the moon 177,000 other images of different parts of the saturnian system then it swung behind the ringed planet losing contact with the earth when radio contact was reestablished the Voyager had increased its speed by 18,000 km hour and it was headed for Uranus it would take 4 and a half years to get there by this time Voyager 2 was showing its age its scan platform the device that accurately pointed its cameras was jamming and Engineering staff on the ground were relying upon its faulty backup radio receiver the primary unit had died with its next encounter still years away the team at JPL were able to restore the scan platform to partial functionality and they completely replaced the Voyager software at Uranus there were no swirling clouds but Voyager returned remarkable images of the planet major moons particularly Miranda which appears to have reformed after a shattering impact the Voyager had discovered 11 unknown moons and two new rings and it was now headed toward Neptune Neptune was a natural Target for investigation but it is the only large moon in the solar system to orbit in the opposite direction to its planet rotation a retrograde orbit in addition Triton steep angle to Neptune equator in February 1988 a command was sent for the longest course correction of the mission still 18 months away from Neptune Voyager 2 fired its thrusters for 2 hours and 33 minutes it would allow Mission scientists a close look at Triton in June 1989 the Voyager began its observations of Neptune [Music] it has long narrow clouds and winds that blow at 2,000 kmph a dark spot believed to be a storm was observed at closest approach the probe flew over Neptune looping down towards Triton after a journey of more than 12 years Voyager 2 would capture images of the last body in the solar system here was a moon like no other rather than forming at the same time as Neptune Triton must have been a Wanderer captured by the planet there were very few craters and its surface features are diverse and relatively Young as researchers piece together the data sent back by Voyager 2 they realized the Frozen moon was geologically active gers were spewing material into Triton atmosphere Voyager discovered the diversity of the solar system which really told us that the solar system is alive the objects in the solar system have evolved and are continuing to evolve and I think for a science team that was a a unique experience which will be the highlight for many of the careers of the of the Voyager scientists the orbits and trajectories plotted for today to grow more complex as propulsion technology evolves and as the knowledge of Paths of planets and their moons becomes more detailed with scientists and Engineers continuing to build upon more than 50 years of experience [Music]	Success
Why We Ignore Climate Change | SLICE SCIENCE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uc-E68vghD0	SLICE Science	[Music] 10 years ago fewer than one out of two people said they warming today 2/3 of the world population consider it a [Music] threat in Great Britain France and Germany 3/4 of the population say they feel concerned climate has become a major preoccupation but the the latest surveys reveal that one out of three people on Earth remain skeptical about the man-made origins of climate change among them are some highly influential political figures global warming and that a lot of it it no no I don [Music] it these official declarations are undeniably dictated by financial and economic interests but despite scientific evidence 100 million Americans and 70 million Europeans today sincerely doubt the element of human responsibility in global warming how can we explain this reluctance to acknowledge what is so obvious fatal sharot a researcher in Neuroscience it has to do with the way our brain processes information in fact without realizing it we to ignoring messages that go against our beliefs psychologists call this confirmation bias if I think that vaccines are very um effective um and I read an article suggesting that it is that will make me more confident but if I read an article saying that it dismiss it as you know not good um science 50 years of research that show that this confirmation bias plays a role in almost every important realm of our lives in an online study involving hundreds of people tally shared showed that for someone who doesn climate change a warning message does not have the same effect on their brain as it does on the brain of someone who does we ask people first of all about their views about climate change so we asked them different questions about do you support the Paris agreement and so on based on those questions we divided them into those that were a Believers that climate change is real and is manmade and those that are a bit skeptical participants were then asked to give their own personal evaluation of global warming unsurprisingly those who believe in climate change predict a greater rise in temperature than climate change Skeptics but then tally sharot announced something to participants scientists have re-evaluated the data and concluded that situation is much much worse than they fought before and the temperature would rise up to 11° in the next 100 years the goal of the experiment was to evaluate how the two groups process this new bit of information what we found was that those individuals that already believed that climate change was happening they really tooken that information into account and they upped their temperature estimate right so now they believe things are worse than they did before on the other hand those that were skeptical to begin with disregarded this information and didn estimate much without realizing it we all practice this selective [Music] thinking information that reinforces our convictions is treated with utmost attention information that goes against our beliefs go straight into the bin but what really happens in our brain to make us so disinclined to change our minds to understand this unconscious process Andreas kappus at City University of London went about trying to catch on neurons in the act of confirmation [Music] bias to do so Andreas carried out an experiment on pairs of volunteers [Music] you houses it their actual value is more or less than the price you see for each estimation you can bet an amount of money a large sum if you sure of yourself and if you aren can lower the bet the amount of the bet is a way of measuring the subject confident they feel about their choice that bet everything M that lower my bet the next stage of the experiment takes place in a brain scan room equipped with two scanners ladies and gentlemen you going to reassess your evaluations but this time you can compare them with those of your partner and change your own should you so wish the result when the assessments correspond the participants gain confidence and generally increase their bet on the other hand when the assessments differ they each ignore the other bet confirmation bias in action here here we see confirmation bias at work oh here happens in the brain after a test subject learns that their partner shares their opinion the brain specifically treats the information offered by their partner this part of the CeX is known for its involvement in complex decision making on this side we have an entirely different image we see what happens in the brain when my partner contradicts me when his opinion differs from mine and what we notice is that we see practically nothing not much happens in the brain it doesn information the partner offers therefore opinion does not change metaphorically speaking it looked like the brain was shutting down and it wasn from the disagreeing partner so what this shows is that people are more likely to take information evidence whether it to what their believe and that makes them a little bit more extreme right they become more and more extreme more and more confident and it causes polarization this functioning that is deeply anchored in our brain explains how hard it is for all of us to change our minds and obviously raises questions about the best way to communicate about the climate when you try to convince someone that climate change is something we need to take seriously it that if you offend them by saying you wrong I point you them what you need to do is find some common ground something you both agree on so that their brain stays engaged and they can actually listen to [Music] [Applause] you the polarization of opinions on global warming is at the heart of psychology Professor Stephan wowski [Music] studies in Brussels Stefan works with the research center of the European commission to understand how digital Technologies maintain and increase doubt on climate [Music] change a 100 years ago if you were living in a village in France somewhere and you thought the Earth was flat everybody would look at you around you and say well who what guy hahaa now today you go on Facebook and you say the Earth is flat and guess what from somewhere around the world there people who believe this none of these people would ever find anybody else in their neighborhood who shares their belief but online they can meet so what is the role of the internet in climate change denial how does it influence people opinions we know from a lot lot of research in Psychology that people hold on to a belief to the extent that they think it everybody else thinks the Earth is flat then you that belief because I can say hey what are you talking about all my friends agree with me and that is one thing that the internet has enabled stepan carried out a study on the comments posted on serious official science websites that discuss climate change comments that are often negative and far-fetched [Music] the planet hasn years sorry mate most of the warmest years on record have occurred in the last decade the climate has changed before yet we will be just fine in the fullness of time yes except Miami will be under water we call them zombie arguments because they horror movies you know you keep killing them but they keep coming back these easily disproven comments nevertheless present a fundamental problem they have a psychological impact a questionnaire submitted to 400 participants revealed that they discredit the information published when people are exposed to comments like that they get the mistaken perception that everybody is denying climate change and that then shifts their attitude so the fact that these comments are out there has a measurable effect by the way it functions the internet influences opinions the web has thus become the object of special attention notably after important announcements concerning climate change like Donald Trump 2017 in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate Accord his announcement generated 6 million tweets a quarter of those turned out to be produced by automated Bots for the most part favorable to Donald Trump in the digital world your opinion isn only easily influenced it manipulated human beings are susceptible to the perception of the prevalence of other people reason it must be very concerning that uh there is a huge amount of disinformation about climate change out there in his report to the European commission to fight against organized manipulation Stefan lowski recommends forcing online platforms to identify and block fake personal profiles that bias opinion in the climate debate for those who are aware of the climate emergency The NeverEnding debate without things ever really changing is hard to accept but it anxiety in ouria where nonprofits are highly active in the ecological transition overall inertia as well as the difficulty of upholding one commitments are topics that often arise in discussions two years ago two of my friends are getting married so that meant Bachelor parties our group of friends finally decided all together okay let other in Glasgow in reality you go for two or three days so you take a plane obviously that goes completely against what I know and what I do my job my commitment and all but in the end it didn long to decide thinking well no I going with them I set up verm compost and all so I find positive good things but I know that I do shitty things alongside that and when my 5-year-old comes home from school and says Dad is it good for the planet if we do it like that I go you that there are kids who for example start crying at home because they see their mom come home with a I don let and plastic bottles there between what I learned and the lifestyle I in among young children these contradictions provoke a blend of distress and anger a 14-year-old teenager I was talking to said to me rather aggressively at any rate you wreck the planet I can see that kids are completely lost faced with what they can have to do things what they have to give up I have four kids and I honestly ask myself how we going to be able to educate them in a way that they can collectively face the difficulties of the degradation of collective living conditions conditions of accessing resources psychologists now talk about Eco anxiety I here to say our house is on fire Greta thurg the young Swedish ecologist engaged in the fight against climate change embodies the disarray of this generation adults keep saying we owe it to the young people to give them hope but I don want you to be hopeful I want you to panic I want you to feel the fear I feel every day a fear that sometimes borders on pathological anxiety [Music]	Success
La NiÃ±a: A Year of Extreme Weather | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEvxcX3YNzw	SLICE Science	[Music] in the southern hemisphere the climate provoked a catastrophe of unusual proportions in the capital city of Paraguay aunion which lies on the banks of the Paraguay River at the beginning of the year torrential rainfall affected the river catchment area in Paraguay and the surrounding countries from late December heavy rains driven by a strong El Nino incre River levels in Paraguay Argentina Uruguay and Brazil but what exactly is El Nino the elino phenomenon which owes its name to the period it normally arrives at right around Christmas time comes from the nickname of Jesus Christ in Spanish elino this recurring phenomenon begins when warm water in the western tropical Pacific Ocean shifts Eastward along the Equator towards the coast of South America during an Al Nino the Pacific warmest surface Waters sit offshore of Northwestern South America the rising temperatures in the East Pacific move the rain from the east of the Basin so it creates rain anomalies and very rainy phenomena with flooding on the east coast of South America [Music] in ason at the beginning of January flooding forced over 150,000 people from their homes parts of aunion had already been experiencing flooding since November by mid December the levels of the Paraguay River had reached over 20 ft the highest of the year at that time and well above the 18 ft considered to be the critical stage [Music] many feared the worst thousands were evacuated from neighborhoods along the river as levels of the Paraguay Rose to 26 ft on January [Music] 7th is every year the flooding gets worse it getting bigger and higher and recently it control in December I couldn here today I made the effort to come for my father you see it to it flooding and it gets worse and worse with the rain coming from Brazil and Argentina it make a lot of sacrifices people always think that this time will be the last time but it keeps on happening history repeats itself people start rebuilding and almost before they finish it starts again and everything is washed away father has his whole life here his animals his family he doesn leave around 6,000 families were affected in the first weeks of December but when River levels jumped to over 23 ft these numbers doubled 13,000 families were hit by flooding most of them from the Poor Los banados area of the city located close to the river [Music] the government of Paraguay declared a state of emergency in aunion and seven other regions of the country similarly affected El Nino events occur irregularly roughly every 2 to 7 years and last from 12 to 18 months bringing with them risks of repeated flooding in vulnerable areas and the danger of outbreaks of Cholera and malaria at least 200 pylons were damaged in the rains leaving thousands without electricity and four people were killed by Falling trees in what has been called the worst flooding in 50 [Music] years the government immediately made $3.5 million available to help those who had been affected [Music] as the climate changes and gets warmer ocean temperatures also increase and warm oceans fuel hurricanes and typhoons in 2016 Taiwan was particularly badly hit by typhoons just as new research pointed to the fact that the power of these destructive storms has increased by 50% over the past 40 years the Pacific typhoon season started late in 2016 with the first named tropical storm nepartak only developing on July 3rd the storm began its life as an area of low pressure over the Eastern Caroline Islands on June 30th on July 5th it was upgraded to Typhoon status by the end of the day with sea temperatures over 30° de C in the Philippine Sea nepartak was declared a super typhoon it reached Peak intensity near tyun on the Southeast coast of Taiwan with wind pressure at 900 milars and maximum sustained winds of 125 mph nepartak crossed over Taiwan on July 7th [Music] oh [Music] [Music] on its eastern side it has big mountains and not very many people live on the on the East almost all the activity the economic activity the big cities all the almost all the people in the buildings are concentrated on the western side of the island the lowland side of the island and most typhoons they come from the direction of the southeast and so they tend to hit the mountains first nepartak caused three deaths in Taiwan but went on to cause 83 deaths in China and a total of $1.5 billion worth of damage 3 months later a second typhoon hit Taiwan named Morandi it was the strongest tropical Cyclone worldwide in 2016 and one of the most intense tropical Cyclones on record the storm formed west of Guam in the Western Pacific Ocean on September 11th it was upgraded to Typhoon status rapidly intensifying on September 12th and Bec coming a category 5 super typhoon with maximum sustained wind speeds recorded at 150 mph and a minimum barometric pressure of 890 milars nanti clipped the southern end of Taiwan [Music] two people were killed and over 700,000 homes lost water and electricity the storm went on to destroy nearly 300 houses in the Philippines and kill some 30 people in flood related events in China on September 21st again near Guam a tropical depression formed becoming typhoon meie on September 23rd [Music] the typhoon reached Peak intensity as a category 3 typhoon this time over the island itself making landfall at Hen City on the Pacific East Coast of Taiwan with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph and a barometric pressure of 940 [Music] M giant waves battered the coast as megie landed leaving over 3 million households without power in the second worst black out in the country history however given the size of the Waves the damage was not nearly as bad as it could have been the last of these typhoons brought um quite high wind speeds so wind speeds that in most countries would have been quite damaging to uh to Taiwan uh in particular to the main port at Kia in in Taiwan it brought very high winds but it didn large amount of damage because the buildings in Taiwan are quite quite well built as the storm island the winds changed Direction megie forced more than 14,000 people to evacuate to government shelters from mountainous areas near the coast even though Taiwan and Southern China are well prepared for such events 91 people died and the total cost of these extremely destructive typhoons has been estimated at $1.25 billion researchers are warning that these giant storms will become even stronger in the future threatening the large and growing Coastal populations of Pacific Nations other events are likely to become more devastating as is a direct consequence of human population growth 2016 illustrates the challenge of living on a tectonically active Planet the Pacific Ocean is circled by a network of tectonic fault lines and volcanoes known as the ring of fire to the northwest of this ring are honu and kushu Japan which lie at the junction of several plates the Philippine plate collides with several Eurasian plates creating a fault line that Loops under the islands from Southwest to East at the extreme South of this Zone the kuma Moto district is built on layers of rock every year dozens of Tremors are felt in this area in April 2006 16 a series of earthquakes hit the kuma Moto area including a magnitude 7 main shock on April 16th it was centered around 60 Mi southeast of Sendai close to the sight of the devastating quake and tsunami that struck in March 2011 these earthquakes in kushu they weren plate boundary they were located on a zone of where there fting running down the middle of kushu roads were damaged and thousands of homes were destroyed in the earthquake between the 14th and the 20th of April the area experienced more than 600 aftershocks including two very strong ones 15,000 soldiers from the Japan self-defense forces joined relief efforts the main priority you have at the moment is looking for people and saving them and to be honest it frustrating because we can at all for the moment the aftershocks keep continuing we need to be very careful because nature isn optimistic as well as destroying houses and buildings the Earth earthquakes triggered landslides across the kushu mountain range leaving scars on the hillsides and forcing the collapse of the Great asso Bridge into the kurakawa [Music] river this was an unprecedented event in the area we already had several large landslides 5 years ago they were declared national disasters and they caused a lot of damage I bigger compared to the ones we had previously but they are ongoing and huge rocks that had never moved before have fallen this time you can see on the mountain areas that the soil is red as result of [Music] [Applause] [Music] landslides on April 17 Japan minister Shinzo AB mobilized 3,000 Personnel from the Air Force to help local authorities reach impacted areas I am part of one of the search and rescue teams at the moment we are looking for people who have disappeared it is the first time that we have seen an earthquake in a landslide of this size since I arrived here we have found four people one person is still missing so we are going to search all night it is a natural occurrence and nobody could see it coming we have no warning we don have been carried off we are doing research based on assumptions time is running out to find survivors the team prepares for a sleepless [Music] night three people in Yamaguchi they haven yet they they down and the last one our one okay that I way are we on the list two people yes you can come with us dozens of people were pulled from the rubble in a desperate effort to find survivors before the forecast range began on April 18th 24 people were found dead 11 were still missing and more than 91,000 had been evacuated the number of people seeking shelter had risen to 180,000 as a result of the Tremors the entire city of Kumamoto was left Without [Music] Water by April 19th the continuing aftershocks drove even more local inhabitants to sleep in their cars stadiums and Open Spaces government officials estimate that more than a thousand buildings have been seriously damaged with 90 completely [Music] destroyed the epicenter of the first one was at mashik kimachi and then the second earthquake was in the asso Reg when the second earthquake hit the house collapsed it happened at roughly 125 in the morning it felt like my body was being thrown from one place to another over several feet I was just there where the table in the living room is Under the [Music] Clock I was sleeping under the table because I thought it would be safer and and that it would protect me if something fell on top of me that P was two stories high and underneath there was the garage and my bedroom it might have happened to me if I in my bedroom at the bottom the car was squashed like a pancake for the last five years once a year we have an earthquake of about three or four magnitude I think it was a sign a warning sign although the focus of the earthquake was underneath Mount Kimu to the northwest of Kumamoto City Center the worst hit areas were mashiki and mikuo in the Eastern suburbs on the 21st of April as feared bad weather arrived adding to the rescue team difficulties rainwater runs into cracks bringing with it the risk of provoking landslides on the unstable ground the cliff is slowly collapsing because of the rain the inhabitants of the houses living below the cliff have all been ordered to evacuate the area we are actually in the process of checking if everything has been taken care of among the most exposed were the houses around ASO where the active fault moved the ground 6 ft sideways on April 17th the building anchored into land that the Earth Quake has turned to soup there the power of nature I comfort myself with the thought that there was nothing I could have done about it there are only two of us in the house we other people now even in temporary housing for a short period all the houses here were destroyed the second day the first day the road started to worsen three pine trees and an electrical pylon fell in my house my legs tremble with [Music] fear around ASO solid earth turned liquid swallowing cars and Roads and even toppling buildings that had been resting on the week soil this liquefaction has been the most destructive part of the disaster scientists have long tried to study the phenomenon but now researchers say that many of their models are flawed and fail to accurately represent real world [Music] conditions liquefaction usually takes place in Sandy soils when the sand is mixed up during the Tremor the pressure means that the ground turns to liquid that causes weaknesses in the ground and the houses lean over like that one behind us because the ground can no longer support it the ground here also has a particular geological feature which is that it covered with volcanic ash which has built up on the sides of the mountain amidst the turmoil and confusion a team of Japanese seismologists is taking measures in an effort to establish a 3D model of the area affected they are trying to understand the Region the forces in motion if you look at this area over here you can see that it has turned into a sort of staircase the ground is very soft I think that when large parts of the ground slipped the surface kept on slipping and it collapse like that Japan is constantly under threat from new Quakes and volcanic eruptions [Music] the whole country is under the continual scrutiny of seismologists and volcanologists 20% of the world earthquakes hit Japan each year around 600 per [Music] year in 2016 another violent Quake measuring 7.1 magnitude was felt on November 22nd in Northern Japan near Fukushima causing cusing more fear than harm altogether the Kumamoto and other Japanese earthquakes of 2016 killed 49 people and caused an estimated $7.5 billion of damage a few months after the Philippine tectonic plate made headlines in Japan another tectonic plate caused havoc in Italy [Music] the Mediterranean Basin is crushed by the African continent moving under the Eurasian plate which generates complex subduction faults trapped in the middle the Adriatic plate rotates in an anticlockwise Direction at a rate of a tenth of an inch per year around the city of amrie and the neighboring Villages of the appenine mountain range in central Italy [Music] the isolated Mountain Villages are known for their olive oil black truffles and [Music] Vineyards at 3:30 a.m. on August 24th a shallow but strong earthquake measuring 6.2 magnitude took the villagers by surprise the towns of Arata prare and pescara Del Tonto among others in the region were badly damaged DED local priest Franchesco armandi is the living memory of these villages on the night of the 24th of August at 3:36 to be precise we heard a loud crash and the ground shook violently I was in bed but I was awake and we had the impression that nature was trying to make my bed hit the ceiling I waited until the end of the quake and I got dressed quickly and went out the streets were full of rubble stones and big rocks the whole population was in the street I got up I put my slippers on and got my son and even before the first Quake was over we were already on the staircase at the bottom we realized that we were in our pajamas at 3:00 in the morning when the second Tremor hit we heard the mount victori it made a terrible noise at that moment everything crumbled I said to myself Mama Mia not only that we were just in the car park next door where we heard a noise of stones from the summit of VOR that were rolling down with the tremor from the earthquake in 10 minutes you look around you and you see the disaster my house is still standing but you can everything has come to an end and looking at your village that no longer exist is even harder the school bus arrives here I picked my son up here lots of times I would give him his snack we bakery that was our life simple basic but it was our life it now I sorry in addition to the loss of human life some of Italy heritage was also destroyed a church collapsed at pescar it must have been a thousand years old and it before even though there have been other earthquakes which must mean that this one was much stronger these are not the Colossal Tremors we see at tectonic plate boundaries where events occur measuring eight or nine magnitude the effects in this region are devastating because the Quakes take place near the surface of the crust these small Faults Are shallow causing dramatic shaking above the sight of the quake the truth is we on the geographical map in fact we just one Little Star on the Italian geophysical Institute site they Mark the epicenter with a star over 4,000 people were involved in the search and rescue operations and 238 victims were pulled alive from the rubble by the timely intervention of the authorities [Music] earthquakes are like bullets in a game of Russian Roulette one can never be sure when and where they will unleash their destructive [Music] power we realized that it was a miracle because at PRI apart from the damage you can see behind us nobody died nobody was injured then we saw besara we rolled up our sleeves and we said we something but what happened in pescara was unbelievable [Music] unfortunately the village was completely destroyed in fact if you go you will find just a pile of ruins there are about 50 deaths these were people I knew I had married them baptized their children so I when 20 30 40 or 50 friends die there is a lot of internal struggle and Lasting pain we will certainly have difficulty pulling ourselves together to start [Music] again I lived through the earthquakes in 1972 in 1997 and the one in Aquilla that we felt here because we are fairly close but for me they weren as this one this time it seems the earthquake followed a line a cursed line like pescara totally destroyed but next to it the village of vetu Which is less than half a mile away was spared completely nothing collapsed so these are phenomena that I for one can understand can science explain such bizarre phenomena the mountains are splitting apart and you earthquakes running from south to North um one after the other weeks and months apart as this this this set of fors very wellknown fors for fors you can go out and see running across the mountain sides in this region which have had big earthquakes on them in the past hundreds of years these fors have been have been breaking one by one um rupturing further north um along the the main axis of the appenine mountains in Italy this is neither the first nor the last time that Italy will experience a big earthquake between October 26th and November 3rd a series of 10 shallow earthquakes ranging from 4.5 to 6.5 magnitude hit the area of masata they occurred on an active fault between the area hit by August earthquakes and Umbria which suffered in 1997 the process of faulting and destruction [Music] continues 298 people lost their lives in the August earthquake the total cost of Destruction has been estimated at $2.6 [Music] billion the Pacific Ocean the largest and deepest ocean in the world conceals a network of faults caused by plate tectonics particularly in the west where the immense nasca plate moves under the South American continent at a speed of more than 2 in a year in Ecuador 60% of the 16 million inhabitants live in coastal areas including the country guak Kil at 700 p.m. on April 16th the Earth rumbled and many cities lost [Music] power it was only at daylight that the government realized the breadth of the destruction caused by this Tremor the earthquake took place in early evening with the towns of Porto Veo pedales Manta and Canoa among the worst affected but the fact that the earthquake occurred at the end of the day before people were sleeping meant there were fewer victims than there might have been it was measured at 7.8 magnitude the strongest earthquake to strike in 2016 and the largest Earth earthquake to hit Ecuador since 1979 president Rafael Korea declared a state of emergency 13,500 military personnel police officers and firemen were brought in to deal with the situation I am the person responsible for the zone that was the worst hit it full swing when the tragedy happened The Rescuers arrived at all the critical points for the first two hours the firemen spread out over the whole Zone and managed to save victims there were a lot of survivors then we had to look out for the dead bodies more than 600 people were killed in the provinces of manabi and esmeral does and over 6,000 were injured the earthquake happened at a time that thank the Lord saved lives people were still working they were in the streets if it had happened an hour later or very early in the morning it would have been much more complicated there would have been much more loss of life it felt like somebody picked my house up and threw it on 40t seas and it was going all over the place you know front and back and side to side the wave arrived when I was at home and I saw how the mountain could lift itself up I also saw some of the buildings in town move I saw the houses opposite rise up collapse and rise up again [Music] [Music] petalis sits right next to the plate Junction this town of 40,000 inhabitants was particularly badly hit many of the town destroyed our house is made up of five floors by the time the aftershocks had stopped as you can see it was a big house five members of my family died in it my sister who is 17 years old is still psychologically affected she she saw the whole building collapse and my mother saw the six-story building behind me collapsed it all just fell at once it was completely destroyed some 30,000 people were made homeless water gas and electricity were cut in many parts of the region and hundreds of miles of roads were destroyed many people been severely affected the pain will always be there years of work loss of hair white hair everything is gone nothing is left 20 years of my life we started with a small property a bit further away over there and then we moved and came here after many efforts and sacrifices we were in debt for 18 years to pay for this construction we just can with physics the structure is Twisted between the third and fourth [Music] floor people in shock everybody was sitting there watch I was too I I felt Shell Shocked you know I was just sitting there and and couldn imagine how something like this could you know could happen but in the the week sense it feels like we we the community some um coordination you know that to coordinate everybody we can get this place back on its feet again um businesses are starting to open which has been great um people are starting to rebuild their houses which is great but um we just want to we trying to work with the local government to make sure the building standards are where they need to be so something like this doesn again Ecuador Baya and the whole region is a very active seismic Zone throughout history we it change the depth and precise area hit by the April earthquake are typical of those in a subduction zone between two large siiz plates such mechanisms produce the most intense earthquakes known and where the Earth has shaken it will inevitably Shake again either nearby or at exactly the same spot the most recent buildings sustained little damage those that fell short of earthquake resistance standards were destroyed causing 673 deaths and damage worth $3.3 [Music] billion low construction standards of poor countries have been responsible for many casualties on the other side of the American continent [Music] the rain brought by the arrival of the West African Monsoon is vitally important for African Farmers this Monsoon also Heralds the arrival of what are known as tropical waves at the origin of many Atlantic tropical storms one such wave which was to become Hurricane Matthew left the west coast of Africa on September the 22nd with environmental conditions favoring slow development and thunderstorm activity increasing the tropical wave proceeded Westward across the Atlantic Ocean Matthew developed into a tropical storm 35 Mi southeast of St Lucia on September the 28th the storm became a hurricane 190 Mi Northeast of curo on September the 29th achieving Category 5 intensity the following day at the lowest latitude ever recorded for a hurricane of this intensity in the Atlantic Basin Hurricane Matthew move started moving North and moov North quite slowly where it would make landfall remained a mystery Cuba hati and Jamaica felt the humid breath of this monster and put coastal areas on red alert at 700 a.m. on October 4th Hurricane Matthew hit Haiti with Winds of 100 45 mph becoming the country first category 4 storm since hurricane Cleo in 1964 despite preparations the damage and loss of life on the island were [Music] catastrophic more than a thousand people were reported killed in the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew as hundreds of thousands of homes were destroyed more than one million people were left in need of humanitarian Aid with damage estimated at nearly $2 billion after ransacking Haiti the hurricane headed towards Cuba at 8:00 p.m. on October the 4th Matthew made landfall near huo with Winds of 140 [Music] mph land interaction with Cuba helped to weaken the storm to a category 3 though Matthew eventually reattain category 4 intensity as it moved away from Cuba and towards the Bahamas on the 5th of October Matthew made its third landfall over Grand Bahama as a category 4 Cyclone preparations began in Earnest across southeastern United States as Matthew approached with several regions declaring a state of emergency for coastal areas widespread evacuations were ordered for large parts of the coast [Music] [Music] the storm paralleled the Southeast coast of the United States over the next 36 hours gradually weakening while remaining just offshore before making its fourth and Final landfall in South Carolina on the morning of October the 8th as a category 1 hurricane damage was primarily confined to the coasts of Florida and Georgia but 47 people died in the US in Hurricane Matthew on October the 9th Matthew returned to the Atlantic becoming an EXT a tropical Cyclone as it turned away from Cape Hatteras North Carolina it captures everything from the poorest to the richest because it hit the poorest the poorest country in the region in uh in Haiti caused uh huge amounts of damage and loss of life but then kept moving North if the track had been 100 kilometers further to the West there would have been a huge amount of damage in Florida from from Matthew but by the time it did make landfall in the US it had weakened and so it was more of a flood event than a than a wind event so the the US was fantastically lucky with Matthew hati was fantastically unlucky over 1,500 deaths have been attributed to Hurricane Matthew Across the Western Atlantic and with the storm causing damage estimated in excess of $8 billion it was also the costliest Atlantic hurricane since hurricane Sandy in 2012 not all countries are affected by natural disasters in the same way there are big differences between the first world between the developed world where most most of insurance is written in in richer countries uh people tend to build stronger buildings um better buildings um they they tend to follow the rules the code and how they build those structures if you in developing countries you may tend to find a lot more risk that things are not built so strongly there in the path of floods for example uh there people and so there are very different challenges if you the first world to if you about risk in the third world or the developing world where where the the consequences of disasters can be much much more critical to people 2016 has had its share of disasters fires earthquakes storms droughts flooding but what percentage of these events can be attributed to global warming we now have techniques in order to to identify what is the ca we we it it done at a number of universities now where you run the world 1950 in in one version of the Earth where you have the increase in greenhouse gases year by year and another version of the Earth where there gases year by year and then you run these two versions of the earth to discover How likely a particular extreme it could be an extreme drought it could be extreme rainfall How likely that is in these two worlds and that tells you how much climate change how much global warming is influencing the occurrence of the extremes [Music] one thing we know for sure is that natural disasters hit the poor much harder than the [Music] rich if it can be recognized that global warming is responsible for at least some of the disasters our living planet creates then we can realize the urgency of approving climate policies that protect vulnerable populations s [Music]	Success
Unveiling the Secrets of Black Holes | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a88C6xwYd9k	SLICE Science	[Music] in 1915 Albert Einstein published his paper on general relativity it included several field equations they explain mathematically how Mass distorts space and time one implication was the ability of gravity to bend light for centuries astronomers had realized that Newtonian physics could not account for discrepancies such as the procession of Mercury the Sun the field equations revealed why and astronomers became very interested soon physicist Carl schwartzel discovered that among other things the field equations predicted a singularity a body so dense that nothing not even light could Escape it the idea of observing celestial bodies that gave off no light indeed absorb it was beyond the technology of the day and while Einstein accepted the mathematics he regarded the prediction as an [Music] anomaly for decades theoretical physicists continued to explore the mathematics trying to predict how a singularity might form from a collapsing star but the Orthodox y including Einstein resisted the idea with the Advent of radio astronomy it became clear there was a huge amount of activity not observable in the visible spectrum powerful radio signals traveling immense distances baffled researchers quazar and Pulsar were identified and the evidence suggested they were relatively small but incredibly dense objects astrophysicists began looking aresh at the idea of the singularity in the 1960s a new term emerged black hole new discoveries about Supernova collapsing giant stars and pulsars provided a mechanism for the evolution of a singularity black holes were no longer regarded as an anomaly within Einstein equations and a new generation of astronomers with new tools began looking for evidence the true nature of quazar emerged as active Galactic nuclei these objects at the heart of some large galaxies release huge amounts of electromagnetic radiation it was realized that matter near a very large black black hole was spiraling around the singularity at extreme speeds this is an accretion disc generating vast energy some accretion discs feature Jets generated by the Spin of the singularity and the highly magnetized material within the disc it is important to understand the scale in this animation the black hole at the center of the accretion disc is roughly the diameter of our solar system the idea that every large Galaxy had a super massive black hole at its Center gained Credence as more quazars were examined at the heart of our own galaxy The Milky Way no active accretion disc could be detected but astronomers still suspected there was a large black hole in 1992 a German team from the max plank Institute began a long-term study of stars at the center of our galaxy initially they used the European Southern observatory telescope in more recent years their observations were made using eso large telescope or VLT the team had to work at the infrared end of the spectrum because the shorter wavelengths in the visible spectrum tend to be absorbed absorbed by Interstellar gas and dust the team is led by Professor Reinhardt gensel well you see the Milky Way Center is one of the most important Laboratories we have to study in very great detail what of galaxies in much more detail than we can ever hope to do in in all other galaxies yet here we are we can study whether there what happens around it and so forth all very general issues which you would like to explore in which you cannot really uh study that much in detail in other Galactic nuclear during 50 nights over a 16-year period the team recorded the movement of 28 stars in the central region of the Milky Way they were clearly orbiting something that could not be seen the circle representing the black hole is 60 million kilm across similar to Mercury the body million solar [Music] masses as they mapped the paths of the Stars orbiting the black hole the team was surprised by the highly elliptical track of the star they called S2 and then in 2002 nature gave us just an absolutely miraculous star which moved so close to this object it you could see it Zi around the uh the mass uh in a matter of only a few years and that gave us absolutely fantastic information we could estimate the orbital parameters the mass Etc and we were fairly sure it orbital period of this star is 16 years and these measurements we took here on the then new a very large telescope we took in 2002 take 16 plus 2002 and that 2018 so our star is coming back to its original very close position near the black hole that to be there using eso the team monitored the close approach of S2 to the black hole at the center of our galaxy to test whether Einstein physics would break down under extreme conditions Professor gel measure accurate the slight shift in the color of S2 predicted by the Einstein field equations this required using the four individual telescopes of the VT working together using the gravity instrument to combine their light and to gather spectral data we have all four telescopes um working together and in addition to these four telescopes we have a beam combiner and this combines the light from all the four telescopes and this is gravity gravity is of course it because we can really trace the orbit of this star very very carefully with really good accuracy so we can now get very nice orbits and uh we test all our theories with this very nice data we have now as it approached the black hole S2 a star 14 times more massive than our sun accelerated to a speed close to 3% of the speed of light the gravitational influence from the black hole caused the Stars light to shift toward the red end of the spectrum exactly as the field equations predicted oo that was a long path it was very very difficult because uh while gravity is sort of an obvious thing you stand here on Earth and then you sort of have an idea what it is in reality it an extremely weak force and the effects of of generativity are extremely small so you have to measure to to a Precision which we are normally not used to in astronomy in 2020 Professor gensel shared the Nobel Prize for physics with Andrea gets and Roger Penrose all for their contributions in the field of black [Music] holes the people from the max plank Institute were not the only ones drawn to black holes American astrophysicist Shephard dolman had assembled an international team with a broad range of skills the objective was to capture an image of a black hole while the max plank team had proved the existence of the giant Singularity at the center of the Milky Way by plotting its influence on adjacent Stars they could not see anything this was no surprise after all it to capture an image the dolman group knew they would have to focus on an active Galactic nucleus light generated in the accretion disc might be able to reveal the silhouette of a black hole so as the magnetized gas is falling onto the black hole it heats up and therefore generates the light that we then see now from our daily experience we expect that light travels on straight paths and straight trajectories we call them race uh here the situation is very different we have a black hole sitting right there and it bending the light rays away from the straight paths that we um and it basically distorts the image by a great amount so um in fact you can see things that are actually behind the black hole and that you thought were obstructed by the black hole simply because the black hole is bending the light rays into your line of sight before the observations could proceed preliminary work had to take place firstly to determine if it really was feasible to capture the image of a black [Music] hole it was understood that an array of widely separated telescopes acting together as an interferometer would be needed for the task the greater the distance between them the greater the angular resolution [Music] the super massive black hole at the center of m87 a super giant elliptical galaxy in the constellation Virgo seemed like the best candidate it has an active Galactic nucleus and it huge while Imaging data would be collected from a specific wavelength some telescopes in the array can record several wavelengths simultaneously where possible this information would also be recorded I multi-wavelength working group and what that means is that we try to gather complimentary information simultaneously with the EHT observations from Radio to even gamma rays and hopefully even particles but mostly I in trying to think about the modeling uh and making simulations and and models of of the lights that could be coming out of a black hole astrophysicists knew the image would look peculiar so they set about using the field equations to make simulations of what they expected to see the extreme gravitation bends the light near a singularity in surprising ways with light from The accretion Ring behind the black hole still [Music] visible the effect is called gravitational lensing and it would assist the astronomers by making the singularity and its accretion disc appear larger with m87 55 million light years away this was important you we started just by measuring the size of black holes with a few telescopes and I remember seeing those first results come across my computer screen and that was when I got hooked that was when I knew that something really extraordinary was possible and since then we a few people to over 200 and now we ready to make the first image of a black hole and that has been a big period of growth initially eight radio astronomy facilities from across the globe collaborated on the project only wavelengths from below the Spectrum visible to the human eye can penetrate the interstellar gas and dust and it was decided to observe at the 1.3 mm wavelength the telescopes were linked together to function as a giant interferometer these telescopes were not meant to work together and you have to do a tremendous amount of fiddling to get the calibrations right and everything coordinated it different experience than a dedicated interferometer Alma the Kaa large millim submm array on the chantor plateau in Northern Chile is one of the observatories that became part of what is known as The Event Horizon telescope when it joined it was a pivotal moment the EHT had made its first observations years earlier in 2006 at that stage the small array was used to measure the mass of black holes astrophysicists knew the EHT would need more telescopes for increased resolution and sensitivity when Alma agreed to participate as a part of the EHT it brought within reach the ability to capture an image of a suitable black hole but there was a problem Alma dishes were designed and built to perform as an interferometer the dishes can be be relocated into varying patterns and separated by as much as 16 km which improves its angular resolution however to image The Singularity at the center of m87 required telescopes separated by thousands of [Music] kilometers Alma had to be reconfigured to operate as a phased array which meant it would appear as a single telescope within the EHT array [Music] this required considerable investment and expertise and it brought European institutions into the EHT collaboration in a major way the max plank Institute for astronomy developed its own supercomputer known as a correlator for the integration of the signal data from all the EHT telescopes from the very beginning this group was instrument m al was a key player in the development of what is now known as The Event Horizon telescope and we uh used our experience we used our scientific engagement but we used in particular the technical contributions we could make to contribute to the construction of the EHT effort now what does that mean we uh developed further developed and expanded our correlator capacity now we are one of the two uh correlator centers for the EHT together with HC Observatory but we also contributed to the continued backend development with our dbbc 3 project and thirdly we played a major role in the outfitting the preparation of the alma array for the EHT observations we um helped making the phasing of the 64 Elma antennas possible so that now Elma taken as a whole is a major contribution to the EHT technical capability all the EHT telescopes were re-equipped with hydrogen masers that provided an extremely accurate frequency standard to timestamp their output signal other upgrades included superconducting receivers and digital signal processors but because of its size the modifications needed at Alma were extensive while the other telescopes improved the eht increased it sensitivity by a factor of [Music] 10 the term Event Horizon can be confusing in the simulations it is simply the edge of the black circle around which the accretion disc swirls however the line Beyond which light cannot escape and the surface of the matter of the black hole are different things in the field equations time stops at a black hole do the laws of physics break down here black hle is a huge amount of mass in a small area which distorts space and time such that you know everything that goes too close light and every information disappears forever in that hole never gets out and that even time slows down and comes to a standstill at the edge of a black hole that exotic objects we can imagine we never seen a black hole so far black holes is a theory we actually seems to do things we black holes emerge we heard uh the gravitation ways from the merging of what we think are black holes but we never seen the actual object seeing a black hole actually allows us to not only know they exist and not only know an event Arizon exist it also ows us to test some of the very basic predictions of the theory of general relativity of Albert Einstein which really describes space and time uh in its completeness and that has never been tested before members of The Event Horizon team met regularly and as the numbers grew so did the meetings the collaboration Drew together experts across a number of different fields we all have different roles in this collaboration there expertise coming together from all the different scientists I Imaging part so um I work on uh data on Imaging very long Baseline interferometry data if this is true that black holes are the extreme objects where we can study gravity and we know that um general relativity which describes black holes in the outer part up to the event horizon breaks down at the Event Horizon so the big hope is um that with more data we might be able to study the physics Beyond general relativity so maybe there might be quantum physics ruling beyond the event horizon or the combination of quantum physics and general relativity which would be the theory of quantum gravity which is non-existent at the moment but we might learn more about this with the help of studying black holes high in Spain Sierra Nevada is the Iram 30 m dish it telescope and is the Project sensitive single antenna like all the other facilities in the EHT its remote Mountaintop location delivers very low humidity good conditions for recording the millimeter wavelengths chosen for the black hole observations its reflecting surface is made to tolerances finer than a human hair all the Event Horizon telescopes required the installation of high-speed recorders to capture the vast amounts of data produced during the observation period each site would generate data at 64 gbits per second with observation periods lasting at least 10 hours each could produce half a petabyte of data per session this made conventional methods of storing data in the cloud unfeasible one petabyte of data is enough to store mp3 music files that will play for 2,000 years during preliminary observations the high altitudes where the telescopes are located played Havoc with the conventional unsealed data drives used by the team for the crucial 2017 obser in campaign the EHT had switched to helium filled data drives immune to problems associated with high altitude the most remote facility in the event horizon group is the South Pole telescope while the very cold temperatures and its 2,800 M altitude provide the earth conditions for submillimeter wavelengths Antarctica is is difficult to access and a challenging environment in which to work the 10 m dish is fitted with a metal skirt to minimize Reflection from the surrounding ice originally designed to study the cosmic microwave background it is perfectly suited to make an important contribution as part of the Event Horizon [Music] telescope the team running the observations at the South Pole has to be particularly skilled because of the telescope cannot be called upon if equipment malfunctions spare parts and expertise must be on hand getting an image from a global distribution of eight different radio telescopes relies upon brute computing power and sophisticated software the bulk of the information recorded during the observation period will be just random interference after the observation when the data drives are assembled at the correlation centers the interference will be averaged out using an algorithm while the distance separation of the telescopes enhances angular resolution there will be gaps in the picture that emerges these will be filled by a different algorithm employing artificial intelligence more telescopes will help future observations but the the algorithms will remain essential after we computed the radiative signature of our simulations we have to compare them to the observations and this can be imagined as you in a in a stadium and during a football match and you have an image and you want to figure out if this person or whatever is on this image is Among The Spectators in the stadium so what you do is you take this image and try to mat it with all the 60,000 Spectators in the stadium and you do this while you rotate it you scale it you increase the contrast and you try to figure out first what is on your image is it a person is it a cat or whatever and try to match this to the spectators and this seems trivial but it computational uh demanding process so we need a supercomputer which we have in Frankfurt and we developed a so-called genetic algorithm which is a very smart way running through this images and try to adjust them and this takes roughly a month and after this calculation time we have maybe 10 of those Spectators which match your image and this is very similar to what we do in EHD so we try to compare and match our observations with the theoretical predictions until they could actually see the image the research team had no idea how the accre disc was positioned if it was a view from above or below as seen from the earth the picture would be very different to an edge on perspective which would be seen with gravitational Distortion having an idea which way the accretion disc faced would help Computing scientists in their development of an appropriate algorithm this is where pulsars come in they are rapidly rotating stars that pulse with precisely timed very intense radio bursts they can serve as accurate Cosmic clocks Michael Kramer director of the max plank Institute for radio astronomy is an expert in pulsers he understood that if a Pulsa could be found in the region near the center of the m87 Galaxy it just might be possible to discover the orientation of the accretion disc via time Distortion in the accurate radio [Applause] [Music] pulses so for this experiment it was clear that we need expertise from completely different areas and so we needed someone with imaging capabilities we needed someone with noric relativity C capabilities and in my case we need someone who can try to find this additional information via pulse us and so just being part of this team means you work completely differently you always know someone somewhere at the end of a of a computer line at the end of an email who knows exactly the answer to your question and so if you don the answer then we look work together to find it out and so it dream is this this shared ambition which brings us together ultimately no appropriate Pulsa could be found before the 27 17 observation campaign but the research team would explore every lead in the attempt to image a black [Music] hole Shep dolman from the Smithsonian astrophysical Observatory has been with the project from the beginning he observatories including the large millim telescope on the summit of Sierra Negra in Mexico its 5050 M dish is the world largest steerable millimeter telescope situated at an altitude of 4,600 M the location provides very low levels of water vapor and therefore good observing conditions for millimeter wavelengths its coverage overlaps with observatories in Chile and Hawaii making it a perfect fit for the EHT as the Director I do many things I go go to telescopes and I do observations but I also enjoy the analysis and I also enjoy the Imaging um so I do many many things I wear many hats in the collaboration the most difficult part of the Event Horizon telescope for me has been building the whole team bringing everyone [Music] together the James Clark Maxwell telescope operated by the East Asian Observatory is one of a cluster of independent observatories close to the summit of wires Mona it has a 15 M dish and is optimized for observations of submillimeter wavelengths nearby is the submillimeter array an interferometer consisting of eight 6m dishes operated by the Smithsonian astrophysical Observatory and the Academia cica Institute of astronomy and astrophysics the mid-pacific location of these facilities and adds to the wide geographical spread of the Event Horizon telescopes locations if you like Einstein theory of gravity then black holes are you know one of the most uh interesting examples of this Theory and this is my my role within the this project I I am a theorist I work with you know equations and uh simulations and um my my role is that to try and understand whether the image that we produce corresponds to the predictions of Einstein theory or maybe to something else again and again researchers mention testing Einstein relativity and so far the theory always holds up but there reason why they keep searching for [Music] anomalies 100 years ago astronomers began to suspect that there was a lot more matter out there than than they could account for by the 1970s analysis of the rotation of spiral galaxies suggested that they were spinning too fast estimates of the observable Mass did not deliver enough gravitation to hold these galaxies together and they did not behave in the same way as other rotating systems such as our own solar system there must be a lot more mass that was not detectable and it must surround galaxies in a Halo this was called Dark Matter estimates have dark matter making up 85% of all matter so far attempts to find dark matter have been fruitless the other possibility is that general relativity is incomplete or incorrect the submillimeter telescope on Mount Graham in Arizona and the Apex telescope in Chile were the final two telescopes that made up the EHT for the 2017 observing [Music] campaign at an elevation of 5,100 M Apex is the highest facility observations are made remotely from an operation Support Facility at 2,900 m Apex is a Pathfinder for the adjacent Alma array initially is a technology demonstrator and more recently finding targets of interest for the larger [Music] array Alma as the most sensitive facility served as an anchor station for the entire group for its role in The Event Horizon telescope the 64 dishes were positioned in a tightly packed configur duration to minimize the effect of local atmospheric disturbance unlike most of the other Event Horizon facilities the data from Alma were recorded 30 km from the array at the operation Support Facility to achieve this a high-speed fiber optic cable was laid between the observatory correlator and the Operation Center [Music] it had been decided that the months of March and April offered the best chance of good observing conditions at all [Music] Sites while some of the facilities had been involved in preliminary synchronized observations the 2017 observation campaign would be the first time all eight telescopes complete with updated receivers and high-speed data recorders were all ready to make an attempt to capture an image of the black hole at the heart of the m87 Galaxy our experiments are like an Arctic Expedition we have to plan for months and months and months in advance gather our equipment and then we have this great migration of people to observatories all around the world we stay up all night uh we run our telescopes and then we have this terrible period of waiting where we don all of our data together and only when it working the global effort was coordinated from a back room at Harvard University observations commenced on April the 5th air turbulence and opacity are usually lower at night and before the scheduled observing time a pole of conditions across the various sites was carried out with a final go no-o command being given [Music] during coordinated Windows over five nights in April all the EHT telescopes focused on the same point in the sky a surprising run of favorable nights allowed the telescopes to record about four petabytes of data 256 hard drives from Seven telescopes were sent to either the hstack correlator in Westford Massachusetts or to the max plank correlator data in Bon they were transported by air and at its peak it was the most rapid data transfer in history at the South Pole the remaining 32 hard drives had to wait for the southern winter to pass it was not until the following November when a plane finally had access to the amonson Scot South Pole station during observation the data had been separated into high and low frequency bands and recorded on different drives high band data was shipped to the max plank Institute and low band data to the hstack correlator the computation would take many months the timestamped signal from each telescope was compared with that of every other telescope initial processing minimized unwanted Noise by calculating an average of all the signals distortions can arise from fluctuating atmospheric conditions or electronic delays amongst many other factors by the end of this process the volume of data was reduced by a factor of 1 million yet there was still no image in November 2018 all the researchers gathered at redbard University in the Netherlands to discuss their progress at this point the Imaging teams took Center Stage they had been building simulations that obeyed Einstein equations by changing variables like magnetic flux viewing angle and spin they generated a library of synthetic images the hope some of these would resemble the image generated by the data collected during the observation [Music] because there were gaps in the data set machine learning would fill out the picture but there was a possibility human buyers could influence the final result box all the way around the peak to see which Imaging techniques to guard against this four separate Imaging groups worked independently on converting the data into an image so we and at the beginning it was simply extraordinary that some point in the indeterminate future these might actually be relevant but I have to say it we actually have images that look like the simulations it Confluence between Theory and experiment and it promises tremendous breakthroughs on the horizon finally an image emerged it obeyed the field equations and looked like the simulations so what what is most surprising of of of of of this experience is that we managed to get a very good image the first time we tried to synchronize all of these telescope at the same time it is not so surprising that we obtain the image that we had predicted through simulations because well we believe our simulations are correct and because we believe that the theory of Einstein correct one I think we lucky I for years and years do many observations until we get a final image and then we look at our first source and we see that ring we see the Event Horizon and we see that shadow that dark region and you know immediately we event horizon and a black hole from all sides at once in this this thing we see at a region where time stops this is very different part of the universe that we that before of course you still need to understand what you you know you need to believe what you see so it really convince yourself what we see there is physically really prove of an event horizon but that exciting Journey we all understand from a mathematical point of view that black holes exist but to actually see something is a very visceral experience and I think important for Science and also for us to believe in it I didn think we would get it I thought it was just going to be too hard I knew it was worth it to try but I didn would get it and seeing that image for the first time uh was really eye openening for me something that I wanted to see for over two decades here researchers had a lot of detail to verify before they finally went public with their image of the super massive black hole early in 2019 are very high and dryes at welcome to today six press conferences were held simultaneously around the world to make announcement and to reveal the image thank you all for joining us today it shows an orange ring brighter along one Edge that surrounds a dark Central core though it data across the observation period reveals movement the ring is the accretion disc it is matter orbiting the black hole at a velocity approaching the speed of light the accretion ring glows because friction within the ring generates vast energy the color was an arbitrary Choice the electromagnetic radiation streaming from The Ring covers the Spectrum from gamma rays right down to radio waves but it is only the lower energy radio waves that are able to penetrate the dust and gas that lie between the m87 Galaxy and Earth As radio waves are not visible the color orange was chosen because it represents heat the extreme gravity bends space time allowing the portion of the accretion Ring behind the black hole to be seen as if it both looped above and below the central region the dark region at the center is the Event Horizon the area of influence around the black hole from which nothing can escape it sign is determined by the black hole Mass Beyond this little can be determined it is theorized that the mass is concentrated at a point known as a singularity within the Event Horizon the laws of physics do not make sense while the singularity can be said to have infinite density it does not have infinite Mass The Event Horizon at the heart of the m87 Galaxy occupies roughly the same area as that enclosed by the orbit of Pluto around our sun and the m87 black hole has a mass equivalent to 6.5 billion Suns it is active it is growing matter in its region is being consumed and the immense amount of energy generated leads to vast Jets of plasma being ejected this process is not well understood but it is thought that the swirling tangle of magnetic field lines around the spinning black hole pushes material out at relativistic speeds the much smaller black hole at the center of our own Galaxy is not active we know it orbital patterns of stars in the inner Galaxy but without an accre ring it cannot be as easily imaged there are big plans for the event horizon telescope I think we first step there to do we need better images probably more telescopes and eventually we may have to go into space then we can make razor sharp images of black holes and test all the theories in great great detail three telescopes have joined the event Horizon group the Greenland 12m dish is a refurbished prototype from the alma facility which needed extensive modification for work in The Frigid conditions inside the Arctic Circle it enhances the resolution of the original eight telescopes broadening the array geographic distribution another Alma prototype has been relocated to Kit peak in Arizona where it functions in tandem with the nearby submillimeter telescope on Mount Graham the noema array in the French Alps is the third facility to join the EHT it has 12 15 M dishes on the plateau de it operates as a phased array when working as part of the EHT weather marred the 2019 observations and the 2020 observing campaign was called off due to issues with the covid-19 virus but the raw data had been retained and it was reprocessed using polarizing information that revealed magnetic detail within the accretion ring this holds clues about the mechanism that drives the polar Jets from active black holes astronomers using the Muse and ex shooter instruments at eso Observatory recorded colliding galaxies in the far southern constellation tucar great activity at the center drives huge jets with prolific star formation the Jets extend vast distances and it appears that they play an important role in the distribution of matter across the galactic neighborhood not all black holes are super massive in a star cluster part of the southern constellation veila a star was seen orbiting nothing once every 167 days calculation revealed the star was circling a stellar Mass black hole equivalent to four Suns this type of black hole forms when a giant star having burned all its fuel explodes in a hypernova ultimately collapsing to a black hole this must have been how the universe earliest black holes formed but they grew by consuming matter in their region expanding to Giants and forming the nucleus of the first galaxies smaller Stars equivalent to eight Suns also collapse at the end of their lives they explode in a supernova briefly blasting out vast amounts of matter and energy The Remnant core much reduced in Mass after the explosion compresses to such density that its protons and electrons merge forming neutrons this is a neutron star its mass is just short of what is needed to form a black hole while they may be only 20 km across they are detectable as very bright radio sources emitting electrom magnetic radiation from near polar regions rapidly rotating neutron stars appear to radio astronomers as precisely timed radio pulses hence the name Pulsar the Pulsa provided another proof of Einstein relativity with the concept that mass bends space it was logical that a moving Mass would send ripples through space anomalies in some usually very accurate Pulsar signals suggested they were part of a binary star system the timing discrepancies could be accounted for by gravitational waves since the 1960s attempts have been made to build instruments that could detect gravitational waves only recently has this become possible this is the Virgo interferometer near Pisa in Northern Italy two 3 km arm set at a right angle house evacuated tubes down which laser beams Shine the instrument can detect minute changes in the fabric of SpaceTime and it works in collaboration with two similar instruments in the United States in September 2017 not long after the instrument became active it registered a distinctive [Music] signal it was the signature of two merging neutron stars it is thought to have been the birth of a new black hole immediately telescopes observing across the electromagnetic spectrum began searching for the event precise location after glob from ejected matter was visible for years but there was no evidence of a neutron star it was the first time that the source of gravitational waves had been precisely located in 2015 the ligo gravitational wave detectors in the United States recorded a different signal that revealed the merging of two black holes the mass of each was roughly 30 Suns larger black holes may not be detectable like this they are so large and move so slowly that the low frequency waves they generate will not be obvious the mass of the resultant black hole was slightly less than the sum of its parts the extra mass being dissipated as gravitational waves with the regular detection of gravitational waves and the global efforts of The Event Horizon telescope completely new fields of astronomy are opening [Music] up the Event Horizon collaboration continues to expand they want to record moving images of super massive event Horizons and their accretion discs the black hole at the center of our own galaxy has proved illusive but new evidence suggests that it has a small accretion disc that just might allow a more powerful array to reveal images we wait with anticipation [Music]	Success
Exploring the Remote Kerguelen Islands | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7ao-bBLcUI	SLICE Science	[Music] these islands are haunted by the memory of those who have run up against them Whos buried next to the remains of their prey ghost ships abandoned and left to [Music] rust these vast empty spaces seem never to have known a living presence yet here and there are traces of men they had intended their daily struggle for survival to be known one day archaeologists have just uncovered the Hut of kgin Robinson cruso an English man called John nun when first I landed in [Music] with three companions he spent 5 years here in the 1820s before a passing boat finally spotted [Music] them they built themselves a Hut out of Pete but they clearly had a hard time coping with the Island conditions especially the constant damp they left this wonderful fireplace which was in fact what led us to une Earth this very moving site they called their H hope cottage for the obvious reason that they spent their time hoping to catch sight of the vessel which would put an end to their suffering [Music] to keep up their morale they made ink out of Albatross B and recorded the details of their stay on the island in the margins of the Bible they had saved from their Shipwrecked boat some 2 yards from our little Hut was the pool in question a small softwater Lake almost 400 yards in circumference the sea elephants seals and Ducks often gathered there and observing their habits proved a great source of amusement To Us by boiling them for several hours and adding salt to taste they provided us not only with a very nourishing meal but a tasty and pleasant stew these sea elephants were not only good meat but they were also a source of fuel which kept us warm and enabled us to cook they also were a means of having light to comfort us when the sun had disappeared Beneath The Horizon and we had returned to our Hut a century later Dub experience the Solitude of John nun and his companions themselves the islands coasts were still unexplored in fact that was one of the challenges rbati had set [Music] himself he thought it would be a good idea to make a map of the KGAN Islands given that nobody had ever explored or even charted them he had his heart set on leading an expedition and making it one which would be of use to other Sailors ha duti was aware of the risks he was taking caralin had defeated men better R than him beginning with the one who gave his name to the island in 1772 a French Expedition set out to find the last great undiscovered continent a vast expansive land in the southern oceans with a mythical place in the tales of old Sea Dogs the expedition was an experienced sailor his name Eve [Music] dealin after many weeks at Sea he had last glimpsed what he took to be the continent coveted by his King Louis the 15th a storm prevented him from actually landing on the island but not from filing a dazzling report on his return all that my eyes could discern was sprinkled with woods and Greenery which would indicate a country inhabited and cultivated with thought in the colder latitudes one can find diamonds rubies Sapphires and emeralds perhaps one might also find their new races living naturally ignorant of the artifices of civilized men encouraged by kolin the king financed a more ambitious expedition to this new Al Dorado once more a storm made a mockery of kin plans but one of his ships lzo managed to enter a bay guarded like a doorway by a huge Stone Arch which has since collapsed on the 6th of January 1774 man finally set foot on this beach which had remained in Violet since the beginning of time that man was not KGAN but one of his crew members he carried with him a bottle containing a message by which kgin claimed the new continent for the king of France he dropped the bottle somewhere in this Bay which became the recognized point of entry to the island rather than setting out to explore an outbreak of scurvy forced karalin toward an immediate return he would never set foot on this island whose outline he sketched for the King on his return 8 months later Louis the 15th was dead a conspiracy grew up against KGAN after a controversial trial he was imprisoned in the Chateau de and left to Ru his one great mistake having taken his dream for reality had he been caught telling tall stories yes of course he had he had painted a rather optimistic picture of his Discovery but can you really hold that against him if you put yourself in issues at the time discovering a new continent was absolutely extraordinary he had barely glimpsed it through the fog and rain did he realize it was totally desolate or did he think it might have some potential even if it was just livestock breeding maybe he thought it could be colonized I don let his joy and enthusiasm get the better of him he thought he had discovered Australia let somewhat I can forgive him that while KGAN struggled to refute the accusations made against him and prove his loyalty to the king his great English rival James Cook set off in the same [Music] direction he too had spent years searching for Australia but he had learned how to protect his crew from scurvy and was lucky to have two easily maneuverable boats in turn he sailed past the archway and into the bay as it was Christmas Day cook named The Bay Port Christmas and sketched it he found the bottle left by the French added a mention of his visit and replaced the bottle then he set out to explore with the scientists accompanying his Expedition he found a land without trees cold and Barren battered by violent winds with no sign of Life at any distance from the coast the land in question is an island of no great extent which from its sterility I should with great propriety call the island of desolation but that I would not Rob M dealan of the honor of its bearing his name cook demolished forever the myth of KGAN as the Australian continent but that word desolation would remain forever associated with these [Music] islands KH duti wanted to take his place in history among the great explorers he had named his secondhand ship after his mentor shako whom he had served as Cabin Boy on a trip to the Antarctic ice cap and Whose advice he sought at all [Music] times that experience of polar conditions and the famous Explorer patronage ensured datti standing in the eyes of his tiny crew made up of his brother H and four Sailors three of whom were under 20 [Music] even to such an inexperienced crew my father who was only 25 at the time must have seemed very young they were showing Amazing faith in him [Music] definitely on the night of the 9th of March 198 the crew of the JB shco at last glimpsed land sailing into the bay they were in entranced by the sight that greeted [Music] them we were welcomed on arrival by our hosts on this island which no human being inhabits they watched us with eyes wide open in Surprise Penguins hundreds of penguins enclosed ranks like soldiers ready to defend their Coast against invasion [Music] but the invasion had already taken place and it was the man who destroyed the myth of a new El Dorado who is responsible for it for James Cook had noted at least one natural resource on the shores of this Barren land mammals whose BL was very rich in oil at the time the great European cities had just discovered whale oil as a means of lighting their parlors that was the Island the new whing ground in tiny sloops at first then in bigger vessels with launchers mostly American and British one whale represents 7,000 L of oil on Shore there were abundant sea elephants for oil and sea lions for [Music] fur in 100 years 1 and a half million sea elephants were killed and the sea lion disappeared from these [Music] Waters under constant pressure to cut costs the hunters spent years on end in regions of which they made no Maps so as not to reveal their hunting grounds the fog often deprived them of any means of fixing their position anyway on each trip they put their lives at risk almost every day my great-grandfather was Shipwrecked of East Island in 1866 he spent six months with the teams of sea elephant and seal hunters who lived on the island before he was picked up by the Esther one of those boats which visited each island regularly to load up the Hunter catch he tells the story in great detail in his log the Shipwreck had been very violent in a couple of hours a raging Storm had blown up as happens very often down there taking them completely by surprise they were caught on the Hop and that was that the boat was immediately blown out of control and onto the Rocks where it ran ground to [Music] the first thing they did was to build a shelter that was the obvious priority they also tried to recover as much as they could from the wreckage of their boat that must have taken them some time my great-grandfather then sketched their camp you mustn spent the whole year on the island sometimes two or even three before they were released his sketches show them inside their Huts lying on their bunks reading or [Music] drawing they also make toys and all kinds of objects that they would be able to sell when they got home to supplement their pay and their earnings from whale [Music] oil those men were used to working in isolated places very few people ever thought about them you had to be fairly Ruddy to stick it out they were hard ready for anything for any hardship when it comes down to it there was a job to be done somewhere off the Beaten Track and they went because it was well paid that would you have liked that I think so yes they were living in extraordinary times certainly my great-grandfather was James stubbington eventually left CR Island on a vessel sent each year to pick up the survivors of shipwrecks knowing the reputation of the islands his family had given up hope of ever seeing him again it must have been very hard for my great-grandmother of course she thought he was lost dead ever since the men in my family have been strongly advised against going to Sea several of my uncles wanted to join the Merchant Navy and was stopped from doing so because of the memory of what had happened to my great-grandfather it wasn time he was reported missing many Castaways were less fortunate than stubbington and lost their lives on the shores of cro KGAN Amsterdam and St Paul like the French crew of the Tamaris who attached messages to the feet of hundreds of Albatross one was found thousands of miles away in Australia but by the time help arrived the men had attempted to sail off the island on a [Music] raft as the Whalers ventured further and further into the ice to hunt Tales of these forbidding lands battles with frightening animals and encounters with huge Albatross became [Music] legendary Gustav dory and Jules Vern Adventure in the icy Southern Seas with a generation of school children nourishing the dreams of future adventurers however the first wave of in invasions was over by the time gaslighting became widespread in the 1890s and threatened to ruin the Whalers the French government had long forgotten its distant [Music] territories and then the fanciful dreams of Two Brothers HRI and reney bosier sparked a second invasion by warning the French government that Britain intended to Annex kgin they obtained a 50-year concession in 1893 they had two motives the first was that they were the sons of a famous builder of wailing ships so they wanted to try to keep the family business going and then there was their sense of patriotism because in the family everybody was very French extremely French they could not allow another country to take control of the islands in exchange for a promise to develop KGAN the two brothers were given full Powers over the territory earning the nickname the governors of KGAN they spent many years planning the project reny bosier filled hold notebooks with drawings of every type of whale and notes on Hunting them he visited Norway where technical Innovation had revitalized the whing industry he inspected their factories and made copies of their design he produced market research promising spectacular returns expenditure 200,000 Franks income 600,000 Franks but the bosier brothers fell victim to the same Misfortune which had defeated Eve degalan all their attempts to develop the island failed in 15 years they did not even manage to land on it one single time in 1908 KH duti did land on the island and found it deserted carg in is ours he exclaims during the voyage he had laid out his secret plan to his father dearest Papa I have just received a copy of the decree of concession to the busier surely they have forgotten their rights by now I have addressed a request to assume the concession of KGAN and crosy to the colonies Minister what do I [Music] risk while waiting for the minister to reply he devoted himself to his his mission [Music] exploration he stumbled across the ruins of a house built 5 years earlier by a German scientific Expedition on route for the South Pole it was his first encounter with the Ireland the Germans had been forced to flee laid Low by a terrible epidemic [Music] I was struck dumb by what I saw around me there years earlier my predecessors in Exploration had built a house and ured themselves a certain amount of civilized Comfort but the place had been abandoned in very strange circumstances as if its occupants had been Disturbed in the course of their daily chores by the signal of impending attack they had decamped leaving all their possessions behind I found hundreds of are bottles of wine and liquor all of them [Music] empty Hal duetti did not have the same resources as the Germans and so like others before him he was reduced to hunting sea elephants to sell oil and pay his crew it was a terrible Massacre of the kind which would shock sensitive souls and those at home who would not harm a fly but let me remind you we were on desolation Island and were like men in primitive times the herd of sea elephants so monstrous so ugly with their fat noses pointed towards us and their tails beating the Rocks roused in us the brutal force of our ancestors which had allowed man to become Master of the world to boil down the blubber Hal duti used cauldrons left behind by earlier Whalers he built Vats and what he proudly called his little Factory in Observatory Bay it was from that vantage point that he looked on helplessly 10 months after his arrival as the power of the bosier steamed in to annihilate his dream [Music] the arriving vessel was unlike the old Whalers coal powerered easy to maneuver and equipped with a recent Norwegian invention the [Music] Harpoon it rendered the hunt less risky for men and merciless for whales systematic Massacre made their oil profitable once [Music] more within a few months a full-scale industrial complex had sprung up in Port shandar beneath R duet yet this model Factory with its three boilers its huge autoclaves to melt the blubber and its workers Barracks was not French at all the bosier had subcontracted to the Norwegians the masters of world whing it was the only whale processing Factory ever to be built on French territory a cottage industry a world away which today offers up its secrets we know that 100 people worked here for 3 months at a time all of them were Norwegian we also know thanks toti that they worked with what we were call today inred professionalism for example they had brought with them two categories of Carpenters those who worked on the ships and those who built their housing it is thanks to their professionalism that we have in spite of the passage of time another testimony to an heroic age [Music] the factory was intended to have a large turnover at full capacity it could process six Wells at once the Norwegians brought precise labor organization to the other side of the world and production targets even harsher than those practiced in their home [Music] factories they spent all day every day in the factory except Sunday they were Lutheran and respected the Sabbath but otherwise the factory was fully staffed every day even then I continue to feed the boilers on Sunday to keep the steam up I of it in fact nothing was overlooked to ensure the smooth running of every Technical and human element in the factory equipment and buildings brought from Norway had been specially designed to resist carolan climate these men were working incredibly hard but the picture we get from studying their living quarters is that they managed to recreate a pleasant lifestyle apparently they succeeded in organizing themselves to be able to live like human beings the second bosier project was 100% French sheep breeding the brothers studied rearing techniques in countries they imagined comparable to kirgin the forland islands and Southern Argentina any at the time not many people would have taken the risk to ride off into Patagonia and live with the Indians for 3 years saying I live in the Cen ice to study the reality of breeding sheep and then come back and reproduce the same thing on French territory says in Port CRA Bay far from the Norwegian Factory the bosier model Farm was established on the Island part it was to have been the first of many farms which would eventually cover the island the Shepherds recruited by reny bosier lived here for 10 years and like this one left the mark indelibly Pi PTI was my father he left for K in 1927 he was a policeman in laav and one day doing his rounds down by the port he was told by a ship looking for volunteers to go to Kagan and wave the flag down there seeing as there was nobody down there and the British wanted to take the islands so my father asked to see the person in charge of it all from the busier company he went to see him and after they had made all the arrangements off he went there were three of them two of his policeman friends and their wives and two [Music] daughters they were sent to look after the flops to prove that you could rear sheep and pigs down there that [Music] in their Huts built with odd ends of wood a few pieces of furniture brought from loav were a reminder of a traditional Normandy Farmhouse but like this imitation fireplace could not conceal the reality of their new life [Music] he kept a diary of his time down there in it he talks about the weather going hunting the hunters their problems the cold the wind the snow of course there misery of it all I don it I don there must have been grim you after the summer months there was no pasture for the Sheep on the slopes the pigs on the other hand thrived on an extravagant diet of nothing but meat the pigs ate seal meat of course but the Sheep needed fodder and when no fodder arrived they had no hope of making a go of it thought see you in his diary PTI appealed to his boss with fodder what profits what will we could deliver now it but it hurts me to the quick to see all my poor sheep dying in your letter you say that they should live wild I say they can it just you want he often wrote to Mr buia telling him things weren well but Mr buser didn according to his diary Mr Busia didn pay his letters much attention wanted to have livestock down there at any cost but he refused to send any [Music] F Piti sent his letters by any passing ship but his pleas fell on deaa ears at the time it took ronier almost 3 months to get down there with a stop in South Africa Durban for example the ships were cold powered it was a fullscale expedition to the other side of the world and by the time you got back something else had happened you didn about it took weeks to receive any information because there wasn there wasn you know what and you can send somebody off but then and the busier had other problems one of the ships which came to pick up wool and seal oil sank in Port CRA Bay with 50 Sailors on board be my father took them in and fed them they didn they were often produc to eating seal within a few months the Shepherds had killed all the sea elephants in the bay to feed their families and pigs they began to go further a field in search of their prey on one such Expedition one of them lalud was [Music] killed the three of them had gone hunting together but they were caught in a snowstorm they got totally lost and started going around in circles my father said he to find their camp and bring back food and dry clothes so my father made it back home and when he set off again he saw Minaj coming towards him he said is legalo with you the other man said no I thought he was with you and so they lost him each thinking he was with the other and they found him three or 4 days after he was dead he his eyes picked out by the birds this grave was the first of many the death of other Shepherds through malnutrition marked the end of the busier project the men known as the governors of kgin were powerless to do anything about the developing tragedy the banks had stopped their credit to begin with everything had seemed well organized we all they took with them everything they might possibly need it well planned you see it just went s when they got down there I think it was all a bit utopian the scheme just couldn succeed not unless they pumped even more money into it but it would have been a bottomless pit as I was a dream given the distance how could you hope to develop an island lost in the middle of the ocean might as well have been on the moon 13,000 km by sea from France from the mother country it couldn just couldn work in 1930 the survivors of the buser KGAN by the brothers last remaining ship even the model Factory of Port xandar abandoned by the Norwegians had become a ghost Factory desolation Ireland had overwhelmed its superb boilers and the dream of industrial Conquest the busier Brothers paid the price for their overweening ambition the news of dozens of deaths on kglin and St Paul caused by their lack of foresight provoked a major scandal in France the two brothers lived out their lives in bitterness and Nostalgia and yet they asked that their graves in Normandy be scattered with Earth from the southern islands and a legend began to grow around the collapsed dream of course people like adventurers those who don somewhat that adventurers who succeed Paul Victor for example are the ones people admire though he only ever put himself at risk people always admire those who reach their aim the busier boys had the financial means to be adventurers because you need money don forget but they put all their money into their adventures and that magnificent even if it means losing everything it an ideal that [Music] it no lessons were learned from the bouser France persisted in trying to colonize her Southern [Music] [Music] territories after the second World War the government decided on Military control to reinforce KGAN strategic importance in the Cold War the galleni brought a colonial administrator Pio to Porto FR his mission was to establish a powerful presence with him came a young Firebrand a representative of France mil and Industrial [Music] power the French government of the time sent a mission led by siku to reoccupy kolan and reaffirm French presence on S Amsterdam and K SE finally managed to persuade me to persuade us I should say because there was also my father to set up an industrial complex on kelan that was the start of our involvement markk pinar figure in the Paris sabar business his speciality was a processing of meat byproducts his son was to exploit the family implant their business halfway around the world she did basically it was the realization of a family dream my father had read about the buser 1930s and at the time he had thought they had not gone about it in the right way he wanted to try another [Music] approach I had just left the Army in 1949 the 11th parachute regiment so for me the whole operation was a sort of adventure and a military project also French presence on K and all that everything came together to make a hole if you like wasn of business or profitability it was a mission of sorts you see once again the main targets of this Mission were the sea elephants the track vehicles we used were designed to be crewed by one or maybe two men once they had localized a fat male which was easy at the time because they were all over the place but preferably isolated so that they didn herd the operator then fired a shot into the brain of the animal killing it instantly he then loaded it onto the trailer at the back of the vehicle with a pulley we had decided to build an experimental factory to show that it was feasible to process the whole sea elephant and not just the blubber as the British were doing in south Georgia the challenge was to prove its feasibility but we never did because we closed it down I mean I decided to close it down after two years after a century and a half of Massacre the sea elephants were at last left in peace the government withdrawal from the project brought an end to industrialization on the islands so no airport and no factories from the 1960s the southern territories became a vast natural laboratory devoted to research into animal life and the environment here no one remembers the last sealers but in the tiny Chapel a plaque recalls that Martin pesar was klan [Music] that will always be the beginning of my life as a married woman it long time ago now and it marvelous memory it wasn church and now and again we look back at our photos and all those wonderful times come flooding back you know it wasn honeymoon because once you were there you could devote yourself to to your new spouse there was nothing else to do after all but we didn on the contrary to begin with we were kept very busy and we were very happy I watched the gallani leave and thought well she months but I can concerned you know we were very young at the time we didn that anything would happen to us a medical problem or such like we didn it when the boat came back I was pleased but no more than that I would gladly have stayed a few months more that adventurers in the good sense of the term are all about being adventurous you might say if you always weigh up the pros and cons you would never do anything the adventure has continued since Mark pinar but it has taken a new Direction in the early 1960s the small base at PTO France grew to house a few dozen scientists often young men volunteers doing the national service who came for a year to hibernate as they called it their living conditions were considerably different from those of John nun or Piti and yet They too had the impression of being the first men to set foot on Virgin [Music] soil very the kealan islands represent a universe slightly out of step with the world or with the planet and from a certain point of view it disorientating than the Antarctic for example these Great Dark valleys with the moaning blustery wind sometimes blowing the waterfalls back upwards the Lakes which vaporize and then that feeling of being lost at the end of the world off the end of the world [Music] almost George Pion comes here almost every year year for his research on global warming his first visit was 34 years [Music] ago generally we would go off without radios so there was practically no one who could have come to our Aid nobody knew where we were and in any case there weren possibility of being rescued and if we had an accident maybe we would have been found 6 months or a year later [Music] maybe in 1974 George poan with a group of French Mountaineers climbed Mount Ross 1,865 M high kirg and supposedly unattainable Summit [Music] the Fantastic thing was that a large part of the Island Terror incognit there were still valleys lakes and Glaciers which no human being had ever seen it was probably one of the last places on Earth where you could get an inkling of what it felt like to be an explorer [Music] [Music] being an Explorer is to have the extraordinary privilege of giving the name of your choice to places discovered and secretly appropriated forever George poon and his colleagues have named numerous valleys and waterfalls but the archipelago landowner the one who baptized the most places was the captain of the JB shco haon duti maneuvering his tiny vessel with the skill of a great sailor he ventured into the most inaccessible places naming them after his comrades his fiance or his native Britany the Gulf of the Glennon Islands St an [Music] finger when the first First World War Began jabati left KGAN with his exploration of the island incomplete to return and serve his [Music] country he told the British about his adventures on KGAN and a book was published but the French have only recently discovered this Intrepid and quiet man who resolutely kept himself to himself [Music] there was a big difference in age between us my father was 44 when I was born he wasn man so much so that almost all I know about him is what other people have told me more often than not [Music] kin was an aristocrat a tacon character he was a great sailor but fairly unapproachable he enjoyed a certain kind of [Applause] solitude he used to talk about it sometimes but never to me everything I said to you I found out after his death he had left a trunk with all kinds of documents inside photos news clippings [Music] everything it is one of the most beautiful places you could wish to find despite the landscape wildness it black beaches the snowcapped mountains the Green Sea full of white horses it leaves a memory of something unfinished because much of it is still [Music] unexplored Secrets oh yes there was the secret of the bottle they opened a cave walked in and found a bottle inside was a m a parchment signed by EA Kagan as in Kagan Island they put it back in the bottle and left it where they had found it they didn his diary he mentions it some people from Paris or Marseilles I can asking him to draw a map of the cave so they could find the bottom he replied that he had no objection but he so he could show them he would have liked to have gone back for the Memories anyway they replied saying it wasn took his secret to the Grave [Music] whether e klan in this Bay nobody will ever know and that will be just one more of the Island Secrets if so many people have felt so deeply attached to kgin despite the disappointments inflicted on them it is because the iseland constantly escapes them even if you manage to set foot on it even if you think you have conquered it you never have it guards its secrets jealously [Applause] [Music]	Success
RioÂs Ecological Transformation: Can Nature Be Saved? | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riKWh8ziWBY	SLICE Science	[Music] no this isn control it where 400 people take the Pulse of the city 247 with 12 million inhabitants from downtown to the suburbs Rio is reaching saturation point the risk of total collapse is so present that day and night there are teams of climatologists geologists Town planners and crisis management experts keeping a close eye on the city and all its tensions it afternoon and a car is floating down a Main Avenue on the south side of town the rainy season is a high-risk period for Rio for the last 5 years it been getting worse in 2010 whole areas of the city were wiped out by landslides with more than 500 people dead or missing in 2011 it was the same thing and the biggest ever natural catastrophe in the state of Rio with over 800 victims almost all residents of the poor districts up on the mountain slopes where they had to cut down forests to build there in place and with every storm it all collapses a few minutes before the landslide the family all managed to get away how can a City built by the Sea and surrounded by virgin Forest have so lost touch with nature that it has become a danger to its own inhabitants we will have more flaws and more strongly flaws and we know that and the people in position of more vulnerability are exactly the poor people they are near the rivers they are in places in the mountain and then we need to prepare now looking for 10 20 years ago to prepare the city for a lot of things especially the elevation of sea level Rio de Janeiro is not the only major city on the Brazilian Coast 84% of the country are concentrated in Rio San Paulo Salvador de Baya and reif they have transformed formed the whole coast and destroyed 97% of the Atlantic Forest once more rich in biodiversity than Amazonia this Galloping urbanization siphons all the resources from the interior of the country without the Coast been disrupted but aside from his climatic problems Rio is undergoing a general disruption of the environment the poorest districts are at the heart of this ecological crisis people here build their houses on top of each other with no help or urban planning and are thus exposed to Serious Urban pollution there are no sewers the former streams and riverbeds are all cemented over and that families all crowded together end up the inhabitants have lost all contact with nature there are a lot of territory of the city where live more than 2 million people and special poor people of the city they don Grim they don don service about waste and and Sanity everybody deserves to have and then this is also a social question Rio can no longer hold back what is now an inexorable process the city may be just month away from hosting the World Cup but its famous beaches are fast succumbing to pollution and nobody seems to care it as if the sad truth were hidden by all the [Music] beauty how could this beautiful city the Envy of the world have gotten to this point Rio has turned its back on nature yet it is the fruit of its environment shaped and conditioned by geography like no other huge City on the [Music] planet to understand its history you have to grasp this powerful wild and Monumental geography what is Rio nature first of all there guanabara Bay it square km and was once the most beautiful Bay in the world home to mangroves and whales right up until the 1950s it was also the home to the very first settlers who were fascinated by its unique [Music] geography it was from the bay that the city expanded threading its way through the natural obstacles south of the bay Rio curves Around The Majestic Mount Uka and its Forest to reach the Atlantic then spreads further contained only by the famous moros those gigantic needles of granite that give the city its striking [Music] appearance for centuries Rio continued to hug the [Music] coast but in the 20th century the city broke loose for the first time it outgrew its geography straddling mountains and forests to gain new territory on their way the new districts devastated lagoons marshes estuaries a whole Mosaic of ecosystems only three big forests still stand protected by their steep hills [Music] AR Rio is a very singular city in the world because uh we have a an incredible quantity and quality of natural aets three rainforests two bays lagoons and spectac OIC literal and uh it half people and we are together rich and poor people we don an outside we are everybody mix and mix with this nature Rio is held back by the ocean to the South but another sea borders it to the North a human sea whose waves keep breaking day after day against the city build and up there where the city reaches its limits the forest takes over this forest and the water it produces are Rio of Life three massive wooded areas that together make up the world Urban Forest the last relics of the extraordinary natural world that for century was Rio they bear witness to the powerful ecology that rained here before the Portuguese colonists arrived they were the first to declare war on [Music] nature Jose Padua is an environmental historian he has written several studies of the evolution of Brazilian society and Rio holds no more secrets for him when the Europeans arrived here at the beginning of this 16th century they saw a landscape that was very different from the European one we had a continuous rainforest from Northeast to south Brazil at that time had more than 1 million square kilometers but they they were were not able to perceive that the most precious thing the most precious knowledge the people here had was the knowledge about what they call now uh biodiversity amirian living in small village of five 500 600 people living what they what they saw as a simple life uh they were a little bit disappointed because they did not see here in Brazil what the sies or mines how how like the Spanish uh saw in Mexico and Peru no legendary cities no gold no matter the Portuguese were skilled merchants and they decided to settle Europe was in great need of wood and the tree they called po Brazil was so abundant here they named the country after it when the trees which they used to make dye were all used up they turned to Coffee easy to grow on deforested soil wealthy ever more opulent The Colony soon had 7 million inhabitants all busily cutting down the forest and growing first coffee and then later sugar cane what I call the meat of endless nature this vew that you can use that you can burn Forest here because uh far away you find more forest and more Forest and this was not good for the establishment of sustainable ways of life because gives this impression that you don not to care for the natural resources because they are so so inexhaustible that you you can use them caress in the 19th century it wasn just the forest that seemed inexhaustible of Brazil inhabitants the huge majority 5 million of them were slaves after abolition a huge population was left looking for housing for work and for an [Music] identity to this population of slaves were added in the 19th century fresh migrants drawn from around the world by Rio promise the abulance of the 20th century especially in the 70s radically transformed the city the wealthy built the city of skyscrapers against the backdrop of Virgin forest and with views of the sea the poor just lived wherever they could with the mechanization of agriculture in in Brazilian Countryside in the 1960s and people had to leave the country and and came to the cities so they went to the hills they went to the mangroves and created what we call the the favelas who has not heard of the favelas the dictionary translation is slums or sometimes Shanty towns in reality the first time the term was used was in a district called canudos there was a little square there with a tree called a favella a community grew up around the tree and took its name from it ever since whenever a group of families finds an uninhabited spot and builds houses there they call it a fava true story or or not the fact is there are today 2 million inhabitants of a thousand favellas spread out across the city with no urban planning or politics originally the favelas nobly gave shelter to the poor and the water that ran down from the mountains was pure today those Forest streams run through kilometers of favellas with no purification plants or sanitation the water that flows into the Bay of Rio is polluted toxic even biologist Mario moscatelli is a key figure in nature conservation in Rio above all though he spokesman for all those who like him are tired of the city powerlessness of the state he by residents associations and real estate companies and once a week he flies over the bay in the lagoons of Rio to monitor the pollution and denounce the polluters [Music] in the 80s you could still find 40 different species of fish in this Lagoon but there species left the tilapia there used to be hundreds of species of birds reptiles mammals today there species left but you do find sofas TV chairs bodies anything it no more water it contaminated not a drop of oxygen and with all the gases it gives off the sulfur and the methane it makes your eyes Sting the smells unbearable it stinks in this 130 hectare area we had to install about 2 km of fencing I think I must be one of the world most qualified garbage men I spend 95% of my time me a biologist stopping rubbish getting into regeneration zones and clearing rubbish out of them it garbage and the civilization that producing it all and chucking it into streams and rivers [Music] observing Rio muscatelli has seen Urban and industrial pollution poisoning ecosystems in the Bay from the lagoons the marshes and even the Lakes throughout the whole of Rio and its [Music] suburbs is it irreversible no there magnificent virgin forests at the Heart of the City there are still build true ecological Treasures it is thanks to these forests that Rio could one day Get Back To Nature up there the forest is Nature barometer there are species of animals that have been there for more than 25,000 years the force of nature is still strong [Music] 3.6 cm venicius is one of the rare Urban biologists to take an interest in Rio surviving animals like this frog that only found here on a 100 met stretch of river deep in the forest folklore says that these are magical creatures but this one looks so small and fragile ianus is endemic to this region amphibians are the Sentinels of the environment the presence here of this individual indicates that this park has an excellent level of Environmental Quality even of the water in the park in well preserved areas covered with forest and little streams the quality of the environment attains a level that favors the presence of these animals the further down you go in the forest the more Wastewater you find emptying into the rivers so when you get near the houses these amphibians tend to [Music] disappear no princess has ever kissed it but all the same this little frog proper name eloia nasus is still proof of a miracle there are still many preserved areas from which Rio could regenerate itself the battle is not [Music] lost the water from the forests arrives in the lagoon polluted so Mario muscatelli wants to purify it but how by replanting along the shore the mangroves those forests on stilts that live to the rhythm of the tides they are a veritable biomechanical machine for depolluting the water a natural way of putting air back into the [Music] water it [Music] mangroves because they Wards and supermarkets they filters they maintain the diversity of the whole intertropical coastal zone there are many other e systems such as the coral reefs but especially on the Brazilian Coast both small and Commercial fishermen as well as ecotourism all depend on the mangroves without them there fish no crabs practically no biodiversity in 13 years with the help of the municipality Mario rebuilt plant by plant 30 hectares of Mangrove through urbanization the airport the embankments and industrialization the Bay has lost 60% of its surface and is getting dangerously dry the greatest loss 35 years ago was the 130 hectar of Mangrove buried beneath the city landfilled the size of a 130 football stadiums right next to the city and right on the bay at water level in 201 12 aware of the ecological emergency the municipality decided to close the dump but for 35 years gramacho covered these days by a thick coat of soil accumulated 9,000 tons of waste per day the closure of the landfill was both a difficult decision and a difficult task there were 20,000 recyclers the catadores working there in nightmarish condition risking their lives every day amongst the constant trucks and the whims of the bulldozers and rendering the site inaccessible but after years of false promises the city of Rio has at last closed gramacho it the city of a political will that took shape only a month before the Earth Summit since the closure most of the recyclers have been encouraged to leave and paid off Rose who made her living from the dump did not want to leave along with her husband she opened a little Recycling business every day she stocks up from castoffs at the shopping centers and here and there in the city sorting and resorting the waste to sell it on to wholesalers in 2 years she has gone from a horse to a little van and now a truck these days she can load a ton of waste every trip and usually recycles 800 kilos of it before I worked at the landfill I didn wasn recycle we threw stuff around and wasted a lot of it so I learned to recycle and to think of the environment and nature I came to understand a lot about nature and I learning we got where we are today thanks to the landfill plastic scrap iron aluminum paper cardboard glass rose and Marco orelio sort 20 sacks a day the plastic sells at45 cents the kilo cardboard and paper fetch 25 cents their hard work means their children now go to school [Music] to get rid of its 9,000 tons a day of waste Rio has opened an ultramodern landfill this time far from the sea where the waste is treated in a controlled environment 2 years after the closure guanabara Bay is starting to look healthier people are making a bit of money they fish that I reckon it [Music] the closing down of gramacho has been hailed as the end of a crime against nature and day by day nature is reasserting herself leaving behind the days when she was run out of town until the 1970s uh Brazilian government was asking companies that produced a lot of pollution in the in Europe and I Sayes to come to Brazil because they published uh a advertisement saying welcome pollution we are open for pollution the policy of excessive development belongs to 20th century history today Rio wants to move into a new era with a new face A Greener soul and action symbolic of its respect for Life 3 years ago the minister of the environment set up a research group both biologists and urban planners testified that the city stability depended principally on its three forests the sole Refuge of surviving Greenery from the primary forest and today isolated from each other and thus unable to regenerate so the work group founded a pilot project to open up the three Upland areas linking them by way of all the pockets of greenery that still exist here and there in Rio and thus allowing life to circulate once more through the corridors created the project is codenamed green corridors the points on this map all show the priority zones to be linked the aim is to mend the ecosystem of Rio with lifelines that knit together the forests and parks with the urban zones what Hills there the extremities of the two masss have become densely built up this Basin Here is known as a jakar pagua district it challenges to recuperate these zones where we amount of replanting it circulate between the two massives along our big green corridor the idea of the Eco corridors is to restore the exchange between biotopes at one time the plain the marshes the lake and the ocean all communicated and their ecosystems were interdependent the corridors open up the canals again freeing the waters to mingle and regenerate revitalizing both flora and fauna in a mutual Exchange [Music] this section of green Corridor is actually part of the system of lagoons if you picture the coastline OFA there deavia down there and lagoons all along the seafront the green Corridor here is made up of canals that are passages between the conservation units down there there side and on the other the pedra branca and here marshes that are part of the Lagoon system so there are always canals where you find animals that need water and [Music] vegetation the Cy B the largest rodent in the world has been the first to benefit from the Prototype corridors it is adept at moving into new territory and as a species is now able to revitalize its genetic stock and on the way like all animals it to regenerate the vegetation the other animals are following the capy bar into these corridors and enriching City Life the urban forests are the biological reservoirs from which Wildlife is starting to take back the city of Rio the monkeys true opportunists are already surging into the city ever cheekier bands of Kates are launching raids on the city as it renews its link with nature [Music] the copy barers have made themselves at home by the lagoons they and protected it Beast to coexist in the city though and the local alligator is in danger of paying the price Ricardo malaguti A young biologist works with the Cayman these anti-u animals called jakare by the Indians who live in the shallows of a lake now encircled by the city have lent their name to the district built on their territory jakare paga there are about 3 to 4,000 of them in Rio here in the city of Rio De Janeiro it risk for inhabitants [Music] stories go around about pet dogs being eaten while out for their walk in reality the Cayman are fascinating ultimately it are a danger to the jakare [Music] our studies in Rio show that Cayman numbers are very high for the region we just over 400 of them so far so do the Cayman have Chihuahua or toy poodle remains in their tummies in fact all the biologists find is chickens all we found in the stomach of this animal is food it has been given these animals have stopped hunting for their own food they just sit here and wait to be [Music] fed I always walk by here I come and visit them every day I love seeing them if you throw them food you to destroy their social behavior if they don conditioned and dependent you must have noticed the number of Cayman is growing around here Rio are leaving their nesting areas and losing their predatory instincts Ricardo malaguti is worried for the species future Rio will just have to learn to live with the Beast the green corridors are the result of a policy of reforestation inaugurated 25 years ago 6 million trees have been replanted in areas where they had disappeared ecological issues seem to be getting through to the politicians for a long time there a general attitude to development that doesn asset this is a tropical country and nature here is an essential feature of Our Lives we have a lot of plants in the city in 3 years no part of Rio De Janeiro will be far from 10 minutes 15 minutes walking a Green Park we will plant 24 million trees and we will try to distribute this green areas around the city and other place where they uh where they don really the same nature we have here if the authorities are to apply these policies of reforestation and green networks they reconquer some hither to inaccessible urban areas the [Music] favellas rios in the hands of the drug traffickers who make use of the miles and miles of Labyrinth in little Alleyways the Brazilian police are starting to take back the [Music] city over the last 10 years they cleaned up half of the 1,000 favellas [Music] at last the favellas are opening up to urban renewal and in the meantime the cleanup has had a surprising consequence it has put Rio with an unjustly overlooked sector of its population the cleanup was a good thing because there violence people have more contact they can learn like here now you can be here now it wouldn before well it would but it would have been a whole big number but more surprising still is that they didn help from the authorities to start getting back to Nature many people and associations were already working to achieve harmony with nature their quiet approach to ecology is as ingenious as it is exemplary in the alimao fava Edson Gomez has initiated an Eco project worthy of being taken up by all Rio disadvantaged communities the sustainable favella his Association is called verar or reg green its aim is to improve people to give children in the favellas a better future [Music] as far as we know we the first to suggest environmental work in the flla and we been working on this for 15 years a work group on the vegetable garden which you we there this is a project to create sustainable housing in the favellas with garbage collection Waste Water treatment solar powerered hot water energy production and storm water treatment we selective waste sorting we want to recuperate organic waste for compost and to plant trees grow vegetable gardens produce food reforest and capture carbon the association the occupied when they they to verar may be financially poor but it is certainly rich in the contact it can give children with nature one day people say the FAA will come down the mountain and conquer the city but we say it it Brazil with joy with Sport with love and music and painting [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] right opposite verar another Community has also taking its Destiny into its own hands in the viid Dal FAA Manuel who used to quari and carv marble has been creating Gardens to his neighbors he since 1996 he mosquito and disease infested filth they sleep better now thanks to him and they have the gardens to breathe in and get some [Music] rest St we community in 1996 we got together and decided to do something for the environment there was a huge tip with all tires and plastic bottles and we cleaned it all up City Hall the Rio state government none of them had done anything for the environment so we got together and transformed this huge pile of trash into an oasis of green for all the generations to come it something for the environment from their favellas or wherever they are in the vastness of Rio graa Edson Gomez Manuel and their friends are doing all they can to help Rio once again open its windows to the world that surrounds it a natural world of tropical Beauty too long [Music] neglected us true Karas from the Rio Community when we look at our Rich cousins IA Leblon kabana we heaven if God ever made anything as beautiful as this view well I never saw it just look [Music] taken as a whole all these spontaneous initiatives contribute in their way to the green corridors policy the idea of the green corridors is to link together the big centers but also the small and medium-sized ones right down to individual houses it we all the wildlife we Birds turning up in different parks along the green [Music] Corridor the people of Rio getting back to the nature they once had relies on the small initiatives as much as on the big ones they multiplying and things are speeding up but if it being a city of nature Rio also needs its [Music] Visionaries there has the political will and who also has the trust of all the people his name is ji he and it was his dream for Rio to become the green Capal of the planet in 2020 all of Rio is looking to his Charisma and his humanist Vision to make the renovation of the favellas really happen this tireless Town planner has been working for 15 years to reunify the city a city divided both geographically and socially his first project set out his aims a cable car that Soares above the favellas that he wants to open up and turn [Music] green there big issue in Rio as is the sheer impact of the landscape itself the cable car system is one way to restructure things between those areas that are excluded and included which will both benefit from this new Urban vision the cable car obviously encourages social Mobility what we call debunker iing I think today we can fulfill L dream with aerial connections lighting cable cars and other things that don harm the earth I see the introduction of vegetation as a fundamental need that has to go hand inand with urbanization and that remains to be done there still a lot of work to do here in jai become a green sustainable City it first has to have social justice and eradicate the inequalities between the rich and the poor areas Rio of the future is one city not two in his City laboratory Jai is working to link The Outsider communities to Rio main ecosystem his efforts have even included lifting up trains this is mongos one of the most complex favas in Rio they call it the gasa strip you just couldn or night it was completely overrun by drug dealers and now it up the main thing was to create a public space that would connect the two separate ends of the flla by raising the railway line it still needs all the greenery the plan is to hang plants under each Arch and plant trees along either [Music] side Jai has already renovated thousands of dwellings in more than 20 favelas he program the favellas the city of Rio the federal state and the banks have all invested more than $600 million to little by little transform the favellas into real neighborhoods with the success of the early schemes the municip IP ality has greenlighted work on 100 more favellas they water energy Street lighting and sanitation without which pollution is a major problem Rio has been choking on its own waste but jai gradually making the dream possible to become the world symbol of the sustainable City Humane functional and respectful of the environment [Music] Rio is hoisting the green flag intent on setting the example for the World Cup the famous Marana stadium is going ecological producing some of its own energy and recycling its rainwater but after the World Cup will come another planetary scale event that could act as a catalyst for Rio and the second in October 2009 the 2016 Olympic games were awarded to Rio De Janeiro will the Olympic Games give Rio the extra momentum it any rate the city is clearly pulling out all the stops on the greenness and sustainability of its plans it has promised the world a clean City for the Olympics being chosen for the Olympics is a great victory for Rio on the international stage it which Brazil has changed over the last decade these are all factors that mean we can now take the necessary measures to resolve our environmental problems the city of Rio has promised that the 10 billion euros for the games will also be used to sanitize the favellas create public transport clean up the bay and make up for lost time in making Rio a sustainable City now this financial Mana just has to be used well for moscatelli it all depends on the attitude of the politicians we real on rebuilding the Marana we need 550 million just to dredge this area it priorities operationally technically I sure we can still reverse the process we have to start by immediately dredging the bay we have to take out five or 6 million cubic meters of mud and waste then we have to recuperate the banks by replanting mangroves and marshlands and set up treatment plants on the rivers to stop waste and sewage getting into the Lagoon system if we can chaos on both local and Regional levels in 3 years it the money will be gone and the political will will evaporate once the spotlights off of us will Rio at last seize the chances being offered by its moment of Fame we with nature now and making it a cultural asset people are increasingly understanding that we have to put nature first we have to use it to improve our conditions our whole way of life uh people live in cities feel cities feel the transformations in the climb and uh put pressure in their leaders in their Mayors that reason cities around the world go fastly than nations in this which is the more important questions of the New Years and decades in the Rio landscape there are some conspicuous signs of transformation 1992 at the first Earth Summit Rio started the whole planet questioning itself today Rio Strikes Again by building the most forward-looking Museum in the world the Museum of tomorrow [Music] it Nautilus a museum in Reverse instead of exhibiting the past it shows us the future a long dreamed of era where between man and his environment it about conflict or profit it respect and balance in sustainable cities built on nature and with nature and the postcard that is Rio will be a much brighter picture with green forests with blue bays and with equality for its people

in what weather world would such systems move 100 years from now predictions of future climate have won climatologist Jean Pascal van iersel a Nobel Prize for science well climate is going to change in the next 100 years mostly through the uh effect of human activities and greenhouse gases and the main change is an average warming of the temperature at the surface of the planet and there storm activity just how those storms do change concerns scientists and forecasters of the hurricane research community in Miami Florida there is still significant debate about how hurricanes may change um as climate changes there are modelers who are running 100-year scenarios that clearly show that the potential energy available for hurricanes will become [Music] greater most of the uh these climate models are saying that we numbers of Storms and hurricanes as the climate warms uh but then people also say that hurricanes are becoming strong longer the strength of the landfall of Hurricane Sandy made it the second most expensive hurricane of all time during the night of October 28th 2012 it would change the lives of thousands this is part of the brick Township and a half miles of the Barrier Island and this is the aftermath of uh superstorm or hurricane Sandy that house that you see behind us here was actually up uh up by the beach and uh and that came down so uh there underneath this house uh obviously the forklifts that you see and just the force of the water uh is really unimaginable because you when you look around and you see the devastation you never before would I I my life would I believe that I something like this [Music] despite its great size this was a modest category 1 storm a deadly storm but was it the super storm of the future we were here for Irene last year and the water came up to the edge of the boardwalk never went any further and it would really didn people that have been down here a lot longer than myself they said they in all their years 50 years have never seen anything like this and you can see what it it did it was it it to be something again that no one could have ever expected to do this kind of damage if the storm only had relatively weak winds why was it so destructive Sandy was producing uh category 1 hurricane force winds but it was such a large storm it tropical storm force winds extended from the Carolinas up through much of New England when we size and storm surge it to think about how the storm is pushing this water on Shore if you take your hand across a swimming pool and push just a little bit of water it doesn move very much but if you take your entire arm across the top of that swimming pool you of water and that at with storm sides so it is not simply how often future storms would strike but how damaging they will be in terms of size and Power satellites encircling the planet collect the best data for computer models of future hurricane Trends do we have more uh cop storms and hurricanes uh in the historical database now than we did years ago absolutely yes and the reason for that and my opinion the primary reason of that is improvements and observations uh I mean if you think about it before we had satellites how do we even know we had a hurricane out in middle of the Atlantic Ocean satellite measurements were not available before with a good quality and therefore we only have a relatively short uh record to talk about the the trends uh in Hurricane activity official weather records only go back about 160 years to extend our data set of when and where hurricanes have hit we need to look deeper into the past okay that is too short for us to understand the frequencies of very intense but very rare hurricanes and that is why we uh try to extend that record that period of observation from 160 years to two or 3,000 years so that we can have a longer period of time during which uh more hurricanes like Katrina uh did happen but the past does not give up its Secrets [Music] easily and so part of the objectives of our work here uh is to try to uh find uh evidence of ancient hurricanes and try to reconstruct uh their frequencies during the last hundreds or thousands of years the team are looking for traces of sand layers in the muddy swamp deposits telltale signs of a powerful hurricane in the past the soil itself serving is a natural Archive of thousands of years of weather events well when we open our core we expect that the storm surge deposit uh will have a different character visually because the mineral and chemical composition may be different uh and also the storm search deposit uh may be of a different texture you see this uh root here that uh lying horizontally it could have been washed in by uh by water but uh just looking at the color you see is very different this is most likely uh the hurricane ISAC deposit and it may go from here uh down to about uh here but when we come down to here then we can see the suit and Clay laminations you know beautiful layers of you know darker bands and lighter bands this material uh might be several thousand years old by analyzing many cores sampled across an area they out how often big storms have occurred we found that the most intense hurricanes like uh category four and five hurricanes they have a typical rate of hitting the same site maybe once every 300 years or so the study of cycles of hurricane activity over time is helping geologists and climatologists to form a view of future climate Trends assembling all that information uh gives a a relatively complete picture of how climate has evolved in the past and that climate models in order to um to have confidence in them when they are used to look at the future complex computer models lead them to believe that hurricanes may actually become less frequent but that it is not the full picture in a warmer climate hurricanes might become more intense even though they would become less frequent which means that although there will be fewer storms overall more of them will be the most damaging of major hurricanes the hurricane is still IR event and our memories are very short I in Miami uh we went through a category 5 hurricane hurricane Andrew in 1992 but with time people forget what these hurricanes can do societies affected by hurricanes would do well to recall such major storms because the past can help us prepare for future impacts one country that has not forgotten the deadly effects of hurricanes is Cuba Jose rubiera had head of the meteorological service remembers a turning point in his country storm planning hurricane Flor was the first hurricane hitting Cuba After the Revolution it was in 1963 it was the second greatest natural catastrophe in cuan history Castro was very very affected by the amount of casualties that Cuba had uh in this hurricane was a terrible [Music] hurricane as Cuba counted the cost Castro Institute of meteorology with special focus on Hurricane forecasting Cuban Society is structured in such a way that the lessons of hurricane Flora are adhered to evacuation orders are obeyed construction tightly regulated and forecasting driven by a single clear voice er point for a state-driven hurricane action plan that is totally supported by the populace our country Cuba has a long-standing understanding of hurricanes mainly due to Dr rubi efforts when the hurricane is close to making landfall people are already evacuated Cuba is one of the safest places to be when a hurricane event makes landfall the Cuban authorities are very concerned about what will happen to the people the aim is State govern protection whatever the future brings in the last 17 years we have seen nine hurricanes stronger than flora and the loss of life have minimum but the storms scarred buildings of ancient Havana serve as a constant reminder that direct impacts from future hurricanes have the potential to be catastrophic Cubans are acutely aware that the worst May yet be to come with global temperatures continuing to rise at 4° fah per decade conditions are likely to Foster the formation of increasingly severe [Applause] storms but even without the effects of climate change the probability is that we will witness an Atlantic landfall from a storm of s the power of an Andre or Flora such storms may become a more common occurrence with up to a 50% increase in major category storms a possibility the heavily developed coast of the Eastern United States is at risk no where more so than the thin strip of coastal Barrier Islands Barrier Islands Fringe thousands of miles of the East Coast bearing the brunt of any storm weather and Sheltering the mainland Born and Raised on Florida East Coast Tim Palmer is concerned by the changes he Islands there on the Barrier Islands but it seems like there development place places that were all sea grapes and mangroves and caseras now a lot of times are host to Condominiums and parking lots you know it to build on the Riverside of the Barrier Island because that protected by the rest of the land but when you start putting these high-rise condominiums on the ocean side not only are you building them in a place where they could possibly be endangered someday but also you vegetation which gives the Barrier Island its fabric that holds it [Music] together if you get a minimal hurricane even that punch through places in the Barrier Island it once the Sea Oats and the sea grapes and the mangroves have been [Music] removed it studied by a us Geological Survey team led by Abby Salinger it a completely natural situation the Barrier Islands uh would would migrate landward uh and they would have room to migrate landward but but around the around the country we have built uh so much infrastructure in place either on the Barrier Islands or just immediately on the mainland on the mainland side of the barrier islands that that in a lot of places there room for the island to to evolve further uh you know particularly places like Miami Beach or Ocean City or Virginia Beach with huge buildings uh you have fixed the location in place but yet the natural system wants to move landward and humans now come in and try to maintain the islands where they are and and we have seen over and over that that that can be a losing game in 2011 Hurricane Irene crossed the pamco sound in North Carolina as a large category 1 storm it attacked the outer Bank islands near Cape hatus driving a storm surge of about 6 ft across the sound it breached the Barrier Islands repeatedly the storm smashing Bridges shattering roads and destroying houses along a 250 M stretch of coast aby Seaboard of the Eastern United States using laser imagery called lidar precisely mapping the topography to identify future weak spots in coastal defenses this is airboard lar data uh the first that uh we received back from our partners in Noah shows very clearly uh the houses along the beach and how close some of the uh Cottages here are to the ocean the islands themselves are extremely vulnerable to damage and Tim believes construction only serves to increase that risk every time we through it always seems to be fairly near where we we buildings these barrier islands are pretty much made to to shift around they get bigger they get smaller the sand piles up the sand washes away when we put a building on it that really really kind of disrupts the you know the natural cycle but desire to build on the ocean doorstep is increasing with sea levels Rising that puts more people at greater risk [Music] the occurrence of major category storms is predicted to be more frequent and with beach sand playing a vital role in protecting coasts the scale of ongoing beach erosion concerns Alfredo torella when a storm impacts a beach the beach sheds its sand creating a sandb which causes the waves to break offshore taking the pressure off the beach so it but that after a storm passes the normal waves then restore the beach to its previous condition so that that assumes a cycle but that natural cycle is already broken by Coastal development to compensate the US Army Corps of Engineers oversees a vast program of beach replenishment at the cost of many millions of dollars each year in Florida one of the world largest dredging ships pumps Marine sand ashore in an operation overseen by program manager Jackie Kaiser in Florida the the sand generally flows from north to south and as development has taken place we reduced the width of beaches we away Dunes so folks can have an ocean view which all uh intercept sand that would otherwise be moving down the coast interrupting that natural Southward flow of sand with human structures creates turbulence that results in sand being lost to the ocean as the shoreline Reeds we Beacher nourishment to try to maintain a a shoreline and maintain a a good width of burm to act as a protective barrier for hurricanes or major storm events the Army Corps budgets millions of dollars a year both to rebuild beaches and dredge clear storm damage when the sand washes away what the answer has been over the last few decades is to just pump sand from you know the bottom offshore and they just pile it up onto the beach I go on now for probably 25 years and it seems as fast as they put it onto the beach it goes right back off again the sad thing is that not only does all the all the work and all the money towards building up the beach seem to be wasted but also the sand piles up on the natural reefs that we have out here just off of the beach when a hurricane erods a beach many people sometimes feel like well that was a waste of money we we spent all that money to get our beach and now it designed the beach to do to sacrifice itself for the Upland structures and for human health and safety and our infrastructure the immense task of replacing the natural cycle with engineering efforts will increase as sea levels rise if we stopped dredging for Beacher nourishment in Florida there would be a devastating effect to the economy tourism alone is a60 billion industry or income producer for the State of Florida and it federal tax producer as well the hotels the streets the schools the hospitals the roads uh would basically be abandoned at some point due to storm damages in economic terms we need to keep pumping sand but the question is whether the sand alone can adequately defend against the worsening storms of the future with the danger from landfalling hurricanes increasing the growing Coastal populations need ever more protection to the built infrastructure well protective action uh is uh can be seen in in two categories one is adaptation is is kind of uh weather proofing having better um building codes so that when intense wind or rain comes those uh infrastructures can resist better in 1992 cap 5 Hurricane Andrew smashed into Florida south of Miami an event that was to change the standards of an entire industry today Hurricane Safety building codes are enforced by inspectors like Eugenio Santiago I think Andrew taught us a very very valuable lesson we need to make sure that things are built the right way both from the design point of view and from the construction point of view and just what dangers are those changed regulations seeking to prevent well the worst damage is what we call the envelope the envelope is what protects the perimeter of the building it those two fails then wind gets inside and just destroys the building you blow in a balloon and you blow long enough the balloon explodes that happened to a house this damage was inflicted by a category one storm we are threatened by far worse Hurricane Andrew uh will be remembered for extremely intense Category 5 hurricane uh but it was not the big one Andrew was a small hurricane extremely small if we had a more typical size hurricane or even a large hurricane like Sandy or Katrina and the strength of Andrew the damage uh would have been much much worse civil engineers like Forest Masters plan for precisely that scenario we and property during extreme wind events and in order to do that we have to have a very clear picture of the wind and wind driven rain environment the work we filling in a critical Gap we measurements in the building stock you know amongst the buildings in hurricanes this is where the damage happens those field observations are taken to the laboratory to be tested in safety but first they have to recreate the hurricane so we built a machine to replicate hurricane conditions in a controlled setting we can generate up to 230 mph winds and this creates significant pressures on the roof coverings and in turn that allows us to find exactly when the failure threshold is expected to occur let bring it up or we can carefully control the wind speed to replicate what happens on an actual roof the endgame is to design roofing materials that can withstand the wind speed of the most severe hurricanes [Music] [Music] 28,000 houses were destroyed by Hurricane Andrew in less than 24 hours in the most severe winds even vertical structures are at risk to test designs the team built the dynamic pressure loading actuator which creates hurricane load conditions on the side of buildings have Daniel put the second the camera and the second panel down from the top okay just make sure the traceable spheres are in the line of sight okay yeah it looks good all right okay this particular system is designed to produce an extreme amount of pressure think about the types of loads that would occur on the top of a skyscraper in a category 5 storm or an ef4 tornado on a lowrise building and that would give you a sense of the magnitude of the power all set all right Scott go ahead and start the engine so we can begin the test okay [Music] [Music] [Music] ultimately we environment where Manu ufacturers can push boundaries they can try new things they can innovate and understand that what they will happen in a real hurricane event and that hopefully will give them the confidence they need to push forward to keep advancing their Technologies civil engineers are improving modern designs with the aim of surviving Category 5 wind speeds of 150 mph or more but a major storm landfall brings Far More Than Just Wind it attention of physical oceanographers at the University of Miami in Florida a major Category 5 storm may have waves well over 30 ft high and it not just the wave size that matters because their height can be doubled by the storm here they can study in safety the potential impact of waves on man-made structures using models with rising sea levels the damage from future storms will be even greater sea level rise is um a parameter that is now well measured uh throughout the world and it is now very clear from those measurements that sea level has increased on average by almost 20 CM since uh the beginning of the 20th century and it because the projections for the end of this Century show a possible increase in sea level that and uh 1 meter more than three ft potentially the big changes for millions of people living close to a coast whatever form the Hurricanes of the future du take there is no doubt their reach will stretch ever further Inland the changing pressures and extreme Winds of a major hurricane may cause a tidal storm surge 20 ft high as rising sea levels Force such surges to new heights Coastal erosion is set to increase beach erosion is driven by high energy events really and uh because Puerto Rico is in the in the smack daab in the middle of the path of hurricanes uh every summer or every hurricane season rather uh we are subject to Serious erosional events so uh absolutely Hurricanes play a big role in beach erosion in Puerto Rico and that role is likely to grow if major hurricanes become more common in the future but San Juan has an unlikely defense the reefs off San Juan are actually surprisingly healthy in in certain pockets of course there are areas that that are quite devastated but it looking at at some beautiful corals and and stick your head out of water and see a a metropolitan City just one mile away Alfredo has known for years that reefs absorb wave energy but he didn how much in 2011 he had a chance to find out tropical storm Irene is just east of Puerto Rico and uh we intensifies to a hurricane uh anytime now well the idea is to record uh the currents and waves during the storm something which has uh never actually been done here in Puerto Rico But ultimately H we want to see what effect H the waves have uh on the erosion of the beach uh as they are transformed by the effect of the reefs because there offshore in front of the city of San Juan and we want to see how they interact how the reefs interact with the waves and the currents and what effect that has on the erosion of the beaches during a storm [Music] with the storm a mere 18 hours away there [Music] waste essentially the instrument is about a 3ft cylinder and we affix it to a base that diving and go to the bottom of the ocean and secure it to the to the bottom of the [Music] ocean we plac these instruments outside of the fringing reef and inside of the fringing reef so that we could have a record of the waves and the currents associated with the storm with Hurricane Irene later we took that information and used it to calibrate a model of the entire area and using the model we could examine the wave patterns and the current patterns that the hurricane generated Irene strengthened into a category 1 hurricane over Puerto Rico with powerful waves striking the North [Music] Coast the 30-ft waves generated by Hurricane Irene as it passed San Juan lost over 90% of their energy on the offshore reefs only 10% reached the beaches of the city if those reefs weren impact on the shore the energy arriving the shore would be 10 times as great if you want to understand the forces involved picture this one cubic yard of water is approximately one ton similar to the weight of a small car well imagine a wave containing dozens and dozens of cubic yards of water hurling at you about 20 mph the forces are certainly significant take that up to the next level a hurricane generates waves in excess of 30 40 50 ft we talking literally thousands of the equivalent of small cars being hurled at you at 20 M hour the impact is truly devastating and now we have one more uh reason why we need to preserve these reefs and and that reason is that without the reefs they would not block the the wave energy during storms and the city of San Juan would not exist as it does today many cities around the Caribbean Sea were built using the protection of offshore reefs but today those reefs are in serious decline the loss of protective coral reefs is a vital issue in low-lying South Florida where the mo Marine tropical Laboratories Research into Solutions led by David vaugh the Florida keys are a place where our elevations here are only a few meters so without our barrier to wave action and storms such as a coral reef uh it Keys we outer Reef corals those were the first barrier uh to things like Storm surges and wave actions we have lost 25% of the world past 20 to 40 years because we some of those bigger outer Reef corals like the elorn those Majestic corals that were out in the Forefront but 98% of those are gone and so now our coral reefs are much more susceptible to wave action in its natural state Coral is less and less capable of protecting shorelines from hurricanes its decline is largely a result of human activities such as over fishing industry and pollution but can the clock be turned back in any other species they do what called restoration if a forest burns down we know how to grow a new tree and replant a forest we the past 10 years years to see if corals can be restored and replanted and the good news is it working it originally thought one team of biologists from mooch Marine is aiming to restore the reefs of the Caribbean stagghorn Coral has always been uh adapted to deal with um weather events like hurricanes uh a big part of its its natural process for reproduction is that it can break into smaller pieces during storm and and events like that and each of those pieces can anchor themselves to the reef and reestablish as a whole new Colony but those stagghorn colonies have all but disappeared it important corals here in the Florida Keys as far as um building the reefs um and it the greatest decline in the last uh few decades it has the greatest potential though for restoration because it of the faster growing species of corals here in the Keys um but a bigger part of this project is we work with Partners um throughout all of South Florida and the rest of the Caribbean so that we have these these uh Coral nurseries spread out uh throughout the Caribbean all sort of following the same procedures and with the same intent um but that way no one Nursery is if we were to be impacted by a storm or hurricane here in the other Keys uh we could just work with our other partners in other regions and the project would continue to move forward great [Music] flourishing in the shallows is a farm of living Rock healthy live hard coral has a thin outer skin of living tissue that manufactures an inner Limestone skeleton which gives strength and form uh because we live in an area that impacts um we account with the way that we we grow our corals we grow it in several different methods anchored to the bottom uh some of them are hanging in in midwater structures that can move with the waves and the tides these corals they grow quickly and if we do it in a controlled environment where we can uh take care of these smaller pieces um and and grow them up to a size where they some of these other stressors out on the reef and we put them out in the reef in enough numbers and with enough diversity um we these small compact populations that will um cross fertilize each other and repopulate the entire Reef tract but the ocean itself is changing making the task ever more more [Music] difficult we have burned a little more than 500 billion tons of carbon since the beginning of the industrial period around 150 billion tons of that carbon have been absorbed by the oceans therefore contributing to the acidification of the ocean which is also a problem acids dissolve calcium carbonate which forms Coral skeletons it is whether an acidifying ocean affects living Coral that is the subject of research here in Miami for scientist Ian Enix corals are very complex structures they have all sorts of uh surface indentations multiple branches and because of that um we actually use 3D scanning here I have a sample of the endangered um stagghorn Coral uh we have grown these Corals in a laboratory that we have that very precisely mimics uh conditions that are predicted for the end of the century so we can monitor living corals as it changes in different ocean acidification conditions by using scanning techniques to look inside the coral skeletons they have confirmed that it is becoming weaker and less capable of growth so we know that ocean acidification affects reefs in really two different ways one this the coral is actually slow down and two the natural organisms that erode The Reef that actually increases as well so we have a really difficult situation of slowing growth and increasing erosion and clearly this is very difficult to maintain a healthy Reef ecosystem if the ocean continues to acidify and warm coral reefs will find it ever harder to grow in a sustainable fashion the team at Mo Marine are trying to preempt the changes we trying to predict what the reefs will be like whether we like it or not uh I guess we are building a reef of Tomorrow identifying what exactly the coral of those futuristic reefs will be is the focus of new research the experiment we have going on is called our ocean acidification system in which we can vary the pH from what it was a few years ago to what it is today to what it may be 20 or 50 years from now and in the offshore Farm there are plans for the future as well our stag harn project uh By Design was trying to get as me many genetic variations of the same species out there and so we watching all of these different Coral genetic strains some seem to be growing better and we different ocean conditions which ones are going to be winners if global warming goes unchecked the ocean will continue to become more hostile to Coral growth so 50 to 100 years from now we may have to restore corals a couple of times before there by global warming high temperatures and ocean acidification but I 10 years to almost completely restore the reefs the way they used to [Music] be despite these efforts with climate changing Coral faces an uncertain future just like the Barrier Islands the natural defenses our forbearers built their cities behind are becoming ever less secure events of November 2013 set a terrible precedent when this monster storm made landfall it completely destroyed the city of taban in the Philippines 45 ft waves and 200 mph winds left at least 6,000 dead it was Cat 5 super typhoon hyan scientists predict such Super Storms will become more common worldwide how seriously should we take these predictions we can intensity forecast out to 5 days so I not sure how accurate that it be out you know 100 years validating a climate model based on the data we have the Earth historical part is difficult we have very little relevant data available with which to make a comparison with our ongoing simulations what is clear is that the sea level increase will render the effects of hurricanes and tropical storms in general stronger and more damaging no matter how many hurricanes we have in the future if there are more hurricanes or fewer hurricanes or the same number of hurricanes whatever hurricanes we have are likely call cause more damage because of the gradual sea level R and it it therefore the tidle surge will be a foot higher it that it could be many miles further Inland despite the increasing danger the desire to build right on the ocean threshold is continuing on invaded Wilderness with its remaining natural defenses ever more rare if you look at development you know we continue to develop these coastal areas these very vulnerable coastal areas and most local politicians see that as a good thing you know if you increase the population nicer homes which we usually have on the coast uh that increases the tax base but development in search of economic benefit risks putting Society In Harm may not be able to protect us the problem is is much wider than just a scientific problem it technical problem an economic problem a human problem a moral problem to solve these problems collectively perhaps our crowded Society of today should take note of the wisdom of citizens in Louisiana over 150 years ago in sit Louisiana there called ilir it Barrier Island to the West along the the coast of Louisiana back in the 1850s uh it was developed as a resort one year in 1856 a hurricane Cable log and and it killed half of the people there every house every structure of the island was laid flat and what happened was they decided not to rebuild within the United States this is very very unusual uh after a major storm comes through our first response is to go in and rebuild along the coastline and commonly to rebuild bigger more elaborately very close to the beach rather than rebuilding more and more grandly after each disaster imagining that everything can be just the way it was shouldn changing our habits because if we only try to adjust to that warming climat and if we do not work in the area of prevention uh by reducing greenhouse gas emissions it will not be possible anymore to adjust for the increased intensity of those damages in an uncertain future there are certainties natural habitats are weakening Urban Coastal developments are increasing and sea levels are rising as fast as we build prepare secure and maintain trying to conserve and reshape the coastal strip working ever harder to preserve our lifestyle it seems the elemental Earth is changing faster still [Music]	Success

adult tree Hoppers from any potential predators that might choose to attack after all it is a Larder that is well worth defending but young nymphs are delicious prey to this hungry ruv today looking for an opportunity to strike just a few centimeters beneath her is a quiet nest of horola tree [Music] Hoppers an attack on the nest has alerted the soldier ants they have taken assault on the invader [Music] to save his life the ruva is forced to [Music] flee and the horola go unharmed the army of ants on permanent Patrol is a considerable Advantage the female banota tree Hopper knows this all too well for she will abandon her Nursery leaving the ants to tend to her eggs and nymphs a winning strategy of evolution is in the making of alliances a service in exchange for a service I you opportunities communication is one of the more subtle Solutions if we can understand each other we can help each other Rex cocraft has been studying the language of tree Hoppers for the past 15 years making him the world Authority on the subject the team has accomplished the capture of three heton notus tree Hoppers they are solitary and such a catch is extremely rare not unlike the fictional Dr dittle Rex is tapping into their secret language it andarn learning a new [Music] language this is the very first time that anyone has tuned into to the sounds of these heton [Music] notis wow it ever heard that sound you could be sure of that there insects that are signaling using incredible sounds that that nobody heard and people used to think of tree Hoppers is pretty but kind of boring and when you listen into their vibrational world you realize that they communicative they environment they each other with Incredible signals strategy of Alliance number two communication just how tree toppers are reading these signals remains a mystery the microscanner reveals for the very first time the magical secret beauty of this heterotis an inside view of their pronotum structure reveals that it is totally Hollow [Music] researchers know that the abdomen is their communicative tongue but they are unaware if the pronotum could be in any way used to detect other tree Hoppers vibrations Rex that the tree Hoppers are speaking to each other by vibrating the plant tissue their hairy legs are hyp sensitive enabling them to receive various signals and they are permanently on patrol their feet are equipped with claws that rip into the host plant ensuring close contact you can see look around us of plants dominate our environment and there are sounds of insects and and of some other creatures too traveling through them all the time and we completely unaware of them so it it there revealing undiscovered dimensions of the natural world is the duty of the biologist constantly on the lookout to widen our Horizons it takes a 6-hour boat ride down the Rio utini to the neighboring research station we already know there are at least 3,000 tree hoers in the world and a rough guess which is all we can do is 10,000 which would be more tree operas than our mammals in the world and that might sound surprising but when you think of all insects in the world if you took all of them and put them on a scale and weigh them they weigh more than all all other living things so to have 10,000 species of tree Hopper is isn St you know it realistic the river is particularly low and Umberto the local waran guide has asked his son Ramon to keep an eye out for logs and tree trunks on the waterline it boat as the whole area is swarming with Cayman and anacondas there highly motivated Stewart to risk traveling down the tiputini river steuart mamy wants to find out if the ant tree Hopper Alliance is found at the higher levels of the canopy Lots tree Hoppers up here and lots there oh there here what do you have orola orola this late in story mature and 10 more ants biting my hands horola and ants is a familiar Alliance that Stuart has already found at ground level but high up in the canopy there are more ants and there is a reason for this the tree Hoppers honeydo is the ant energy from the top of this ancient tree the philosopher is asking himself who does this Forest belong to I can imagine being a tiny little tree Hopper I wouldn immensity of the forest around me I could even believe that it belongs to me I would be unaware that other creatures called humans are threatening it destroying it I of biodiversity I Hopper but I am just as important as any other species on Earth Umberto the native waran guide of the Amazon is worried and he should be the team cannot return under the intense rainstorm and daylight is running [Music] short there were many risks at stake just getting here 6 hours Downstream and in daylight now the team is faced with navigating Upstream after a large rainstorm and at night it feels like we fiction movie in the Lost World of Conan doy searching for the last dinosaurs but the last dinosaurs are tiny little tree hoppers [Music] we didn make it but luckily Umberto decided to push through and we gave him some headlights and now we ready to hopefully eat some dinner and uh look at our tree Hoppers and then go to bed really don we don dream yet another [Music] mystery the overwhelming heat and insects of the rainforest are not easy going on the human organism and while the team was away Professor kolina gdy Has Fallen and sick her legs have badly swollen and she is totally exhausted she doctor you there okay thank you well that there won [Music] deep beneath the rainforest Umberto is now guiding Rex craftt who wants to record some tree Hopper sounds in their natural [Music] [Applause] environment see the fog horn sound is produced by the wings of the amonia species warning her fellow tree Hoppers that these two humans could be a threat strategy of Alliance number three have an alert signal Alberto was explaining to me how the wani use these trees to communicate this is a tree they use like their radio so they caught an animal who bring it to the tree then thump on the tree to call the family and then they cook and have a meal right here under the tree it how these parallels between how the waran use plants to communicate and how the tree hyers that we about also use plants to communicate they might also announce we or we [Music] visit ants are not the only insects to visit tree hoppers [Music] bees so it would seem capture the vibrations of the mosid they definitely seem to benefit from collecting the Honeydew from The Young nymphs of this Italian family but scientists are unaware if the bees give any protection in exchange on some branches mothers can be found to brood in large numbers it is the case here with the m calella species scientists believe that an egg laying female produces pheromones that will attract other females enticing them to lay their egg cluster nearby strategy of Alliance number four United We Stand but the jungle is also the kingdom of perfect [Music] selfishness this tiny parasitic wasp is worse than than a cuckoo bird for he will do anything to strike an egg laying his own egg inside that of the tree Hoppers the chances of the tree Hoppers egg surviving such an attack are close to [Music] zero the infected eggs will turn a yellowish brown color and the larvae of the WASP will feed from the egg before growing adult oh a nymph there here I because he told me that the inflammation in my feet and legs was an allergic reaction to trigar bites I was expecting an anaconda or a crocodile to eat me up but it mosquitoes and mites that caught me oh well that kolina has learned that the Amazon is a world of mystery and [Music] dangers researchers have discovered that many tree Hoppers have developed a subsocial behavior that is extremely rare in the insect [Music] Kingdom numerous species will guard their eggs until they hatch and care for their young ones through throughout the various stages of their lives until they turn adult and are capable of taking care of [Music] themselves one of these young ainop ferini nymphs is ready for its final [Music] metamorphosis and it water ful eye of the [Music] ants we ignore which animal if any will make its meal of this ainop ferini exoskeleton strangely adult tree Hoppers do not seem to hop but have an extraordinary capacity to both jump like a flea and fly like a mosquito they use their wings with immediate takeoff and leave in search of a partner of the opposite sex after several weeks of leading a solitary life the young adults have one Obsession reproduction but just how do they find each other it and there are a lot of plants in a lot of places to search probably they first find the right plant because many of these J Hoppers specialize on one or a few kinds of plants and then they use their vibrations strategy of Alliance number five sing and sing loud to find a partner Rex has synchronized his equipment with our camera you are about to hear for the very first time the bewildering mating call of the amonia tree Hopper these two males are calling out for the female and she Above This male has localized her call for discretion we the lights these romantic love calls would have gone unheard without the research perseverance and highly sophisticated technology of our scientific communities Rex cannot pretend he is a male tree Hopper seeking a partner but he can play the role of a dangerous Amazonian predator and the scientific Expedition team is simply Amazed by his Revelations he has collected a mother amonia and her nymphs on a branch the courageous mother will defend her vulnerable Offspring against any Predators including Rex Rex has Amplified their signals using his dad two accelerometers which are basically tiny little contact microphones I call are these the rngs that taking off she she to to create an incredibly loud vibration that can potentially drive away the predator and can also communicate very strongly to the young they don the in the sense of human beings they don were to just stand next to this and we were not listening to the vibrations you might see a little motion but you think really nothing wouldn Airborne sound associated with this at all it takes a little more than a wing flap to scare Rex he this time the mother is going to stand up to him using a surprise kick that sweeps under the abdomen with terrific Force [Music] let motion they animals you know they have to get right up next to the predator and you saw what she did she kicked right a tiny animal like this is defending her brood by kicking and she buzzed her wings a bit but she close strategy of Alliance number six have a loud defense system [Applause] it the Expedition at Yuni is over and it time to say goodbye but before returning home the team wants to listen out for tree hoppers in a radically different environment after the rainforest they follow the pipeline West they will spend the last few days at the bell of vista research station altitude 7,500 ft this is the cloud [Music] forest despite the luxurious vegetation tree Hoppers are harder to come [Music] by it plants and the animals including the tree Hoppers and there are huge temperature fluctuations it winter at night and then it becomes like summer in the midday with the equatorial sun beaming down on them we have to dress in layers but the tree hoers can do that and there between what yasuni down at low at the low elevation at this altitude oxygen is short and each step requires that extra effort we this Narrow Path it found anything possibly because the path is a bit dark a better place to find mebr is in open areas where there sun so it beautiful path but we haven Hoppers Rex has walked a fair way from the research station to a brighter Zone he cannot see as many tree Hoppers as in the Amazonian rainforest but he can hear many vibrations and where there are vibrations there is life and this whole field is just a carpet of sound there of a cocktail party effect here where there there but if you particular sound you filter out all the other so for a tree Hopper that another tree Hopper of their own species they against the background of the sounds of many other species a mob lab is the answer to his problem in order to isolate certain species from the noisy grass we m m cafel female M [Music] cafel the uh toucan any Airborne sounds get picked up by the leaves and are transmitted through the plants so as you tree Hoppers and talking they can actually hear you even though you can hear them thought of it that way the level of communication between individuals is often associated with their level of socialization female medcal FAS are extremely maternal and this comes as quite a surprise in the insect World they are often found grouped together on the same branch each mother laying approximately 70 eggs as the team has already observed the mother watches over her Offspring and her nymphs with determination but here the scientists have noticed that the mother has a strange [Music] behavior in waiting for her eggs to hatch she will drill holes into the plant to feed more easily these are one of the few tree Hoppers that are pests to humans as these punctures Scar and damage coffee cocoa and avocado plants in the cloud forest without their ant protectors the Mella are more vulnerable and must quickly grow into adults this may explain why their mother punctures the plant stem strategy of Alliance number seven collectively adapt to the dwelling there are not very many ants up here whereas the Amazon teeming with ants so we find here many species that have lifestyles in which the female lays her eggs and then in many cases we spend the rest of her life looking after that clutch of Offspring and by the time they their own families she dies steuart mckamy has set up a light trap in the hope to attract some tree Hoppers we often don look like this but when we do it usually good news but um it disappointing from a tree oper point of view because there are none [Music] it hoppers at 7,500 ft but if Stuart cannot see them Rex can hear them but just what are they talking about these social signals that go back and forth between mother and Offspring or members of a group tend to be very short instantly recognizable and very functional help or here got to to do more than that here to record any mating calls at 7,500 ft altitude he shares some of his favorite [Laughter] [Music] recordings that balloon you going is that a mating call it was all of these are mating songs produc Mals here [Music] [Music] two most people wouldn songs as beautiful but I think you could use it so is that a single individual doing that or oh that males so singing together we Sublime to [Applause] ridiculous that is ridiculous here it [Music] insect sounds more like a bird or a frog this one hang on there there at the [Music] end wow aliens have landed that that incredible disappointed with their findings in the cloud forest the team is checking out the outskirts of the town of mindo this is a future housing estate we the cloud forest this place looks great let sprad out all right [Music] Rex has come across a colossal Community by dropping 3,200 ft in altitude the ants are back and so is the profitable tree Hopper ant Alliance just like in the Amazon ants have built a casing around the plant to keep a close eye on these nymphs and adult anti an tree [Music] Hoppers ants communicate using odors known as pheromones could it be at all feasible that they share a language with tree hoppers it from here because the ants are so protective a very recent study showed that tree Hoppers can actually communicate with ants when mothers of this tree Hopper are defending their young against a predator the mother produces a series of little signals and if you play back those signals to ants the ants respond and approach and can then find the predator and evicted from the plant strategy of Alliance number eight communicate with other species we have learned that Darwin theory on evolution is largely misunderstood it is not the great battle where the meanest eats the others evolution is also strategic tree Hoppers show that you can be small cunning and you can integrate the biosphere that the lore of the Jungle is not the LW of the Jungle the LW of the Jungle is the LW of community it association with this kind of science you don you know we might find something incredible from tree Hoppers that we can apply to humanity we might not but every single bit of knowledge that we learn about any living thing is valid in its own [Music] right back home in Washington DC Stewart from the Amazon [Music] this trip was more successful than I could have imagined I I years of collecting I such a rich fauna so many species so many gener in one place if most species can be identified under a microscope this technique has its limits even under the microscope many species of tree Hoppers look very much alike so you have to use other methods to differentiate them look at their study their DNA and Stuart has even earned him a species that carries his name like in all areas of Science in a sense the more we find the less we know because every Discovery just brings up new questions this is a tree Hopper 40 million years old trapped in fossilized tree sap I can see it broken off leg wo looks so huge it looks like it space it cool back at the University of Missouri Columbia Rex KRA continues his quest to reveal New Dimensions of the tree Hoppers world World under the protection of this greenhouse he is breeding amonia crassicornis for his research requirements one of the 200 species that naturally occur in Northern America tree Hoppers communicate using the same frequencies as we do but for us to hear them their vibrations need to be Amplified [Music] these insects are at least as sensitive as our most sensitive equipment back in his laboratory Rex is able to use a laser vibrometer and the technology is much like U the police radar that a policeman would use to measure the velocity of your car Rex is going to play back his recordings via this apparatus that will transmit the audio sounds into a substrate vibration one of the great things about working with substrate vibrations is that we can play them back into the plant and the insects will respond to our playbacks as if it was another insect let Rex [Music] female at first the male seems disord orientated but it doesn the male to mistake the playback apparatus for according female Rex is mastering tree Hopper secret language but how can this help humankind there are many situations in which people want to know where a vibration is coming from whether it earthquake or whether it a car that somebody been collaborating with some mechanical engineers for several years now in order to understand some of the tricks that tree hoppers use to localize vibrations and it turns out that the tree Hopper body itself acts like a little directional sensor that moves differently if the vibration comes from in front of it or behind it strategy of Alliance number n interpret the vibrations of a predator I family and found that communication is is universal and so they also been communicating for the past 40 million years and that may be part of why they successful tree Hoppers have offered us an amazing array of forms and colors like a dream on planet Earth but scientists have taken our knowledge of their world one step further these insects are exceptional beings of communication they have their own language they swap information within their own species with other species with the plants that support them with the forest that nourishes them and within the biosphere which we are also a part of everything is linked [Music]	Success
Invasion of the Jellyfish: A Rising Threat? | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PwYWU5sl_E	SLICE Science	[Music] we time it attracted attention was in 2002 nura with a diameter of 2 m it looks like an alien not much is known about the life cycle of these animals with tentacles as thick as macaroni the German scientist Cornelia yaspers meets shinichi U from Japan he considered the leading expert of the international jellyfish scene the Plankton expert wants to find out more about the phenomenon of the giant jellyfish in the Sea of Japan their appearance on mass is a sign that something world oceans the Eerie invasion of the giant jellyfish scares Japan particular Professor oui shows us news footage seemingly straight from a horror film when the The Jetty fish comes in large numbers uh the they are net broken and burst and then the fisherman lose a huge money it very difficult for the fishermen to do the solution but maybe the science will give some uh the the cue to do it uh well we scientists know where the jellyfish come from and then the way they abundant so we will like to give such information to the fishermen as early as possible the Marine ecologist has discovered that the large swarms come from China the coastal Waters there are exposed to intensive human influences the ocean is being overfished and polluted the jellyfish weighing 200 kg then drift on the current to the Japanese Coast Barcelona the elite in jellyfish research are meeting at the jellyfish bloom Symposium the scientists from all around the world want to study the seemingly Unstoppable growth of these gloopy animals their field of research is esoteric there aren biologists in the world who study jellyfish are humans responsible for the current explosion in jellyfish numbers it Cornelia yaspers and her colleagues discuss at the Symposium she has good International connections she Leads she to visit yose Maria Gilly his renowned lab aquariums are home to dozens of species of different ages they research jellyfish are true survivalists they 600 million years science underestimated jellyfish for decades in fact they were positively avoided jellyfish were always ignored in studies but because they attract a lot of attention in our harbors and on our beaches there have far more jellyfish than we used to sadly we don long-term data so we can question jellyfish don a heart when when they swim their ring-shaped muscles constrict their bodies made of supportive jelly are only held together by two Thin layers of cells jellyfish have a hollow space inside that located oral tentacles guide the prey from the tentacles through a stomach tube into the interior jellyfish experts are discovering more and more of these animals remarkable skills the moon jellyfish Aurelia aita occurs in all the seven seas and can form huge swarms yosip Maria Gilly is particularly worried by one species occurring in the Mediterranean pelagia noctiluca also known as the mve Stinger it glows in the dark the biggest problem with the m Stinger comes from its impact on the entire Marine ecosystem their predators they eat zo Plankton and fish lari but they a problem for humans currents and wind bring them together in large swarms around our beaches contact with our skin causes severe burns beaches are regularly closed as a result players on the Catalan Coast Beach visitors can use an app to obtain information about which Beach jellyfish have been spotted at nobody here wants anything to do with Mau stingers it where you have these colorful mauve Stingers which cause serious Burns and skin irritation if you look further a field in Hawaii Thailand or Australia you even have these small box jellies they have deadly venom these box jellies have made the global headlines those who survive contact with their toxic tentacles suffer from extremely painful wounds life-threatening box jellies aren Mediterranean Coast but there are mve Stingers the seaside tourists call these pink medusas the horrors of the beach no wonder because their stings are extremely unpleasant if they suddenly appear on a beach relaxed bathing is no longer possible most tourists won in the water Veronica Fuentes is the number one contact for the Spanish press when there of the peak holiday season [Music] there are areas such as the baleric islands where you have red flags blowing on a 100 days during the bathing season because there are too many jellyfish in the water tourists can water that the Spanish tourist island of itha is one of the bolic islands it Mari and Jose tala work their volunteers with the Proto civil the Spanish Civil protection office the two regularly inspect the monitored beaches to determine the number of jellyfish incidents nobody here can predict when the Swarms occur [Music] in early may we had a veritable jellyfish invasion in the sea and on the beaches but since then it stayed quiet according to our lifeguards we had no more than three jellyfish incidents per day we the next season his colleague has a picture from last spring on his mobile this is what a real jellyfish invasion in itha looks like it s there are Sistas Spanish lifeguards on all of ia holiday makers there today indicating that visitors should take care Bome and Jose ask the Lifeguard what the problem is there aren the winds causing a strong current anel says but most of the problems at the beach are because of jellyfish 80% of all Beach incidents are jellyfish burns the two always keep that in mind when they Stinger could show up at any time it unpredictable in their tentacles jellyfish have developed the most toxic and most differentiated cellular mechanism in the animal kingdom contact with these tentacles activates the nid sites these are tiny cells that discharge explosively on contact the magnification shows such an explosion a fine hair is stimul ulated and opens the lid of the capsule at 500 times the Earth needle with a tubule penetrates the skin the Venom enters the victim through the tubu it has to be quick and effective because jellyfish can battle to the death with their prey they would be ripped apart sometimes it humans who get stung it felt like a cramp after an electric shock then like burning and that the water because it cooling if you go out into the sun it burns and hurts much more you should cool a jellyfish burn right away David The Lifeguard knows what he talking about he became a jellyfish victim himself just recently he and his colleagues swear by their first aid measure they take salt water and add some baking powder not fresh water because that would fuel the activity of the venomous capsules the prepared anti- jellyfish burn mix is always at hand at their observation post that soda it vinegar the baking soda is alkaline and neutralizes the toxins and the jellyfish tentacles it renders them harmless and lessens the pain anel wears rubber gloves to protect himself from potential tentacle fragments we always use some bandage to rub the skin but you could use something like a credit card too we use it to scrape the toxic cells of the skin many a Beach visitor complains about faintness and allergic reactions after contact with jellyfish the lifeguards have to call an ambulance that takes the victims to the expert in the island Clinic as quickly as possible when we get patients like that we give them external use antihistamines in the case of an allergic reaction or a cortisone cream for pain if the affected area is somewhat larger or the allergic reaction is very strong then patients should take the medicine orally The American National Science Foundation estimates that around 150 million people a year are affected by jellyfish it Mediterranean regions dependent on their holiday makers the authorities and tourism industry are constantly searching for Solutions on the c da the solution some beaches have taken to isn visual enrichment to the landscape it looks more like a barrier put in place after an oil spill hermetically sealed netted cages for swimmers bathing in the sea without [Music] jellyfish but swimming behind this barrier comes with a Price It to keep jellyfish out the net has to reach to the seabed everywhere and be firmly anchored so it withstands currents and storms the jellyfish Nets were tested in recent years in a European project they install and maintain it takes up a lot of time and the Nets don lot they also produce other problems they solution it too close to jellyfish 100,000 salmon were affected in Northern Ireland millions of tentacles got into the fish farm the ocean current had pushed a huge swarm against the netted cages jellyfish are even responsible for power outages conding when those jellyfishes are coming in swarms they blocking our cooling system as Kasam nuclear power plant in southern Sweden was forced to shut down on the weekend after large amounts of jellyfish clocked up the pipes carrying cooling water to the turbin for two days Tores nuclear power station has been shut down the plant relies on water sucked in from the sea to cool its nuclear reactors but earlier this week huge clouds of jellyfish brought the station to a stand films like that give jellyfish a bad image some scientists exploit this and go along with this image saying jellyfish are bad and we have a problem but what people don that jellyfish are characterized by the fact that they go through these Cycles there are years when there are lots of jellyfish and years when we have barely any that jellyish Plankton expert Cornelia yaspers wants to find out the truth about jellyfish she research around the world for years my professor talked about small animals that could reproduced within 24 hours and that really fascinated me I asked him and he mentioned a trip across the Indian Ocean because they wanted to know their significance in the world oceans I agreed to it and that became fascinated by these jellies in the water her research object was transported in the ballast water of large container ships to Europe Cornelia yaspers who observing the introduced species for almost 10 years and not just on her doorstep in Keel on the Baltic where she currently works there population is growing dramatically now in the late Summer she can see individual animals from the jetty it inhabitants [Music] underwater she doesn for long as expected the animals can be found on mass around the jetty the Wy comb jelly or sea Walnut strictly speaking it true jellies it doesn why Cornelia can touch them the scientist has specialized in comb jellies their biological name is neops lii their natural home is the Atlantic of the American east coast Cornelia yaspers has found out that this species is extremely adaptable and can reproduce at lightning speed since there for food it can grow incredibly large this is an example it take just the body and then you have the wings an animal like this produces 15,000 eggs per day that can fertilize themselves we have to keep an eye on these Wy comb jellies even though the salt content in the central Baltic is too low for them but here it has a super Habitat to reproduce the port of Keel on the Baltic is the starting point for scientific Expeditions all around the world the gomar helmhold center for ocean research is known well beyond the city Cornelia yaspers Has Come From The Institute for aquatic resources at the Technical University of Denmark in 2006 marine biologists discovered the introduced comb jelly species in the Baltic that was a shock because in the Mediterranean region their population exploded and also caused huge damage in the ecosystem of the Black Sea how quickly can the Wy comb jelly conquer its new habitat is it a threat to the Baltic too at first glance they eight conb jellies Shimmer in all the colors of the rainbow it the microscope that it becomes clear why light refracts in all the spectral colors in the tiny transparent discs with which the animal moves around Cornelia yaspers has made a frightening Discovery this immigrant can cope so well with the local conditions that it jellies that are reproducing in the lab under ideal condition it only takes a few days for a freshly hatched lava to reproduce after months of counting yasper team found out how many eggs such lava can produce Cornelia yaspers has shown that the ability of the Wy comb jelly to reproduce rapidly where it likes the conditions is based substantially on its reproductive qualities this isn important that we keep an eye on it so we know how it it ecosystem that would be disastrous the Baltic is a nursery for commercially important edible fish such as Cod and Herring are the Wy comb jellies eating there young Cornelia yaspers performs an experiment she gives the jellies cot eggs and lvi for food but the jellyfish doesn out [Music] again that young Cod babies the comb jelly laps them up the Wy comb jelly can eat the fish larvi but mostly those still in their Yol sack those that don the others are too mobile and can get away from the jellies that means the Wy conb jell is dangerous on board the Danish research vessel Danna the Fisheries biologist Bastian Hoover conducts a jellyfish census four times a year are the animals a threat to the eggs and lva of Herring and cod in the jelly fish original habitat where it east coast of North and South America this jellyfish is notorious for eating fish eggs and lari that discovered this species here around Bourn home this area is the main spawning area for Baltic Cod Plank and Nets Sie through the water column from the surface to just above the ground the net is called a bongo net because it looks like bongo drums we use this larger one mainly to capture FX and lvi this one captures all kinds of zoo Plankton and the baby Bongo captures very small organisms jellyfish are caught by all of the Nets the captain of the Danna is setting the course for the night Bastian Hoover has to head along the same coordinates every time so that the results gathered can be compared long term if we zoom in again we can see the islands of borol rugan and fman our bases are more in the Eastern Area I thought we the Arona Basin and then we way over for several nights the research ship travels along the set GPS coordinates the captured Zoo Plankton gathers at the end of the net in a catch bag the main thing we is how many jellyfish we have in the samples and how many fish eggs and ly fish on Fish laugh the Darner is heading towards the next spot check coordinate Bastian Hoover takes care of his catch a school of sticklebacks Feasts on the zoo Plankton that Bastian Hoover has to count they have to be removed first under the microscope the different species of Zo Plankton can be identified tiny copi pods along with fish eggs and lava great for the jellyfish a measuring probe is lowered into the water at every station they determine the oxygen and salt content along with the temperature a vertical profile of the environmental data arrives live on Bastian Hoover the graph indicate salty oxygen rich layers water from the North Sea has found its way to the Eastern Baltic through deep channels that suggests that the Wy comb jellies came to the bour home region on this saltwater current at the moment we don this jellyfish has had a big impact on the fish populations here in the Eastern Baltic because it hasn mass anywhere in addition the jellyfish doesn up during the main cot spawning season so it yaspers says definitely not the victory of the Wy comb jellies in Europe is taking place in two waves of immigration the animals that appeared for the first time down here in the Black Sea originate from the Gulf of Mexico Mex the animals we have up here in the Baltic they Hole that area that genetically these were two completely distinct invasions what happens when the Wy comb jellies from the Black Sea are introduced into the Baltic the animals occur in the southwestern Baltic and in the C between Denmark and Sweden we have quite High densities here but these jellies haven conquered the majority of the Baltic if we can show that the southern species has a different genetic repertoire and can cope with a lower salt content that could be a threat if the southern ones transferred North on the other hand we don Southern and Northern jellies were brought together we could get super potent hybrids or we could get hybrids that can question that the future of the Baltic that bringing Wy comb jellies from America the Black Sea and the Baltic together in the lab she and breeding experiments over the next few years funded by the eu program and the Danish Council for independent research for Natural Sciences with this international support the Plankton scientist hopes to find out whether the mysterious jelly superpower is continuing on its path towards dominance and whether it can win over as yet unconquered areas on the C in V FR Su the marine biologist Fabian Lomar works for the observat oceanographic [Music] the jellies aren beautiful organisms I think they of the sea they have beautiful tentacles and bodies they way of life is very Zen to me anyone who speaks that positively about jellyfish has to have a reason the location of his office for example it from here that he decides whether it worth capturing a few of his research [Music] objects today Stinger is the dominant species in the Mediterranean on the cot daur Fabian Lomar needs a few for his experiment in the [Music] laboratory the jellyfish aren terrible as people think they home and the world long time for more than 600 million years sometimes they not they play an important role as predators in the ocean they could be useful to us humans we have to learn to live with them even though there are too many of them sometimes sometimes we can use them lombar has an unusual idea he sucks up large quantities of slime that the mauve Stinger releases when laying its eggs or the moon jellyfish when stressed he fills the Slime into test tubes for a brilliant experiment he injects water polluted with nanop particles into the jellyfish slime dyed purple here the result the jellyfish slime causes the nanoparticles to Clump together which cleans the polluted water there are more and more nanop particles in creams for example the factories that manufacture these things have to take care of their waste waterer they have to get rid of it without polluting the environment you could use the jellyfish slime to filter nanop particles out of polluted water it would be cheap and environmentally friendly will this rescue the jellyfish reputation Zabo host on heligoland wants to understand the mysterious double lives of jellyfish for decades she been researching the reproduction strategy of true jellyfish to do that she needs the help of the divers from the Alfred Vaga Institute the team to look for jellyfish polyps they prefer to live on the underside of substrates which means we have to look from below that them there are five North Sea species floating under the dive ship apart from the hemaphrodite compass jellyfish all the species have males and females the sperm is released into the water and is taken on by the females the eggs are fertilized internally jellyfish lava develop the true jellyfish release these plui into the ocean in [Music] shifts the jellyfish lava are covered in many tiny filaments which they use to swim to a solid surface surface to attach themselves to the planul develops into a polyp under very specific conditions the polyps release many little jellyfish called epira they grow into sizable medusas the cycle starts AR fresh it effective reproductive strategy the polyps survive for several years on the hard ground that the divers will search in a minute they don sandy soil moves around them it would break them down that hard substrate where they can settle safely they don because we substrates in places where we used to have sand with concrete for platforms for example we increase the places where planula can settle and develop polyps and then jelly fish can grow offshore

occupied the diver tries to find the polyps in this jungle on the Harbor sheep p smiling she takes a sample from a likely location on the way back her colleague hits a lion capillata fortunately the diver is wearing a full face mask otherwise he would have been badly stung I hope it can harvest the larvi and raise polyps in the lab then we can study the polyps and find out when they produce jellyfish and under what conditions the jellyfish and the sample are taken to the lab the environmental conditions in the sea are changing the reason is climate change the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations is warming our atmosphere the ocean absorbs the heat that increase of 1.7 de for the North Sea alone global warming is also a subject at the jellyfish bloom Symposium in Barcelona gaspers and Holst are meeting an expert the scientist Jennifer pcel has been researching the dynamic between jellyfish populations and their polyps for the past 40 years when you give them higher temperatures they produce more jellyfish um dramatically more jellyfish than they do in the cooler Waters increasing air pollution as a result of industry and traffic is leaving its Mark there dioxide in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution the world have absorbed half of the carbon dioxide the gas dissolves in the oceans reducing their pH value our oceans are becoming more acidic all organisms with a calcium based skeleton are in danger because the acidic water dissolves the Limestone jellyfish don skeleton therefore the acidification of the oceans isn they survive Jennifer pcel lists even more negative environmental [Music] influences too much fertilizer from agriculture the nutrients get into the oceans via our groundwater and rivers this causes phytoplankton blooms these tiny algae form huge carpets as seen from space this vegetable fodo produces all the more zup Plankton zup Plankton is made up of microscopically small animals and fish lva this is what jellyfish eat allowing them to reproduce in great [Music] numbers this is causing utopic conditions with lots of nutrients in the water uh it leads to low oxygen levels and um jellyfish are very tolerant of those conditions at the same time the global jellyfish victory in the oceans is a threat to their food competition fish fishing samples from the Baltic on the Danish research vessel Danna even a cursory glance tells the scientists that there are too few female Cod able to spawn they Baltic fishing fleets the Danes are counting on behalf of Isis the international Council for the exploration of the sea which monitors 110 fish species around the world their data is included in the annual recommendation for EU fishing quotas both the young fish and the small schooling fishes like Herring are eating the Z Plankton um the little tiny animals that swim around in the water so both of them are being consumed by jellyfish and fish then you away the fish so that leaves more food for the jelly fish to [Music] eat Zabo host is on her way to the lab on heligoland the break Waters made of tetrapods are like a red carpet for the jellyfish lvi she finds plastic rubbish on the beach [Music] millions of tons of plastic waste find their way into the oceans around the world the current makes sure that the pieces of plastic drift around in the water for a long time a habitat for jellyfish polyps all the hard substrates we put into the oceans including plastic waste are places that organisms can live on we jellyfish pops settle on artificial substrates including plastic she takes care of the recently captured jellyfish female she tries to settle her plui she fills small containers with water from the North [Music] Sea the sex cells eggs and sperm are produced in the gonads the male releases the sperm into the water where it absorbed by the females the fertilization process takes place inside the female the fertilized eggs turn into larvi they move into the brooding pouches where the plui develop before they released she carefully siphons off the lvi and offers them an upside down plastic lid that they can settle on [Music] the lab Sellar of the Alfred Vaga Institute is the scene of a successful settlement experiment the heligoland polyp culture three species are located here at a temperature of 15° most of the time they the plastic lids [Music] Zabo hos wants to use the polyps of

pinch off little neira a new generation of jellyfish is born [Music] it the scientist finds what she was expecting she finds the branching jellyfish polyps of the anthom Medusa in amongst the algi Barnacles and Moss animals the heligoland biological Institute has sent a measuring boat out to sea almost daily since 1962 for one of the longest running long-term Marine data collection programs the scientists take water and Plankton samples if the environmental conditions change that can be reflected in the composition of the ocean Plankton jellyfish could even benefit from that we know that the jellyfish polyps are very resistant to changes in the environment and that means that the polyps survive environmental conditions that other organisms can the Atlantic the saraso sea is situated far off the coast of North America the Danish research vessel Danna is on an eel Expedition Cornelia gaspers doesn believe in the negative image jellyfish have together with an international team of Fisheries biologists and Plankton experts she wants to prove that gelatinous Plankton plays an enormously important role in the food chain for the endangered European eel for [Music] example everyone becoming more expensive they threatened by Extinction one connection nobody which have a negative image could be a potential building block in the food chain without them we might have no more eels to eat Al Ence the net for catching eel lava is lifted from a depth of 250 M the first glance proves that there are many species of gelatinous Plankton organisms here in amongst them the scientists discover the mysterious eel lava that emerged from the egg here in saso [Music] SE this size wouldn aquaculture because nobody knows what these baby eels eat that has ever been successful in breeding European eels [Music] the multinet is lifted on board it catches samples from several depths between 0 and 400 m the Plankton expert Cornelia gasas is [Music] needed after hours of rinsing counting and identifying it becomes clear what organisms contribute to the food chain out here in the saso sea we cut them open we the stomach and we molecular methods to determine what they eat jellyfish don result they get digested immediately that makes it really hard to use normal methods like microscopes to demonstrate such [Music] organisms now we have molecular methods so we can find out what gelatinous organisms are in their stomachs and what gelatinous organisms are in the water and then we can hopefully match the two up do eel lvi eat jellyfish proving that is quite elaborate the meticulous counting job on board is only the first step for Cornelia yasas and her colleagues the analysis of the data will take several years only then will the results be ready for publication is it jellyfish that feed our important edible fish in their Nursery that would be a breakthrough for Science and the key not just for rescuing the European eel but also for other endangered fish species such as bluef tuna the jellyfish bloom Symposium is an important event for exchange for the scientists jelly fish research is still in its infancy there are no uniform methods yet kind that are long established in Fisheries biology welome I think it sign that there are so many young people involved now um that sign so if there are a lot of post dogs and uh Master students involved that that means that there growing interest and that is what has been lacking the the past years I think we still need to find out why uh there is some growing population at some point on the planet uh we have lot of indications but of course it needs long studies dedicated studies or even very strong experimental studies that for the moment are still lacking and there is lot of monitoring uh issues uh monitoring programs that have started that need to be contined to already understand what is going on what an important indicator for the decline of the oceans a problem caused by humans of course the jellyfish has no the words to say the human beings but the explosion of their population is just the unspoken language uh that the fish uh the jellyfish Express to us human beings as a warning sign I believe that all of us are responsible of course for for spreading this information and also for realizing that we cannot keep doing things in the way we are doing now the Mysterious World of Jenny fish they

PirahÃ£: The Tribe That Defies Language Rules | SLICE SCIENCE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fddKrsKx-zI	SLICE Science	[Music] I eventually realized that the Paha are happy already they don they don the message of God to the Paha like taking ice to the eskimos [Music] in 25 years of missionary work Daniel Everett failed to attract a single Paha convert [Music] the questioning of my own faith began as I saw how happy the Paha were as I tried to answer their very probing and direct questions about the nature of the evidence that I had for what I believed and as I reflected on all of these things it eventually led to the abandonment of my own faith this dramatic change triggered the breakup of Everett traumatic experience to have a relationship of over 30 years come to an end like that I mean we got married when we were 18 but much more difficult to me was uh the fact that my children didn speak to me for two years and even today they struggle with some things uh based on how radically I father that they thought I was in terms of my beliefs [Music] abandoning missionary life ort began to focus on his academic career he had long suspected something was fundamentally different about Peta [Music] grar and if his hunch was right it could transform our understanding of human language at the time that I was going through the uh spiritual crisis and the family crisis and the marriage crisis I was also going through an intellectual crisis and I had to say something about this at the same time that I Tred to explain a number of the unique characteristics of the petah halang I had no idea when I started writing this paper that it was going to be controversial to the degree that it was Daniel Everett had just picked a fight with the father of modern Linguistics gome Chomsky Noom is not only the most influential linguist in this sense of the past Century but I think it probably the case that he influential linguist of all time I finished the paper I sent it off to the number one Journal of anthropology and then all hell broke [Music] loose I think he knows he what I really think it might be an interesting question of a social anthropology but can do with the nature of language it just doesn sending me hate mail accusing me of uh racist views and I think a move that many many intellectuals make uh to get a little bit of attention I was appalled when I read the chsky had said that Dan was a charlatan I I know both these people and that is not right that is unacceptable the reason there was so much fuss is really not very scientific I mean it was here with this language that only he knows and he linguist in history is dead wrong about his most important idea yeah I there also questions about whether any of it true but that story The Bitter war of words is in reaction to the grammatical anomaly Dan Everett claims to have found according to Everett Paha shows no evidence for recursion the ability to combine an endless number of ideas in a single sentence so let simple sentence like Bill saw Mary and now we want to make that part of a larger sentence John said that bill saw Mary but for this to be recursion we have to be able to keep going so we might want to say something like John said that Bill said that Mary said that Peter said that Irving bought a house and that is real that is true recursion the ability for a sentence to just keep going on forever if in a language you can show there is a largest sentence and you can language doesn is such a language in 2002 Nome Chomsky proposed that recursion is the basis of all human language a key component of his theory of universal grammar the most influential idea in linguistics Universal grammar argues the structure of language the grammar is innately found in the human genome something we are born with rather than learn according to the theory all human languages regardless of their surface differences share a common deep structure a universal grammar it dominated Linguistics for more than 50 years in a modern sense Universal grammar is just the theory of the genetic component of the language faculty uh that it exists is hard to deny oh if Everett is right about petar then many believe the case for Universal grammar is severely undermined chsky who kind of has an outsize influence in linguistics whatever his latest pronouncement is everyone takes very seriously in a recent paper Chomsky argued that the narrow language faculty the part of language that consists only of an ability to do recursion uh not every linguist to put it mildly accepts that I don was out there as the latest statement from Mount Olympus on what about language and so the claim that there exactly that thing that Chomsky said is essential obviously made it much much more interesting to people if I and Paha does lack recursion then recursion can for human language so one of us is right and one of us is wrong it Everett mit new Expedition is preparing to go and test his claims leading the team is Professor Ted Gibson I think Dan claim is the claim that human language doesn might be right and it might be wrong and I just don that controversy how many rules along with colleague Dr Steve pad DOI Gibson has developed a new computer program for analyzing human language he it specifically to test Everett recursion claim but first he needs Paha recordings what and I are doing is is trying to make make the debate scientific and so I think that that really the only way to to resolve these kinds of questions um you can back and forth bickering you know all the time you have to have some kind of scientific method and and some some kind of uh quantifiable evidence if if you want to answer these things one of the most interesting properties of this language and culture is that they uninterested in in the outside world so we get a uh a look at human cognition without the influence of other cultures just sort of one un cultured this Expedition will be the largest and perhaps most rigorous to test Daniel Everett ideas in the eyes of many its results May well settle this debate Everett will accompany the team is translator but taking on the world leading linguist is more than an academic argument it strikes at the heart of where human language stems from what makes us human that this debate is all about where does our language come from is our language some mysterious Gene that somehow crept into our Evolution if so that that claiming is that culture can affect not just the words of a language but the entire grammar of a language and I saying that the Paha are one clear example of this happening perhaps the most radical claim of uh Dan Everett is that the is that unusual features of Paha grammar are uh a consequence of features of their culture because there think almost all linguists would agree with which is that the variation among languages doesn with variations across the the cultures of the people who speak the languages so just to be concrete I me some languages put the verb in the middle and have the object after John 8 the sushi some have the verb at the end John the sushi 8 but do any of these features correlate with some kinds of culture with more you know uptight cultures or expressive cultures or intimate cultures or technological cultures the answer is generally they [Music] don culture affects grammar lies in their fixation with the present this preup a he claims produces a grammar with only a present tense a grammar without recursion a grammar of [Music] happiness e speee fore [Music] for foreign speech speech [Music] Bo on the eve of his departure Everett gets a call from Brazil Indian Foundation known as fi o Pedro to the main yeah I mean I think that U it don extremely disappointing to uh Ted and his team uh you know I don I was just told that uh you know after all this planning and all this effort and having gone down that um volir the local fi Supervisor has said that uh we can go back to the Village I I don what the only thing I can do is fly all the way down there to Brazil go talk to volir and say U you know what can we do to make this happen with one stamp valir pinin chin can grant Everett access to the Peta he is the regional coordinator of fi the agency responsible for Brazil indigenous tribes [Music] [Music] the fact ever is now a professor of linguistics doesn much his old occupation continues to haunt him so now I meet with uh valir pingin volir is the one with the power to say whether I can or can now if vmir says no there chance that that will be no for good it may be the last chance I ever have to go to the piano ever suspects his religious power past is not the sole reason for his rejection the real cause he believes is his collision with the Linguistics establishment as a result of my work I linguists a couple of um years ago um a couple of us linguists wrote a letter to the national Indian Foundation accusing me of conducting racist

Ecovillages: Building a Sustainable Future | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_F1NnaiUo4	SLICE Science	[Music] Matawan is a 63-year-old Italian from Tuscany installed in a hippie community in the early 60s before moving into the dusy killed Echo Village he has witnessed the community evolutions the movement um of echo Villages has come up as a result of a of a on a side on a critical to the the way the society the mainstream Society is today the way we treat the nature and environment how Society is is buil up how our economy is going on instead of the fighting maybe in the political arena for realizing that Vision they try to to live that Vision we don Society or want we don anything we want to actually oppos want to communicate the hepp movement was uh was completely against the traditional family and see it the traditional family family structure as a as as a completely negative uh thing while in the Echo Village movement there is more openness somehow for different point of view 130 adults and 63 children live in this Echo Village that is like a miniature Village 50 families have settled here all the houses are different as everyone builds their own house Ben is VI with his partner Sarah and their two daughters he keeps the echo Village children every day Sarah thank you for the I think it children that they relate to more grown-ups than just the mother and the father and the teacher so I think your social awareness uh expands a lot with that because they like our youngest daughter 3 years almost four and in the morning in the weekend she say okay I go play with the f and she leaves the house herself she go knock on the door and she and she can go in eat breakfast with them if you would teach subjects in school of alternative living maybe there would be as many kids in local schools choosing that or normal but people because they simply don know they they yeah they have no it it [Music] I like the openness that exists in this Village like the way people accept each other because I think we are really like we have some common goals but we are very different from each other one of the echo villagers priorities is to provoke changes in behavior in order to ensure a future to our [Music] planet even if uh we are changing the climate and we are affecting the nature and and making many species die there is so little action uh at the political level [Music] one word that is very misused in our time is growth growth should be about the whole society not only part of society not only having more things in the house or more money in the bank I degrowth economic concept in favor of a decrease in consumption and a relocation of the economy to reduce the ecological footprint aims to establish a society in which people live better by consuming less normally the the media the and the and the government they talk like um as a danger if if a society is not growing economically of course it change they cannot see farther than their their nose their nose is the power they have and the and so maybe the the the change must be somewhere else one of the sites of eological Village is our relations to to the energy so we thought that was been a good idea to produce energy ourselves and in 1994 we decided to to build a windmill and the windmill you can see is is the result of that project [Music] [Music] the Danish Echo Village Network that I part of has made an inquiry and we have published it in our magazine in our number in English we made in 2009 so the the results show that in an echo Village we use 60% less energy than in mainstream houses and then mainstream uh villages and cities it looks like in Europe they have problems to go to 20% less we can make it much better so we it bless the food that it for enjoy this food was hry in Denmark we have the the biggest Nets of Eco villages in the world this uh Echo Villages growing popping up around we see in Europe every n every country has some coming up and is their catalysator of a of a new worldview of a new way of of seeing the world of seeing a human being hello Alfred hello Mal how you going okay Alfred settled here in 1994 he has always lived in community as they in the cities he has been able to gauge their process since the 60s matan introduced him to this place I think community life is a a challenge uh it education in De democ in democracy when I moved in it was much more uh um a common uh sense or common period uh of um of what we could do together uh today it is um more individualistic but it it rest of the society everybody has their own project either it children or it whatever the land on which the echo Village is built was purchased in 1989 and it took 7 years years to get the formalities done many participants left the project along the way given the administrative difficulties more complex than they had imagined Matan settled here in 1994 this is one of the nicest place in our village is uh the garden called Stardust and in this Garden there is a very special tree this is a tree that is as old as the Community this this oak tree is born with the echo Village via has always lived in community since childhood she is one of the founders of this Echo village where she settled from its start in 1990 with her husband and three children her son Ben also lives in the Echo village with his two daughters VI regularly takes care of them today still she has difficulty evoking the hard times of the early years in the beginning it was everything here was just a field there was no trees only very very very special beautiful garden on the farm which was our meeting place because we didn any houses yet so we have to live in wagons I think we didn because uh as I said I I think I at the the first seven years I I work worked all the time I think the the key to a good Village is to have the courage to keep on trying it want uh for the wood World in a way I think because in a way I feel that if you should explain uh where I live maybe to somebody on the other side of the world I could I could say I could say in a way that I live in Paradise this new world view is also reflected in the Echo Village of of Sean Linden in Germany where the concept of degrowth is also applied to become independent of the system the inhabitants try to be self-sufficient by consuming the food and energy they produce Echo Villages are a kind of laboratory where we experiment more ecological Lifestyles for me Echo Villages are one answer to the problems the world faces today a path for the future with regards to energy we are 80% self-sufficient with solar panels This varies a bit depending on the sun intensity with regards to food we self-sufficient with our vegetables herbs and Grains Garden here in the mixer I put the herbs in the blender I pick my breakfast herbs that I pick every morning to make a smoothie that breakfast this is the first straw Bell house in Germany to be validated by the author it was built with the goal of consuming only 10% of the energy of an ordinary home of the same size I think that if we and radical it too and so I think we need radical Solutions many people need bridges that are not so abrupt in order to cross them but we also need radical experimentation to show that it can very well live this wayi [Music] [Music] like I always wanted to try I noticed that when I eat raw food like a carrot or a cucumber it satisfaction than eating cooked food I love eating cooked meals but I really wanted to try what it is to eat only raw and finally I continued because I feel better I healthier it but that is a great motivation for me I realize that I feel much better in general I energy during the day I sleep less everything better if these Echo villagers tend to be self-sufficient and independent of society their income comes mostly from the visitors they receive unlike DUS kild in Denmark where all the residents work outside the community in Germany at zeben Lindon only five people do not work in the Echo Village the hold of their income therefore comes from from the holidays and taxes paid by visitors it Lisa and Pablo during their 2 we stay at C Lindon they pay holiday and restaurant taxes and also contribute by working in the Echo Village the quality of life here involves a cost that high so it who pay for it it it could be complemented with other activities which would help to bring in money and make the community less dependent on visitors we Face contradictions here in zeban Lindon because we see this whole process and development for example we professionalize our awareness seminars we business activities because we simply need the money and this is increasingly the case because we Auto Finance most of what we do on the other hand there are people who come here to live even more simply with very little money and want to do even more things themselves we dilemma okay the desire for self-sufficiency goes beyond food and energy since kindergarten children even have their own School within the echo Village they study all year in the woods to develop their independence the success of this schooling attracts even the parents of surrounding Villages who have enrolled their children in this school I think we traditional kindergarten in a house except that many of us are familiar with the plants and animals in our environment sometimes better than the parents are [Music] children know the names of plants and insects the question of the concept of such a kindergarten can be posed how can we teach greater autonomy to children [Music] been I because we have so many friends it Paradise when I turn 18 and when I older I want to continue living in an Eco Village in a community or at least with roommates when I was younger I told my daddy I never want to live in a city because of the noise from the cars and the lights they sleeping we live in a world of knowledge I think we Germany on all the things happening in the world but I also realize that there gap between what we hear and know and how we behave [Music] the fact of living here is in all cases also political work in Germany there saying privacy is policy and if you try to find alternative private Lifestyles it is also somehow a political commitment in the sense that we are trying to change society today changing the world is very important to me because as it is now I mean me personally I see what is happening in the world I can there is so much misery and injust Justice in this world and I can content to sit here and watch I have to do something to change that up up the idea of creating an Eco Village existed well before the fall of the wall but just after the wall came down there were a lot of empty spaces in East Germany where something new could be created for me it was like a small window in history when something could be done like creating a village but it founding a village is one of the co-founders of the echo Village and settled here in [Music] 1997 we started in nature [Music] we struggle to demonstrate that our Cooperative will not damage nature that to preserve it we would minimize infrastructure roads water supply the least possible damage to [Music] the question of Eco Village recognition hasn Germany despite our desire to work in a very open way there that it can even exist so we have contacts with members of parliament party members have even come to visit us to see how we work and they realize that we function quite well but what we need is to raise awareness and public support because the current laws and regulations don necessarily lend themselves to this type of [Music] [Music] entity aim is German too but he preferred to find land in Spain where laws and local elected officials are more flexible especially since the Andalusian Sun greatly facilitates energy self-sufficiency on one hand it because something like what we did here in um Germany would be perhaps impossible to do it because it rigid here the problem is a little bit other way around that the things aren well defined so you can do a lot till nobody denounce you but if you get denounced it approve especially on the on the lower end of of any type of building so small buildings it what you need to build it or if you need permission or not where in Germany there have every law exactly defined here not so I think we are really in a Tipping Point of human evolution where we still could have the time to to work on a on a concept for the future future but like politic is is really closing their eyes it what happens after peak oil and they just try to continue as usual the sentence of book Minster Fuller is very important to me who said that if you want to change the things don against the existing create something new which is the old which is making the old way OBS silent [Music] you see there exploding and uh their peak oil the oil is nearly finished and everybody continuing as if nothing would happen uh this I think is was difficult for me to to understand of grain red roses and I them BL for me and you anything to myself What a Wonderful World this system wouldn and it system to have any money which might not be there because it the whole thing is collapsing and I still think like this so mainly my protection for the future is to build up a sustainable place which uh is able to feed us we create all our energy electricity you get from the grid is in most areas quite connected with nuclear power so I don want to have to do anything with this so it grid I feel like something which is creating pollution or a great risk on another place for sure I believe that another world is possible and I hope that all this crisis we experiment in the moment is helping uh for this to happen [Music] yes you grow in this society and you think everything is so so normal a lot of people coming here they come they saw the website and they have no idea how to change their life because they don know what else can exist and they just want to see that that other life is possible I came here because I wanted to learn about the world of Eco Villages I also wanted to know myself better live more in touch with nature relax and live more peacefully away from my everyday life I learned to become more Serene here it home with me now [Music] Raa aim Village 5 years ago I became maybe more more calm more settled I feel I have more ground and then more my feet on the ground now for me it people an inspiration and or to give them at least the opportunity to see our life here and this place that they can get an inspiration and an idea and maybe they find motivation to change their lives what we are doing here is is a good job that uh we receive people here and give them uh hope here we have an example of this uh philosophy what we have to try really break the barriers between human life and the nature to keep on having certain Comfort but live uh really in a very strong contact with nature for that we have several spaces which you can open a lot in summer and in winter it so here space to later live much much more connected come on Alex give me a helping hand so we close the normal door I have to go in one moment and now give me a helping hand to rise it can you hold it okay okay should be fine so come in I firstly because I want to live as part of a community I love living with other people I think it natural and also for my children when I have some I in a larger family because to raise children I don think that just two people is enough and here houses are made with clay from the earth it sprung up from the ground when you that man interacted with nature and made it more beautiful normally it other way around you feel that everything is made with natural materials that integrate well in the homes [Music] [Music] the homes that emerged and the atypical lifestyle initially intrigued the inhabitants of the small neighboring village yur where Akim was considered an eccentric [Music] Akim is my friend I little what he did here nobody would have thought it could work compost and ecological washing machine a water purification system everyone thought it was crazy at first and over time we all realized that this was something that was effective that could work people have a need to really learn solid things to change their life because the more the crisis appeared the more people contacted us and said wow I live in Madrid or Berlin or wherever and I know how to do this I want to get out of the city and I have no clue how to do it [Music] after this overview of European Echo villages we wondered what it was like in France where it is difficult to establish nomadic habitats indeed this type of habitat is only allowed when numerous conditions are met connection to electricity in particular is mandatory [Music] Michelle was thus obliged to create a campsite in order to place his yurs and trailers he lives here year round with his wife coren nomadic dwellings are more or less prohibited in France let urban planning code I think it because people can no longer afford housing in a nomadic dwelling a yur costs about 1500 if you make it yourself between 3,000 and €10,000 if bought from someone who makes them and I think that normal currently it municipalities to decide if they will accept or not the installation of Ys as a main residence I realized there could be administrative bottlenecks so I met elected officials the administration and the regulatory offices I controls on the contrary it in this way that things will evolve because if we stay cut off and we don understand each other then we create conflict and I think that that exhausts us mutually on both sides while if we try to work together we work with intelligence they are human beings too like me so that meet and see what Solutions we can find together you time I came to see you because I know you I cabin gladly I it only from the outside we had some problems and difficulties sometimes administrative what I really appreciated about him is that he has always listened and wanted to integrate perfectly the village and I think he is integrated as he is popular I mean it you have projects that are a little outside the norm we displeasing the local population the city council there has always been an ongoing dialogue and I the result like aim Michelle wants to raise awareness in the greatest number of people on the possibility of living differently more respectfully of the environment and by consuming less for this he regularly welcomes families voila okay follow me and we see the cabin immediately okay so here there for you and bed for the children the fold up there there you are good do you smoke in fact no good great if you don even better no almost never I took three days to think about it when I got into the Smart Box or cool gift boxes and I thought touching all these people I tell myself it so I wouldn because at least I can reach many more people so that people because otherwise they wouldn come here maybe when I do the tours what is important for me is to touch people consciences because I always have open consciences in front of me so I show them that it differently because I myself I was in the system and I in it in some way because I am I have an individual business I have a Commerce number in order to receive School classes to be validated by the National Education but I try to make the connection between people who live in cities and those who live like us here in a different way and show that it is possible we can change lives PR what do you prefer your home or the cabin and all that I prefer the cabin would you like to live in the cabin yes why because it and looks like Tinkerbell [Music] I like it here because it holiday and it day in front of the TV and all that it things will allow them to open up their minds it McDonald like the mountains and the countryside they don to go for a walk but all they want to do is stay in the cabin finding yourself in nature with no stores no network you know it feels good when you Leon so it vacation you choose such places because it will change your daily life your routine so it feels good it also sort sort of puts you back in your place we this kind of thing [Music] [Music] yes there then tomorrow I have the Treehouse that will be taken as well come in so there you have a good feather comforter I you can settle in yourselves and then after that you turn off the small lamps hello hello have a seat did you sleep well in the cabin very very well what can I get you coffee tea hot chocolate I want you can have some you want a hot chocolate you will drink it right it sharing of friendliness also because we have an ecological Campground for us that means it discos and Noise it nature the stream people who bring their own instruments guitars things that are in harmony with this place we who spent last weekend in a yurt and since last week the hummingbird has made its way we renovate thank you for this wonderful meeting and The Awakening of our Consciousness if we can really help people it makes us happy too to best transmit his experience Michelle organizes guided tours for every person who sleeps in his Campground so here is the phyto purification so it coming from the house kitchen washing machine bathroom and shower so here are the dry toilets what me what Little House on the pee Prairie why waterless toilets because here we have two streams one spring One River but we save water nonetheless because firstly it four people 200 L of water a day and 365 days in a year multiplied by 200 people that the water that you pay home goes down the toilet the water arrives here in this small retention and so it dirty Waters from the home kitchen washing machine bathroom and shower like I said and then there is a pump which brings the water and the water goes to the right then to the left it energizes the water you can see the movement it makes so in there there are small fish too mosquito fish which eat the mosquito La as you it I water for me these visits are very important because I communicate with people I share my experience there are discussions and sometimes I don conversations happen that ecological and against progress and against those who don exactly but I also try to make the connection because what you do in the CI is you press buttons turn the tap pay your bills but you don where your energy comes from that we were saying yesterday when we went to eat we had a power outage one day we have electric shutters and so we stayed in the dark Day first I was a draftsman so I drew villas for 13 years I stopped 17 years ago and I drew 650 building permits now I my karma I draw everything I used my old profession in order to draw the cabin sometimes I receive people who work in the nuclear business in Pharmaceuticals in the police so I enjoy when when I have them and it always works well because I put myself at their level and we talk about everything in fact last year I had someone who worked at the trasan nuclear plant which is a member of Greenpeace I think that great and I say thank goodness you here because you are the safeguards the day there be there and as long as there human element where you are well that important that what you do stay with it but if you no longer like it change your life before you get sick get a disease when every morning I went to work and passed the same people all alone in their car for me I felt unwell with myself with my life I had a nice apartment with a beautiful view of the V cor but I didn feel good because I wasn autonomous I told myself the day there a problem I stuck pretend you you press a bit without going too fast it sound come up [Music] he little speech which he believes profoundly but maybe these little bits that he gives to each will perhaps help Society evolve a little too I think it we resistant in the ve call all political parties should Advocate acology it should be that you you wouldn need to have a party a green party an ecologist party it doesn this is is our planet it it future if these Echo villagers hold firmly to remaining in link with Society they also want to establish a strong bond between them every year a global Echo Village Conference is thus organized we attended this meeting in the Tamara Echo Village in Portugal 100 km south of Lisbon in the small town of colos Jen and all the different communities like like yours like Tamara on the on where we are here they offer in a certain sense a seed of Hope something different and something that has been conquered in time and that has been densified in time hello welcome I the community mandala I I the internet platform since since year to bring out knowledge and inspiration from our project but also offer it to other projects and I saw a little bit yeah seeing our project at Bas and slowly getting in contact to people and now suddenly I find myself as part of a team where we really work on a global village also on of this work so I suddenly uh I and my work from a year in a much more effective way uh out into the world what what we need to do is we need to reorient the money of this world from where it moving into creating destruction and we need to move those funds into building sustainability we United Nations meetings for many years um Jen has has a consultative status with eoso so um some of the connections we have with with politicians has come through those Gatherings for instance the connection with the German government was with one of the politicians who was present at the at the climate change meeting in Copenhagen and um being having worked for months and hoping for better results and being very disappointed he ran into a gen Gathering one day and thought wow this is fascinating um what I do believe is that change will not be a top- down process I think that has become more than evident and more than clear you know even the I think it the International Panel for climate change has said very clearly that he believes in change from bottom up because the establishment is moving too slowly there there they have a hard time changing and they need our help and if you look around the awareness change that is happening in the people on the Sur Earth is amazing and it especially with the help of internet I mean it Waves this is what we happening in the Arab Spring and other civil society movements so I believe that the the most underutilized resource at the moment on the planet is the willingness of people to engage for positive change [Music] e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e [Music]	Success

have brought 400 kg of food and Equipment accompanied by a small army of Porters an essential part of any Himalayan Expedition they will walk 5 days to reach the mirror Peak base camp which culminates at an altitude of 6,500 M tomorrow they will climb to 4,500 M the short climatization time makes every step a challenge for [Music] Patrick vanon is not the only one fascinated by our planet glaciers geographer Alton buers is also undergoing a scientific expedition to the imj glacia in the northern part of the kumbu valley 40 years ago today I was walking this same street I was 21 years old and undergraduate the University of Colorado came over to Nepal for 6 months doing a couple of independent studies and this place was very very different in the Everest region the number of tourists has gone from a few dozen in 1970 to over 40,000 a year today bringing with them an Ever growing number of Porters and guides although these crowds have allowed a certain amount of Economic Development they also present serious ecological problems this water used to be used for drinking but now it contaminated from the septic tanks from the dozens of different lodges throughout Nam Bazar and it for washing purposes today now freshwater sources in general are disappearing throughout the kumbu region as a result of irregular precipitation patterns brought on by climate [Music] change the surrounding Villages still rely on mountainwater sources to meet their drinking water needs due to increased tourist pressure the authorities are now turning to the glaciers glaciers all of a sudden are a better bet than are the traditional sources of Springs which are drying up everywhere a few kilometers away the kajo glacier flows into a lake the water of which will be transported down the mountain side through a pipeline that is being built at Great cost but this gives you an idea of the Extreme Measures that people are going to today even in developing countries to um respond to the impacts of climate change are such Investments made in vain considering the Potential Threat that hovers over these [Music] glaciers in the Himalayas the variable flow of stream water has become an Ever growing problem for the hydroelectric stations that can no longer meet the local people needs in cand do daily service interruptions have put serious strain on the electrical grid at least 90% of the country electricity is water powered from River sources a significant amount of this water comes from the monsoon the Himalayan chain is so colossal that it blocks these warm humid winds coming from India the summer sees the formation of gigantic clouds and intense rain batter the base of these mountains at high altitudes near the Summits the resulting abundant snow snowfall helps to replenish the glaciers how are these ice giants evolving while being simultaneously subjected to Monsoon rains and global warming in the Himalayan region such is the question that Patrick Von seeks to [Music] answer they have walked for 2 days from LCA descending to an altitude of 3,500 m in the valley that leads to meor [Music] Peak in addition to the impact of global warming on glaciers other questions are a matter of concern to glaciologist Christian von br [Music] [Music] on September 3rd 1998 part of the Tang nag Village was destroyed when the Lakes Marine burst [Music] the disaster was immortalized by one of the rare Witnesses who still lives on site ear in the morning big noise G like a blance yeah like a flood oh then we wake up we look at up there up there water coming like a cloud okay like cloud from the top down below as my brothers I call it them run up run up run up CL have you seen some uh block of ice after after black ice many ice came we seen yes many ice came with after Landslide we went to see there there was big big ice big big ice in the lake so [Music] climbing up over the scree the scientists find themselves on the Marine that once held back the lake before the disaster the water level reached a line one can still see on the facing slope the brutal emptying of the lake lowered the water level by dozens of meters for on that day two people were killed in the valley over 40 glacial floods have taken place in the Himalayan chain since the 1930s the main reason behind the scientific investigations of Lake imja a large lake found high above the kumbu valley is to determine its risk of draining in the kumu valley the risks associated with glacial melting are a constant preoccupation for Alton bias as he approaches lake imja so now we the land of the glaciers which must be one of the most incredible landscapes in the world everything here has been cars by a glacier at some point in time glaciers in the kumu tend to be debris covered and debris from the sides of the valleys tends to fall on the glaciers and you get a debris covered Glacier however it does have a benefit if you have a thick layer of debris that tends to buffer the glacier against melting but we Glacier imja that has actually turned into a lake and we [Music] why in the Southeastern Himalayan chain and in the Andes glacial lakes are expanding in 1941 in Peru flooding killed 6,000 people in the village of HZ the authorities have since built a dam but the lake continues to grow if it were to burst again this time up to 30,000 people could perish Alton has brought a nepes team with him to Peru to study the solutions applied by local Engineers to lower the level of the lake they dug a trench in the merine and installed a drainage system to evacuate the water here the Marine was made entirely of stone and robust enough to allow construction work to take place without the risk of rupture due to unplanned thwing for the nepales the key issue will be to determine whether the terminal layer of lake imer solid enough to resist such an operation the helps to melt the ice faster at the lake IM base camp Alton buyers meets up with fellow engineer Dean McKinny to conduct research at altitudes over 5,000 m 4 months at first glance the researchers can have passed since they last visited and yet large quantities of ice have detached from the glacier scattering icebergs across the surface of the lake the lake is at the foot of the imja lots of sha and ulape Glaciers three Giants all capable of triggering a devastating TI M wave so behind me you see the uh the mountains with the uh imj Glacier below them the glacier is calving off into the lake and as it does that then the lake volume increases which puts additional pressure on the terminal morine which given the right trigger event such as an earthquake could cause cause a devastating flood Downstream damaging communities and potential loss of [Music] life in car at an altitude of 4900 M patrique Von night fatigue and above all the lack of oxygen are affecting everyone there wants to carry only what is absolutely necessary a vertical difference of 1500 M lies between the climbers and their final objective a real challenge but for the scientists studying glaciers at lower elevations the mirror is not an option not only could this Glacier soon disappear but it is also representative of most Himalayan glaciers which often culminate at altitudes over 6,500 m the researchers have reached a Zone when no human being could possibly survive over an extended period they are breathing less than 50% of the oxygen they are used to in everyday [Music] [Applause] life meanwhile the IMO research team has picked up speed sonar will be used to precisely measure the depth of the lake and its water volume the devices are placed on board a Zodiac boat which was carried here to 5,100 M by nepes [Music] Porters we didn about a/2 inch of ice that we have to break through before we can even paddle 5,000 m okay you see the icebergs in front of you yes head to the left of those icebergs right let to the ice okay cuz it might puncture the raft icebergs now all we need is the gin and the tunel in 2001 another group of scientists estimated the volume of water to be 35 million cubic M and the deepest point of the lake at 92 M left 78 M 79 9 84 [Applause] 88 it than 100 more than 100 here more than 100 m here more than 100 wow boy that I awesome we faster here than we else this is climate change happening right before our [Music] eyes in barely 10 years the volume of the lake has gone from 35 million to over 60 million cubic M at over a million square m it surface is 40 times bigger than it was in 1963 will it be possible to lower the level of the lake as was done by the Peruvian engineers in order to find out the researchers will perform an ultrasound of the Marine retaining the lake and now I ones red goes to Red so every once in a while look and see where we are you got a signal we you want okay [Applause] [Music] the scientists think there could be ice hidden deep within the natural barrier we that ice is because efforts to lower the level of the lake will need probably to cut a channel through this marine and if you encounter ice during the excavation it could lead to a disastrous flood their analysis reveals significant amounts of ice within the Marine which would make drilling dangerous other studies are needed before they can empty the lake without risking accidental and destructive flooding the [Music] [Music] little after five days of hard work patrique vanor and his team have finally arrived at the mirror Peak base camp at an altitude of 5,400 m [Music] the first day at high altitude will be dedicated to collecting data from one of the two weather stations they installed over the past few years these devices which record data continuously are an essential part of the research [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] at According to some studies the Himalayan Glaciers are retreating on a global level which would have a significant impact on the availability of water on which these arid areas depend but this hypothesis cannot be confirmed without high quality scientific data gathered over extended periods of time [Music] Glaciers are constantly flowing due to the effect of gravity the equilibrium line is the limit between the high zone of the glacier where it grows in mass and the lower Zone where it loses Mass 100 met higher Christian and oi are measuring the glacier thickness they have only a few days to survey a very large surface area they provides a precise location on the glacier in relation to a fixed point off the glacier surface [Music] recent assessments of Glacier Mass have shown that even the glaciers at higher altitudes than the mirror are in danger those that fall into Lake inja are unstable and [Music] thinning to better understand this phenomenon Alton Bas has decided to continue his research by the lake this time in Winter he from the University of Colorado Boulder ulana horod discus so my work is looking at how glacial lakes evolve with time uh and the way I do this is using time-lapse photography I use things such as solar radiation meters I measure water temperatures air temperatures all to understand what the physical pavers are governing Lake formation and evolution the scientists begin a hike to the heart of one of the glaciers valleys alongside Lake in [Music] Marine the path is covered with powdered eroded rock also known as glacial flower this is proof of the power of this ice giant which melted here long ago even in the middle of winter the imja glacier is losing mass numerous icebergs litter the lake up in the accumulation Zone there um where you see all that clean ice that glacier and so it even the IM Glacier now the problem here is that we have this cing front so even though we might be at adding Mass from the accumulation Zone to this Glacier it feeding all this ice into the lake and you see all these icebergs all around right and so that mass is leaving and entering into the lake and changing into liquid form now this accelerated melting can be explained by global warming but there are also other influencing factors then you also have debris thickness that matters uh for example on inja it you have really thin debris cover you can actually absorb more of that heat flux that heat to the ice and melt it [Music] faster another significant cause is the accumulation of melted runoff water on the glacier surface this forms small lakes surrounded by Ice that gradually breaks down you can cause calving or collapse of those ice walls and so that way you can really expand your ponds until they start to Coal into a much larger Lake and so that actually understand how quickly that happens how do I do that timlapse photography it can actually show these ice walls collapsing [Music] the researchers have found what seems to be the entrance to a cave and decide to explore it this means undertaking an expedition over the semi Frozen surface of Lake imja the surface it much so did you say this was filled with water when you were here in September yes we actually saw a lot of water flowing through this tunnel and how we know that is if you look down on the ground here you have a lot of fine particles and so the water deposited this and now all we have left is this evidence right in front of us so my time- lapse imagery on unuma shows these lake levels going up and down and so we don evidence of it happening from the surface flow so we think it must be some kind of connection and so the answer I of preliminarily came up with is it natural siphon like process something happens further up Glacier maybe a crack opens water pours down through one of these tunnels that we right here causes the lake level to rise puts pressure on that system it reaches a threshold and then it that [Music] water the Imaging technique used by David brashers during his flight over Lake imja allows him to envisage the possible effects of glacial flooding on the kumbu valley so the concern is should this Lake grow quite large and break a terminal Marine here that a gloth a glacier Lake Outburst flood and it has the potential to run down this Valley and threaten the inhabitants such as here at dingbo or further uh Downstream will the kumbu people have to leave their Valley someday Alton buers knows dingbo and its residents well he has befriended them over the past 10 years he on multiple projects attempting to find possible solutions to the dangers that threaten the villagers living in sight of Lake imja Sonam heishi understands these dangers better than anyone in 1985 a glacial flood in a neighboring Valley carried off his cattle and destroyed his Fields along with his home no we don know before we not see for that kind of big flood you know and the the lake is natural dime that we thought is very strong very safety but there out you know sonam towards Lake inja a mere 10 km from ding Bo we know that one other day is they should be the you know leg broke down and we all afraid but we not do anything we don have money that way you know the all we have to pray for the god that have to do it is not impossible that Lake im expansion could one day be of used to the people of dingbo assuming scientists manag to control the draining of the lake a small hydroelectric plant built nearby could convert the potential energy of the lake into something that benefits the people [Music] back on mirror Peak at 5550 M after 3 days of hard work Christian and noi have successfully completed their mission the challenge was difficult this year due to the particularly strong Monsoon which left a thick layer of snow at high [Music] altitudes fore spe for don foree spe [Music] at the mirror Peak base camp there are barely 18 hours left before the team make their first attempt to reach the summit before that Patrick vanon will climb to 5800 M to take a core sample he snow that accumulated on the high part of the glacier during the monsoon the size and weight of each core section allows patrique to determine its equivalent in water [Music] the glacier is measured with bamboo sticks taken from the forest 2,000 M below it is a physically Landing operation as it requires using a steam probe that weighs nearly 20 [Music] kg by subtracting the ablation values from the accumulation measurements patrique and Christian will obtain a key figure that reflects the overall health of the glacier this allows them to determine whether the glacier or shrunk over the past [Music] year on his end glaciologist Patrick Gino is digging through the thick snow lirer that accumulated during the monsoon for this snow will be analyzed in a laboratory to determine its chemical composition PE [Music] [Music] despite their fatigue chrisan and Obi have successfully carried out the last day of ice thickness measurements at over 5,800 M but the hardest part is still to come only m foree one short night is all that lies between the climbers and their final most challenging destination mirror [Music] Peak [Music] [Music] for for [Music] at around 8:00 a.m. the first high altitude sherper reaches the summit followed closely by Patrick vano and Patrick [Music] Gino an hour later Christian von courageously [Music] arrives for [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign spee foreign foreign [Music] foreign for El [Music] for it has taken the team nearly 8 hours to assemble the weather station now one of the highest in the world the data provided by this station will allow scientists to better understand the Himalayan glaciers and will help highlight the impact of global warming here and elsewhere where on the [Music] planet according to recent studies Himalayan glaciers have lost an average of 10 times less mass than what was originally believed in the 1990s some of our planet indeed melted but the amount of ice lost has been largely compensated for by new snowfall and thus new ice however the retreat of small glaciers in mid-altitude valleys seems irreversible in the last 40 or 50 years there glaciers in this region small glaciers have disappeared by the hundreds debris covered glaciers have lost mass or a bladed other glaciers have receded and created large and potentially dangerous glacial lakes so we need to start thinking seriously about this now how to control these new glacial lakes before they become large and potentially dangerous all area is the glow warming maybe reason for that before winter the snowfall now the day time doesn snowfall as a more heat comes and gler areas all melting faster at an altitude of 4,500 or 5,000 m certain villagers notice firsthand that the ice and snow are melting yet scientific research draws a more nuanced picture for for [Music]	Success

retreat of the glaciers and the climactic variations affecting the Region two [Music] seasons throughout the year he analyzes rainfall and solar radiation levels affecting the glacia for [Music] [Music] in the southern hemisphere the seasons are switched around and December is the month with the highest solar radiation levels Rising temperatures should cause the ice to melt but December is also the peak of the rainy [Music] season the falling snow blocks some of the sun glacia nevertheless all it takes is for the rainy season to shift by a few days or a few weeks and the entire system comes [Music] [Music] unhinged understanding The Retreat of the andian glaciers means taking an interesting climate and more particularly in the factors affecting the arrival of the rainy season Studies by glaciologists have shed light on the direct connection between glacial melting and the greatest climate regulator on planet Earth the Pacific Ocean it stretches out west beyond the Andes and comes just to the foot of the Cera this ocean stocks 70% of solar energy in the form of a gigantic warm water Reserve that has a surface area roughly equivalent to the size of Europe it is at the origin of a climactic phenomenon known as El Nino normally this mass of warm water lingers near the Australian coast but due to trade winds and sea currents it drifts towards the East Pacific in a cyclical way said for [Music] is today connected to the El Nino phenomenon or is it a consequence of more recent [Music] events in order to find out we need to understand glacial Evolution on a much larger time [Music] scale Vincent jamell research director at cnrs studies glacial Marines the rocky debris the glacia pushes ahead of it before leaving it behind when the ice begins to [Music] retreat over thousands of years the shakini glacia left strips of Rock and dirt in the wake of its advances and Retreats they are obvious and perfectly [Music] visible one can read these successive deposits like an open book which contains the entire history of the glacia [Music] to decipher the story of the shakini glacia the first step is to date these Rocky deposits the most commonly used method for determining the age of ancient elements is carbon dating however carbon dating requires organic matter containing carbon Vincent jelli is searching for vegetal debris that was once imprisoned by the Marine when the glassier advanced the resulting Pete has accumulated over many years it is a vegetal Lair that develops on extremely humid ground such as that at the foot of a glacia the moment the glacia advances the Pete is gradually entrapped in the Marine as time passes this organic matter fossilizes what [Music] indexed and carefully packaged these Pete samples are sent to a laboratory where they will be carbon [Music] dated to properly date the Marines Vincent jelli also relies on large Boulders that bear witness to the life of the glacia these large blocks weigh many tons and the glacia shifts them over long distances as it moves forward as the glacia Retreats and the ice melts they remain stranded on the ground Cosmic radiation provokes a reaction at the core of the rock modifying the crystals of quartz and other minerals [Music] inside it is the appearance of this modification that in the lab each sample reveals the exact moment a piece of rock was deposited on the ground following the glassier [Music] retreat [Music] set for [Music] EX the work by the glaciologists confirms what they saw in the [Music] field The Retreat of the shakini glacia has been accelerating drastically in 40 years it has shrunk as much as it had in a century the suspicions of the scientific Community are well founded a new phenomenon is at work this has nothing to do do with the ordinary cycle of glassier advances and Retreats in this part of the Andes 1976 is a key date in time for Bern franu [Music] atmosphere the acceleration of the glasser is the result of a combination of two phenomena a natural cycle of warming in the Pacific compounded by the global warming linked to human activity the volume of the andian glaas is collapsing between 1975 and 2006 it diminished by 43% the rapid Retreat of the glassiers is not without consequence as they draw back glassiers uncover strips of thed land where new life has not yet had time to resettle these zones larger than ever before are unstable they have a significant impact on local biodiversity the living conditions here are extreme Olivier dong a biologist at the research institute studies the water torren released when glaas melt accompanied by a Bolivian student he heads to the foot of the zongo glacia about 20 M from laaz in these cold and nutrient poor Waters lives a population of of micro invertebrates insect and crustacean naari these minuscule beings are at the bottom of the food chain the birds and fish living at lower altitudes feed on them [Applause] [Music] l certain invertebrates have adapted specifically to survive in such demanding conditions for high altitude glacia streams are like small islands of isolated life here the migration of invertebrates is extremely restrained for the invertebrates that live on the glacial front are not the only organisms threatened by the glasser pullback the ground that has just been liberated from beneath the ice is a virgin space on offer for new plant [Music] life candidates for colonization find themselves facing highly selective conditions in the newly melted zongo glacia Zone faban onel a plant specialist at the research institute sets up a perimeter for his sampling he is creating an inventory of the pioneers of plant [Music] colonization for in the Andes the snow cover is fragile plants are exposed to the cold virtually all year and subjected to extreme alternations between freezing and thoring conditions the local environment is so demanding that only the most opportunistic plants have a chance at survival in this Frozen and mineral Universe the plants can only rely on themselves to spread their seeds no animals or insects here will help to transport them adorned with small plumage these seeds take off at the slightest puff of air and travel with the Wind [Music] pollen on the other hand has a notched form during reproduction this shape allows the pollen to stick and resist the violent high altitude [Music] [Music] winds but these fast moving migratory plants are not the key players in the area opportunists they take advantage of the shelter offered by other very particular plants which are essential to the creation of fertile soil for [Music] although ground covering plants are of vital importance for biodiversity their development is very slow this sluggishness is a handicap given the fast moving Retreat of the glaas of the cordier Royale [Music] [Music] back when the andian glaciers were relatively stable ground covering plants developed over long periods of time hundreds if not thousands of years this is evidenced by the Pete found in the shakini Marines and the other glaciers in the region these thick plants with spongy like texture unfold at the foot of the glaas like a giant carpet that captures the [Music] meltwater these damp zones are important for the survival of numerous insects and herbivores such as llas alpacas and vicunas all emblematic of the region during the dry season they act as natural reservoirs that Supply drinking water to the local cities if the glaciers that dominate lapaz were to disappear the consequences would be catastrophic for this city of over 1 million inhabitants [Music] over the past Century lapaz has continued to grow its density became so concentrated that a second City sprung up on the [Music] plateaus as a result the water resources for this expanding urban area are seriously threatened [Music] Bernard franu and hydrologist Edson Ramirez share a common concern given the combination of global warming and the fluctuations in the rainy season they fear the worst for the local population for [Music] the easiest solution is to replace the glassiers with artificial retainers these reserves could hold millions of gallons of water [Music] will the rain satisfy the water needs of the region in a sustainable way it is highly unlikely over the past 40 years El Nino significant impact on the fluctuations of the rainy season [Music] at the same time the cities are experiencing wild and uncontrollable growth the need for hydroelectricity has exploded across the area and demand for drinking water has increased exponentially out of touch with nature the population of leaz is still unaware of the true impact the rapid Retreat of the glaciers could have on the region the collective belief is that water has always been an unlimited natural resource the ecological upheaval currently taking place will have a huge economic impact building structures to stock water at high altitude is very expensive fore [Music] creating massive Stocks by building high altitude water reservoirs is not just a matter of economic cost the andian cordier is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire and volcanic activity in the region is intense an earthquake of exceptional magnitude could have catastrophic consequences the situation is even more serious in Peru where the Ciera is higher the Steep glassiers create their own Lakes which are ticking time bombs for the inhabitants of the valleys [Music] below for Berna franu The Retreat of the glaciers in this mountainous region strongly accentuates the danger in fact the cordier Blanca is the world the difference in height is such that going from one Valley to the next is already an expedition the Summits are practically vertical with global warming the glaciers clinging to their sides risk collapsing at any moment in addition when a glacia melts huge quantities of water can accumulate behind the old merine built up when the front of the glacia was at lower altitude the merine that held back the Waters of Laguna sauna is over 100 m High a tunnel was dug through this is an emergency Spillway in other words a security valve that would allow draining the lake in case of a sudden and unexpected rise in water level belna has come to meet Thomas condo a hydrologist at the research institute who is studying the risks associated with these glacial lakes [Music] [Music] Thomas surveys the lake to investigate the state of the glacial merine this endeavor is quite risky a chunk of rock or rice could fall into the lake at any moment the resulting impact could provoke a tidal wave [Music] the Glasser accelerated melting intensifies the danger the more water there is in the lake the higher the chance the Marine holding it back will eventually break to estimate the volume of water Thomas begins a bimmetry this test reveals the depth of the lake over its entire surface using Sonar equipment during the last rock slide the tunnel fortunately served its purpose for in the Peruvian Ciera Blanca Laguna Safa is not one of a kind PR glacial lakes where the Marine could potentially rupture and devastate The Valleys below are abundant by accelerating glacial melting global warming has significantly increased the danger in the course fora blaner alone there are around 200 proglacial Lakes these lagoons are suspended miles above the urban areas most of the time they are invisible to the people who are unaware or at best underestimate the constant Danger the sudden draining of local proglacial Lakes have already claimed a number of lives the andian populations accept these events with a certain [Music] fatalism although the great majority of them are Catholic they consider Mountain Water as a gift from patam mama or Mother Earth while glacial water is sometimes synonymous with death it also allows for irrigation and farming in the heart of these arid deserts [Music] in Peru the kuiti festival is the most important event of the year in early June thousands of pilgrims from all across the Andes converged near the kulki punu glacia near kusco at the heart of the cordier Blanca for as long as they can remember the andian populations have paid homage to the glassiers that provide them with the water they deem miraculous [Music] nearly 50,000 worshippers make the journey setting up camp over 3 days at over 5,000 m in altitude the kuiti pilgrimage Blends both Catholic beliefs and andian mythology hallu one may sing hymns or burn altar candles but pieces of ice are used instead of holy bread the body of Christ and the glacia are one Bernar franu is familiar with the ceremony it took part in it and his return is filled with concern much like the other andian glassiers the kip punku is noticeably retreating if the most sacred andan glacia were to disappear an important part of the Native people would be wiped away with it [Music] for Bernard fonu this is also an opportunity to find people who have seen the glassier shrink firsthand can can you rare photographs taken over 50 years ago reveal the magnitude of the kip punku retreat [Music] worshippers take turn and pray throughout the night until the gods [Music] awake the kuya ceremony which coincides with the June Solstice perpetuates the ancient Inca Sun ceremony it awakens the spirits of the mountains and glassiers [Music] [Music] Z for [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the costumes worn by the pilgrims relate to the origins of the people those from the high Andes regions wear animal skins while those from the lower Amazonian regions done exotic bird feathers they join forces on this high plate the boundary between two worlds where the mountains meet the forests the ukus are mythological half bear half man creatures they provide the link between these two [Music] worlds they are creatures of the Dawn and sunset both troublemakers and policemen they bring Order and Chaos Alik [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] the yukus are an order founded on and around the spiritual nature of the glacia [Music] you respective btis after being symbolically baptized with a whip the novice becomes a new guardian of the kip punu the yukus are aware of the dangers that threatened their sacred glacia fearing The Disappearance of the homes of the apus so Paramount to their world they have abandoned the most important ritual of the kuar festival for [Music] [Music] GL [Music] [Music] atere the pilgrims pack their bags with heavy hearts they fear that one day they will witness the end of the kuiti the melting of the andian glaciers is a tragedy the day water no longer flows from the mountain life on its high valleys will cease the people of the cordier will lose part of their soul and Native culture that are already Gravely threatened [Music] if the andian glaas were to disappear our entire world would suffer the [Music] loss e [Music]	Success
Cyborgs Among Us: The Future of Humanity | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-oyBsJY9e8	SLICE Science	[Music] never was the relationship between humans and technology so close but for cyborgs it their bodies with technology I a new sense and a new organ and I designed my perception of reality I have an implant here and I use my implant on a daily basis without it being medically necessary cyborgs inject magnets into their fingers plant chips under their skin they implant technology we crazy ideas with people who are trying to shape the future now we do like a 100 a month maybe so the exponential growth is catching on so as soon as soon as there have 200k 400k 800k 2 million 8 million 16 million will it be normal in the future to upgrade our bodies or are we already [Music] there if your mobile phone is running out of battery many people say I running out of battery this is a clear sign of using or talking about technology in P first person as if you were already technology yeah if someone offers me to to to get a new hand instead of this one but just stronger and better and more efficient and more precise then I would be absolutely willing to do this when people say I that implies I can do things that you can do it boundaries it Neil harberson is as he says the world first officially recognized cyborg the composer has been colorblind since birth he sees the world in Shades of Gray [Music] so each color has its own light frequency which corresponds to a sound frequency So the antenna allows me to hear the sound of each color this is F this is a so each color has its own note so when I put colors on a piece of paper to me like putting music on paper in 2004 Neil harberson had the antenna implanted by an anonymous surgeon it contains a sensor that that recognizes color frequencies and transmits them to a chip in the back of his head this chip turns them into audio signals so it improvising so it just um playing different notes at the beginning it was overwhelming hearing so many colors and need some time of adaptation the brain will need to adapt to the new input until it becomes like any other sense or pre-existing sense and then when it becomes normal you feel the need to extend it again so that happened to me that when I was able to hear all the colors visual because I I I felt it was a repetition all the time so that UltraViolets in this way harberson can also hear sunrays motion detectors remote control and anti- theft devices but is that desirable 24 hours a day So the antenna is always on there no switch at night when I turn off the lights there there so people can still send colors to my head while I uh they can color my dreams it creates problems har fought with the British authorities for a long time before he was allowed to include the antenna in his passport well the biggest struggle of being a cyborg is society it who are not tolerant to one it people who really think that we are against uh nature and against humans and against God but Harbison also has some of them in Germany in Berlin there is a community of people that are very um enthusiastic about cyboris maybe not so artistically but I think here in Berlin it social thing cyborgs view themselves as for runners of a growing movement [Music] Oliver V Jurgensen belongs to the Berlin cyborg Society oh cyborg cyborgs need vitamins too VAR jurgenson is a chocolate maker and member of the pirate party and he intends to turn himself into a [Music] cyborg it takes a bit of practice it easier to make this bread than most people think we our own bread for four or five years venson lives together with his partner and their children the past few years have been hard V jurgenson suffers from arthritis he already has two artificial knees and an artificial hip and although he again it he wants to upgrade this one [Music] all the things you can do with a hip like that of course biom monitoring is no problem the bloodstream and the neutral stimuli provide a lot of information and then of course the little gimmicks like this mobile Wi-Fi router or I have a smartphone in my pocket next to the artificial hip and it gets charged when I move or from the heat of My Blood just don to get something better no of course not nothing think this is cool would you think it cool if Ollie had a Wi-Fi rout in his hip a free radio rout with Wi-Fi wherever I happened to be cool then you wouldn you already I don believe me how do people get such ideas for as long as I wanted like a little boy to be connected to the internet like in science fiction he him anything that upgrade his body he would do immediately when Oliver V jurgenson received his three artificial joints he Associated the operations with pain and feeling old it would be different if they built in a wireless charger for his smartphone he says that would be cool a form of avanguard Blazing a trail it would take a lot of pressure off me of course on the one hand this is the fourth time so I know what to expect but if they were going to build in some gimmick it would make it easier but German law does not permit implants with supplementary functions so VAR jurgenson has been in direct contact with manufacturers for months in Germany an implant is just an implant you don the current View and of course it has to be cracked we want to reach the people who make these decisions who can also say wait a minute here needs to be filled you need to get your toe in the door and if the manufacturers don at some time in the future will artificial spare parts be able to do more than the originals this question obsesses beral Meer he was born without the lower half of his left arm and wears an artificial hand probably the best that [Music] available basically the artificial hand can can the artificial 1 360° continuously but that practical I always say it trick but it theoretically because of course it shows that even an artificial limb which in many ways is not as good as the original can be better in other areas in very specific abilities beral Meer is a social psychologist at the Technical University in chemnitz he focuses on people who want artificial body parts even though they healthy I think it people say theoretically I replace a healthy body part with an artificial one because it would make me somehow [Music] better I think well frankly being 100 % healthy is a privilege that I don have so I think perhaps you should be a bit more aware of what a privilege that is that you enjoy humans are weak vulnerable and forgetful technology is supposed to liberate them from Nature limitations but why take Tools in your hands when you can carry them inside yourself is this the next logical step to upgrade humans to become stronger faster more perfect is this the end of human weakness or the beginning of the end of [Music] humanity Patrick palman dreams of overcoming the limitations of his body with technology as a small step in this direction he inserts micro implants into his body December in December 2010 at the chaos communication Congress left anonym gave a lecture entitled cybernetics for the masses he explained how you can perform your own implantations at very little cost the lecture mentioned magnet implants and RFID implants I became very curious about how magnetic and electromagnetic fields would feel then I decided to do it magnet implants don at the present time they vibrate in Patrick palan he approaches an electric cable but a car manufacturer is researching where the drivers could be sent signals via magnetic vibrations for instance in a dangerous situation humans react to tactile feelings more quickly than to any other sense data Patrick palman lives in hin on the German Dutch border he now has five magnets and six chips in his body each chip has its own function I have the advantage that I can never lose my keys or have them stolen from me I can never lock myself out it makes life easier when my hands are full I don trouser Pockets to find my keys and look which key do I need for the door with another chip palman can log on to his computer the chips operate with a technology known as RFID radio frequency identification it allows data to be transmitted over a short distance without a battery palman has already ordered another chip it apparently has its own apps by means of which messages can be encoded and payments made so far palman only knows the chip from the internet of the some people have had the idea of making glasses lasering eyes developing hearing implants we keep developing the aim is to make life simpler I only see advant cyborgs are viewed as eccentrics but the industry thinks this is going to change Neil Harbison is often invited to talk to telecommunications companies a sensational presentation here on the stage I he [Applause] [Music] so what I like doing is sound portraits where instead of uh drawing someone face I get close to someone write down the sound of the eyes the lips the skin and the hair the first one I did was of Prince Charles I asked him if I could listen to his face and this was his reaction when I asked him each person sounds different Judy DCH has silent hair for example algor has different nodes in his eyes different shades of turquoise Steve rice has a melody in his eyes cuz he has like a small pattern uh M has has one note less he has no hair so he has less sounds woodan like a soft painting very unsaturated Neil Harbison makes a good living from his lectures his cyborg existence is it just clever self-promotion or is he really a social Pioneer yeah in 20130 years I think it will be strange to not to have an implant of some sort in the same way that now it with tattoos and whereas maybe 50 years it would be really strange now it common to modify our skin it will soon be very common to modify our [Music] mind but a practical problem for cyborgs is the implantation itself doctors are not permitted to perform non-medical operations so hia kenup is kept busy the piercer turns humans into cyborgs today it wants to have a magnet implanted in her [Music] hand partly curiosity but mainly in fact for professional Reasons I like pin cushions so a small magnet here on my hand will be be very useful cutting your skin for such trifling reasons is surprising but the piercer hea kop hasn can [Music] help it as the patient signs a contract that she Bears all the risks and implanting magnets carries considerable risks I reliable firms rust in the body they rust it out or they led to allergic reactions there the body will react to magnets it can reject them nerves can be [Music] damaged fine [Music] a the procedure costs roughly €150 and takes about 10 [Music] minutes that it feels like a pulling sensation it strong most people would never dream of implanting magnets or chips in their bodies but kikino believes that will change there are now chips in the beta phase that are more functional and I can see that in two five maybe 10 years much more useful implants will be invented implants like sardia which registers heart frequency and other physical data but on a smaller scale for much let sardia is as big as a smartphone an American had it implanted in his arm in 2013 it is hey everybody my name is Tim Cannon I just became the first man to implant a device in my body that was solely for the purpose of enhancing myself sardia can continuously measure body temperature pulse and blood levels and transmit the data to a smartphone Patrick palman is also interested in this implant yeah I implant any longer from what I see on the internet it big it looks creepy and was dangerous the batteries in sardia may have leaked that after 3 months but he wanted to show what available on a smaller scale I have an implant in my lower arm which measures my body temperature there inside and I have an RFID device that reads the chip it displays the serial number and the temperature in my lower arm [Applause] unlike thermometers or activity trackers these chips gather the data continuously without you having to think about them eventually nanorobots could circulate in our bloodstream and analyze everything what we could continuously monitor our health and detect diseases before they develop but do we want that have total surveillance of our bodies Patrick palman is still waiting for the new Chip he ordered it will enable him to encode data he now wants to further develop the chips himself he goes to hackspace a meeting point for technology freaks in hin palman founded it himself [Music] even at the drinks machine he only has to scan his chip and it transmits his [Music] data palman and his friends want to get more and more out of each [Music] device done I want to lock and unlock my car without using a key if you accidentally feed current into this white wire you break the device this could go wrong that sh palman has to change the switch of his Central lock system so it can read his Chip he Tinkers with the device for 5 [Music] hours it now but the engine Joshua [Music] electron the members of hacker space believe that they are helping to shape the future but making even a little progress costs a lot of [Music] effort a few hours later Perman succeeds the central Locking System can now read his chip now it has to be installed in the car um just it [Music] locked great now I can throw away the keys once again pman has improved his life a little now he just has to wait for the Chip he ordered from the USA Oliver V jurgenson in Berlin is fighting for his cyberg hip so far the implant manufacturers have given him the cold shoulder he support of his orthopedist Dr pet [Music] Hansel would he agree to implant a hip with which VAR Jurgensen could charge his mobile with the energy produced by his movements or one containing a mobile Wi-Fi router okay so in the head or in the acetabulum there would be space for a little gimmick certainly it could easily be built into an artificial joint you just have to watch out for the radiation exposure of course that issue right laws and ethics play a role but we somebody like this they can think about whether it could be upgraded a bit of course the radiation exposure could become a problem because the radiation has to pass through all the skin layers there but Dr pet Hansel believes in the future of such implants I this I from the medical point of view but also when it patient most Physicians are skeptical about cyborg ideas it jurgenson has received support from a doctor he has contacts among the manufacturers and he could help us convince them that it wouldn party game but something for the future form from avangard but where does the compulsion come from to do such a radical thing equipping your body with technology is a way of making it more efficient and appearing more efficient and perhaps of increasing your own value a bit because of my disability my self-esteem is certainly not the best and I know the feeling that a bit of complicated technology can increase your sense of selfworth humans become designers of their own bodies when everybody immediately knows everything about everyone else when little robots inside us watch over our blood and when there anymore between online and offline a new human era will start would it be like when humans first invented tools and life became easier or will it be a competition for the best implant what will happen if some people refuse to have them would it produce a division like between rich and poor between upper and lower class in Sweden there about being a cyborg a Stockholm media Enterprise is holding an implantation party it has invited the artistic crowd they can upgrade their bodies at the party it was hanis cot founder of a biohacker group biohackers refuse to accept biology and the limitations of nature they want to upgrade their bodies with technology today s blat is promoting rid chips the same chips that Patrick palman carries in his [Music] body I mean it works like this we humans we are skeptical about things we don really understand right but if you explain how it works what are the good things what are the bad things what are the dangers I mean then most people are simply comfortable with it so this is what I try to do I of sing implants I just like to share the insights I have getting a chip implanted in Sweden costs exactly the same as in Germany about €120 the chips are made of bioglass so the body doesn the size of a grain of rice Helena yvert is one of the first who wants to try them out I am not nervous at all actually it sticking to my thought on that try everything once you only live once I might take it out tomorrow you love it 5 seconds later Helena yvert is chipped hopefully I can open my door with it I have to call the uh insurance company and the the people delivering the door and see if I can open that with it an extraordinary number of people who get chips implanted don exactly to do with them a company representative explains how they can save passwords or their business cards on the chips and transmit them to a smartphone with a wave of the hand theoretically the data could easily get into the wrong hands no doubts at all I think it great I think it thing and I think it beginning of this it should be I think it be will be an explosion going forward 10% within 5 years yeah we really uh Avant guard with technology I mean the upcoming generation it with an iPad or an iPhone or Samsung they I mean my son is 6 years old um he his iPad like kindergarten [Music] the public transport company in Stockholm is even considering letting passengers pay for their tickets with implanted chips Helena yvert who has just received her first chip thinks that idea I lose my things all the time I lose my uh passport I lose my uh bus card my keys my card to the gym if everything could be one place that would be amazing and I hope I hope that will come during next 6 months but maybe I shouldn too optimistic uh but I guess I would be i be more free elsewhere in Stockholm chips are already Common Place the epicenter is a large modern office complex in the central business district there are dozens of startups here as a matter of course workers open the doors with [Music] implants it was hanus sbl host at the implantation party and he the building spirit I want to question the status quo I mean yes we all our lives right we are used to it but someone has to say we don someone needs to see what is possible to do tomorrow so far workers have been able to choose the question of course is whether they will still be able to do so in future I just want to have a community of smart people who learn how this works because if the day comes when a big company launches the the the Eye implant or the Swedish tax Authority says we were going to chip everyone then we will have a group of people who understand understands this technology and can challenge the uses that the authority wants this technology to have on us so for me this is so important with the democratization of Technology it just to learn how to use a technology it it [Music] you what if the data on the chips was accessed by strangers the orwellian dystopia the big brother would no longer be fiction chips could create the transparent citizen Fork gab from the chaos Computer Club believes that the secret services and business would be very interested in this data of course it them to register people in passing without having to use face recognition or similar techniques simply to say that was this and that person who just walked along there and there to produce personality profiles or movement patterns at the end of the day these Technologies can be used against [Music] us in Berlin hea kenup has an appointment with a regular client Arina Duo doesn magnets in her body but bigger implants that need batteries am I going to be one of the first people cuz they said they first 2,000 people who pre-order it or yes you will be one of of the first as far as I know the first one in Germany oh my god really yes and Arena wants the north sense a kind of compass the implant is supposed to vibrate whenever she faces North this is not a device or a gadget this is technology that evolves with you in time you memory experience and feeling big promises lead to Great Expectations it would be exciting because it Maps at some point you will be just used to you know you walk uh down that street or you you have this feeling oh okay I have to go there yeah getting the nor sense can completely transform my perception of of of travels of of discovering cities of maybe uh I will still get lost but I will kind of know which direction I going and that that can really yeah that changes my perception I wouldn Arena doesn she would even replace some body parts if I can have a heart that makes me live forever sure um I guess if if we get to the point where we can exchange uh body parts then eventually I will have to exchange all of them because they naturally die could humans eventually upgrade themselves for immortality a political scientist at the ks Institute of Technology is researching how cyborg Technologies are influencing our society I if we assume that Society remains roughly as it is I that the so-called refuseniks people who reject these developments can keep resisting a simple example I remember is how people discussed the importance of participating fully in society without using the internet of course you can refuse to use the internet today but I think it would be difficult even to study without it human dignity is in alienable when the boundaries between humans and electronic devices are blurred where is our identity is it going to be a question of what upgrade we can afford this new life means greater control we can stop diseases and Decay but we will need a new frame of values and social mores for this freedom [Music] [Laughter] things are not looking good for Oliver B jurgenson and his cyborg H he hasn been able to convince the manufacturers so today he the pyra Society where he the board pyra focuses on political education and its members have good contacts amongst politicians and academics he hopes to get their support I support from your connections to find other men ufacturers probably outside of Europe and for us to say come on guys let this I don reach the manufacturers perhaps you can explain because I think the first thing you need to do the first people you need to talk to are the guys involved in medical ethics and they are not the manufacturers [Music] another issue of course is the legal aspect apart from the ethics experts the lawyers that Target group to get them to think about where the boundaries lie you should really be having this discussion with technologists doctors and ethical experts and not just for a matina but a whole Workshop I think that could trigger a social debate we would support you I said this from the start it issue great thank you your reaction cool it really pleased with the feedback far Genson could get his cyborg hip quite soon I hope Society will take more notice of Cy orgism and it spreads so that people overcome the fear they have it guy is trying to improve himself with technology and he advantage over me that indisputable it ISM we need to work on it and demand that Society create the conditions in which the two can coexist and in the best case scenario cooperate Patrick palman has been waiting for this day for months he the Prototype of the data encoding chip from the USA in his [Music] luggage I able to test it yet I hope everything works out palman wants to get the implant done in hia Kiko [Music] hi I brought the new implant show me the packet arrived yesterday perfect timing they don works when it was tested recently on another volunteer it broke immediately okay so this is it it my first time wow it it but relatively flat I certainly want to test it first if it [Music] see what does that mean no um sorry communic tag communication was [Music] interrupted now it it chip so it go the Prototype chip is exceptionally large it can Skin like most of the other chips palman has what implants do you have now only the NFC chip NFC chip I can the number off hand a 125 RFID M the procedure takes 45 minutes then palman has the 12th implant in his [Music] body so so it inside inside for palman the chip is mainly a status symbol I been yes I it yet and I [Music] testers the manufacturer asked me if I could test it and I said yes yeah [Music] palman can now encode with the chip and eventually perhaps even pay with it it certainly won implant Neil harberson also has plans he wants to receive an implant that is entirely [Music] new so now I will be circular between the skin and the bone and it will give heat depending on what time it is so it would take 24 hours for the heat to go around the head so I feeling the heat around the head but if I have this for several months or years it should become my perception of time so then I to control if I want time to go faster or slower if I make the heat go slower I want time to go faster I can program it so it goes faster if I make it go twice forward or backwards so it Einstein into a sense into an organ to see whether or not you can control your perception of time if you have an organ for time it really manipulate our sense of time like that but what technologies will change our society imagine two persons meeting in the future What would will the interaction be like so possibly let say we have a implant technology that logs the different processes that is going on in the body someone is stressed someone is Happy someone is angry someone is in love and imagine the ability to share this information directly inside someone else I think this would create a greater understanding between people and a greater understanding for what another person is feeling and going through and I hope that this will make make us more ethical persons if we have a greater understanding for each [Music] other I think it to leave the debate about the social effects of technology to technologists engineers and economists it start a discussion in the media about what lies ahead what what effect it could have on our society [Music] I think we should reflect on these processes before they Rush In on us what is technically possible [Music]	Success
Automated Driving: The Future of Transportation | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7T1DotohBM	SLICE Science	[Music] what can tomorrow everyone and self-drive cars we consider the fully automated or autonomous vehicle to be entirely realistic this is all happening now it no longer the future Studies by the manufacturers promise of Rosy future but what do things look like in reality what can tomorrow going to show you using the new Mercedes-Benz S-class as our example it progress Carl hin land an independent expert on digitization creates an awareness of the rapidly changing market and the urgency of digital change [Music] the fact is that digitization something we private lives is changing the way things are being produced and the services on offer that in turn is causing the digital transformation and this is being called the fourth Industrial Revolution which will probably have a more lasting effect on our private and business lives than in the first three revolutions since the invention of the steam engine the latest generation of the mercedesbenz S-Class a preview for international motoring journalists a very special moment the evolution of intelligent motoring that makers are calling this view into the future at the preview the international press has not only given information about drive and Chassis but invited to a Hands-On experience of the special features of the mercedesbenz S-Class Mercedes has set up a test run especially to simulate realistically critical Maneuvers engineer Frank Verner mour explains completely free no problem yes let what do you see it oh sorry have a look I accelerator you see it in the Sass entirely new in the S-Class we have a system that allows us to recognize very quickly and reliably any vehicles moving across the field of view we do this with a camera and radar system which can each recognize the other vehicle but we use both to be quite sure we get no false positive and we can react very quickly to avoid an accident we will do it a second time but we will make a little bit difference in the maneuver you say what will happen I don know what will happen we will CR hey it break and when the car was through the brakes went open the car behind us was not irritated of course we S-Class the very latest in automated driving we to a new level and tried to give the driver all the little helpers needed to make driving even safer and even more comfortable these little helpers include the active distance assistant distronic with the active steering assistant the two together can support the dve D in numerous situations the active Lane change assistant in the new S-Class a light touch on the blinkers all that to change lanes the magic body control chassis with curve function causes this body work to tilt by 2.65 de towards the inside of the bend reducing the perceived Cent Fugal force on the passengers the avoidance steering assistant can support the dve driver when pedestrians are recognized within the car zone the emergency stop assistant with tailback emergency brake function reacts in time before a traffic jam end and can prevent an imminent collision with speeds of up to 100 km an [Music] hour step by step and year by year we adding new functionality to our systems this highly automated driving is now for the first time at a point where the driver can get on with other things this means of course putting even more technology into the car in order to safely command all situations other manufacturers are of course researching and developing similar systems on a daily basis it is AAS to digitization to ever more complex Vehicles Audi BMW or Toyota and not forgetting Tesla they the field of autonomous driving and hope to have models on the market within a few years this is precisely what we want to test so we carjack the S-Class to the Frankfurt area one of Germany conations we want to find out what the S-Class can do how pleasant and comfortable is it for the driver how does the car behave on winding roads we get someone who knows all about it to explain it to us bhart viman is dimess press spokesman for autonomous vehicles and intelligent drive when we put this generation of the S-Class on the market in 2013 we introduced the distronic distance regulator which also included a steering assistant it was a distance regulator supported by radar allowing me to drive as fast as I like but not faster than the car in front thus automatically ensuring that I keep my distance at the same time as driver I got this steering support another new feature in the S-Class is that we incorporate data from the satnav which are very very precise into the driving task if the consumer doesn Mobility systems he probably won them that consumer should have confidence in the service the products and the companies then trust becomes a currency in the digital world I think this will help us all to introduce the right steps and do the right things to make the systems really digital and safe here we assistance and it better it to walk that and more in particular our algorithms keep on improving the sensory systems are getting better too so the system we possible at the moment this is made possible by faster and faster computers and processors that are more and more powerful programed machine intelligence is already monitoring and controlling our vehicles even today let short break to look a bit more closely once more the S-Class has a huge number of sensors Incorporated I try to compare it with a human body we need our eyes our ears to find out what us it these two cameras at the top of the wind screen which together produce a stereo image much like our two eyes so that we have threedimensional Vision but other cars and pedestrians are also recognized in interaction with the radar that of several radar sensors that here the advantage of radar is that it very fast it works at the speed of light we everything the speed of light with the radar ultrasound for the hearing so to speak all around the car and of course the camera for seeing and the technology will get even better in the future the keyword is leader that laser beams instead of radio waves liar is a system that works with laser beams an optical system in other words it is very exact and very fast it has a range of well over 100 m directional of course and simply provides a further sensory element which can register distances speeds and objects around the car very exactly Ford SE themselves as Pioneers in this field 2005 the first experimental self-drive Generation 2013 the second leadar generation 2016 Fort and Lexus experiment with the latest generation of leadar sensors with ranges of up to 200 M different scenes can be registered simultaneously weo an American company is also working on the technical development of autonomous cars continuing the initial tests of the Google street car in cooperation with with Fiat Chrysler longterm the focus is intended to be on service provision for example driverless taxis not necessarily with driver owned Vehicles who would have thought that we self-driving cars not just in 2040 or 50 in science fiction but in 2025 2026 if we combine DNA and digital technology then we storage and if we combine car with digital then we have a self drive car and this too is part of the digitization of Mobility at the Mercedes Factory the new S-Class is already driving itself off the assembly line as a pilot project to start with sooner or later maybe the cars will be driving themselves to the customer front door one thing is certain our cars will be fundamentally different in the future Mercedes have taken a look into the automotive Crystal Ball and created the concept F5 as a vision of the vehicle of the future communicative eco-friendly and self-driving this Mobility Vision will not be for sale though and another thing there are legal issues to be resolved for example who is liable if a driverless car causes an accident neither we nor the insurers are ruling out the insurability of automated systems in principle we assess the risks of course which is what insurers do anyway there discussions about this but we don any fundamental problem the first Trials of driverless cars in German inner cities are taking place in for example dorf and Berlin driverless cars will be negotiating traffic quite soon the dorf experiment is due to last 25 months and the test field is already under [Music] preparation the trials use highly accurate digital maps and reliable communication between the vehicle and Technical traffic Management in the USA permits for autonomous driving have been around for some time every major car manufacturer is using the land of boundless opportunity for trial drives one thing is clear driverless cars are coming we at Mercedes have test licenses on a variety of courses worldwide with the E-class we had the first series model to get a license for driverless testing in Nevada but we also have test licenses in California and in Germany close to our R&D locations and not least we large testing area close to here in Iman where we every possible scenario independent of road traffic we these technical features from Innovative Concepts on the way to the sustainable robot car if there are concerns about these Visionary technology they [Music] imagination we automated or autonomous vehicle very concretely it is of course the major challenge but also the ultimate driverless experience where Mobility is made accessible to customers in a completely new fashion we a few years via pilot application we already and will get going in a big way in the early 2020s mega cities are one of the major trends of our age more and more people are moving in more and more confined spaces sustainability here means guaranteeing Traffic Safety all the same software centered Motor Vehicles are developing more than ever into self-driving digital devices which can seriously improve road safety but how will this work and how safe and roadworthy is digitization really the crucial question is whether car makers and it companies can cooperate for example in data protection and the cyber security of driverless cars we have to think about the safety of the total system if we don being negligent if we don best thing that could happen would be that is a joke someone sends my car not to work but somewhere else when I should be at work but it could get nasty if I 180 and someone takes control of my car and aims it at a concrete pillar that would probably only happen once security is a core issue and one we have to concern ourselves with when the S-Class was in introduced nearly 50 years ago in 1972 all of this would have been inconceivable since then the mercedesbenz S-Class has been the leader in modern automobile technology and remains so to this day it has always brought Innovations to the marketplace which went on to become standard in other models too the next step for the future will be the networked car worldwide the automotive sector is one of the driving forces of the digital transformation at the latest since the internet giant Google brought out its driverless vehicle car manufacturers have picked up the gaunlet the connected car as an intermediate step towards the self-driving car is currently causing upheavals in the automotive sector we at Mercedes have the competences that these new players are bringing on to the market and as a result of the synergies between the vehicle expertise and the software competence we think we good position even today cars have numerous driver assistance systems but they can yet alert the drivers to a danger lurking round a bent for example car 2x makes more things possible though here a nice example the virtual warning triangle thanks to car 2x this can be seen much earlier than a physical triangle on the road through direct communication with other vehicles in the immediate vicinity safety relevant information can quickly be shared car2x already plays a big role for us even today last year we were the first manufacturer to integrate it into a production vehicle the thing about k2x is that the vehicle sees things that otherwise wouldn car2x is a further element towards making driving safer whether it breakdown or an accident the driver told about it before he can see it a further advantage of car2x lies in efficiency enhancement the Contin ous exchange of information between all Road users allows Intelligent Traffic Control leading both to fuel economies and time-saving an intelligent networked system can re-root vehicles in the case of a tail back or gridlock car2x communication is being tested and research projects both by the automotive sector and by independent research organizations this will allow the advantages to be tried out and improved on the basis of real life dat but how future proof and practical is connectivity in today really many people have the dream of sleeping or just sitting on the back seat when they go on a long drive we won it we driving in towns a vision that may help to avert the threats of total gridlock driving in cities is often often accompanied by jams stop and go or long stops at traffic lights all of which mean more stress for the driver but before we get to see fully automated driving in the major cities of our planet there still be occasions when people get driven in special limousines on special occasions the S-Class the classic among chauffeur driven Vehicles is one such eye-catcher people notice it we driver seat M TR has been a chauffeur for a good 30 years what he likes about the S-Class is the Innovative technology and the unconditional emphasis on passenger Comfort it offers all the things a passenger expects in the long version in particular plenty of leg room in the back seats and generally a comfortable ride and of course it makes an impression on the outside too Mich TR has driven high ranking politicians such as Henry Kissinger and Mikel gorbachov not to mention VIP actors and sports stars but his bread and butter in Frankford consists rather of prominent Bankers he doesn driving as an immediate threat to his line of business there are a few assistances in the cars already of course but really autonomous or even partly autonomous driving that future in the long term those occupations where the driver is associated directly with the car may be faced by a certain danger if the driver is replaced by a robot I don problem for our trade at the moment but in some sectors they probably ought to be thinking about what the future holds back to the testing ground here an experimental setup reflecting a daily situation in real life the end of a traffic queue a quite new feature in the S-Class is this emergency braking system it can recognize on the motorway when all the lanes are at a standstill maybe the driver Ed and he hasn warns him and performs an emergency stop this system makes a crucial difference to the prevention of rearend shunts especially where traffic is queuing Frank vanam Moon can explain this situation very well too tell me what will happen will we crash it is a soft crash Target crash breaking breaking and okay hey a little bit scary really but uh everything is okay it safe experience it very amazing technique and this too is part of the digitization of Mobility the crash test mercedesbenz are working on reconstructing accidents even more realistically if possible the aim is to prevent accidents or at least reduce their severity by deploying assistance systems in the age of intelligent assistance systems and from the perspective of autonomous driving passive safety that is to say mitigating the consequences of an accident for those in the car is a central task of vehicle development in just 5 years time it thought we cars on public roads especially in our big cities this is how an autonomous City car could look in 2013 as shown by the daimer study with the Smart Vision EQ 42 the self-driving car can be summoned by smartphone and is thus a potential rival for taxi companies and apps like uber it first diimler to dispense with paddles and steering wheel completely so how close are we really to autonomous driving 40 or 50 years ago a car was a piece of mechanical engineering the value creation came 100% from brakes clutch engine gearbox Etc and now the car is driving itself so we have the autonomous car so probably 70 or 60% of the value creation lies in software in other words the software is accounting for more and more of the value every business must be aware of this they have to adapt or die survival of the fittest as Charles Darwin said the best Will Survive and the others will go extinct so could the digitization of the automobile lead to a transfer of power from Human to computer no final answer can yet be given to this question but everyone in the business is clear about one thing when the first self-driving cars appear in our cities they will have to share the road space with conventional cars with no automated functions even so in the forges where digital ideas are being hammered out tomorrow it will take greater account of cooperation between all Road users and make even today comfortable and more efficient

Trapped in the Ice: A Polar Expedition | SLICE SCIENCE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCgpuWQy61c	SLICE Science	[Music] we meet Jorgen who has just caught a [Music] seal I don be important to our adventure and become our friend Kim for dog pu for seal Emanuel is initiated into this technique that uses a white screen for concealment so that Hunters can get close to the seals but for us it to come out in the open joggen points out the road to the school theerasak Community is waiting for us hello we come from France and we arrived in Greenland it exchange with the population of a sack and we are able to tell them a bit about who we are what we and then well we obviously have a lot to learn from them who would like to try that we all want to all of us they have accepted us it possible for us to access the Ice Flow along with their fishing and hunting territory there next morning the entire crew is ready for a first reconnaissance dive we have to sharpen up our reflexes both above and below water Our Lives depend on it so we a lot of divers the idea is just that we all go over everything concerning preparations for the under I dive which can be extremely dangerous if you get lost for example if the hole is here and you underwater you can be 3 m from the hole without seeing it you can get disoriented very quickly because there are no visual references under the ice and that Ice this yellow rope is our Lifeline which makes sure we find the way out it links the divers to the assistance on the surface on the ice flow as soon as visibility drops and whenever we are worried that poor visibility may occur it immediately the polar Knight only leaves us with a few brief moments of light so as a symbol of this overwintering we launch our dive program at night it a fin in the water and I Frozen the ice has made its way into everything into The Regulators the purges even the masks the thermos bottles with hot water have become our best tools for deicing the equipment in fact everything takes more time in the cold not only getting ready storing gear and everything around it it dive everything takes time in the cold and generally speaking when you plan to do something it takes nearly 10 times longer than it would in temperate climates given the level of salinity the water temperature can be lower than 0° evenus 1.8 and as opposed to Open Water Dives I won this hole this Lifeline is the only link that will keep me alive it is the passion for discovery that gives us the energy we need I have rarely made such extreme Dives okay let unknown [Music] [Music] there first nocturnal contact with the underwater Arctic [Music] [Music] World the underwater world seems asleep during the polar night the brand new Ice Flow has blocked icebergs as they drift slowly for us they are an ideal playground for conducting our mission and recording all the forms of life that they contain during our first dive this shrimp emerges from its ice cave to meet us [Music] [Music] the water is at its clearest during these months of winter meanwhile I float as weightless as an astronaut discovering this new blue and white planet [Music] it is intense but after a 1hour dive in this glacial water I can no longer feel my fingers the first sign of hypothermia it resurface the temperature of our hands and feet is sometimes close to 0° that was great up you come okay we got you beautiful I need the warmer it there hi supp I to the boat want some help with that my hands hurt they tingle it painful can glove all right but it alive I warm up I in okay see you later the boat up there massive storm which reminds us of the danger of this extreme territory the strong winds have broken up the ice which is still fragile dangerously dist stabilizing our boat our only Refuge here in the middle of nowhere [Music] a large hole has appeared to starboard and it has crushed the ice flow to Port we picked up the equipment lying around so uh if it gets worse we [Music] work it take a look yeah we made it [Music] since I got here basically in December there days it turned into an ice palace minus three something like that the metal conducts cold more than other materials so the ice gathers there and all these small spots those must be screws so I pulled out the big red sleeping bag that outside made for surviving the North Pole and it the ice usually melts a bit when I sleep my breath melts a little bit above me and in the morning there is less ice than when I went to bed but today it so cold this morning that there ice than yesterday the water tap has frozen and if we don drains will freeze for sure so we have to hurry it use the toilets you have to get a bucket to pee in and for water to cook I didn before seeing that it was frozen and then here inside the glasses are trapped in the ice it them anymore it more complicated but there are waffles there are waffles before starting our plans for Dives writing and reading it we spend just so that we can function every day we wanted to overwinter we overwintering this is what it we created a daily observation schedule for ourselves which is as comprehensive as possible even if Robin is not always happy to see me disappear under the ice we have to ask Papa do you want to go sledding on the iceberg we do it once okay you could start from right here no Gil don not dangerous we did it play time is over we have to dive again and again despite the cold that we will never get used to getting ready takes 2 hours an eternity the equipment also takes a beating the regulator doesn don there there air is it working today it iceberg some 15 met down a big Iceberg which could easily be 7 m high and go down at least 40 to 60 look at papa he come look can I have hot water in my mask okay yeah you on okay he put it on fast before it freezes let tight great thanks everything is so complicated so that when we dive we photograph and film everything I feel personally responsible for documenting this environment that is so unknown to provide Heidi with the observation she needs for her study of the Ice Flow I am her eyes searching for any trace of polar life eyes that are a struck every single time by the underwater landscape a place no one one has been to before I never get tired of these enormous icebergs this one must weigh about 200,000 tons time has carved multiple galleries in this giant they can crack and break off at any time but winter is the best time to get a closer look our senses alert we decide to explore more further deep inside the [Music] monster it speleology with an impenetrable ice ceiling over our heads it would be easy to get lost in this Labyrinth I hold the Rope tighter than ever this Lifeline is our only guide to finding the way back and

The Digital Revolution of Mobility: A New Era Begins | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-l6QJHKt4E	SLICE Science	[Music] in the coming 5 years we will see systems like this all over Europe in the future the digital intelligence of the track will be a new trademark I think looking back in 50 years maybe you would ask yourself why was it allowed to drive with a manual fact driving modern high-tech trucks evolves around the demands for energy efficient driving precision and road safety for drivers and others automated driving is no longer science fiction but is already used in many Industries such as Logistics and transport one manufacturer with Decades of experience is among others Volvo trucks in Sweden pioneering Innovations for trucks happen at two fronts one is on the road manufacturers are working on a number of Vehicles driving simultaneously as a group they call this way of driving platooning several Vehicles follow a leading vehicle while keeping the exact same speed and distance platooning contributes to more safety on the road and more convenient driving it it enables a smoother flow of traffic platooning trucks can save up to 10% fuel this virtual trailer coupling is possible by using radar cameras and control units which are communicating with each other other Innovations take place in confined areas such as yards Harbors or deep underground in mines here in Christina back in Sweden 1,000 M deep inside the mine beden trucks face difficult and demanding conditions such as confined space and darkness curves and uneven ground Here For the First Time autonomous driving truck tested in everyday operations underground based on a sensor system of radar and Laser the truck analyzes constantly its surrounding space thanks to automated speed gear shifting and smart logistic all waiting times and stops are minimized and the productivity has increased digitization plays a role in every kind of mobility and Logistics think about the autonomous driving car the autonomous driving truck we getting it very soon maybe sooner than a lot of people are expecting it so everything with if it is digitized and connected it can be automated there is an increased demand of transportation and mobility in the society driven by urbanization but also by new uh customer behaviors like for instance more online shopping this is actually going to be a paradig shift when it comes to Logistics the three technology trends that we talk a lot about here when it when it comes to automation connectivity and electrification generally trucks are operating along the full chain of logistics delivering Goods into the cities but naturally also bringing Goods straight from the point of production in Brazil the production of sugar cane is big business but about 4% of the seedlings for next year are crushed by manually driven trucks following the Harvester they also damage the soil when entering and leaving the field this means big losses Volvo trucks innovative prototype is an automated self- steering truck which keeps track with minimal deviation it digitally synchronizes the speed with the Harvester ensuring a high degree of precision the driver can accelerate or break manually or he can use speed control this increases the harvest output and the safety at work for the drivers back in the City operating a big Refuge truck in urban areas is challeng challenging narrow roads parking cars and Crossing pedestrians present high risks for Collision as part of a research project the Swedish Waste Disposal Company and Volvo trucks develop and test this prototype of an automated refu truck basically the heavy truck follows the refuge collector like a dog in walking pace when the truck approaches a parked car it will drive around this car if encountered by playing children it will stop automatically sensors monitor the environment constantly providing maximum safety big Advantage for local authorities only one refuge collector is needed Innovation never stops so how can manufacturers tap the full digital potential for future models in cooperation with Swedish energy agencies the manufacturer developed a con SE truck with hybrid Drive using a new aerodynamic concept we had a very tough Target uh to improve transport efficiency by 50% and we have not made all the final test yet but it seems very promising all that we have tested so far this concept truck runs on diesel when necessary and it recovers and restores electric energy when recuperating while breaking or driving down hill we actually try to optimize the truck so we use a combustion engine when needed we use use electrical engin when we can save fuel this way the fully loaded truck can drive up to 10 km in electric mode when on flat roads or in urban areas nearly noisess driving in electric mode uh first of all you cut emissions it uh be in on truck that is driven by Electric mode its connected Super Brain knows the country like the back of one constantly analyzing the topography ahead by using GPS and electronic road maps with digitalization we can offer new services like Zone management through G GPS positioning we can for an instance uh turn the vehicle into a low emission mode or zero emission mode in certain areas of the Cities first of all every business every company have to think about what is my strategy what is my future my digital Vision if I don know where to head if I have no vision for the Future No digital Vision uh I think you are in big trouble connectivity is actually br bringing the possibility to optimize uh both uh transport uh efficiency and Resources by actually making uh efficient traffic flows and also increase for instance the utilization of already existing infrastructure today urban areas and Road congestions are tough traffic challenges for drivers commuters and city planners more and more cities restrict numbers of vehicles in city centers for envir mental reasons gothenberg is one of the first cities worldwide which invests large sums into the electrification of buses here in Sweden electricity is operating fully electric buses along Route 55 in the crowded City Center electromobility starts with addressing the need to create sustainable cities reducing emission reducing noise and so forth then of course the bus needs to be able to transport people in a safe way the project electricity is a collaboration of 15 Partners from industry city planners and politics to solve this Balancing Act uh Urban transport has the most at the moment the most suitable uh driving patterns with low average speed less energy consumption frequent start and stop with then high level of energy recuperation and suitable uh ranges driving distances that will require less battery capacity without a doubt the first impression is of nearly complete silence and at Second Glance one realizes that there are no exhaust fumes at all the electric and the hybrid buses are charged at the an stops with renewable energy they have a 80% lower energy consumption than the diesel bus thanks to electromobility bus stops inside public buildings have become reality [Music] being able to take the B public transport and the bus indoors opens up for new ways of City Planning because we can bring public transport closer to people we can bring buses in areas where we haven before because now they are silent nothing still-standing truck only a moving truck is a good truck for the haulers their customers and for road safety digitization has become an important enabler of modern Mobility so with this connectivity uh technology we will be able to reduce the number of unplant stops we will be able to reduce uh service cost and it will also improve road safety with less uh trucks standing still on the road a look behind the scenes the Volvo Action Service Center in ganton Belgium like spiders in a web these experts have maintenance data of all connected trucks literally at their fingertips how does that work during a journey a truck driver has a technical problem after stopping he presses a button next to the steering wheel and seeks direct assistance the call will be redirected to one of the multilingual vol service centers also called uptime centers while speaking the operator already reads all relevant data from the connected truck also potential diagnostic trouble codes of the problem well digitalization for us um really means that we can gather the information we need and the data we need in a quicker way um we skip quite some steps uh let flow to make sure that the case handling time uh and to organize that repair that the driver needs or the truck needs is a lot faster than it used to go the operator directly books an appointment for the truck sending all diagnostic codes and providing spare part numbers to the workshop the driver gets a call from the operator who is telling him the locations and the time slot for this planned repair stop upon arrival at the workshop the driver is expected no time is wasted every minute of the road counts the mechanic is informed does specific Diagnostics and confirms the remote [Music] Diagnostics thanks to the advanced notification by the service center the software problem of the truck is fixed right away and the truck is back on the road again regardless of their careful training each driver drives slightly different when using gears and brakes so how can a truck avoid unnecessary service stops following a fixed rigid service plan Tru monitoring today means that we leverage data big data is the new gold for us in the past we needed all data to see what had happened to a vehicle today through digitization we can predict what will happen to that vehicle tomorrow Prov ided the truck owner has booked this service the system can inform the center digitally about potential malfunctions an analyst checks the case and runs remote Diagnostics he identifies an upcoming problem before it will occur this is called predictive maintenance and will become standard in the digital era today with the live stream of data we can really create here centrally actionable tasks for each single truck appoints and plan a dealership to that repair create the parts and the diagnostics for that specific vehicle instead of calling the truck in at fixed time intervals the truck is now asked to see a service center only when it receives all data from the center to arrange resources as spare parts and repair time so we clearly moved from a reactive approach to a proactive approach which is a very big difference this maximizes operation times of trucks saves resources and minimizes breakdowns on the road digitization means transformation of processes products and certain Services into the digital environment so that we can use it from our mobile phones for example thing about the car industry is becoming a Mobility industry because each one of these Technologies can of course bring a lot of value to mobility of goods and transport on its own but it they will radically transport transform Transportation trucks are long-term Investments naturally the design and look of a model are important for its sales figures conventionally the cabin design and all its support and Safety Systems is centered at the driver at work the general boost of computer performance enables the most complex digital simulations like here in the C cabin so how is digitization adding a new dimension to the design of connected trucks the big change that now is that the digitalization not just part of the process it into the to the product itself so we have another area type of design that we have to deal with interaction design uh immaterial design the designer minimize driver to maximize information when interacting with the truck in a safe way I think design is changing in the way that it it or perception of of a of a product it it with a product and that our designers are having to learn uh to deal with completely new design options lie ahead autonomous driving trucks don cabin to work in maybe aerodynamics won maybe they can be quite boxy today trucks typically operate for about 150,000 kilomet a year shifting gears at exactly the right moment is an art for professional drivers automated manual transmission Systems Support the driver when shifting gears in Split seconds this means reducing fuel consumption for up to 5% fuel efficiency is key for the profitable operation of trucks therefore new trucks are fitted with a cloudbased topographic recognition [Music] system before a truck even arrives at a hill base the system has already calculated the best kinetic driving for this hill and following drivers benefit from these calculations via cloud-based service steering a heavy freight truck requires sometimes hard work from the driver Dynamics steering systems enable nearly effortless and precise steering even when fully loaded driving very slowly is electronically supported which is essential when reversing irregular Road surfaces or strong side winds are automatically compensated we talked to a veteran expert of Automotive Safety about digital systems we say 90% of the accidents are caused by human error and the main cause of this is inattention now inattention could be that you are looking in in the wrong direction you else apart from driving and that we come in with support systems to help the driver to stay attentive when driving when in danger of colliding with another vehicle the size and weight of trucks multiplies massively the possible impact well looking at safety as a human human being you get tired now if you have digitization and you things it never gets tired the computer is running it is collecting data at all times by now all manufacturers have developed life-saving systems such as Collision warning and emergency brakes and by law this technology is compulsory now all over Europe for all trucks since 2015 well the emergency break is is a is a really a system where you can see that if if the driver is not paying attention to what is happening in front of him if the radar and Camera based system recognizes a danger ahead such as the end of a traffic jam a pre-warning for the driver is activated when the driver does not react a light flashes and a loud alarm alerts him finally the emergency brakes spring automatically into action by decoupling the gearbox and a full brake this happens in Split seconds it prevents an actual Collision even with speed differences of up to 70 kilm an [Music] hour for the sake of safety the industry crashes plenty of real trucks and Spares no effort to gain insights for future improvements but real crash tests of trucks cost a fortune and Destroy one or two trucks each time when you testing you only see what the final outcome is and you can film meantime when you you can zoom in you can zoom inside the the surfaces and see what causing the metal and the other surfaces to crack digitization would save enormous cost costs and resources it could save the lives of many crash trucks and speed up development with digital testing you can easier reach Paradigm shifts because you can step away from old designs much faster than what you dare to do with physical testing and this will of course improve the safety of the truck as a whole much faster a daily scene in any City pedestrians and cyclists with headsets on or use their smartphones while crossing a major Street totally unaware of the moving traffic around them well the 2017 Volvo safety report is showing that if you accidents are going down if you car that alarming thing is that when it comes to vulnerable Road users we accidents with them most accidents are based on human behavior visibility for examp example is key to Road Safety the manufacturer strives to give drivers digitized co- drivers smart mirrors cameras sensors radar and Laser these scan 360° of the truck surrounding in real time it time and a lot of sensors and some supercomputers to come up to the same level as an attentive human being an inattentive human human being any computer can do that today I strongly convinced that Mobility is one of the areas where digitizing and digitization is helping us quite a bit to be way more productive than before it looks like science fiction a construction site with little noise and absolutely no diesel fumes automation shows great strength when applied to constant tasks in unchanging environments these hybrid or fully electric load carriers do their job constantly at the same speed experts expect a reduction of up to 95% of emissions at construction sites in the future what lies ahead in the future generally the flow of goods will increase due to booming online shopping and changing consumer Behavior electrified traffic in urban areas will run the transport of goods waste and people smoothly and more safely saely with less noise and no emissions Smart IT solutions organize a possibly large number of goods together to minimize the number of vehicles automated systems will assist drivers with digitized support and Safety Systems in real time and 24/7 because the machine is not making any mistakes there are no misunderstandings anymore and of course the whole value chain the whole logistic chain is going to to be autonomous manufacturers and experts are confident Automation and realtime data will Propel the operation of high-tech trucks into a new dimension [Music]	Success
High-Tech Trucks: Safety & Innovation | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAV4Z6uFxv8	SLICE Science	[Music] high-tech trucks are in transit with file technology and more than 500 horsepower it is all about driving with the highest precision and Energy Efficiency the manufacturers constantly develop new safety features in order to decrease the number of accidents nevertheless trucks are the number one cause the accident outcomes are more disastrous for other traffic participants than for truck drivers due to the size and mass of a truck for every Deb truck driver there are nine fatally injured passengers their risk is more than four times as high and yet trucks are only involved in 177% of all fatal accidents high-tech trucks a horror scenario for every car driver at trucks that drive into the end of a traffic jam tiredness inattention or driving too close to other Road users are the most frequent causes only every 10th accident happens because of technical reasons while the number of truck companies has been increasing so has the accident frequency from 1995 to 2011 by around 25% it must be the aim of the manufacturers industry and Society to improve every year the producers try to minimize the danger of causing an accident with their trucks a process that cannot be compared to the development of a car as it takes more than 8 years trucks need to last longer due to the fact that they cover longer distances than cars up to 100 50,000 km a year cars on the other hand cover only about 14,000 trucks also have a number of assistance systems to be prepared for daily Traffic Safety is is becoming more and more in Focus now also for the users of the transports and they are requiring that trucks are driven in a safe manner so therefore we are seeing more and more safety features being put into trucks the industry pays a lot for safety for complex crash tests for example new trucks are still being manufactured when they are tested and crashed against a wall in high numbers looking at the Improvement of the new Volvo FH the Swedish producers go for over 20 different crash tests to check the outcome of an accident with the help of trucks and dummies [Music] [Music] the design Department of Volvo trucks the development takes more than 5 Years From the first virtual stroke to the finished model it takes several thousand hours and countless modifications until the new high-tech truck is finally finished a good appearance is essential for their designer but safety is most important it wouldn compromise a safety aspect because of a a sort of a a beauty aspect if you like the best design is the one that combines the two it looks good and it safe as soon as the head designer decides on a draft a model on a scale of 1 to 14 is created it is traditionally crafted out of Potter modern computer program helps the Constructor to transcribe visions and Innovations which is still not enough for the real production the clay model is the original guideline for the onetoone model of the new truck a good example of a meaningful cooperation of design and function are the rearview mirrors now attached with Slimmer straps furthermore the Big Frame around the mirror is not necessary anymore we have really optimized the uh the mirror glass area and then made sure that we have not added any unnecessary material around that kept it as Slim as possible mounted it on these very slim arms and um that has at the same time as it has improved the the uh the safety and the visibility has given them a very um special look uh that makes them very unique and that really complements the design of the rest of the truck the headlights are undergoing a change in design as well by adding new features to improve safety the idea is to achieve Dynamic main headlights for even better Vision okay with the new headlamps we have actually Incorporated a very important safety feature in here called the the uh the daytime running light which is an LED lamp here that by law has to be on at all times additionally there are special bending lights to improve Vision even at night when driving in a curve the beam is aimed in the driving direction and not straight ahead as in the past on average drivers spend 5 days per week in their cabin while on longdistance Journeys this is the reason why the cabin needs to be perfect both for driving and relaxing for every driver whether short or tall big or thin the new cabin is 1 cubic M bigger and has 300 L of extra storage this means more Comfort but also more living space for the driver it through design we have really tried to emphasize that as much as possible so up here in the roof you see that it nice flowing simple surfaces the um sun roof here which is actually a safety hatch uh because we now glue the windscreen in order to be able to get out in case you have an accident you can a safety hatch uh but it also lets in natural light and and creates this feeling of space in here The View through the roof can look like this but while driving should only be enjoyed by a fellow passenger and not the drivers themselves the developers are very proud of the new air condition in the driver name of the new park cooling system which guarantees a restorative sleep we have to have good climates you really sleep the whole night and this is an integrated uh air condition so it works the whole night with electrical fans the compressor the the compressor to the air conditioning system is also electrified so you have the the right climate the whole night without having the engine idling before a high-tech truck like this is produced in sirious the people in charge test the stability of the cabin in detail what happens in case of an accident and how does the cabin perform after a crash everything documented right down to the Last Detail [Music] [Applause] [Music] after various simulations the impact on the stability of the truck after a crash is tested with a collision from a height of 3 m the goal is to find the best safety conditions for the driver [Music] it takes about 5 days to turn a roll of Steel into a truck the metal plates are made from very robust steel the so-called Boren steel they are pressed in five steps so the pre-fabricated parts can be connected in the best way the optimized consistency is also a result of the new laser welding method in which two flat plates can be matched before forming the obvious reduction of the depth of deformation especially improves the safety of the cabin the vibration Test shows how resilient the shafts really are they are shaken 6 to 8 weeks 24/7 this correlates to an actual driven distance of more than 1 million km the new FH hasn component from the predecessor 2,970 screws are needed throughout the manufacturing process durability and reliability are most important for the driver and the trucking company breakdowns are dangerous and can end up being very expensive the persistence tests on this special Road are also about testing the resilience limits of the truck in everyday life the check correlates to a lifespan of 10 years and 1,250,000 driven kilom the trucks are tested forcefully they drive through puddles and water gutters over Hills with a climb of 10 to [Applause] [Music] 20% and over massive obstacles like potholes and cobblestones we do it over over millions of kilometers with with test trucks you know to make sure that the systems are working as they should be doing and and not doing things they shouldn that keep away from things that shouldn happen in practice the accident researchers also test how trucks survive several typical accidents for example how dummies react to a lateral rollover we most uh important accidents first the most common accidents and and the rollover stand stand for 50% of of the truck drivers are killed in rollover accident the dummy sitting in the truck has got more than 50 sensors that are carefully evaluated after the [Music] crash the new and so far unique independent wheel suspension improves the driving conditions the trucks drive over potholes and cobblestones without the driver noticing anything the front wheels accept any little bump straight routs can really be driven in a straight way due to the new technology the independent suspension brings us to a new level of handling where you get a very good stable feeling from the truck it even on narrow roads and and we will help and support the driver in order to prove that this is no empty promise ESP spectacular advertisement is being produced a professional stuntwoman the American slack line world record holder Faith Dicky slack lines between two trucks that are connected with a rope I this before um I lines and I winds but I forward before the producers want to demonstrate the good driving conditions and the perfect handl of the new truck which succeeds in the end the producers from Hollywood think that the stunt would not have been possible without the new independent wheel suspension water a success because of the perfect driving conditions both trucks keep the same distance between each other while the stunt takes place Dynamic steering the new steering system promises an even easier way of handling the truck the system contains electric motors in order to relief the driver while steering he thus needs less muscular strength to steer the truck Dynamic steering guarantees directional stability and Precision in any driving situation it is based on an electrically controlled motor which is regulated approximately 2,000 times per second to provide very precise steering Behavior there are three features of Volvo dnamic steering that is benefit icial for the driver the first one is the low steering wheel Force required at low speed the second one is the disturbance reaction and the third one is the steering wheel returnability when [Music] reversing the driver has to work far more in a standard truck without the dynamic steering than in a truck that has the system implemented thanks to the Dynamics steering system the truck driver muscular effort is reduced by [Music] 20% also when I reverse it requires very little effort to steer the vehicle I can let the steering wheel slide back in my hands however the new Dynamic steering system is not only a relief on flat roads for the drivers imagine that we are in a Timber truck in the forest since the road is very uneven it the disturbance reaction Volvo Dynamic steering will keep the front wheels straight if the driver doesn torque to the steering wheel software is controlling the electric motor about 2,000 times per second so it external disturbances the driver is more relaxed the stress on his neck and shoulders decreases and fewer accidents occur a hamster is used to demonstrate how easy it is to steer the truck with a new steering system Charlie who only weighs 175 G is supposed to steer the truck out of the Spanish Quarry oh and don forget this very important we hamster can really steer the truck so it think it would be possible but it I assure you it really is possible he St the [Music] truck the professional stunt drop driver guides the hamster through the wheel just with the help of a carrot gradually the truck is steered from the bottom of the Quarry over the Stony Hills up to its peak [Music] [Music] the people responsible for this are filled with enthusiasm and yet this is not the end the Suites were also able to convince action star jeanclaude vanam the trucks will be placed closely together and you will be standing on the side mirrors one foot on each mirror right the tracks will move backwards after a while they will slowly separate and you will perform one of your famous splits with one foot on each side mirror on each side mirror of each truck yes and they they have plenty of time to perform the split yeah but with us again I mean if they keep on opening up I can fall down yes to the ground so they have but after a while they will stop opening up and they will keep the distance at first the Hollywood star is skeptical and wants to form his own opinion about the alleged straight on driving qualities of the trucks in the end he is convinced I had my ups and downs my fair share of bumpy roads and heavy winds that today now I stand here before you what you see it Perfection a pair of legs engineered to defy the laws of physics and a mindset to master the most epic of splits due to the new steering technology the drivers of both trucks can match their distance very precisely and keep the same speed all while driving backwards [Music] in the opinion of the people in charge jeanclaude fand Dam the driver the stun success but it would not have been possible without the Volvo Dynamic steering in the first place despite every progress in technology more than a third of all truck accidents are rearend collisions the consequ quences of these Unbreak collisions are shown by the crash test performed by the adac the swedes put a lot of extra electronic safety components in the new truck to prevent accidents and to protect the lives of the truck drivers and other Road users more effectively one of the most important technological assistance is the so-called emergency brake assistant via camera and radar the system warns about a Poss possible crash and breaks independently development Engineers carefully test the new system in order to make it work in a real life [Music] situation in a collision with a car in a traffic jam it is of course the car which takes the brunt of it because the truck runs a lower risk with its mass the system should help if the driver isn truck accidents are caused by human failure due to distraction or excessive speed we want to get the attention of the driver back on what the driver should be doing but if the driver fails in seeing the situation the truck will then automatically put on the brakes and do an emergency braking so stops before hitting the object in front of him the system records cars and trucks regardless of whether they are stationary or driving and prevents crashes with speed differences of up to 70 km an hour if the system sees a vehicle the emergency program will be activated immediately very happy because it it showed that the system works exactly as it should do the next step has already been taken how is it possible to maneuver a truck if for instance the driver overlooks stationary traffic as a consequence the braking distance is insufficient despite the emergency breake assist and hectic steering makes things worse if necessary the new evasive maneuver assist system EMA for short takes over the assistance function recognizes whether an activated emergency stop will be sufficient if a Collision cannot be prevented activated by a steering impulse to the left or the right the EMA directs the truck to the next free traffic lane independently and safely even at maximum [Music] speed the technology can all by itself because some businessmen are reserved due to the price it comes with and are therefore not willing to pay this additional price experts in the field of accidents estimate that with the help of this system up to 2,500 lives could be safed in Europe 350 hands work on the cabin of the new FH until it is completely mounted the centerpiece of The New Colossus is the engine which fulfills the strict Euro 6 norm and produces clean exhaust fumes in comparison to its predecessor it runs more smoothly thanks to many electronic components however the different trial measures are much more complex the suits make the most expensive tests worldwide [Music] in this case the scientists want to know the consequences of a frontal crash of two trucks depending on the equipment the Giants weigh between 7,500 and 12,500 kg these test results must be integrated in traffic as quickly as possible in order to make it safer a lot of accidents happen because the truck drivers get tired or lose their concentration the lane keeping support turns on at 60 km an hour and controls to position in the lane if the truck touches the lines on the road the driver will get an alarm signal the system has identified that I without using the indicator light and this is when I get this acoustic warning as a hint that I left the traffic lane without using the indicator light if I use the indicator light and drive over the lane again I voluntarily and I won signal in the EU the lane keeping support has been required in all new trucks that weigh more than 3.5 tons since the 1st of November 2015 not required but certainly reasonable is this adaptive cruise control it adapts the speed and distance to the vehicle driving Ahad and keeps a safe distance ad cruise control system here you can see that the adaptive cruise control system spot truck driving in front of us and automatically adapts to its Pace in the traffic lane distance included this means I have a chosen pace of 80 km per hour the truck in front of me drives at 50 at the moment and accelerates now and I keep the same Pace as this vehicle with a safe pre-chosen distance if another slow vehicle drives in front of the truck the truck will automatically break and adapt its speed and distance to the vehicle in front of it the high light the latest developments of these adaptive cruise control systems automatically keep a safe distance to the vehicle in front throughout all Paces which in this case also involves stopping and driving off again besides relieving the driver the development of these electronic assistance systems which was initially intended for cars only also comes with a higher safety standard back to the production before the truck is supplied to the customer all new systems are going to be tested numerous times for example a warning system that monitors the truck driver tiredness the truck informs its drivers when they should take a break and controls the driving behavior if it seems as if drivers are getting tired they will be informed by a warning signal on the display and are urged to pause and when you get tired then you tend to sway a little and then you will kind of wake up and maneuver very hard the system will then detect that and it will then after a couple of these things it will then say warn you and come up with a light and say time for a break time for a cup of coffee since 2014 the regulation of driving Dynamics called ESP has been required it helps when the truck starts sking out of control and is on the verge of overturning the electronic stability program is provided with three sensors a central unit calculates all current measurements that it receives if they do not fit each other the brakes on one or more wheels will be activated at the same time the power of the engine is automatically reduced slippery roads during winter can turn out to be a challenge for trucks with a heavy load even very skilled drivers can get in danger when the trailer swings off the so-called Jack knifing phenomenon is very dangerous for the driver and the oncoming [Music] traffic Yan sunbar often drives heavy loaded trucks on narrow streets in the woods he learned about the problem the hard way it can happen from time to time and gives you a huge shock you feel like being on a roller coaster and you lost control Jack knifing is a very dangerous situation the consequences can be loss of control over the vehicle or shearing out of line injuries damaged vehicles or even deadly accidents the problem is that the situation is very hard to control but what exactly is the jack knifing phenomenon Jack knif Jack knifing happens between truck and trailer it is an evil phenomenon where the trailer is pushed forwards while breaking and ends next to the truck in order to avoid any kind of risk Volvo trucks developed a new braking system the so-called stretch break stretch bre this system will break the trailer automatically if it is activated by the driver when the driver throttles the system the trailer will be slowed down automatically so that the truck and the trailer stay straight in line and there is no chance of Jack knifing thanks to the new brake system the trailer will remain in sync with the truck even in tricky situations and that makes driving for truckers much more relaxed stretch break is extremely important for us because it is a a problem that drivers have where the draw bar is pushing going downhill and uh with this we can now help them to control it in in a very good way stretch break is something that will give uh the driver a feeling of more security really that that he he knows what he can control the vehicle and in a very good way 50% of the truck drivers still don accidents are declining since the beginning of the lives could be saved if more drivers would belt up I things is that we still can truck drivers to understand that they should be wearing their seat belt if they were wearing their seat belt a truck is probably one of the safest working places to be in but you need to have your seat belt on this is also shown by a decra crash test already at a speed of 30 km an hour test dummies not wearing a seat belt can be catapulted through the front windshield and even if they survive they would be overrun by the following traffic all test dummies at Volvo wear seat belts otherwise the complex technology would be useless with or without a seat belt the blind spot remains a serious danger despite an improved miror side in the blind spot cars bicyclists or pedestrians can easily be overseen often with disastrous consequences known by every truck driver the lane change assistant watches the area the truck is going to drive into as soon as the driver indicates if a car or a cyclist happens to be within this area the system gives the driver an acoustic and a visual warning signal when the driver wants to turn right and there is a vehicle in the blind spot on the right side the driver gets an acoustic and visual warning signal this system could prevent nearly every 10th accident it really see if you have cars or or other traffic on your close side and especially towards the area of the front wheel front right wheel there there that it it that fires up sideways looks at that area and sees if there is a car or or an object there it will then trigger an alarm inside the truck to help and support the driver when it comes to safety these experts are operating day at night the staff of accident research they analyze accidents and draw conclusions for design and further development since 1969 the researchers have analyzed more than 1500 accidents and installed a large database that is often used to improve safety it when parking or something like that they sticking out like that now looking at that we then can go into the computer on the truck you know and look at data there and see if we can understand further what actually has happened if possible the researchers also work with truck drivers who survived a serious accident enva yanson donated blood before going to work 6 months ago with disastrous consequences I felt really bad then I fainted and my truck crashed into a bridge Pier the cab was separated from the chassis and was catapulted onto the other side of the road then a car drove into the cab I found myself with a car tire in my face m i mean yanson talks about everything that happened in detail the experts evaluated to eventually develop further assistance systems we heard about this accident and and immediately we then send one of our accident research teams down there the perfect thing to here now is is that we could also ask the driver we could ask ask in exactly what happened and he could explain and tell us and this is an invaluable input to to our research and and future products Johanson was in rehab for 6 months after the accident and had to learn how to walk again and how to move his arms nevertheless a few months later the father of two children was behind the wheel again he felt safe after the positive outcome and doesn want to stop driving trucks I think a KN SC the crash caused my cervical to be fractured meaning a broken neck later on my doctor told me that normally only 40% of the people who have this kind of injury survive such an accident I think of it every day and I am endlessly thankful that I still alive in order to avoid accidents the hall contractors and drivers regularly test the new trucks in detail the trucks are available for the guests in all varieties including a driving instructor to explain all the new features the new trucks have so many new safety system and they have many many new components in the truck so some of them is skeptic in the beginning guests come from all parts of Europe to gothenberg to test the new trucks a few are skeptical at first due to the many assistance systems the first reaction is wow so many new things but it just take some laps here a few laps and then you recognize the the system after a while they love just a new track efficiency safety Automation and networking changed the mobility in all branches of the industry this can also clearly be seen in the field of logistics where the growing parcel Market demands new Solutions along the entire supply chain to meet the increasing demand or increasing pressure due to Rising costs digitalization and intelligent ly planed tours make new and highly individual delivery Concepts possible the intense Network and automation of systems and functions can considerably promote the efficiency and safety of processes at company depos and reloading hubs in the past collisions often led to expensive damage to vehicles or even a breakdown and therefore needlessly prolonged the loading and unloading procedure starting point for this is a concept that was already introduced in 2014 which made it possible to maneuver a long truck by tablet nowadays the person who operates the tablet just has to trigger or maintain the automatic steering [Music] process the truck and the depot are connected to the autonomous steering function safe range [Music] stationary cameras capture the truck in question which has only been marked with a Target on its rear end sudden obstructions will be recognized by the system whereupon unnecessary accidents will be avoided a computer that is installed at the Depo calculates and transmits the data via wireless land to the onboard unit in the truck at this point the vehicle control system takes over and leads the truck accurately and safely to the ramp the engineers test the wind resistance of The New Colossus in this futuristic Hall it is relevant for safety that the truck really is aerodynamically sound the wind tunnel is situated in Canada due to the large fan more wind can easily be produced and in standard facilities the the base of low or improved aerodynamics is to have uh flat surfaces no gaps and so on in in the in the surface but it optimal from a design perspective so designers would like to have something and uh from an aerodynamic perspective they would like to have something else so it those two areas the researchers in Sweden use another wind tunnel in order to simulate extreme climate situations on European roads wind speeds of up to 90 km an hour as well as heat of up to 55° C the experts arrange for about 50 tests for the development of the new Volvo FH alone in all a testing period of more than 2 years we are doing this kind of test to avoid any risk for for causing accidents out on the the field or for our customers we have this rig where we can um simulate extreme conditions the the most extreme conditions you you could find out on the fields out up in the hills or whatever conditions you have you can simulate that here in this test chamber the truck has to run through extreme situations in reality as well on bumpy roads in Queensland South Australia Down Under the researchers check on the driving behavior and maneuverability at extreme temperatures of more than 40° C and on miserable road [Music] conditions in this area there are 40° C as well but minus 40° C on the winter testing area in kiruna North Sweden the drivers used to test Vehicles as if they were their own trucks they sleep in the cabin and check if the truck starts up straight away after a freezing night every truck runs 20,000 km minimum under these freezing conditions if we are talking about summer Expeditions we Hills and tring to various conditions with different uh moisture different Heating and so on and trying to to press the vehicles to find if there is any errors the producers of this video could not afford to make any mistakes hello my name is Claus nilon president of Volvo trucks I to make a YouTube hit you need a hook at the beginning of the film and here it is this is is a hook from the new Volvo fmx made of cast iron and it holds up to 32 tons that don worry in fact you don about anything the new Volvo fmx is the most robust truck we than once did Neilon ask himself what he was getting himself into just to prove to the world how loadable the towing device of this construction side truck really is it with his life that was okay survived that it was good that was good yeah no problem the wind and the cold it was nice no other truck producer has done anything similar so far noise can be a potential cause for accidents as well furthermore it can make people sick in this sound cabin all noises are recorded with super sensitive mic microphones the researchers want to know how noisy trucks are for example for residents that live next to busy streets they also decode the noises coming from the truck itself that can be heard in the cabin and which could distract the driver while cruising focus on the noise inside is to reduce the noise level for the driver um so he can be focused on driving permanent and overloading noise is pure stress and stress causes accidents with the support of thick protective insulation aerodynamic design and new Mufflers noises can be reduced fatal injuries are not uncommon when it comes to rear end collisions partly caused by inadequate underride guards in the event of an impact with a truck the passenger of this car wouldn stand a chance to survive he would be impa the underride guard systems must get more solid only this way can the car passengers be better protected if a frontal crash where a car happens the underride guard of the truck will have to minimize the consequences of the accident as much as possible the car and the truck are not meeting each other fully and as you see here the car is slightly outside the truck which means that 25% of the car does not hit the truck and and this is a normal unfortunately normal situation where you have a frontal Collision 14 high-speed cameras are used while an accident test takes place even here where elaborate crashes are caused regularly everyone is still on the edge n yeah I think you always a little nervous here when when when you do some some true testing like this and hope that everything expect to do in this test the truck drives with 35 km an hour the car with 55 afterwards a lot of work is still left for the scientists to analyze the underride guard in the front primarily serves the purpose of saving the car driver in case of a collision with a truck in comparison to the Old Guard the new one distorts itself twice as much and works like an additional nose the chances are are great the driver will definitely survive this it it here that the the whole engine compartment is been pushed together here and you would think that it pushed inside the car itself but if you look inside here you will see that yes it has been pushed a little in here there might be some injuries to to the legs of the driver but but apart from that you you fantastic that that you can actually survive a crash at this speed the Swedish scientists are currently working on systems to prevent frontal crashes of cars and trucks here it a car comes towards him how do test persons react to the truck warning signals there a haptic and a visual one a so-called heads up [Music] system additionally there is a warning signal if the driver doesn at first the truck will break a little and in case of an emergency it will break fully until the truck comes to a stand still 32 test persons passed a simulation test after the analysis another testing area is used and only after that it is tested on the streets when you very safe place and even if you have a collision with a car you know as as a truck driver it doesn damage you in that way more more than psychologically therefore it important for us to to make sure that we take care of the car drivers because they are the ones that really gets the most hurt in in an accident with with a larger vehicle the Innovative trucks consumption is lower too the Volvo can be equipped with cruise control which can retrieve basic information topographically and through doing so save diesel fuel while driving the so-called IC System saves up to 5% the ic2 is is a a very smart system to save fuel where the truck itself looks at the road and the topy of of the road where it then record the road it will then also send this to a cloud so when the next truck comes along that has this system they can download it from the cloud and then this truck will know exactly how to climb the hill in the most fuel efficient way almost exactly one year after its introduction on the market the new Volvo FH model was voted International Truck of the Year 2014 by Leading utility vehicle journalist it has therefore been the third time that the Volvo FH was the International Truck of the Year the model was already awarded with this title in 1994 and 2000 class Neilon accepted the award during the festivities of the com transfair in Moscow these days you can Motorsport without high-tech via long-distance control innumerable data are checked by the technicians an important part of race tactics one example perfect timing for a pit stop technology like this is part of the new truck to Workshops can check the state of the vehicle via long-distance control with a telematic Gateway wastage or situations are checked and the error codes are picked out via the GSM net the shop can control component parts continuously which get guarantees ideal maintenance intervals today when we service a truck we estimate a planned uh driving conditions but then the customer may use it more and drive in the more heavy conditions now we can actually read out the real usage from the truck so we can service the truck when it necessary modern Mobility minimizes breakdowns provides higher reliability and lowers the administrative expenses of the carrier and if a truck is driven any other way than planned maintenance intervals can be changed appropriately brake linings for example a braided parts are changed in time so they don long distances and this we see a great opportunity in the future today we have a few parameters but in the future that will become more and more so more or less everything that you can do today in the workshop you can do it remotely the purpose of this is to give more up time to our customer from Volvo trucks point of view the mechanic is always on the road with the truck in case problems occur [Music] Volvo engages itself in another special vehicle Network 2 every participant follows the head vehicle automatically after docking via camera and radar trucks and cars are controlled exchange of data happens via radio the network imitates the leader so to speak speeds up hits the brakes and therefore steers in the same way here four cars are following the truck with a distance of only 6 M at a speed of 85 kmet an hour during a successful test I think what we will be seeing in the future is that we will be getting smarter Vehicles we will be using more of of the telematics vehicles will start to talk to each other they talk to the infrastructure they will get information if one truck has passed Road and it will itself identify that and and send that data to the next truck that coming along not only accident researchers but designers too are constantly thinking about what the track of the future should look like generally speaking appearance is important but the safety of the driver always has [Music] priority safety uh of course is to um it in in the future I think it will be less and less acceptance of of uh of uh dangerous trucks on the road as as it gets more congested visibility for the driver is of course the critical part to make sure that the driver has a good overview of the road high-tech will also help to make the growing traffic safer in the future but man the number one safety risk Remains the responsibility still lies with the driver [Music]	Success
The Future of Mobility: A Revolution in Travel | SLICE SCIENCE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JKiKqCUPDM	SLICE Science	[Music] intelligent comfortable and autonomous that transport of tomorrow to be but is it really the automobile that will drive us into the future the vision of a new means of Transport seems promising the hyper a train that could be able to travel faster than sound some people think it a crazy idea but researchers and entrepreneurs from all over the world are working on making the hyperloop a [Music] reality should we stay faithful to Old concepts of Mobility or accept an uncertain future Los Angeles the City of Dreams is the birthplace of a vision that could revolutionize our travel speed the hyperloop a train that floats through a vacuum tube the idea came from billionaire Elon Musk he got rich from internet businesses and primarily produces electric cars and Rockets for personal space travel he doesn called the hyperloop himself so he organizing a competition for students from all over the [Music] world so so what what this is really intended to do is to encourage uh innovation in in transport technology uh to get people excited about new forms of Transport um things that may be completely different from what we we see today but to but to really just get people to innovate and think about uh doing things in in in a way that not not just a repeat of the past uh but to explore the boundaries of physics I think it something that inspires the world and uh and and results in in real Transportation technologies that uh help people again congrats to everyone um I at at what uh the student teams have done uh really just blown my mind and um uh May the best team win there is also a team of people there from Munich the students are absolutely determined to be highly involved in the mobility of the future they over the world in the competition which one of them will build the best hyperloop prototype we around a year now and we brought it here so of course we compete against the other teams and to see how our design measures up alongside the others over 400 student teams have supplied a concept the 27 best teams were invited to build their prototypes and are competing against each other for the first time in Los Angeles one team traveled from Tokyo we were thinking that it is time to reinvent our transportation system um currently we have car boat planes for more than 100 or 200 years so we want to have a next uh Innovation to bring people to have high speed Transportation all around the world the members of the youngest team are still at school the 16-year-olds from Texas developed their vehicle together with their teacher I am 100% sure that this is going to work and that in the future we will be using the hyperloop for transportation Dutch students from the Technical University of Del are the second team of Europeans to have made it to Los Angeles all the others from Europe were eliminated at an earlier stage it is still hard to imagine that the transport of the future could be borne out of these creative workshops I believe that the hyperloop concept will become a reality I think it would be great if we could travel that quickly and bring parts of the world much closer together forecasts predict that transport in general will grow more and more people are covering longer and longer distances they and traveling across the entire Globe the current infrastructure is not designed for a society that is continuously on the move [Music] it Michael shreen people into consideration the actual State of Affairs or our ever diminishing resources mention people expect to be able to be mobile at all times which means being able to use transport at any time they expect the infrastructure to be available and for us to have the energy for it that creates a certain attitude in people and problems arise when things are no longer available and in the future we will have to live with limited resources owning one important to young people as it once was but thanks to greater prosperity and population growth the number of cars is continually Rising around the world the result roads are under strain and there is more and more construction work and [Music] congestion statistically speaking a car is stationary for 23 hours a day that means it is dead Capital that I could invest better somewhere else so car sharing and public transport are better Alternatives there are different concepts but in the end it depends on whether people the drivers go along with these Concepts one of these such Concepts could be the hyperloop the idea is not new the basic principle of the hyperloop is quite old even it is based on a transport system that wasn important documents the pneumatic mail tube in New York enormous letter shoots connected entire districts with each other they also sent letters within one building from floor to [Music] floor they were sent in containers through a pipe and transported at up to 40 kmph by the air pressure it place today the canister fits so precisely in the pipe that it slides without any air escaping air is sucked out of the pipe in front of the canister creating a suction that drives it an idea that the hyperloop picks up on it also floats through a tube out of which almost all of the air has been pumped the capsule hardly decelerates at all in this partial vacuum only a very small amount of air stay in the pipe just like an airplane the passengers travel in a pressurized cabin that balances out the low air pressure otherwise they wouldn breathe the low level of air resistance makes the hyper Loop very fast at 12200 kmph it could connect Paris and Berlin in around an hour enough for Theory Durk albor wants to prove that it can also function in practice we have the chance to develop a means of Transport the way it should be done in 2017 of course we need to be able to use various pieces of Technology when I consider just how much time I spend in traffic and in our car on the train on planes I think just how many better options there are several years ago albourne established a company in Los Angeles it is one of several startups working on implementing the hyperloop yet at this Stage IT remains little more than an idea investors are needed potential investors get an introduction to operating the hyperloop using abstract models above all it is a foundation course in magnetism this entire block the power of magnets plays a significant role for two decisive elements of the hyperloop the capsule is able to float with the help of magnets and it can be driven they attached to the underside of the hyperloop capsule when these magnets move across the bottom of the tube they create a further magnetic field there both magnetic fields consist of a South and North Pole the two South Poles meet each other since equal poles repel each other the capsule floats a kind of aluminium fin allows for the movement it runs along a track made of magnetic coils these coils can be activated with electricity they can also create a magnetic field in the aluminium fin the magnets in the track repel the capsule forwards so the capsule moves forwards it technology that leaves many questions open in Al borne the majority is more intelligent than the individual there are headquarters here but the staff members are spread across every continent they internet platform we gathered a small team together and said anyone who wants to be a part of and is ready to give at least 10 hours per week in exchange for a share in the company in the form of company stock options or better said shares or share options should get in touch then we had around 200 applications out of those we selected just 100 engineers and work with them on a feasibility report the students from Munich have found a temporary Workshop in Los Angeles where they can put together their capsule after trans exporting it to the USA they still need to qualify for the run through the test pipe whether or not the capsule will be allowed into the tube depends on how welldeveloped their system [Music] [Music] is Things become clear during the construction crucial parts are missing they were taken at customs and without the these parts the chance to access the pipe is as good as zero but the team have another week left working on the hyperloop is a hobby for the students it isn study time there either only the cost of the Prototype is covered by sponsors such as Airbus for the students it is above all an investment in the future in the Great dream of co-creating the transport of Tomorrow there have always been Concepts to speed up travel we dream of making a quick trip to Australia one evening for dinner and coming back again we dream of being able to change places quickly to be able to shrink the world down so to speak that just a dream until now the inventor Eli Beach is was already dreaming of this in 1867 he wants to build an underground commuter car in New York that Glides through a tube due to air pressure but the city only allowed a letter shoot system for packages secretly Eli Beach advises his team to continue going ahead with building the train for people so that he can prove that the system works but the city still denies it and puts its bets on the system that took off not only Underground ground but also above ground the railway the train has been the most important means of Transport in the West for the past Century but it is complex the track bed rail signaling and control systems as well as stations all need to be built that is only worthwhile over the long term nowadays the structure of cities is so often oriented around railway lines they this infrastructure cannot simply be written [Music] off Mobility is not something that is just handed to us people have had to work hard for it and it our enjoyment it has been one of the most liberating things for humankind to be able to choose where to move to it was so different in the past when people were more or less trapped in their localities until this Liberation came it also has something to do with bringing great pleasure from traveling independently until the beginning of the 19th century the horse was the fastest means of Transport but animals need regular breaks and food if you don feel like waiting around you need to change horses around every 20 km [Music] so in the Roman era post offices start to emerge along well-traveled paths keeping stalls with rest horses at the ready nowadays 20 km is a normal distance between small towns because they were originally refueling in service stations from earlier [Music] Generations a horse is not exactly a cheap means of trans sport this animal needs around six tons of food each year growing their food requires land and labor oats are precious goods and soon they will be hard to afford as the Tora volcano explodes on the Indonesian island of SWA in 1815 t many particles of sulfur are hurled into the atmosphere they combine with water and the rest like a veil over the entire Globe rays of sun can hardly penetrate it [Music]	Success

Italian government began building an ambitious feat of engineering to stop the devastating high tides and save the city a massive surge barrier with 78 floating gates to close off the Lagoon when flooding occurs let problem of preservation of the city Monumental Heritage thanks to exchanges with the environmentalist and to the Improvement of the Technologies we have created the most important and probably the greatest environmental initiative in the world can see if it works we wait until it finished Venice is sinking due to a two-fold mix of natural and man-made problems climate change has caused the Adriatic to rise but Venice also suffers from shifting PL tectonics meaning the ground underneath the city is sinking this problem is made worse by by The Reckless pumping of ground water for use in petrochemical Plants [Music] nearby we estimate that the sea level has risen by 12 to 13 cm so the sum of rising sea levels and the sinking soil totals about 25 cm so the city of Venice over the course of the last century has sunk approximately 25 cm with respect to the average sea in 1966 flood levels in the city reached a record 1.94 M roughly 6 ft causing immense damage to the city building and giving birth to the save Venice movement recognizing the need for a permanent solution City authorities hatched a plan for the separation of the Lagoon from the sea at high tide the project was baptized MOS an acronym that stands for Modo electromechanic experiment or experimental electromechanic module in 1966 Venice flooded dramatically it was the worst flood ever recorded and lasted longer than ever before and so the Italian government decided that Venice had become a national problem and that the city had to be saved from the high Waters so from that moment onwards a series of ideas emerged and then projects were launched that are now being concluded after many years to create a system that stops the rising Waters outside the Venetian Lagoon protecting the city from flooding the MOs project was all the more ambitious because of the geography of Venice the Venetian Lagoon was formed about 6,000 years ago as the Coastal plane shifted following the last ice age today it stretches 550 Square km from the river Sila in the North to the Brenda in the South the city of Venice and the smaller islands around it all together only account for 8% of the lagoon area while 12% is permanently covered by open water and canals and 80% is mud flats tidle shallows and salt marshes in fact it is one of the Mediterranean basin Wetlands the Lagoon is connected to the Adriatic Sea by three large openings in the natural sand barrier they are the Leo the maloko and the kyja inlets where the tide enters and exits twice a day laa into the sea water enters the inlets and spreads gradually into the Lagoon from the inlets it spreads along the canals it goes faster along the canals but also around the sandbanks and the deeper areas and when the tide recedes the sea level goes down and the waters flow out of the Lun inlets once again during and after the fall of the Western Roman Empire the inhabitants of the Venetian coastal plain fled the invading barbarians and came to live on the dozens of islands surrounded by the shallow Lagoon for the protection it afforded over the centuries the Lagoon became a natural base for the great Venetian trading empire the venetians built their City by driving giant Oak poles up to 4 M into the muddy Flats effectively petrifying and preserving them they put Planks on top of these pillars and marble foundations on top of the planks over time the brenta and Sila Rivers deposited in the lagoon blocking the navigation channels and venetians found it necessary to redirect the rivers so they flow directly into the sea instead of into the Lagoon large scale Naval engineering projects including hydraulic pumping and the redirection of rivers have been underway for centuries and have altered the Natural Evolution ution of the Lagoon creating canals and a number of artificial Islands battling high and low water has been a part of Venetian life for hundreds of years the MOs project however is the most complex and massive Naval engineering project in the city history the idea that Venice could be protected from the Sea by a series of barriers began to gain Traction in the 1970s other surge barriers in London St Petersburg Russia and Rotterdam in the Netherlands showed that the concept could work but actually building it in Italy proved far more complicated than expected like all costly big engineering projects in Italy it encountered strong opposition from environmentalists became vulnerable to corruption and fell into a web of contradictory local and National Powers when the project was first designed 30 years ago it was essentially an engineering project and so we approached the problem in a very let say hard way today there are two sides to the project the engineering side but also the environmental side construction of the Venetian MOS began in 2003 and the surge barrier is expected to be complete and fully functional in 2018 the MOs project was tailor made to protect Venice with four major barriers installed at the three main Lagoon inlets that connect the Lagoon to the Adriatic Sea the Venice surge barrier consists of 78 floating steel floodgates arranged into four rows of various sizes widths and lengths they are all independently operated and housed in tanks anchored to the sea floor each gate lies horizontally on the seabed when not in use but when the tides over 110 cm are predicted the barriers rise up on their hinges after the threat passes the air is released and the barriers can sink down again the flotation forces do most of the work think of them as boys which are submerged except for the last part so they are controlled with pressurized air inside the barrier and absorb the force of the wave but the air inside the barrier compensates for [Music] it over time the the MOs project morphed from being a purely engineering project to Encompass also the recovery of Lagoon Wetlands that had been eroded over the centuries and the recovery and restoration of venice which became the control center of the whole project now run by the construction Consortium venetsia Nova or new Venice the work we have done over the last few years has been buied land recovery reinforcement of the coastline decontamination protection of polluted areas all this to regenerate and improve the Lagoon and the quality of its watera over the course of a 15-year infrastructure project the work has often been bogged down by political quagmires and Kickback scandals one of the most vocal opponents of the MOS project is Luigi Lazo of Le amb this model this Italian style of managing the bids and sub bids in house that determine who gets the project and then inflating the cost year after year is a direct result of the new Public Works law now we are up to 7 billion EUR with the MOs maybe being completed in 2016 then we will cost in the future it is one of the most complex and costly Public Works projects in Italian History the budget of the construction is approximately 5.5 billion EUR spent over 10 to 15 years for construction in general terms we think maintenance will be 30 to 40 million EUR a year but it is the MOs surge barrier that is at the heart of this massive new effort to protect Venice the heavy lift company foli was called in to move some of the key elements of this massive engineering operation together with construction company mantoani the Venice Water Authority and the privately owned Consortium venetsia Nova after centuries of devastating floods a plan to save Venice from the rising sea and the sinking City finally surfaced each of the 12,000 ton concrete housings had to be moved from the building site to the Lagoona entrance while the Leo and kyoda barrier housings were built close to their final destination site the casin for the maloko Lagoon entrance were built far from where they were to to be laid moving the concrete barrier housings from the building site to their designated place on the sea floor and then installing the mobile barriers was an epic lifting job fjol first had to deliver a lifting structure that would allow the casin built for the maloko entrance to be lowered into the water as the site could not be flooded like the others in order to sink the casin here the Consortium built the largest Synchro lift in the world made up of 26 beams each 57 M long activated by hydraulic winches that could lower the casin underwater so that they could in turn be lifted and transported syn the Synchro lift is a synchronized elevator that allows us to lower things in water structures that aren in size but above all extremely heavy and with this lift we can carry kons that weigh up to 22,000 metric tons the massive cross beams of the synchrolift were transported onto a specially designed barge using self-propelled modular Transporters they are equipped with dozens of wheels that can rotate individually through 90° in order to move massive weights in any direction it took three to carry each of of the beams to the barge where they were loaded and taken to the construction site where they were laid side by side and attached to the massive hydraulic jacks that provided the lifting and lowering power fjali was also contracted to move some of the concrete casin from the Leo treor building site in order to move the massive concrete casin foli Engineers designed a unique tool for the job they designed a catamaran structure with two river barges bound together with cross beams equipped with strand Jacks a special wedge-shaped connection provided the catamaran with the necessary rigidity to perform the massive lift the unit was designed and built at the fjali yards at Crona on the Po River under the direction of Loris Joan of Crona has been a very important location for the MOs project in that it had the shipyard where the catamaran was pre-assembled the catamaran was constructed out of two existing river barges that were taken out of the water in the port of Crona put in the dry dock in order to modify them and utilize them as the catamaran in the port of Crona the two cros head beams were constructed that would constitute the catamaran once assembled in the dry dock the whole catamaran was disassembled and piece by piece bges and beams were transported to the Le party for this heavy lift job the catamaran needed a total of 20 strand Jacks able to lift from 45 to 294 tons they do the heavy lifting of the concrete Cas four strs were used to syn The Quon there were four vertical strand Jacks that let us syn the kons to their correct depth then we used the 12 l50 strands with a capacity of 50 tons for the secondary moing that connected The Quon to the catamaran then another four L300 strand acts with a 300 ton capacity were used for the primary Waring system which allowed the catamaran to move The Quon to its final resting place the single most employed instrument in all the transportation of the 12,000 ton Quon of this Mega project was the Strand Jack which uses an electrically activated hydraulic pulley to raise massive weights spread evenly among the dozens of cables lifting the load strand Jacks were famously used to pull the 100,000 tons of the Costa Concordia over 12 hours from a 60° list to the vertical in the 2003 parbuckling operation in July of 2012 one of the massive concrete kasons on which the individual floating barriers were to be attached was ready to be moved once ready the Basin was flooded and the Cason started floating but then had to be partially sunk by pumping the air out of the tunnels built inside them two tugboats drag the casin one at a time out of the Basin to a sheltered area though the casin were secure every safety precaution was taken to make sure nothing went wrong special propylene axle lines were fixed to the special transport trailers parked along either side of the shoreline they crawled along with the slowly moving casin the heaviest lift of Italian History had begun once the casin had arrived at the sheltered Bay the tugboats were disconnected and the launching operation began the two tugboats were hooked up to the catamaran the launching operations involved connecting the lifting points of the casin to the catamaran for the so-called secondary moing system the quod was delivered to foli already floating it had a dry weight of 12,500 tons it was connected to the catamaran Alpha inside the Basin and then connected to the moing system once we reached the exact point of installation The Quon was ballasted until it became very heavy then it was dropped down to the seaf Flor by the hydraulic pulley or strand Jacks F Marino once the structure had been connected the catamaran was pushed by tug votes until it arrived over the underwater primary moing system long wires called trench axis lines showed the pathway or line to follow in order to get the concrete structure over the trench carved in the sea floor and reach the precise sinking Point once in position the casin were ballasted and sunk using strand Jacks positioned onto the catamaran water cushions previously positioned into the seabed were filled gently taking the load of the casin before they reached the bottom of the trench the bags were then deflated allowing the placement of the casin in their final position Engineers used precise 3D computer models to place the casin with millimetric precision and slide one against the other to form a single water typ line even the smallest error could mean disaster for the mosa project however this was just the first stage in the massive move once the casin were lowered the floating barriers had to be attached this was a massive feat of engineering in 2003 the Italian government began investing billions into a project called MOS a massive barrier to control the tides flowing in and out of Venice from the Adriatic Sea here at Leo torti the mosa construction site Rises out of the sea a massive gray wall of concrete but what is underwater and how does it work 20 M Beneath the Sea are a series of massive concrete queson every barrier has its seven housing kons and 21 Gates and two service tunnels one on each flank workers who build and maintain these undersea tunnels take a lift to the bottom of the shaft it is an imposing Labyrinth of metal concrete and cable there are two tunnels one for transport and another a lateral service tunnel in which repairs can be carried out in a hurry if there is a leak watertight rooms along the side of the tunnel host the attachment mechanisms connected through the watertight female housings to the male part of the hinges on the outside of the casin round which the barriers move when compressed air is pumped into them each of the hinge rooms is flanked by a service chamber that allows a diver to enter the hinge room to carry out any emergency repairs if it is flooded the watertight doors need to be checked regularly they must be kept closed at all [Music] times each casin was lowered and pulled against the next with with millimetric Precision so as to make the whole length of the unders sea tunnel completely watertight the next phase in building the MOS is positioning the mobile barriers once again the heavy lift company foli was called into play in this hanger in the Meera Port Shipyard south of Venice the massive yellow Floodgate is finally ready to be moved if you think moving a piano is hard imagine this 210 ton steel box the whole process of moving the barrier out to sea would take three full days fjol uses a special heavy lift transport vehicle to slowly roll it out onto the awaiting barge it is a tedious and dangerous process to move such a beast finally at dusk the barge transported at a snail San Marco after Nightfall a brief glimpse of the very City it is destined to protect in order to do the final most delicate phase of installation at daylight the crew docks for the [Music] night Dawn Rises over Venice the city of water slowly wakes doing its Daily Business by boat the barge with the great yellow gate heads out to sea to its final resting place after we lowered the seven Quon F was also involved in the laying and installation of the floodgates to do this we utilized a scaffolding structure that was constructed of trellis towers and beams connected to the towers the tailor made system included a four Tower structure with two cros head beams on top each equipped with four strand Jacks necessary to lower this gigantic 210 ton barrier into the water the support structure was called the fishing beam as it would be used to hook the mobile barrier with 14x 14 axle lines the axle lines had to be perfectly constructed when the structures were ready a large barge equipped with four sets of gantries was maneuvered into position and the tower legs connected to a bottom frame were joined to the four Tower sections this was a delicate stage every connection had to be precise to the millimeter workers monitored every parameter using radar adjusting the cables and hydraulic pressure as needed the barge with a Floodgate on board was transported to the Le Inlet and there it was floated under the four strand Jacks mounted on the launching legs the weight of the lifted Floodgate is almost 250 metric tons The Strand Jax allowed the floodgates to be lifted from the barge and lowered onto with millimetric Precision once the qu had been laid the barges loaded with the barrier were moved directly under the launching structure so the fishing beam could hook the barrier after this the area was cleared from the barge and the barrier was lowered into the water using the Strand Jacks then the mobile barrier was freed from the support structure and fixed to the casin any misstep could send the 200 ton gate to the Bottom of the Sea finally the barge came back to load the launching Gantry system and repeat the whole operation with the other three barriers this will be done 78 times this is the old Arsenal Ground Zero of the fight to save Venice from sinking once the former Shipyard of the Republic of Venice today it is reclaiming its place as the power center of the city here in the main command and control station of the MOs project engineer Eris RI is in charge of managing the Mosa combination of high tides and adverse winds as we are caused by a combination of several events one is the normal tide the other is the southeasterly wind which pushes the water towards the upper Adriatic and SE against the Lagoon and lastly there is a standing wave which contributes to Rising Waters He Works hand in hand with the engineers and technicians of the city tide Center to analyze the meterological and tidal data coming into the control room it is here where the crucial decision is made to close or open the 78 Gates that make up the barrier the parameters of the screen that you see on the upper left are the monitors that give us the actual position of every barrier its position and its state should we need to activate them the central part is dedicated to the weather forecast all the other screens give us information about the Lagoon surroundings the Mediterranean and the Adriatic Sea all the data near our area that allows us to have a clear picture of the meteorological situation there are many parameters that determine exactly how many gates are opened where and in what order we can see normal Tides High Tides very high tides and we can react to each individual situation differently today Science and Technology allow for the forecasting of when flooding will happen but there is a [Music] deadline we are able to predict several days in advance when a flood tide will occur and to forecast the tides quite accurately but obviously as we get closer to the day of the flood tide our ability to forecast what will happen in proofs so therefore the real moment to decide whether or not to close the Lagoon with the flood barriers happens about 3 hours before the event because at that time we can determine with total certainty what is about to happen multiple meteorological factors must be calculated the decision was made to use the MOs Only When the tide is at 110 CM above average or higher under this scenario flooding will still occur using various simulations Venice authorities are able to determine with Precision exactly what impact flood waters of different levels will have on their City Venice is underwater in a very small number of places when the sea Rises 80 cm above the average sea level but the areas subject to this flooding as you can see are the most famous areas of the City St Mark first to flood and Rialto immediately afterwards but when the water level rises to 100 cm 1 m above average St Mark some smaller streets begin to have some problems at 110 CM the famous rubber boots become a necessity to get around the city at 130 CM City isn flooded but it is certainly completely impacted which means that not only the ground floors and not only the shops are flooded but the store rooms can used and people can freely at 140 cm rubber boots are no longer any help and the city becomes extremely difficult to navigate but it is the Epic flood levels like that of 1966 that are the biggest worry basically in that situation Venice is completely underwater once the mosa has been activated the seven 8 Single barriers emerge from the seabed in groups of four effectively creating a wall between the Lagoon and the Sea a control system keeps the inclination of the gates when closed at approximately 45° constantly adjusting the water inside when it is time to open the barrier the gates are filled with water a process called ballasting they slowly come to rest flush with the seabed invisible from above massive hinges that weigh 42 tons keep the gates attached to their bases there are small gaps just a few centimet wide which allow a little water through but more importantly allow the gates to move and rotate on their hinges as necessary in October of 2013 the first test was conducted on the MOs and the gates were raised ceremoniously out of of the sea the precise data is boring but I can tell you that just by closing half of the inlet you could definitely see a lowering of the water level inside the Lagoon so the MOs works the tide was slow however there is more to the MOs than simply massive engineering over the years despite the scandals attached to it the mo has contributed to restoring other areas of the Venetian Lagoon but even those efforts are not without controversy in an effort to preserve the uncontaminated natural environment environmental groups often oppose big Civil Works like the Venetian MOS barriers in this case however the ecosystem in question is far from natural sediments carried by the many inland Rivers originated from the Lagoon itself in ancient times by sinking and consolidating below sea level for the Mose new concrete walls and embankments were built and even a brand new artificial Island was created at the northernmost Leo Inlet to host all the service buildings that control the barriers on one side of the island is a lock system a deep Canal for tankers and cruise ships and on the other side is a a shallower canal leading North however not everyone agrees that the Lagoon should be open to large ships at all in Italy there have already been disasters associated with large Naval vessels if one of these ships were to sink in the Lagoon close to Venice it would be catastrophic both for the environment and the residents alike it has made the city slave to the passing of these gigantic ships ships that could very possi create a legitimate threat of accident accidents like the ones that have unfortunately happened in this country like on the island of Julia with the coast of Concordia and the port of Genoa two extremely grave incidents that have created terrible damage if Moos is to be successful it needs to be complemented by projects that will restore the Lagoon structure and build up its natural defenses the part of the project that concerns the Lagoon is one of the most urgent as ects of the work because it is necessary for environmental restoration of the deteriorated areas of the Lagoon but also the shore the moment in which the floodgates prevent the Tidewaters from entering the Lagoon from the sea the sea will spread out back along the shore and so we had to reinforce the shore for this reason some of these measures include improving water quality by dredging the canals which improves the water Exchange in the inner Lagoon areas securing runoff from dumps and industrial areas reinforcing the seaw walls surrounding venice restoring thousands of kilometers of salt marshes polluted sediment was removed from canals but where was it taken there is concern due to some of the corruption scandals surrounding the project that the mud polluted by heavy metals may not have been properly disposed of and what about the 49 km of new beach where did it come from and who will manage it there is a risk here just like in other places from the excavation that brings in soil from the southern part of the Lagoon which is obviously polluted and has been since the 60s by petrol chemicals deposit in the seabed from the Margera industrial area another concern is the impact Moos closures might have on the Lagoon water quality it is the sea itself that is responsible for keeping the Lagoon Waters clean since there is no sewage system and black water is released into the Lagoon some worry that closing the Lagoon more frequently could tip this delicate balance it tides to clean out the Lagoon and they come into the Lagoon and they leave the Lagoon twice a day clean water comes in picks up the waste and takes it back out into the Open Sea experts predict that sea levels could rise between 25 and 50 cm between now and the end of the century at the same time Venice is sinking 1 mm annually the more frequent the floods the more often MOS must be used the frequency of the flooding could increase significant between now and the end of the century so the need to close the MOs barrier could increase from the present five times a year to up to 100 or 150 times a year or even 200 times and closing the barrier so often could have an impact on the quality of the Waters of the Lagoon and the city itself University of Padu professors are proposing a companion solution to the Moos an audacious plan to raise Venice by pumping water into a soil and rock layer beneath the city our proposal is to raise the City by taking sea waterer and building Wells 700 to 800 M deep and then pumping the water into the rocks at that depth Venice will rise we have calculated that over 10 years it could rise as much as 25 to 30 cm very gradually critics say the mosa project may go down in history as little more than a concrete icon of corruption and waste if it Venice it doesn the city that it won with a meter or a little over a meter of water washing up here in Patza San Marco the city already has problems in truth this won to stay while MOS officials say corruption scandals were reprehensible that does not change the fact that MOS is a naval engineering feat of incredible proportions the work in my opinion is a extraordinary seriousness and quality you have to think that for the kons that are 60x 40 by 28 structures we have tolerances of less than 1 cm in the last year we put down 18 of these kons one every 15 days without airing by 1 second or one cim from our plan the mosic construction is permanent together with all its accessory parts and will have to live with it even if it change which it seems is about to happen we could be 2016 2017 2018 waiting for the moment when we know for sure if it really works so we can test if the project will be able to keep a significant amount of the flooding out after it had been pushed back several times due to the ongoing Public Works investigation underway the Consortium of new Venice has determined a new June 2018 date for completion of the mosa [Music] project the whole project is about 87% constructed it rows of floodgates that they install by the end of 2015 although there is some uncertainty about how effectively Mo will protect the city of Venice 7 billion e have been spent and the project is currently the best hope the city has of not being swallowed up by the very Lagoon to which it owes its Fame without doubt the MOs project has been a Marvel of engineering that has utilized the toughest machines and technologies that the maritime construction world has to offer if it does work to save Venice from more frequent devastating floods visitors from all over the world will still have the opportunity to admire this wondrous city of water for decades to come [Music]	Success
Unveiling the Secrets of the Sun | SLICE SCIENCE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6O1SqIZpUA	SLICE Science	[Music] as soon as I saw my very first images of the sun I was just mesmerized I couldn believe how much was going on and then I started hearing about how little we actually knew about the sun then I was then I was hooked I was like you know this is something that I really want to try to understand the sun is fascinating and very mysterious to truly understand it we must attempt The Impossible and touch a star for almost 20 years NASA and the European Space Agency have been pooling their efforts in order to rise to this challenge having landed on a comet with the Rosetta probe and having caught Pluto on camera with New Horizons we are finally about to travel to the heart of our solar system it is kind of our last place to go and explore and I would say the most important place for us to go and explore with the European solar Orbiter Mission and the American Parker solar probe a 60-year-old dream is about to come true the notion of solar probes dates back to 1958 and as is often the case in the history of science it all began with a revolutionary intuition of a young scientist in 1958 a young scientist called Eugene Parker published a paper where he actually predicted that this soul wind this continually streaming atmosphere away from the Sun would exist young Eugene Parker was Earth shattering without observing a thing just by using mathematical equations he worked out that the sun must expel minuscule particles of matter all the time and in every direction this solar wind reaches the whole of the solar system Eugene Parker changed the way humans View the cosmos forever we realized that space wasn empty but there were particles streaming full of energy and so immediately became clear that to understand this we probably needed to go close to the Sun 1958 was the start of the Space Age Sputnik 1 the first ever satellite had just been sent into orbit by the Soviets and the Americans already had some catching up to do 1958 was a decisive year for the American space mission its first breakthrough came in February with the launch of its first satellite Explorer 1 in July President Eisenhower created NASA to oversee America in the wake of the Cold War The Race For A Space Odyssey began that same year scientists from the brand new American space agency dreamed up the best possible space missions a committee was put together chaired by John Simpson and James Van Allen and they were asked to provide guidance and advice to NASA they came up with 14 missions that they said were they could do one of the 14 priority missions the Simpson committee came up with was of course a moon landing which later became the Apollo program there was also the premise for the Mariner missions which was to land on Earth planets and another of the 14 projects was the solar Mission the idea was to go and observe the Sun from close up to get as close as possible to the sun this Mission has been a a holy grail for most solar physicists ever since we actually have to go there to sample the composition of that atmosphere in the solar wind to fully understand it and that is important because what happens on the sun impacts us here at the Earth 13 of the 14 missions dreamt of by the Simpson committee have become a reality in the ensuing years that man only one has yet to see the light of day The Solar Mission Engineers have faced an insurmountable challenge how to build a probe that could withstand such a hostile environment so close to the Sun it becomes very very hot so it in an oven and we are going to be moving through there working and getting our data we can avoid it we need to go in there to take our data if you had an ordinary material sitting there it would sort of either it would fuse and evaporate very very quickly it has taken 60 years for technological breakthroughs to make the space Pioneers dream a potential reality to accomplish this feat Engineers from the two missions Parker solar probe and solar Orbiter have had to construct super resistant Shields that could withstand the INF heat they have rivaled one another in Ingenuity inventing new technology and sometimes rediscovering materials previously used by cavemen we really pushed the boundaries it was always designed just at the frontier of what was possible technologically [Music] it working hard to get close to the Sun this project is finally seeing the light of day thanks in part to the tenacity of solar scientists in Europe and America Milan maximovich has kept the notion of a solar mission in mind for 20 years there have been several studies I myself researched the possibility of a solar probe with marlli we pushing for this mission to take place and finally at the beginning of the years 2000 it seemed that this was actually going to happen we had a dinner with Milan maximovich whom of course was a good friend of mine back from the days in the observatory in Paris and we said well maybe we are the ones that are actually going to be able to do this and see this Mission through but scientists soon realized that a single probe would not suffice to solve all the mysteries of the sun they would need two first there was the American Parker solar probe NASA to what space Pioneers envisaged in the 1960s it was named Parker as a tribute to Eugene Parker the man whose revolutionary discoveries had inspired the mission 60 years previously could finally contemplate his ideas coming to fruition it was a tremendous honor to be able to introduce Jean to the spacecraft to actually turn to him and say Parker meet Parker and watch just joy and overwhelming come across um his face and he was very gracious he kind of joked with me gee I just wrote a paper in his paper Eugene Parker predicted that a critical Zone must exist at a distance of 4 million miles from the surface of the Sun in our star atmosphere this enigmatic region has remained a source of of Fascination for scientists for 60 years it is the target of the American probe 4 million miles that sounds quite a big distance but the Earth and the Sun are 93 million miles apart so if I put the Sun and the Earth on a meter stick solar probe will be just 4 cm away from the surface of the Sun and that is close to get that close to a star without being irredeemably sucked into it Parker solar probe would have to be launched into space at considerable [Music] speed NASA has had to come up with a two-fold launch using the most powerful rocket at its disposal the Delta 4 heavy with a takeoff thrust of 8 boeings it is an enormous rocket we need such a big launch vehicle so it can throw us away from the planet the secondary rocket is the one then sends it into um interplanetary orbit and will be moving at about 120 m per second and it will be by by far the fastest spacecraft ever created after just 5 months the American probe will approach our star for the first time in order to get inside the Strategic 4 million mile mark it will have to keep circling it getting slightly closer each time round in December 2024 after a 7-year Mission before it dissolves in the a 2 million Dee heat Parker final analysis of Our Stars atmosphere the NASA probe won to relay images of the Sun from a furnace that hot no telescope would be able to look a star in the eye from that distance without being blinded solar probe will get so close to the Sun that at this distance you simply cannot fly a lot of optical instrumentation uh so this is something solar Orbiter will provide so it can take images that will prove invaluable for scientists the European solar orbitar probe will have to keep a distance of 26 million mil from the Sun it will need 3 and A2 years to complete this Voyage the trajectory of solar orbit is very strategic it will allow us to discover hitherto unexplored territory in particular the sun poles solar Orbiter will not be as close to the Sun but it with its Suite of instrumentation gives a a much sort of more Global picture of this fundamental physics the solar Orbiter Mission will also last 7 years before being abandoned in space but just like Parker solar probe the European probe will have had time to collect essential data that will be transmitted to Earth in just 15 minutes the results of the two probes will then be coordinated to give scientists around the world a better understanding of our star for us this is a golden opportunity to have the two missions up at the same time and working together the missions are very similar in what we want to do but the methods that we it are very different one technical element in particular will be very different in the two missions the heat shield situated at the front of the probe that is the key to the mission but also the main obstacle Engineers have been coming up against since the 1960s if the heat shield fails in any way then the the inside of the spacecraft is going to start to heat up and our our instrument and our satellite if it gets too hot then they will just stop working the slightest fault in the heat shield would signal the end of the mission for each of these two probes the engineers have had very different issues to overcome for Parker solar Pro they have had to create an ultra reflective Shield that would survive being closer to the Sun than ever before the European solar Orbiter probe will get a bit less hot but its Shield must be ultra fine so that it can be pierced to make openings for the instruments without it being weakened in any way you protect very well and then you leave as small it Le and this destroy the [Music] isolation in tyin the Aerospace manufacturer Talis alenia space has taken 6 years to perfect the heat shield for the European solar orbit [Music] Mission electronics are a bit like human beings they work well at an ambient temperature of somewhere between 20 and 50° Centigrade we have had to produce a shield that is just a few cenm thick to protect our instrument from this intense heat it challenge the engineers for solar Orbiter spent a long time selecting materials capable of withstanding such an inferno they have an exceptional instrument to their disposal for test purposes a sun Simulator the exact conditions for the mission are reproduced in this tank firstly the void but also more importantly the Heat and solar radiation before being selected each material is tested to see if it is fireproof we make sure they don disintegrate uh at high temperature so we do a lot of sample testing of these materials in in in small quantities and from that we extrapolate than the properties of the big surfaces on the spacecraft we tested the sample failed the change of the material failed the gain made another sample and this time was successful and selected in 2012 a solution was finally found for the European solar orbit Mission its Shield is formed of two large panels each measuring 2 m by 3 placed 20 cm apart the front panel is comp composed of 20 very fine layers of titanium the back panel is made of carbon fibers the titanium structure reflects some of the intensity of the sun second panel the heat bounces between The Shield expelled into space through the side openings to make it even more effective a unique covering has been created especially for the mission it solar black and against all expectations the engineers had recourse to a pigment previously used by cavemen solar black is made from burnt bone charcoal interestingly this is the same type of material that prehistoric men use to paint on the walls of caves and this is a really stable substance it won oxidized it will still be pristine at the end of the mission as it is at the beginning Parker solar probe Shield is quite different from that of its European counterpart because the thermic challenges faced were even greater the American probe will dive into an atmosphere that reaches temperatures of 2 million de and it will get closer to these powerful solar flares than ever before but at 2 million de no metal can remain solid the mission is only achievable because the sun is is very unusual quite different to anything ever experienced on Earth the Sun looks like fire and it looks like there the Sun but in fact it exactly that it material it the the atmosphere and the Corona and the material that corona is actually not very dense there aren particles the sun billions of times denser than the Earth are extremely hot but they are also far too small and widely dispersed to burn the [Music] probe the real risk for the Parker soda probe is the sun which warm us on Earth but at that distance the rays are 700 times more powerful than they are here the temperature of the shield will rise to 1 , 400° that it intense 1, 400° is already hotter than the melting point of most materials the ovens you get in kitchens today reach a maximum temperature of 300° so where we our instruments is really extremely hot to find a material which can withstand 1,4 400° C the American probes Engineers took their inspiration from space shuttles [Music]	Success
Venice Is Drowning: The Untold Story | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOPr9LMD4B0	SLICE Science	[Music] it is the night of the 12th of November 2019 record levels of Aqua ala are eating away at precious mosaics and destroying world heritage landmarks it is one of the darkest hours for Venice and its fragile Lagoon EOS system three natural events combined with half a century of corruption have brought the city to its knees the sheer survival of one of the most recognizable romantic and beloved cities on Earth the pearl of the Adriatic is now at stake this is the sad story of how Decades of ineptitude and Corruption have destroyed hundreds of livelihoods and left the city of light and water on the edge of Destruction the critical moment was when the sirens stopped what we saw was like the day after tomorrow it was like a war scene Total War it looked as though there unforeseeable completely unforeseeable but we took our boats out anyway and once we we couldn what happened to St Marks and the rest of the Southern Lagoon that was very badly damaged what we saw was shocking what we saw was the powerlessness of the rans of those of us who love Venice the weather forecasts were wrong they were wrong and I don were wrong it weather is difficult to predict with great Precision we were also betrayed by the alarm the water Rose extremely fast in the last hour it Rose by 30 or 40 cm in the last hour or hour and a half why because the Border blows from the Northeast the shiroko from Southeast and together they tra the water at kyja where the water Rose 50 cm when the wind changed to lieto or Southwest that blows from kyja to Venice all this mass of water was sent back to Venice and reached Venice with this additional 40 cm [Music] November the 4th 1966 the world looked on a gast as an abnormal occurrence of high tides rain swollen rivers and a severe shiroo wind flooded Venice causing the canals to rise to a record height of 194 CM the high waters sparked a Race Against Time to save the city but instead of protecting Venice this particular big engineering Endeavor seems to have enriched a few by pouring money into private pockets and concrete onto the Lagoon floor more and more frequently high tides and high winds push Salty Sea Water Through The Heart of the City already suffering damage from years of unfettered mass tourism could these be the final years of the Venice so many have known and loved for [Music] centuries it is the night of the 12th of November of 2019 a strong southeasterly wind known as the shiroo blows warm air towards the Alps where it clashes with cold air from the north torrential rain and snow close mountain passes and swell the rivers a highly unusual Cyclone settles over the northern Adriatic the deadly combination of climatic factors a high Autumn tide and the failure of An Unfinished man-made surge barrier turn a natural phenomenon into a tragedy seawater is pushed through the three openings in the sand spits that run north to south that usually protect the shallow Waters around Venice from the storms the wind whips the Lagoon Waters into waves that crash into to the islands and pushes the salty water first into St Mark Square then the narrow streets and canals of Venice this is not the brackish mix of fresh and salt water that usually surrounds Venice it is the sea [Music] itself toward 5:30 or 6 of the afternoon the messages and Sirens began that forecast of a worsening situation that with the last message and the last siren told us it would be catastrophic because the message that due to extremely strong winds with gusts faster than 100 kmph the high tide around 11:00 p.m. could reach 1 M 90 close to the great flood of the 4th of November 1966 the wave isn enters in slowly the tide that in the Venetian Lagoon breathes slowly the tide that comes in and goes out with the same speed this time it was the sea itself that came in everyone was in the street trying to move their cars to park them higher up people in underwear and their High waiters trying to block the water but the water came in like a tidal wave wave after wave of stormy sea that night we came close to a tragedy and out of pure luck there was no tragedy everyone in the world has seen the pictures of Roni with the water bus is beached on the street not even half an arm bridges this means that the actv water buses were lifted by the water and almost smashed into the bridge The Columns of the does Palace the doors of the hotels that danly all the Metropole all the hotels in that area the waves were trapped inside the Lagoon and became as high as 2 MERS crashing into the Kota pellestrina the most exposed areas of the city the banks of Juda island disappeared windows were smashed boats and water buses sank boats Cut Loose water bath pontoons got detached and floated away it was a catastrophe catastrophe the freak weather added to the disaster as the southeasterly wind blew seawater into the Lagoon the wind changed and became northeasterly a wind called The Border that drove the seawater trapped in the lagoon southwards against the north banks of the city and the island of Morano the Thousand-Year old church of San Donado was severely flooded this new alarm system that was set up in 2010 has been improved and after the siren that sounds like an anti-aircraft siren that sends out whales according to the forecast tide so after the siren there which means 110 and then two means 120 up to four Wales means 40 and more so 140 and more what did that more mean we simply didn only by calling each other comparing notes checking the tide warning center were we able to understand that we could get to 190 there difference the water began to rise in the Heart of the City too when where the church of Santa Maria de miracul famed the world over for its marble facade was swamped sa Venice has um provided funding for the conservation of over a thousand artworks in our 50-year history one of our most important campaigns was the Church of Santa Mar miracul which was restored inside and out um cleaning removing salts from all the the marbles um the marble decoration of the church we the miracula now after the floods because um it the church itself did did uh have go underwater and we are dealing with problems with the floor and with the salts reemerging after the seawat from the floods has dried then the wind changed again and blew a deadly tidal wave against the already devastated City it November 2019 and Venice has been battered by 100 km an hour winds first from the southeast then from the Northeast salt water has been pushed into the Lagoon swelling the waters that have risen to over 1 and a half m above sea level the city is prepared for 1 M 60 with flood barriers at the entrances of homes and shops but now the situation gets even worse the wind turns again now blowing from the southwest a wind the Italians call alipa the huge mass of water trapped in the south of the Lagoon begins to move north cotesta is a veteran Venetian journalist and watched the unfolding events with [Music] horror the Bora blows from the Northeast the Shiro from Southeast and together they trapped the water at kyja where the water Rose 50 cm when the wind changed to lieto or Southwest that blows from kyja to Venice all that mass of water was sent back to Venice fast and reached Venice with this additional 40 cm then I read a study written by the CNR which said that we were even lucky because the high water caused by the wind and bad weather did not coincide with the actual Luna high tide because if the two had coincided it would have been 2 m 20 or 2 m 30 the water rushed northwards at high speed crashing into the Venetian Waterfront and the Lagoon side shores of the outer Islands shops homes libraries and the cities architectural Heritage was swamped by highly corrosive seawater homeowners and shopkeepers were already moving furniture and goods higher and higher until they ran out of height electrical appliances such as fridges and washing machines short circuited and electrical wiring sparked out the damage was also on the other islands of the Lagoon pellestrina Mur buano quiet and quaint during the summer were pummeled by 2 m high waves and 100 kilm per hour winds Leo home to the Venice film festival and usually safe from the floods was swamped by the high tide the water pressure was so high that it broke a window in the Crypt of St Marks and the water poured in overwhelming the pumps that had been in St to keep it dry the thousand-year-old mosaics and marble Paving were soon a wash with highly corrosive salt water the world watched in shock and sadness as the water Rose in the Basilica of St Mark one of the finest churches of the Western World the Crypt was soon submerged the damage incalculable the beautiful Waterfront hallway of Bal o pizani the city school was kneed Deep in water ancient homes that host the world-renowned banial Art Festival were inundated this floor that you see is an ancient floor an original marble floor that was completely covered in water and repeatedly covered in water in the following 10 days causing an irreversible damage because not so much the water that is above rather the water that gets in and goes below because the water comes in from below and it water and since it is salt waterer it corrodes violently and irreversibly the material with a chemical reaction and the same problem impacts the wooden structures all the foundations and the wooden piles but going back to the night of the 12 what was particularly serious was that everything that we had put above 160 cm and a little more to be safe was destroyed and obviously all the ground floor Apartments some of which are St rooms flats or offices were flooded it only takes 5 minutes of immersion to spoil everything and this case it lasted hours the financial loss to the city inhabitants was massive not to mention the damage to the cultural heritage such as the destruction of autograph music scores in the music school the floors and woodwork of the grti palace along venice private residence termed luxury hotel and the Venetian Gothic style doa churches the banks of the world famous river deavon were devastated and both boats rammed up against bridges in the Kad de Cardman the parish priest arrived to find water had covered the ancient marble floors and soaked the antique pews he snapped pictures and then got to work with parishioners to try to move the water out [Applause] for Kiara Panino is librarian at the conservatory where precious music manuscripts are stored here too there were tragic losses when the water Rose above the expected high fora [Music] above all the damage was to the livelihoods of ordinary venetians without the citizens of Venice the daily maintenance of the whole city as a living community would crumble for for for for they pay for the upkeep of their homes they keep the city ordinary everyday actions although its native population is dwindling Venice is not a museum it a living City in Winter and in summer it the Hall of Mirrors The House of the witches and so forth the casinos de the trader shops the fondi and you see a city that once existed and is no more no this would be missing an incredible opportunity it like the Americans destroying the native population it we were seeing a conscious destruction of a very important part of our city this city has an incredible anthropological Heritage of immense value and barely hangs on because we are stubborn with our Venetian accent our long eyes and double letters we are stubborn and demand that Venice be recognized as a whole city with its inhabitants the aqua ala is not just a normal flood but an increasingly frequent phenomenon that has been made worse by Decades of mismanagement and destruction of the Lagoon Balance that has left the city on the brink of utter Annihilation and yet the catastrophe might have been avoided if the steel walls of venice deployed but the imposing concrete and steel Mega engineering project called moosy stayed firmly anchored to the bottom of the Lagoon only 2 weeks after the devastating flood under the cover of the darkness of night did the Consortium in charge of building and managing The Surge barrier actually perform a secret test on the system in conditions considerably more favorable the very survival of the city of Venice depends on the health of the Lagoon that surrounds it it stretches over 550 Square km from the river Cel in the North to the brenta in the South the city of Venice and the small islands around it account for only 8% of the whole area the rest is made up of mud flats and tidal shallows and salt marshes it is one of the Mediterranean basin provided crucial protection to Venice over the centuries the Lagoon opens into the Open Sea in three places in the south at kyoda in the center at malam moo and in the north and right in front of Venice is the Leo entrance the widest these seawood channels have been deeply dredged to allow heavy shipping into the Lagoon profoundly transforming the very nature of the waters around Venice letting in the force of the sea digging channels not cleaning out the city canals but opening wide shipping channels around Venice means taking the irreversible responsibility for changing a natural system that is extremely delicate that is the Venice Lagoon system when the water rises no longer to 60 cm but to 180 or even 120 the ratio of sea water and fresh water changes and this impacts the FAA and the Flora and the consistency of the water when there was a low tide you could see land from San georgo all all the way to Leo now you can anything once you could wait with the water up to your knees all the way to San Clemente or Sano even the area close to the Juda where we mean not close to the Juda but today towards San Marco aboka where the Venetian Galley is or close to the oil tanker channel the water is two or 2 and A2 M deep it fish have changed there are no longer any G but you find sea fish sea bass at Morano or breams that were never found before the city of Venice itself is a Marvel of architecture built on millions of wooden piles inserted into the mud and brackish water to create artificial foundations for the houses around the 13th century the city began flourishing as a trading point between the near East and the wealthy courts of Western Europe a new building technique was needed and the venetians came up with some incredible ideas Venetian Engineers understood the workings of the Lagoon and knew that there would be high and low tides so on the one hand they kept the canals dredged and on the other they used alternate layers of brick and marble as the foundation of the buildings the marble from estria now in Slovenia kept the water from seeping into the brick work and since the tall of the buildings were the lighter they had to be the outer walls were also the supporting structure the overall weight of the building was reduced by the presence of large Windows a unique characteristic in the Middle Ages [Music] this city was built on 124 mud flats held together by millions of wooden piles and joined by 400 Bridges since ships and boats traveling on rivers and sea remained the fastest mode of Transport until the invention of the internal combustion engine V in the Lagoon made it the richest city in the west but there were problems the rivers brener and Cel brought silt into the Lagoon and blocked the waterways so from the 16th century the venetians built channels to alter the course of the rivers and save the Lagoon over the centuries the city of Venice established a balance between its trade over the Open Sea the health of the brackish Lagoon and the solidity of its foundations the tides were the key to keeping lisima healthy the brackish water is perfect for the health of the foundations the light architecture can survive a limited amount of subsidence too it was not until the 20th century however that high waters rather than low began to impact the City by then it was a shadow of its former self although water is the city of wealth the industrial Heartland of Veno beyond the Lagoon poses a mortal threat and is the real challenge to its survival over the decades Venice and its Lagoon have been subject to radical transformation and unfettered exploitation the growth of the industrial cities of Porto Margera and MRE sucked water from the water table under Venice while on the other hand deep channels were carved into the Lagoon floor to allow ships to access the mainland ports and shipyards worse still came with the exponential rise of mass tourism in the in the form of Cruise vacations huge ships carrying 6,000 people literally floating cities pass right by St Mark Square they are even more devastating than the cargo ships as their wakes not only flatten the Lagoon floor but their idling engines pump hundreds of tons of sulfur into the air of a city that has no cars Mass tourism is one of of the greatest contributors to the death of Venice but it also provides a living to many of its inhabitants finding the right balance is the key to saving the city over the centuries Venice has been a place of inspiration for the great poets and artists the unique cultural and Architectural Heritage of a City built on water and navigated largely by boat has also been the city downfall as it has become one of the mustsee sites for tourists of every [Music] kind in June of 2019 a 300 met ship collided with a dock and a small tourist boat in the city five people and there were calls for a ban on grandi big ships before it is too late Kiara Don de ro has a proposal to make tourists pay for the spectacle of Venice as a living [Music] City let people in a ship these are the figures more or less and let Ship by 2,000 people the cubic meters of the ship so every person on the ship moves we worked it out about 70 cubic M of water so as soon as someone sets foot in Venice either they pay the feet tax or the sea tax the tax for walking on Venice or the tax for looking at Venice from his or her own balcony or they will be dowed in 70 cubic meters of water with the same violent force that he or she forces onto my city that metaphorical but it understanding what [Music] apart from Mass tourism subsidence flooding and Airborne pollution from ships the growth of the petrochemical Industries on the mainland has also undermine the Lagoon jeppe gambolati of Padua university has studied the multiple threats to Venice over the years Venice has sunk due to human activities during the 1950s and 60s by about 12 CM then this sinking stopped in the 1970s because the sinking was due to the extraction of underground water especially for industrial use in Porto Margera the combination of rising seas and sinking sea floor is catastrophic increasing flooding and erosion of venice buildings in the last century the 20th century we estimate that the average sea level has risen by 12 or 13 cm so the sum of the rising sea level and the sinking terrain comes to a total of 25 cm so the city of Venice over the last century has lost over 25 cm in height with respect to to the average sea level the rising water is causing serious and specific damage to the city remains within the normal limits the typical Venetian house is constructed of bricks with a damp course of istrian limestone that stops Water Rising and damaging the bricks above the ground floor of the larger houses also had a well which Drew on rainwater collected in massive systems under the street or flooring of the house the wooden floors and Ruth beams and where necessary chains were used to literally hold the house [Music] together today most of the city transport is by motorboat or barge the buses are the diesel fueled vaporetti while hundreds of outboard engines are used to power transport boats all over the city the waves from these propellers are slowly but steadily eroding the cement between the bricks the constant churning of water in the canals has had a devastating effect on the foundations of the buildings [Music] in order to reduce the churning that is eroding venice speed limit on motorboats and Venice traffic Police monitor and photograph speeding boats in 1966 just 50 years ago in some places the sea level reached 2 m higher than average the question of saving Venice from sinking and the rising sea levels became a national and International priority and a plan for a massive protection system was set in motion the project for a surge barrier to block High Tides was born and given the name of mosy which stands for experimental electromechanical module it involves positioning dozens of floating barriers on the sea Flor to be raised every time an exceptional tide is expected over6 billion EUR have been sunk into the most ambitious surge barrier ever built the idea that Venice could be saved from flooding by mobile dkes that lift up from the sea floor goes back to the 1970s when big engineering projects were common to solve everyday [Music] problems the MOs project is managed by a private Consortium called consortio Venia NOA based in the regenerated arsenal of Venice and has been dogged by administrative and legal obstacles and also by the biggest corruption Scandal the city of Venice has ever [Music] seen they created a slush fund by paying the suppliers a higher fee than required against invoices that did not correspond to the actual work done so the companies that received more money sent some of it back to the Consortium under the table so the companies earned more money they were cooperating with the Consortium and the Consortium created a slush fund that they used at least that investigation says so as to pay people who had to authorize the work as it [Music] progressed the disaster of the 12th of November 2019 raised serious questions about how the project has been designed and managed the mayor of Venice at the time the project was launched asked Naval engineer Vino d to present an alternative project to the government that involved a gravity based system with Gates that were raised not facing the tide but lying in the opposite direction this project was chosen by the city as an alternative to the MOs because the costs were 1 of the costs of the MOs the cost of maintenance if you compare the two would have been 1% of the cost of the project which is the norm not the 120 million euros we talking about today so they brought me to Rome to speak to the technical committee about the issues where I would have said what were the weak points of the MOs and what were the advantages of the gravity operated barriers when they saw me they didn even let me speak on the basis of this the technical Commission of the city seeing that their proposal had been rejected decided to give the matter to the French company Pria to study the dynamic behavior of the muzi barriers and the gravity barriers an international group of experts called in to evaluate the project made two recommendations that were ignored one was to verify that it did not produce dissonance and the other that mathematical models be used to design the final project the French company hired by the city of Venice highlighted a design floor that they identified in the mosy the instability which occurred under C conditions with a wave frequency of more than 8 seconds with the different reaction of the independent Gates AC according to their position along the whole barrier as each moving gate produced its own waves that interfered with the incoming sea the test basins where the walls were tried out were too small to properly simulate the behavior of this massive structure during real high tides no serious mathematical models of the mosan operation were attempted how the MOs will react to high seas and strong winds is still a concern Vino dla has been asked by the consumer protection Watchdog Kodak cons to analyze the project Dynamic instability means that when I move the gate with a regular CA waves of 8 seconds the wall reacts not only at 8 seconds but also at 16 so half the wavelength and this is called subharmonic frequency or dynamic instability there is no mathematical model that can simulate it and the tests carried out in the water basin are affected by the scale effect so are not realistic in the sea viscosity is real while in the test Basin it I could find that the gate goes and beats against the bottom of the sea or against the reinforced concrete structures and breaks off the MOS is designed to protect Venice from high tides when a high tide is predicted on the basis of wind and tidal data compressed air is pumped into the barriers which rise slowly to the surface blocking the influx of water from the Adriatic Sea access to the hinges for maintenance is via two service tunnels built into the concrete housings 20 M underwater should these flood there is an emergency access door in the Next Room for divers to enter these have to be kept watertight and are regularly checked joavan zarti is the lead engineer on the MOs project he has seen it grow over the years and now heads up the team that will bring it to fruition in all there are 78 barriers but more were actually built because there are two spare barriers for every Lagoon entry and the reason for this is that these barriers will have a periodic need for maintenance so in order not to leave the place where the barrier has been removed without while it is being repaired the extra and identical barrier is positioned there as soon as the barrier due for maintenance is removed the effects of the different water levels can be seen in this graph where the amount of flooding is shown in blue tides of 80 cm automatically flood s Mark square and a few other places but with the sea at 130 CM the whole city is flooded it is a hard decision to make to close the water barrier and brings enormous responsibility they should take the gates as they have been built and give them to an outside company like P or others in the world Norwegians or Americans or others that can simulate this and analyze if they work or not and if they do proceed and try to create a system of checking them properly and if they don stop the whole thing and avoid making a bad impression on the whole world because to find ourselves with a high water and waves and find one of the gates washed up in P San Marco would be a terrible thing to see the MOS was conceived of to protect Venice from high water but also to guarantee access to the port system of Venice if we had not had a port inside the Lagoon we would not need the mosy but why have they had to maintain the canals that lead to the oil refineries and have dug all these deep channels to bring ships into the industrial areas all these major access points these enormous autostrada it is because there is the port otherwise we could have done an entirely different kind of intervention well I have to say that since everybody we the project and see how it works I have to say this is technically absurd according to the best practices the test run is done by comparing it with the project planned but if there how are you supposed to do a test run my impression is it have 93 or 94% of the work done but I think it is more like they have finished 93 or 94% of the funds available there is still work to be done for example the electrical command centers to control the surge barrier the part of the electrical mechanics to control the single Gates very complex systems perhaps there are those thinking the worst who suggest that perhaps they do not really want to finish it because they too have their doubts on the Fateful night of the 12th of November 2019 the sea walls on the island of palestrina built by the Consortium actually contributed to the disaster by keeping the water on the island however the sea surge did come from an unexpected Direction the Lagoon the light motive after the high water of these days was we have to finish the MOs as if it were the only problem ignoring the pollution the changing Lagoon subsidence erosion the poor management of Tourism it seems the special law is just reduced to creating a tap at the mouth of the port and everything else is just a detail [Music] we realize that as soon as the high water goes away after we have fixed everything back up everyone will have forgotten it will be February and there will be Carnival and in May the Bali of Venice everyone will come in here and use Venice like a beautiful red carpet that belongs to everyone and they will spend billions on parties but in the end there is nothing left for Venice it is a Vain and selfish perception Venice which is made up of fishermen and regular people who go to cour houses and schools and live their lives like in every other city in the world however close the city came to destruction venetians woke up to the arrival of droves of volunteers from around the region who came to help the ordinary Venetian shopkeepers and save the city [Music] a lot of things were saved thanks to the help of volunteers who rushed down to the city there was a solidarity a network of solidarity and help that was incredible the young especially people came from Piva from outside of Venice I was moved for I I have to tell you the truth it took a bit of the bitterness of these days away to see how how the others responded the cleanup began and a few days later the sun came out on a city that had found its will to survive even the worst disaster the university building of the cadoro was one of the architectural Marvels that enjoyed the first restoration efforts uh when the flood hit on the 12th of November and then continued with a series of floods through all of November SE Venice launched a special appeal uh we were joined by the Italian Embassy in Washington and they called The Campaign Americans love Venice and together we been raising funds that we uh to help clean the churches to desalinate Marble to clean out the the water log debris um we at cadoro uh Museum the ground floor um was about 190 hours I believe total underwater during the month and so it important to work fast and that SE Venice has been able to do to um find out where there immediately it is important to know that venetians exist they were those who were born here some in this hospital or another or in the home because some are still born at home all of those who chose to live here and who desire to stay all the students who come here to study want to stay here once you enter in the rhythm of the city of Venice you realize that it is the most beautiful city of the world not just because of the stone but because of the pace because it is a human rhythm with Humanity at its Center this is such a special beautiful city I could not live in any other place because there is this human Dimension the sea the Lagoon the contact with the others and we walk we these little boxes with wheels even taking the vaporetto the water bus it is so beautiful I can writing on it because I have to look around me I was born here and it is what I and yet I am still not used to it to save the city of Venice is to save its residents to guarantee their right to live as Citizens to guarantee their right to their activities which risk being Swept Away with these high [Music] tides at 1 m87 at its highest point the aqua alter of November 2019 is the second highest flood ever recorded these floods happen several times a year but they are getting more frequent and adding to Decades of damage caused by mass tourism rising sea levels incompetent and corrupt government the city of Light and Water lisima is at risk as never before of Disappearing beneath the very Waters that sustained her for centuries

The Algae Revolution: A Future Without Plastic? | SLICE SCIENCE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MioAWkDlac	SLICE Science	[Music] the Pharaoh Islands an archipelago in the North Atlantic it the water temperature is a little lower the biologist Agnes Ms Morton is on her way with a team to one of the large salmon farms in the region we because we content in the water and we want to take from 2 m dep and St together with colleagues from the state research company FIS Carling the biologist is working on a unique project algae should help to improve the breeding conditions of [Music] salmon their idea to create a near natural habitat in the aquacultures that makes the use of chemicals and medicines in Salmon farming Superfluous in Spring she spread brown algae in the water normally they grow particularly well in clear and cold F water whether they also thrive in the fish cage must first be proven this is one one of the test ropes that we will keep in here away from the fish we have similar ropes that are going so all the green ropes you see here in the in the cage they will be transferred to the cages a bit later to be used as shelters this will function as a test rope that we will measure once a month for a period of time Agnes controls the growth and fertility of the brown algae although they look very similar two species have grown on the Rope planted the one the second has settled by itself the fish farmers are already convinced that the algae have only advantages or us at Hidden fi it these guys that are the main reasons these are Lum fish uh these are wild young ones that live in the seaweed that we Farm but uh we use these longfish on together with our salmon because they eat the seiz of the salmon so it natural way of taking the sealess away so instead of using chemicals or others we use these guys the habitat of the lump fish is algae the algae themselves need hardly any nutrients they are plant-like creatures that occur mainly in the sea they Thrive through photosynthesis they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and convert it into oxygen with the aid of sunlight a unique process that began 3 and a half billion years ago algae as a group have been a part of creating this world as it is today the humans have evolved because we have the right um composition of gases so we can actually live [Music] these are primary producers they can do their thing without us interfering without us feeding them and it important for our Fisheries that we have these forests because it nursing grounds for our Fisheries stocks and um if we want to use them as a resource in large amounts we have to culture them is it possible to produce our gon land a large beore reactor is operated in otob Brun near Munich at the so-called algae pilot plant of the Technical University Professor Thomas Brook cultivates nanoc chloropsis Selena a microalgae that also occurs in the [Music] sea Bavarian pretzel salt provides sea water in the plant the sunlight is imitated by modern l D technology every climate zone in the world can be simulated here mostly alaria Spain runs here that has the background that the domestic ones do not grow naturally in Bavaria very well in Spain they grow much better we could produce there all year round and in order to produce technically relevant data you have to be able to simulate this climate and that feasible here so far unique in the world secret of the green seaweed is its high oil content can it replace our oil in the future the scientist regularly monitors its optimal growth [Music] conditions this culture looks quite good continues to grow actively and so we leave it alone for a few more days before we Harvest and stress it stress stress means depriving the algae of nutrients so that they can stop growing only when it no longer grows does it produce enough oil is this where the fuel of our future flows the fact is that you have to have the interest of the industry which then really has to spend some money we are talking about tens of millions of Euros in order to set up a large Plant I believe of course that this pressure to implement climate relevant technologies will increase in the coming years so much so that we have no other option yes we know what the climate report says if we wait any longer we will be at the point where the climate tips over and then we can anymore becoming independent of oil this idea inspired the algae researcher to another groundbreaking invention a carbon fiber made of algae more stable and lighter than anything made of steel and aluminium the plate consists of carbon fiber Stone composite and is therefore completely CO2 negative in production and because we use carbon fiber brick we also need less material as you can see below you can see a small Granite plate up here underneath it is our carbon fiber in between we have a limestone this step plate is a stable as steel it flexible because the initial tension is created by the carbon fiber we also have a certain elasticity in this material so it can completely replace the steel and we also called this device minus E which then stands for negative emissions in production and operation alga oil itself could revolutionize the building materials industry with carbon fibers made from algae but the process of obtaining the coveted raw material is still too energy intensive and too expensive we have now managed to break up the algae using enzyme based technology and we are at the point where we can say we produce enough oils anyway around 60% where we have spontaneous phas separation this means that once the cell is open we carry out a short centrifugation step and then we can separate the phases by gravity this is much more energy efficient in the processing and the subsequent conversion to a fuel which was already efficient 5 years ago and whether I make diesel for cars or kerosene for aeroplanes it doesn matter anymore at the moment moment kind the dream of flying with algae gasoline has long since come true but the extraction of algae oil remains expensive the researchers are continuing to work on new processes so that it can really replace oil the Hubertus Tes in curtain in the former bronol area of bitterfeld here too scientists are looking for a substitute for fossil fuels but they going about it completely differently as in many lakes a film of algae regularly lies on the water surface in summer blue algae which release toxins in high concentrations and prohibit bathing but the researchers are happy about the algae bloom in the lake at anhalt University one of the largest algae research centers in Germany professor carola greil and her team are looking for the Super Algae it would be nice if you could have a look yes that Bloom we now try to isolate the sample from the lake here in the algae stem collection in the lake it comes in a mixture from different algae and we now try to separate algae here so that they are ready for Tech prodction her research interest is in the special ingredients of microalgae ingredients such as proteins omega-3 fatty acids and dyes are in great demand in the pharmaceutical and cosmetics Industries but algae technology is a young science not all the ingredients and properties of algae are yet known scientists assume that there are between 4 and 500,000 different algae species with a wealth of colors and shapes that seem [Music] Limitless approximately 10% of algae have been recorded in the first place and only a few microalgae are used industrially maybe four to five on a large scale and each one contains different active substances depending on their occurrence and appearance [Music] the big advantage of algae is that they grow up to 20 times faster than land plants and produce up to 30 times more fat than rape for example the researchers are particularly interested in oil the algae can be cultivated optimally under laboratory conditions the only difficulty is the high energy and water consumption to reach the ingredients however the scientist and curtain have actually taken a decisive step forward in this direction they have discovered an alga that could revive the idea of biofuels a type of algae that discharges the oil itself so it just needs to be tapped we save various treatment processes and extract the oil continuously from the algae practically during growth this is what makes it special an algae filling station that may soon be working on a large scale we don must continue along this path at the moment this is not profitable but who knows what will happen in 20 years you have to break new ground here we have developed a suitable technical system to catch this oil the so-called milking extractor we have saved 80% of the costs compared to this classic method but that enough either we must make our algae even more productive but I optimistic that we will be able to do that as a renewable raw material algae could become a real alternative to our fossil fuels a French environmental company has already taken advantage of alga hunger here algae provide fresh air in the Paris suburb of poi there is a very special advertising pillar each year it can catch one ton of CO2 the capacity of an entire Avenue of trees performance the performance in terms of CO2 uptake and oxygen production depends on the amount of CO2 present in the air for a column like this in an urban environment its oxygen capacity is equivalent to that of a few dozen trees in Industry where we have high CO2 emissions we speak of an output of over a 100 trees it all depends on the concentration of CO2 that makes the system work the column sucks in the outside air and circulates it inside 10 kilos of microalgae are distributed over 1,000 L of water LEDs in particular still provide uniform [Music] lighting future developments will use much more natural light during the day and will only be illuminated with LEDs at night our goal is to operate the device 24 hours a day 365 days a [Music] year the column is still a model experiment in a Paris suburb but already now a real Improvement in the air can be measured there is still plenty of good air to breathe in the Pharaoh Island ISS the biologist Agnes m mortensson is on her way to her breeding station in this container is the nursery of her Aly Agnes wears protective clothing because it kelp and Wing kelp the superfood of the future for her Agnes has experimented for a long time with how the spores Thrive best and how light and temperature are optimally controlled now she their growth every few days the plan is to deploy these on our farm on calbox furor in um October and um so I maintaining just keeping them alive and healthy until then because of the photosynthesis you know there in here when the light is shining on them so you can see bubbles on on the seaweed ropes the algae grow on small ropes these are later wrapped around larger ropes and sunk into the sea Agnes narrow Bay in the south of the islands she hopes to increase its production soon but already this year it was difficult to get enough helpers to spread all the fertile spores in time it season is almost over today Agnes wants to go out and harvest for the last time this year together with her brother and a helper like the ground on land the fields are also divided up and it difficult to lease land at all the rules are strict only one user is allowed per Bay if there had been a salmon farmer Agnes would not have got a license but algae and fish go well together together with her older brother Agnes founded a company in 2007 and called it tari the feres word for algae her Plantation is only a few nautical miles from the jetty you can see it right here now so this is one one of the ropes that and we have these long units so if you have the red big buoys they are one quadr we have another quadr further out and then we have our seated ropes in between that growing it huge size it quality depending on what you want to use them for so in this case everything here goes to to food production so to to people for people to eat so quality is is the is the most important part we learn new things every season and I think we have done all the mistakes that can be done so we getting there because the small boat with which they normally catch the algae is damaged someone has to get into the water and that 8° yeah he going to to you know because we have tied our uh growing ropes in between so he one at the time it working because it and so the operation is not so demanding we for bacteria for example so we want to make sure that the food we sell is not infected with uh eoli or or bacteria of that kind that can be harmful for people to eat the algae must be removed from the Water by mid June at the latest the later it gets the more polluted they become colonized by bacteria but also by other organisms this does not make them unusable but then they no longer meet Agnes standards take one of the bigger ones it salty and then it bit maybe a little bit spicy or yeah and then it also has a texture that you can chew the algae are rich in iodine magnesium calcium and proteins but are they also the answer to the big nutritional questions of the future Agnes wants to Triple the Harvest next year but there staff and money but she rejects a big investor she wants to keep her independence and wait and see how strong the company can grow on its own yeah microalgae are very adaptable they grow much faster than plants on land and especially fast when it have a lot of nutrients at their disposal like here on the Britany Coast actually this green algae is non-toxic however if it is washed ashore and dies it produces toxic hydrogen sulfide [Music] but where does that come from why is there such a big algae plague here [Music]	Success
Merapi: JavaÂs Deadly Fire Mountain | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJD8bXWb2EE	SLICE Science	[Music] [Music] Mari is one of the world volcanoes and very dangerous more than 700,000 people live around Mori for them it e evacuation takes place at level four danger maraia is famous for its pyroclastic flows it [Music] [Music] and suddenly the Mountain of Fire erupts marapi Indonesia volcano streams of lava measuring up to 800° C surge into the valley silent Insidious deadly lava chunks shatter in gigantic clouds of glowing [Music] Ash in 2010 villagers were impacted that had previously been safe the lava flows took a new Direction [Music] the old jaanese capital yakata was at risk for 6 weeks the volcano hurled redh hot chunks of lava 17 kilm Into The Valleys once again it was clear why scientists have rated marapi a high-risk volcano during this eruption alone more than 350 people were killed in Indonesian marapi means Mountain of Fire volcanologists rate it as one of the 10 most dangerous volcanoes in the world it dramatically that the consequences would be Global 25 km to the South yakata lay on the main axis of the 2010 eruption previously the lava had flowed westwards and residents had abandoned that area long ago how can scientists assess the risks from such an unpredictable volcano [Music] better the island of java with its population of 160 million lies on the Sund Ark the most active volcanic region in the world here the Indian and Australian plates are subducting under the Pacific Plate only a few centimeters each year but with dramatic effect Indonesian is Indonesia is famous for its very big eruptions for instance the Tober eruption about 75,000 years ago it almost destroyed the whole of humanity of the with the help of geoss satellites like the tandem X Mission deformations are visible from outer space they can provide evidence of dangerous tectonic shifts the data is analyzed in Laboratories such as the geosciences research center in potam for more than 20 years scientists here have been studying this high-risk volcano only recently have they detected in satellite pictures a deformation running right through through the mountain radar data shows how a crack 250 M long has formed in the volcanic plug after a sudden eruption this crack lies in exactly the same direction as an old fracture Zone if that one becomes active again it could have wide reaching consequences for volcanic activity in Central Java and explain why marapi eruptions have suddenly changed direction to obtain more precise information the scientists are planning an expedition up to the crater edge if we start to go late in the morning we cannot really see which are the most active part or what are the feature so I for the infr measurement I really prefer to have nighttime images maybe we should spend the night look here on the map somewhere here and then we this path early in the morning to look into the crater mari been dormant for 300 years but now scientists have measured seismic activity here as well [Music] volcanoes are common throughout the region scientists have discovered that they are linked deep underground marapi is the most active it usually erupts every 7 years sometimes more frequently the eruptions are generally signaled by growth in the lava Dome a lava plug composed of very thick magma solidified on the surface it has been pressed out of the vent by the pressure inside this plug can Arch over the sides of the volcano like a dome until it shatters time-lapse photography of a very similar volcano sent Helens in North America shows how lava domes grow and collapse again some of them coincide with very frequent pyroclastic flows as in the case of [Music] marapi big eruptions are generally preceded by increased Tremors for days in advance that Observatory set up by the Indonesian Geological Service in yogyata is connected to a number of seismic stations around marapi tectonic earthquakes and ones that indicate volcanic activity are recorded here around the [Music] clock our most important task is to see when the population must be evacuated for this we have a system of four warning levels there activity followed by alert increased alert and danger we employ various observation methods and the results are analyzed here in the office it information to the regional government for Thomas valter from the German geosciences Research Center in pdam the Indonesian Observatory is also an important resource it provides him with valuable data about seismic activity and possible deformations on Mount marapi we have various aims on the one hand we want to understand the changes in marabi better that issue in the past 3 or 4 years marapi has been providing a very different picture for instance we know about previous eruptions caused by tectonic earthquakes and so it to understand whether the current situation on Mount marapi is controlled by an entirely new kind of possibly reactivated Gonic zone or weak Zone that question but of course there are also technical aspects we want to develop new technical methods and test them methods we the test here for the first time to see whether they can be applied to active volcanos 5:30 in the morning they set off on the first leg of the Expedition their destination a farflung observation post in the immediate danger zone of Mount marapi the journey takes them through Villages declared high-risk areas since the last disaster this road also provides the only Escape down the valley [Music] the road ends some 4 kilm from the [Music] crater exclusion Zone from here the scientists want to measure the gaping fracture on the southern Mountain Side from a safe distance it mountain side itself they are trying to find out whether this crack really influenced the pattern of vol canic activity in recent months there have been four quite large explosions here without any warning this was unprecedented at Mount marapi the volcano now appears to be reacting even to changes in weather these explosions occur after heavy rain and we rather assume that what are called ftic eruptions that is to say by water penetrating the hot magmatic body it tries to expand but can steam that is a really new situation here at Mount marapi the observation Hut serves members of the volcanology service during periods of increased activity the German scientists are now using it as a gauging station with a 3D laser scanner they want to obtain precise images of the Topography of the volcanic crack and the lava Dome instruments like this are mostly used by Architects and civil engineers to identify damage to a building using this scanner on a volcano is something new the scientists are looking for data that would reveal cracks and changes in the structure of Mount marac laser scan the laser scanner is supposed to produce a very precise topographical elevation model to measure the crack and its depth so that we can calculate the depth to which rainwater can penetrate and where this interaction between an older magma body and water is taking place we combine that with infrared measurements which give us information about the temperature in the crack so here we are looking Direct onto the crack later we the summit and then we can better assess the interaction that is actually taking place weather keeps interrupting the research a new position Cloudy [Music] Skies we are heavily dependent on weather conditions whenever we go into the field external conditions over which we have no control we you can only reduce the frequencies here to 30 khz and that clouds we try to adapt as far as possible that the morning and start scanning as early as possible we have the best chance of good visibility in the early hours at a distance of 4 kilm the measurements don indication of the lavad DM the scientists have to ascend to the crater scans of the volcanic cone are very valuable we get a better image of this Dome and the volcano edifice up there so if I want to use this data that we get here only once it will be used in the numerical models that we will be running to infert the sources uh which run the whole process up there but if we can make another uh scan maybe uh in one month or two month something like that then we can use this second uh image that we get uh compare it to the first one that we already have then we will see the deformation that uh has been undergoing uh in this uh time interval so yeah as as you know later on we we will use this deformation to better image the sources uh which drive this process the break in the volcanic cone reaches right down into the valley within just a few years a yawning Canyon up to 250 M deep has opened up along an old tectonic crack the valley of gendal during major eruptions hundreds of pyroclastic streams bombs of lava rock and pyroclastic flows hurtle down here the most dangerous spot at the foot of of M [Music] marapi nevertheless gangs of workmen come into the natural Quarry if the volcano suddenly erupted they chance of Escape [Music] valuable Building Material gravel Earth lava rock is exposed by the force of the volcano on the edge of the valley of gendal lie deserted Villages ruins covered in just a few years by Lush vegetation the hot ash clouds that swept over the edge of the valley of gendal in late October 2010 only brushed this Village nevertheless they burned to the ground everything in their path 26 residents were killed it now lies in the exclusion Zone but life is slowly returning close to the Volcan cone on a spot that is so far proved safe the German geophysicist Berger gotfried lure has had a bunker built it lies 5 M below the surface and wouldn event of an ash flow it has another purpose by means of a broadband seismometer and undisturbed by traffic vibrations lure is able to receive signals from the depths of the Earth [Music] he measures earthquakes within some 600 kilom of the Earth surface together with many other seismometers in the region L has been able to register the increase in Quakes at a depth of 100 kilm the earthquakes follow a pattern that corresponds exactly to the Collision zone between sinking crusts and the Pacific Plate by measuring the tiny differences in speed between seismic waves the scientists were also able to identify the rising Paths of the liquids that ultimately form the magma from Mount marapi it sinking plate that penetrates the upper layers as it passes through the Earth hot mantle chemical reactions occur with the solid rock magnet a thick hot slurry of rock is only formed at a shallow level these discoveries contradict previous assumptions about the driving forces of volcanoes we especially wanted to find the magma paths and where the magma is stored we all know the image from children bladder shaped magma chamber underground and when I started here we also had this idea of a bladder that four or 5 km deep however scientists did not find a cone-shaped magma chamber under marapi or indeed under any other volcanoes they began to doubt the truth of the current hypothesis if there here where is [Music] it French scientists such as the volcanologist franois bod do are also involved in a long-term project searching for the reservoir of the highly active Mount [Music] marapi we stations here which enable us to get close to the magma and produce a precise image of its layers we the top of the crater where the eruption occurred in 2010 of course we are interested in the processes and forces that drive the magma upwards from the reservoir so that it causes an eruption the size of magma reservoirs can be an important factor in estimating the destructive potential of future eruptions one of the few methods of identifying these storage sites in the earth is still the precise analysis of earthquakes and their speed delays we have two aims first we researching basic scientific ideas we trying to understand this kind of volcano and the better we understand this system the better we can help the Indonesians that is the second a to predict the risk more accurately so that people can be evacuated in time it lives although scientists have been studying M marapi for more than 70 years their research has been slow to influence life in the shadow of the mountain many Javanese are deeply religious and Trust in good Mountain Spirits to protect their lives it volcanic eruptions on that point the scientists have to agree with the people who live [Music] here masks have been erected around marapi with surveillance cameras to observe the volcano Thomas wter wants to install some more cameras to close the gaps in this monitoring [Music] system climbing the 40 m Mast is not a job for the faint-hearted a colleague from the volcano Observatory offers to perform this dangerous [Music] operation when when visibility is good a camera like this can contribute a little to the system of disaster protection and it gives the scientists from potam in Far Away Germany direct access to current data at the moment we of being able to process the data in real time for instance by defining various categories distinguishing an eruption from a CL and recording movements in the Dome on the summit that which we can base geophysical research series of photos from the cameras are especially useful for showing how lava movements develop that enables scientists to estimate for instance the mass that is moving and to forecast future cracks in the dome total camera surveillance also provides another benefit roads Bridges and river valleys are closely observed that means that the destructive force of the dreaded mud flows called Lahar can be estimated immediately lahas often occur during active phases when volcanic ash combines with heavy rains they form suddenly usually one has only a few minutes warning and then only when a laa is spotted somewhere when marapi erupts the destructive slurry sometimes flows right into the center of [Music] yogyata more than 600,000 people live in the city where only a few suburbs have so far been declared danger [Music] zones officials say it evacuate Yukata the sultanate with its gajja Mada University is an important spiritual center in Indonesia its residents don in the shadow of marapi this is also one of Java zones in 2006 a disastrous Quake killed more than 5,700 people in the region part of Indonesia temple tranan also collapsed as an immediate result of those Tremors an eruption of Mount marapi which was occurring at the same time increased three-fold in strength the scientists working on the edge of the crater Al also have to consider the danger of a sudden earthquake before starting their climb they check once again for any signs of possible volcanic [Music] activity I assume that it moment none of the instruments show anything unusual however that can change quickly we important because early indications of change which we call precursors are sometimes very late in occurring that means changes can Ur within a few hours or even minutes and that communicate which is why we keep radio contact with the observatory Around the [Music] Clock the north side of RI from here the only path providing access to the summit the scientists have to climb, 1300 M to reach a plateau where they will spend the [Music] night they hire a dozen Indonesian bearers to transport technical equipment and food this you can and this is heavy heavy for everybody it with an uncertain outcome they don 3,000 M they will be entering an area in which there explosive eruptions the weather begins to turn clouds descend onto the summit when the Expedition reaches 2,000 M the vegetation becomes thinner the group of scientists with less to carry arrives more quickly via an old crater Edge they still have 1,000 M to climb before they reach the summit [Music] the peak is shrouded in mist and this doesn visibility it also muffles sound so that they as they climbed in the cloud half an hour later the group of bearers also looms up out of the Mist [Music] at the base of the Summit is a geological station belonging to the volcano Observatory it was completely destroyed during the last eruption a short distance away there small Plateau the Pasa bbra it is stwn with chunks of lava rock this is where the scientists want to set up their base camp for one night it would be dangerous to stay any longer the arduous climb takes its toll they need another 10 hours to reach the summit on the North side they also urgently need good weather to carry out their research at the crater [Music] you can perhaps vaguely make out in the distance how steep the mountain side is at this point those are Mora volcanic dmes and this area here hasn been covered by new lava streams for a long time mainly by very explosive eruptions which are very rare here between us and the summit area there are also some larger chunks which offer protection and this area has proved relatively safe this is certainly no spot for a camping holiday the local people tell me that they usually only come this far and no further unless absolutely necessary one definitely shouldn on the summit and we minimum tomorrow they check their equipment before the final Ascent using a simple camera drone they want to photograph the crater from above that should provide them with 360° images of the lava D from which they can deduce its condition and volume however the upward current is not very strong besides they don the quadricopter will react to The Thermals in the crater at least it flying the conditions are unfavorable we have poor visibility so we can the Drone very well from a distance or see what position it [Music] as a backup in case of strong thermals the scientists are relying on a helium balloon it has proved its worth on previous Expeditions in Chile and on Kamchatka it can also be used for flying a camera over the crater however the gas cylinders are much too heavy to carry up onto the crater so the balloon is inflated at the base camp the heavy Cloud Has Lifted without them even noticing rapid changes in weather are common up here for a short while the Pasar bbra Plateau becomes visible before Fading Into the brief Sunset three members of the Expedition have climbed down again to The Valleys to gather firewood even this close to the equator the temperature drops to 5° C at night they plan to set out for The Summit in the middle of the night to be able to start work on the crater Before Dawn at 7 Minutes p 2 the seismic instruments at the Jaa observation station register unusual movements they the Pasa bura Plateau then the Indonesian observation post sounds the all clear the minor Tremors were probably caused by humans in the vicinity of the geological station it was the members of the Expedition who started their Ascent to the summit shortly after 2:00 the hardest part lies ahead loose scree from from cooled chunks of lava in the dark they can hardly see how steep it is they can only feel it the group must stay as close together as possible any stragglers could be struck by loosened chunks of Rock the balloon group can hardly keep up the balloon may be light but it Aid to maneuver up the Steep Mountain Side just over an hour later they catch their first glimpse of the valley to the South the city of yakata above which Mount marapi soes forbiddingly shortly afterwards they arrive at the crater edge the scientists start setting up their instruments I think conditions are ideal we distance you can see first light I think in half an hour the sun will rise you see yakata the city the Sea of Lights surrounding this mountain is incredible that area and the conditions are very good for gauging there still a bit too norly ideally it will turn so that we can float the balloon over the crater the infrared expert has to begin his temperature gauging Before Sunrise only then is the data useful when it sunlight he makes a photo series comprising hundreds of images later when put together they will provide a very precise idea of the lava clearly visible that penetrates the Dome causing dangerous gas explosions whereas the surface is really cold the body of the volcano is permeated with hot [Music] zones in daylight the huge dimensions of the crater become visible it diameter half of that is the lava D which Rises 80 m above the bottom of the crater a mixture comprising mainly Steam and sulfur thrusts upwards from a depth of several kilometers and escapes through the [Music] crack at Sunrise the scientists start their fieldwork on the dangerously narrow rim to climb down into the crater itself is out of the question no nobody knows how stable the lava Dome currently is the laser scanner is brought into position the whole team has been waiting for this moment with baited breath the scanner measures a cloud comprising some 5 million individual points each with its exact three-dimensional position never before has the surface structure of a volcanic crater been recorded with this degree of precision the scientists are especially interested in the structures of the lavadar at what points is the dangerous plug unstable where is there a threat of new eruptions the scanner appears to be recording usable data it is providing an exact measurable view into the crack to a depth of some 40 m [Music] ideally one would of course return several times with the scanner that we have here every six months or once a year it depends on the activity and the changes to the dome but we can also do quite a lot with just one scan we can measure the directions and cracks The Depths and structures and what parts of them are potentially unstable or perhaps how this crack will develop where it will open up more and in what direction yeah uh Let It Go please Let it go Let it go I way during the morning the wind increases 20 knots wind Force 5 the head of the Expedition decides in favor of the helium balloon instead of the Drone the combination of kite and balloon is especially designed to keep steady even in a gale well that anyway cameras are attached to the lower wing they bird crater but the wind keeps forcing the balloon in the wrong direction it to control and not be swept along with it [Music] there visibility nevertheless after more than a thousand shots the images are what they for this is the first complete look into the crater since the lava D cracked together with the laser scans and infrared images these photos will provide the scientists with an extremely valuable image of the lavadome system the general growth of laves is already quite well known and understood what we don collapse the prevailing wisdom is that a lavadome occurs as the result of thick magma and that the sides break away as the result of new magma covering it but Mori is a good case in point which shows that it complicated where for instance external influences such as changes in weather strong rainfall or tectonic earthquakes also lead to the breaking of lavad DS and that of lava D for instance a combination of lava D fracturing with what we call Ash flows and then earthquakes can forecast because earthquakes for instance can need for more research to try and assess that kind of combination in advance the balloon can only be recovered about midday the scientists have been on their feet for 12 hours they hope to reach the valley again in the late afternoon I actually everything went well we gathered data and that the wind was rather strong and the balloon is a combination of balloon and kite we could hardly keep hold of it well we did keep hold of it but the problem was getting it down again the Drone is very complimentary to this helikite the helikite is more stable when it the winds are so strong drone is okay in Winds of up to about 15 knots here they are much stronger we would simply lose the Drone so we didn it we are coming down it will take months before the data has all been analyzed but in potam even the provisional results indicate that the Expedition has been successful if this bit here is actually a small crater and becomes unstable because of the crack it that risk well the valley is open here down to the left right and here we have and here a bit has slipped broken away and frankly I see these two Shadow areas there is definitely a hole there it could be an explosion crater is I think it explosion crator yeah like this one because you don of the material so if this was just a lateral collapse you would see an area where this material is accumulated but apparently it so it mhm mhm we never able to observe a dome breaking up and as far as I know nobody in the world has been able to do that but because We examined it shortly after a large eruption and possibly before another one this is very valuable data if this is an unstable structure we infrared gauging if there are temperature changes here usually that would indicate that there there uh yeah this is the the most hot or the hottest part at the time of the survey and here this white color is very bright color represent high temperature I measured above 150 celus at the time of of the survey so this hot temperature this is exactly at the place where we think another fracture has formed yeah what Dome itself is really cold and a cold Dome gets blocked up or ultimately forms a plug in the volcano the danger of course is that it eruptions the research doesn produce snapshots of the most dangerous part of the volcano it also clearly shows that observing the lava plays a pivotal role in assessing the risk however one key question about marapi has not been answered how much magma lies hidden in the depths in other words how much more dangerous can this volcano become very little usable data Rises to the surface gases and steam from the deep layers the magma chamber that scientists have long been searching for under mount marapi appears not to exist instead the analysis of comprehensive data indicates an anomaly a zone that dramatically differs from the normal state of the Earth crust in an extensive experiment we constructed 20 stations in Central Java and measured earthquake waves we then analyzed this data and discovered to our surprise a Zone in the Earth reduced extraordinarily greatly reduced seismic speeds that is to say the speed of the earthquake waves is very greatly reduced in this Zone everything that is red here covering the whole of Central Java a volume of some 50,000 km it ever found a gigantic Zone reaching 40 km into the Earth the volcanoes including marapi are cited in this area contrary to previous Notions of magma Chambers there fluids rise causing the rock to melt and resulting in distinct layers in the crust this completely new model is confirmed by other [Music] volcanoes whether the anomaly becomes greater or smaller we can have to repeat the experiment from surveys in Kamchatka we know that these anomalies change in combination with eruptions after an eruption they weak but before the next eruption they build up again and become relatively strong here in Central Java scientists are confronted with a puzzle they can yet solve the fact that it the surface at various points is clearly visible steaming ferals mud pots are only one indication of the danger that could be lurking here Underground comparable to what scientists call super volcanoes which could destroy life on Earth yellow Yellowstone as always mentioned in South America there are some similar big reservoirs magma reservoirs in the depths but the volume that has been observed here at marapi is even greater than those is marapi on the way to becoming a super volcano whose eruption could have disastrous consequences for the whole world that scientists to [Music] predict we don eventually become a super volcano we have lots of data about volcanoes in general but very little information about how an active volcano becomes a super volcano we know for instance very little about the size of the magma Reservoir and the processes that occur there the Mountain of Fire at the foot of which people have lived for Generations farming raising animals this mountain was only comprehensible in the past to people who understood the spirits humans made contracts with them for the volcano to leave them in peace even today are extraordinarily casual about the risk posed by living in the shadow of Mount [Music] Mori three harvests each year the ancestors who are buried here a good climate those are all good arguments that persuade many residents to remain I come here as a son scientist and I don demand that people clear out that for me to say there warning chain but I wouldn spirits and mystical models that have developed as empirical models over the centuries without being able to replace them with something better we have to be convincing as scientists and the process of convincing people is evident here the people increasingly take us and our statement seriously and incorporate them after the last big eruption it was possible to rescue hundreds of thousands of people from the ashcloud that has improved the status of the scientists among locals in the volcano Observatory there is regular discussion between scientists and the Emergency Services the geoscientists from Germany also on their results to the Indonesians after every survey Expedition these are often just small pieces in the puzzle but they can help understand the mountain and its dangers better but you see very clearly this nov 18 here here place an imp placement of camera new research techniques such as laser scanning could in the future regularly be used to predict the danger of gas explosions and pyroclastic flows more accurately so in the perfect case you would want to walk all the way around to the other side of the CR scan from there combine both of the scans and have a full view but of course that is very difficult in the field working together with Scientists from abroad is very important whether it occurs at quiet times or in crisis because it us here to really predict Mora activity a massive eruption with global consequences that scenario is quite feasible at Mount marapi but in spite of all the research the question of when and whether it will happen is one of the secrets that the Mountain of Fire still refuses to [Music]	Success

vessels on the sea are cut in half and and lengthened with an entirely new section undergoing a new and complex process called jumbo [Music] [Music] [Music] isation palmo Sicily buzzes with the intoxicating mix of cultures that is a result of its Domination by the Greek Roman Arab and Spanish civilizations over the last 3,000 years famous for the influence of Mafia gangsters it globe for its beautiful beaches breathtaking scenery and complex history palmo is not only a well visited location for tourists it is a major Italian trading Port Dawn Rises at the construction site where fincantieri engineers and ship experts are hard at work moving tens of thousands of metric tons with near laser Precision we M wide with a height of 50 m from the bottom to deck 11 with the tolerance of just a few millimeters overall F Jolly skito system has raised 15,000 metric tons after the enlargement of the ship she will have an added capacity of about 500 passengers making even bigger ships is Big Business this construction site is owned and operated by fin cantieri which builds some of the largest ships across the globe fin cantieri is in the business of constructing cruise ships barges and Military vessels here in palmo the company has pioneered a ship recycling program to meet demand for bigger and bigger vessels for the lucrative Cruise industry in the process they have created a thriving New Market for upgraded [Music] ships the Renaissance program is a massive engineering project the lengthening of four ships for Mediterranean Shipping Company MSC each of these four ships the MSC armonia Symphonia Opera and lria are undergoing the jumo isation process due to be completed by the end of 2015 the repairs and enlargement division that does what you can see behind me is just one of the divisions of finti [Music] the shipyards here in palmo have got the technique down to a fine [Music] art the tools used to lengthen a ship once cut in half are massive movers skid shoes are like a hydraulic train that moves along steel rails on which the carriages are pushed horizontally by hydraulic levers acting on the sleepers the skid Sho system is computer controlled and powered by diesel fuel packs each unit has the capacity to lift more than 1,000 metric tons these particular skid shoes are a brand new design by The Fad joli engineering department before the jumbo isation process in the Palo docks foli delivered into the yard no less than 22 skid shoes and built three rails to hold the wide Hull of the cruise liner as it was being cut in two the weight of the front half of the ship is supported by vertical cylinders and each skid shoe is able to support 1,000 tons getting the ship resting on skid shoes however involved a lengthy Preparatory process first the dry dog had to be emptied using massive pumps the operation took a whole day once the dry dock was empty the skid shoes on which the ship would rest and then be pulled apart once sliced through had to be positioned at the bottom of the dock and the electrical parts removed before the dock was flooded the amazing process of jump ization starts with the creation of the new segment of the ship that has to be positioned in such a way that on the big day the whole process goes according to plan in May 2015 the fincantieri yard successfully floated a new segment that was to be used to lengthen the MSC Cruise liner Opera the new segment specially built to lengthen the ship was first ceremonially floated proving that it would contribute to the buoyancy of the lengthened ship and then positioned in the dock where the massive Opera was to rest for the time of its complex high-tech lengthening surgery philipo Odo is the fincantieri Y director and has been working on the jumbo isation of ships in palmo Sicily for decades this Dry Dock has a capacity of 400,000 cubic M it Mediterranean Sea to give you an idea it surfaces four football pitches in length it allows us to do this process that we because it is wide enough as I before to allow the new section to be moved next to the ship if it were narrower we could not do this this is the reason why we used this dock in the past as well for this kind of [Music] operation once all was ready the dock could be filled again slowly so as not to move the skid shoes as soon as the dock was full the massive cruise ship could be sailed in it was carefully positioned over the skid shoes and the dry dock was emptied once more the the ship and the new segment slowly sank to the bottom of the dock and the ship rested snugly on the skid shoes that would become its operating table the first thing we did in the dock before the ship arrived at the dry dock was to put the skid shoes in place that point the dock was flooded so the skid shoes were merged underwater thanks to this the ship could be sailed into the dock and positioned onto the skid shoes as the dock was emptied at this point once it was settled the dock was completely emptied of water until dry this is an operation that has been done many times in these yards a speciality developed here since the 1980s the Poo yards has a lot of experience the first enlargement process was done in 1980 to lengthen the V Vera and over the years we have done several others this enlargement process of the MSC Opera is the 27th operation in the series the next will be applied to the last of the four msse ships in the Renaissance program with the MSC LCA it will close the cycle of the enlargement of MSC ships the MSC Opera is 21.25 M long and 28.8 M wide and when fully operational hosts 2,199 passengers offering 878 cabins and Suites luxury bars a theater a casino shops and many other attractions with a new segment slaughtered into the middle the capacity will increase to 2,700 passengers which means that the ship will have to carry more food and offer yet more services it is just one of the hundreds of massive cruise ships that Grace the ocean waves offering vacations to a market of 22.2 million people with a turnover of 39.6 bill billion dollar it is a growing tourism segment but not without its own safety issues on the 13th of January 2012 the giant cruise ship Costa Concordia crashed into the rocks of the island of jilo in the Tuscan archipelago leading not only to the world operation but also to criminal and civil trials in which the safety of these Mega ships was questioned American lawyer John EES was one of the most outspoken critics of the cruise industry you know this industry has continued to just grow bigger and bigger and bigger Coast Concord is not even the largest ship the largest ship uh is a 6,000 uh passenger vessel the problem here is that is that these ships are topheavy they do this for profit because they know that they can sell a balcony space for much more than they can sell a space under or below the waterline however fin cantieri ship Builders say tests on the structural Integrity of the ships they have stretched prove that these ships are not weakened by jumbo isation safety is not an issue in ship lengthening the lengthened ship has to satisfy strength criteria and resistance distresses that it will encounter during its life at Sea exactly like any other ship so from the resistance point of view it makes no difference whether this is a lengthen ship or a ship originally built with these Dimensions has just delivered one of the 10 largest cruise ships in the world to its clients princess Cruisers the Regal Princess and other massive liners regularly come off the production line at these types of shipyards around Italy from triest to palmo if you were to compare the construction work we do here at the Poo site with the construction of new ships the first thing you would notice is the timing to construct a new ship from the very beginning to when it take to the sea with passengers would take at least 2 and 1/2 years here we ask estimate even When taking into consideration the work of Engineers that we can finish the ship in 9 months the jumbo isation process cuts down on costs resources and the years of Labor that it would take to build new cruise ships the current series of four cruise ships that fin cantieri is working on will cost €200 million E when complete that cost of building a single new cruise ship like the Regal Princess which carries a price tag of up to a billion [Music] e stretching an already massive liner takes equally huge lifting and pulling machines this is the MSC Opera one of the finest cruise ships to sail the Seas built in 2003 in mares France that just 10 years after launch she is ready to be lengthened to host yet more passengers is an indication of how fast the cruise industry is growing she is about ready to go under the knife here in the Palo Dry Dock [Music] engineers and technicians are tightening the cables and positioning the skid shoes that hold her in place as preparations get underway Ela she is about 250 M long and after it lengthening process she will be about 275 M long the new section is about 25 M long the beam Remains the Same of course and is about 29 M the MSC Opera is 59,0 58 gross tons which refers not to its real weight but to its cargo transport capacity and so its potential commercial value while the ship skid shoes have to lift and carry Transport company foli supplied fin cantieri with skid shoes and trailers to do this heavy lift job the team on site is led by Loris janini the skito system combines both lifting and transport the lifting function is done with hydraulic jacks which take on the vertical weight and are therefore able to provide vertical lift the skid shoes also have another hydraulic system that allows them to apply a horizontal sliding action once settled in the dry dock the engineers ordered it to be cut in two and prepared for the new midship block to be inserted the new segment was built in the fin cantieri yards over the past 5 months so as to keep the Opera working on the cruise routes while it waited for its Mega stretch building a new chunk of ship to add to a vessel that was not built here was problematic but before fincantieri could begin construction on a new midsection they had to be absolutely sure of the ship specifications for this they had to go back to the original plans and Technical documents of the [Music] ship Andrew tozo is the project manager in fanti he is looking over the vessel technical documents to be absolutely sure of its measurements and specifications he oversees the logistics behind the massive jumbo isation operation and makes sure that things run smoothly with over a hundred workers on the job the operation starts with the examination of technical documents that were made by the ship Builder this is a ship that wasn constructed initially by finti so we have to ask the ship technical documents in order to start the project obviously before the ship arrives the construction site has already completed construction of the ship is completed in every way the ventilation system the electrical wires the cabins the bathroom boxes it will be completely finished so that in the end all we will need to do is connect the forward and rear fa of the new segment only once we documents can we start our part of the project so on the basis of those documents we before we can begin constructing the new section and as we be compared to a single blade of grass against a whole football pitch we can just sort of guess or hope that the original plans are sufficiently precise and don construction so once we the prelim minary documents we go on board to carry out final checks to validate the initial data and only then can we put together the whole [Music] project the new section was fitted with all the necessary specifications so that the ship would be continuous from bow to stern the new section was 25 M long each ship gets a c made segment to insert it beams and frames that need to be cut a cruise ship like the Opera is connected together by a maze of electric wires Hydraulics plumbing and ventilation ducts that need to be sliced and [Music] rebuilt in addition to cutting the beams and decks of the ship and the hole of the ship all the wires that run throughout the ship are cut on the same line the electrical wires will need to be reconnected so as to run through the entire ship and they will be tagged with a code to enable this connection we talking about around 2,000 wires that are cut marked and then reconnected the same happens with the pipes and the ventilation conduits like every ship first the double ke was laid and then as it grew before the eyes of the engineers that built it it assumed the qualities of a viable floating vessel the new section was built to the same specifications as the ship it would go into and of course the construction materials and tools were state-of-the-art light and transportable it took about 5 months to complete the segment with the utilities and Furnishings that match the rest of the ship at the end of construction it was duly blessed in the presence of the local authorities the new section of the ship was fitted with the 2,000 electrical wires and plumbing pipes so that when the ship was extended an extra 25 M all of the systems would connect the ship before enlargement has a gross tonnage of 60,000 tons and after it terms of displacement so the real weight of the ship will be from 30,000 tons to 32,500 tons the whole extent of the increased weight comes from the new section in that 5 months the new section was completely outfitted with carpets cabins and bathrooms [Music] the jumbo isation process is fast and efficient so the ship can be returned to commissioned Service as soon as [Music] possible also for the cutting of the ship well we can split it up into two phases all the preparations for lighting the blowtorch and cutting the ship start when they remove all the fittings when we say fittings we mean the cabins the beds the mattresses the bathrooms the carpets once all these things are all removed we get down to the raw metal of the ship once the ship was stripped to its iron frame metal workers marked a precise plan for cutting the ship by referring to the original technical documents of the vessel experts measured the plating and beams in order for them to be cut with precise laser accuracy a physical m Mark was made on The Cutting line Where Metal Workers would go in with blowtorches and melt the metal apart after this process Opera was ready to be stretched sitting snugly in the massive Dry Dock of poo Sicily resting on skid shoes that not only took the load but also would later be used to move the bow and Stern sections of the ship apart the side of the ship or actually all the flat surfaces are cut semi-automatically there are machines that are positioned so that the cut can be carried out automatically using normal asling torches basically with the same asling blow torches that are very common the curved parts of the ship the round bulbous parts are cut by hand by experienced metal workers not all the areas that need to be cut are easily accessible some of the spaces are very cramped but workers squeeze together and work for hours to finish the project on schedule the number of people needed on the ship depends on how many people can work in the same space without interfering with each other also because the ship isn cut to be able to preserve the ship structural Integrity it special sequence you can the ship mously so basically we have about 40 people all cutting a particular section at the same time and that process should usually take around four days as the sun set over the port of palmo the dry do was a buzz with workers ready to perform a massive nighttime stretching operation the MSC Opera was about to undergo an incredible upgrade in this huge dry do construction site where it had been cut in half workers had verified the original technical documents of the ship and were about to proceed with the first stages of jumbo isation after these checks they could be certain that the new section would fit into place with absolute Precision the bow of the ship slid forward ready for operations the next day once lengthened she would be able to sail the waters with as much ease and with the same fluid dynamics and physics as she had as a shorter ship the Italian company fed Jolie works all over the world providing heavy lifting services for both commercial marine and land operations foli and Finn cantieri have taken on a massive lift project together to stretch a cruise liner while jumbo isation sounds simple in theory lifting and transporting these massive loads is a complicated job foli became involved in the jumbo isation process that consists of cutting the ship in half in two sections one of those parts was then supported by the foli skidding system that proceeded to move it 28 M this task was combined with another lifting system the spmt to insert the segment between the two extremities once this additional segment was added the part of the ship that had been skidded 28 M was then moved back [Music] 4 days after the ship was cut in half the fji skid shoes began their slow work Engineers made sure that the skid shoes were working at the same speed so as to provide an even Force along the whole Hull it took 6 hours for a gaping hole to appear here on the ship where the new segment could be slipped in over the next [Music] day when the cut was completed we began operations and took the weight of the ship on the skid shoes and the bow of the ship was lifted with 22 skid shoes with 1,000 ton capacity each in all the foli skidding system lifted 15,000 tons the two most critical technologies that foli provided for the jumbo isation project were the skid shoes and the spmt transportation and lifting machines spmt stands for self-propelled modular transporter they are specialized trailers that allow for the distribution of heavy weights over a large area they are used worldwide for moving oversized non-detachable super structure caros they have a powerful engine and hydraulic pumps and must have fast response for synchronized steering and lifting both systems that we in our operations here the skit shoes and the spms guarantee all of the six degrees of freedom so they allow obviously the horizontal advancement the transverse movement and also as we vertical lift spms like these are widely used all over the world for this ability to position heavy loads with all 6° of movement it technologies that can position these loads in tight spaces a single operator can control the spmt lifting and lowering heav heavy loads vertically as well as moving them forward in reverse and side to side on top of all that they allow for the rotation with respect to the three axes all the different directions of movement are covered by the systems we are using the purpose of all this is to make sure we can align the additional section with the MSC ships sections with millimetric precision spms can carry a load of over 10 metric tons per square meter this ability to hold a mass distributed over a large area is crucial when transporting loads so heavy they can crush the ground and crack the concrete underneath we can move huge structures offloading very little weight onto the ground so keeping within the boundaries of what the surface can sustain although the spmt can take a uniform weight distributed across a large area they also have the ability to be taken apart so that each axle is its own individual unit the separate units can be locked together from the front and the back to build an individual train-like transportation system or they can be locked side by side to allow for extra strength and stabilization the bmts can be placed together both one in front of the other and also side by side for today operations we can put together 80 axles the weight of the new section was too large for the spmt to be able to move it so we chose the skidding system utilizing the skid shoes meanwhile the additional segment had a relatively low weight so we could use the spms alone the MSC Opera sits in the dry dock of the bustling Italian port city of [Music] palmo the ship has been cut and the bow moved forward 28 M however before Andrew too gives the order to insert the new section the yard takes advant anage of the Gap in the ship to fill it with fittings that otherwise would be too large to be inserted through the existing doors and Port holes an extraordinary refit is underway while the ship waits for its extra length of Hull the ship consists and is constructed as an iron or rather a steel structure and inside we find the fittings so when the passengers arrive they don the carpets and go into their cabins the objects that we put in the ship are mostly small objects so they can be brought aboard the ship through any normal door or temporarily removed window which is easy many of the ship of boxes that can be pre-built and pre-loaded to keep construction on the ship at a minimum then when we think about the boxes such as the bathroom boxes when the passengers enter they baths and sinks these are built out of fiberglass and are put together on land the yard inserts oversized items such as bathroom boxes at this stage but even if other bulky units need to be mounted after the ship has been sealed shut several different methods can be attempted here we have two possibilities the first possibility if we enlargement is to see how much we can load when the three blocks of the ship are separate if this is impossible we make a temporary opening in the ship Hull we Hull to load the material the new new section pre-fabricated with all the utilities already installed sat on eight massive trailers ready to be slipped in each trailer had 80 wheels that could pivot independently 180° the spmt could also lift the new section to ensure millimetric Precision while sliding it in the skid shoes had moved the bow forward 28 m enough for the amazing spmt trailers to slide the new segment into the new space slowly the massive wheels of the trailers began to move then after a few meters they rotated bringing the new section in line with the rest of the ship everything had been precalculated like a gigantic tight curve an error of judging distance could leave the new section stuck on the corner of the cut ship then the ship needed to be pulled back together again once again the fat joli skidoes began their Herculean task of moving the ship section had been inserted once again the operation had to be carefully monitored so that the skid shoes moved at the same speed uniformly Shifting the section to connect with the rest of the ship with millimetric Precision here the hydraulic elevators came into play to bring the edges of the sliced beams and Hull to perfectly connect with the new segment how do we attach two metal plates together with the welder obviously but it could be an electrode or with a wire depending on the technique being used what distance between these two plates that I can physically weld together only a few millimet so imagine cutting a ship that as we a height of 50 m from the bottom to the 11th Deck with a margin of aor of just a few millimeters in order for the welder bead to connect each separate piece of metal both pieces must be close together the closer together the cleaner and the stronger the welder obviously the hull must be watertight so the Ws must be perfect all the way around the ship here in the bustling Port City of palmo fin cantieri Shipyard workers are busy working on the jumbo isation of the MSC Opera now that the ship is once again a single unit the furnishings and final utilities have to be completed once the ho of the ship is reconnected that ship the bow of the ship the new section and the stern so once the hole and the decks have been put back together we have to reconnect the plumbing the electrical wires and we have to test these systems that were taken apart due to the cut the ship has been stretched with surgical precision and now the workers can get on board and begin turning it into a functioning Cruise liner again the scars of recent surgery are visible but soon the ship will get a new paint job as well most passengers will never know the cruise liner they are on was once a miniature version of itself as the cruise industry grows and the ships get bigger vital questions have Arisen about the safety of thousands of passengers inhabiting these massive floating hotels far from the seashore the second problem with these ships is that they designed to keep you shopping on board to keep you gambling on board to keep you entertained and and using the inside of the vessel and so it becomes ath in an accident these ships uh become a trap the new hydraulic and electrical systems must be tested while the ship is in the dry dock before they are tested at Sea if the systems fail at Sea it could be very difficult for the company to return the ship to the dry do to continue work the ship builders respon responsibility is to ensure the structural solidity of the ship says the finer yard director filipo [Music] utto the plant is tested in the dock before the sea tests to ensure that the ship works the structural aspect of enlarging a ship is the most interesting part of the process because we have to think about how we will be able to enlarge something and make it function as though it were originally built to that length in the SE test we have to verify the maneuverability of the ship which has changed due to its having been lengthened from its original size the propulsion and control systems are tested speed tests are carried out to see how the ship behaves after the lengthening process the ship returns to the dock we complete the last activities and the ship is delivered [Music] there is still much work to be done to make the MSC Opera into a viable seagoing vessel and only many weeks later is the ship ready for service fin cantieri meanwhile has found a fast lowcost solution to keeping Cruise companies competitive by stretching ships and increasing the number of passengers they can carry heavy lift and massive Naval engineering are probably the least known part of the cruise business but they are a reliable support partner when it comes to keeping the industry afloat we the forces that the sea exerted on the original structure will inevitably change so the structural verifications are definitely the most chenging aspect of the process so how did we commence we tried to keep the dimensions of the new section such that we can minimize the changes on the existing ship the thickness and amount of Steel on the new stump section had to be enough to withstand the stress exerted upon it from the weight of the stern and the bow on either side then we made the structural modifications of the existing ship we need to ensure that the new modified ship will have the same structural Integrity as the ship had before before the ships of the Renaissance program can be used in service they must undergo a series of sea trials to prove their strength and seaworthiness this whole process from the time the ship is put in the dry dock until we can send it back out again lasts N9 weeks the stretched MSC Opera Cruise liner will take to the Sea as a completely rejuvenated ship ready to take on the fierce competition MSC Cruisers has only 5% of the world offer bigger ships at a fraction of the cost of building a new one after the enlargement of the ship she will have an added capacity of about 500 passengers so basically the owner of the ship after four enlargement processes is able to Embark as many passengers as if he had a new ship it brings results but the tolerance or margin of error is very small this whole jumbo isation process of the for ships in the series cost €200 million EUR overall this includes the cost of engineering for all for ships and customized work that needs to be done specifically on each ship overall the project costs €200 [Music] million the cruise ship industry may be controversial but the technology behind jumbo isation is truly remarkable the lifting and moving of tens of thousands of metric tons and cutting metal ships that are 50 m tall utilizes the most modern of Technologies recycling ships to make them brand new gives them added capacity to hold hundreds of extra passengers that saves years of work and hundreds of millions of Euros in resources although the tourism business will always need new cruise ships undoubtedly the process of putting these ships under the knife will continue almost certainly there will be more jumbo I a

Antonov An-225: The World's Largest Plane | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aQeV_EdvOQ	SLICE Science	[Music] a red Sun rises over Goose Bay New Finland the world refueling on the tarmac on its way from Berlin to Edmonton with a single piece of cargo a 151 ton heat boiler the only plane capable of lifting such a heavy object is the Antonoff a225 as six turbofan jet engines begin to spin a deafening hum fills the air technicians make their last checks on the massive cargo and Pilots prepare for takeoff the air catches the wings and the giant takes to the skies the a225 is unmatched and unrivaled a heavy weight in the heavy lift sector [Music] more than a quarter of a century has passed since the maiden Flight of the a225 since then the legendary cargo aircraft has broken hundreds of world records and transported some of the largest loads known to man across the globe over a quarter of a century in operation it has moved more than 21,000 tons worth of the widest varieties of caros imaginable from machines and parts to even animals well no larger planes have been created so far that it I think it create such a plane and when need sufficient experience with large planes because it task it is part of the tester if you are scared this means this is not your professional our planes have such characteristics and opportunities that they can be marketed throughout the world the boundaries of Ukraine and even of the former Soviet Union are too narrow for them Kiev the great City on the dapra river is the capital of Ukraine which stretches from the frontiers of Poland and Hungary to Russia and the Black Sea until Independence in 1991 Ukraine was part first of Russia then of the Soviet Union it was here that after World War II the Soviet government decided to locate one of its prime strategic Industries cargo planes the Russians were the first to experiment long-distance flight using giant planes such as this tupolev and 20 a record-breaking aircraft powered by no less than seven engines the Germans developed a powered glider for heavy transport duties during World War I the mesas smid 323 gigant or giant the world was getting HST Mega planes well before the antinoff design Bureau was founded the antinoff design Bureau was built around one of Russia aircraft designers alak Antonov the state owned everything however so when alak antinoff pioneered record-breaking aircraft in the 1960s he continued to be just an aircraft designer his team grew and eventually was able to control contr production of the aircraft in its own factories Maria started with rusan the a124 plane it was a Plane desided by o covic Antonov a124 rusland and the idea that gave rise to our Dream also belonged to Antonov everything changed as the world was changing in Soviet times we were dealing with with Aviation tasks which were financed entirely by the state the planning was centralized the government gave us tasks telling us what to do it provided funds and this is how the planes were constructed during the Cold War years the antinoff design Bureau came up with solutions to Russia transport troops and weapons long distances at high speed while the USA was producing the locked C130 Hercules Antonoff designed and built the a22 a long-distance transport plane that was the largest of its kind on the market at the time the world was already full of large aircraft American millionaire and pilot Howard Hughes paid for the largest flying boat ever built which still holds the record for the widest wingspan the Spruce Goose it flew only once Boeing converted its War Productions into building civilian planes and the largest airliner of the time the Boeing 747 the 747 took to the air in 1970 while the US Air Force ordered a number of large planes to transport military equipment Halfway Around the World such as the C5 Galaxy there seemed no limit to the size of the plane as long as it had enough power and enough lift in the Wings Over the years anono adopted the Jet Engine and built faster and larger planes for the Soviet military and tested new Concepts such as the a72 with its over-wing engines that increase lift however when the US Air Force began deploying its long-distance C5 Galaxy transports Antonov and the Soviet Union realized that in case of War they would have to move just as much military material as far and as fast design of the then largest transport aircraft in the world began the a124 rousan or as NATO knew it the CAC it flew for the first time in December 1982 the 1980s were marked by increased rivalry between the USA and Russia in space too NASA carried out experiments in space but also contributed to the USA Defense Initiative a wall of anti-missile technologies that it was claimed took the teeth out of the Soviet threat in an arms race that eventually broke the back of the Soviet economy the Russian space shuttle baptized the Bordan played a key role built in 1988 when Ukraine was still a part of the Soviet Union the a225 aircraft still operates from the original site of the antinoff factory and headquarters here outside Kiev only 25 years ago the city was a major industrial center in the Soviet Union here Soviet Engineers of the Antonoff design Bureau put together the largest military cargo plane of the time the a124 rousan and then were ordered to adapt it to carry the Soviet Union space shuttle the [Music] ban after the end of World War II the USA and the Soviet Union VI to break records in space although the Russians were the first to successfully send a satellite then a cosmo not into space the Americans put a man on the moon and advanced space technology through a Strategic Defense Initiative dubbed Star Wars which included massive funding for NASA program Russia meanwhile used the Space Race to develop its first intercontinental ballistic missiles the Russian space shuttle flew its first and only space flight on the 15th of November 19 1988 but just as the Americans used a jumbo jet to carry theirs the Soviets too needed a big plane to carry Bordan they asked Antonov for a solution the result was [Music] this in the 225 plane called Maria dream we used rusan fact the larger part of the center body from rousan and the chassis but we added some changes in order to save design time the anof bureau began using their then largest plane as a base a twin tail to make space for the Boran more engines for more power larger wings for more lift and a massive cargo hold to be able to carry the space shuttles and cery Equipment objects as large as 11 m in diameter and 76 M long can fit inside but with a payload of 250 metric tons it could also carry things on its back which is what it is designed for the a124 rouslan morphed into something quite different but clearly related the mara or dream the changes were quite significant they included an additional center part of the wing and the additional engines because there were four there and six here and the rear loading hatch was closed in miria in other words these were in fact the main parameters among the unique characteristics of Soviet era aircraft are their robustness sturdy frames and tough undercarriage were a fundamental part of Soviet design strategy to enable aircraft to survive a potential nuclear war and deploy to irregular or semi-prepared airfields like all antonov one was designed to land not only unpaved but also on unpaved airfields this explains the number of chassis and respectively the frame is large this all has to be buffered during the impact stress during Landing it has to be distributed and the number of chassis was designed respectively however not only had the aircraft to be able to survive tough Landings but the airfields had to survive the Giant them too the plane 250 metric tons the antinoff 225 has an increased capacity landing gear system with 32 Wheels some of which are steerable it was designed so the aircraft could turn on small runways on each side there are seven pairs of Wheels plus two front landing gears with two wheels each explains G Maxim who is in charge of maintenance on the Mia there are seven rows of the main chassis they are special because despite of the big size of this plane the last four rows are rotary racks despite its Dimensions the plane can turn round in a small place with minimum radius when the plane is towed these wheels can turn as well in the tiny cockpit convention instruments move the control surfaces hydraulically and the throttles for the six massive turbofan engines are still manual the cockpit opens onto a corridor where the crew and technicians can rest during a long Mission Dimitri Antonoff has worked for 22 years at Antonoff since retiring as a military pilot and instructor he has flown nearly every Antonoff designed plane including this one the most massive of them all this aircraft Anon of 225 also Anon of 124 Anon of 7274 and one of 148 158 and another one aircraft it is a unique experience to be at the cockpit controls of this oneof a kind plane I in the world just only this one but for normal control it it control and uh you have big team flying with you uh we are working and have a good team spirit and everybody uh trying to help and working for Captain for uh to uh uh make a safe flight his crew of Pilots engineers mechanics and technicians must all know the a225 in great detail they must be autonomous so that wherever they land they can troubleshoot any problems on their own nobody knows this aircraft we have to after landing we have to make a loading offloading fueling and maybe if we have some problem with equipment to uh make uh small maintenance or repair something that we are flying 18 20 person on this aircraft it just it cabin in re side um and enough space to uh feel like home here he has come to know every corner of the cavernous aircraft whose vast spaces are remarkable it good good for uh who make a the decision to prepare for long flight uh and um uh uh to sleep here to take a dinner all it to uh prepare coffee tea or uh heat catering and here we have big space uh for just it walk here and also we are keeping here some spare parts for our navigation equipment for and all other system you can see it navigation equipment fire protection system and Al in it uh proceed from here to top of aircraft actually placing a load inside such a massive aircraft was a huge challenge so designers had an internal crane built inside the cargo hold it M long it than 4 M High uh inside you can see um everything what need to load aircraft it take uh any kind of cargo we have um uh equipment to fix aircraft uh fix this cargo inside compartment and also some spare parts spare wheel um and uh our for example here it times to Towing aircraft on ground here it to through through this door we can proceed to technicians uh technicians uh uh compartment it pilot cabin but uh it um uh quite enough space uh to stay our technicians during the flight remarkably there is a lot of space that goes unused the load Masters are also cater for with ample space for dining sleeping and passing the hours in Flight it prepare and uh it technician sitting during takeoff and landing and the back side you see uh 11 bets it undercarriage and a folding nose loading ramp are the heavy lift Hallmarks of the a225 it literally loads and unloads oversized cargo through its nose and kneels using retractable nose gear allowing deliveries to drive directly into the cargo bay several small suburban houses or 80 midsized cars can fit inside the cargo bay there were other major ways the aircraft differed from its smaller brother and from every other aircraft around the world it is the one and only such aircraft in the world dwarfing the Boeing 747 and outli fting the C5 Galaxy transporter just and with regard to the for body almost nothing was changed if we compare A1 24 to a225 and of course in view of the larger capacity with regard to the length of the center body and the wings the plane to 250 tons maximum that all the wingspan of the aircraft was extended from 73 to 88 M and the wing profile was modified too to give it extra lift at the Junction with the fuselage and greater wids to house even more fuel an incredible 300,000 kilos worth the extra fuel was needed to power the six iena progress d18 engines built in the Soviet Union now Russia each of these engines provides 51,6 lb of thrust enough to push the aircraft up to a takeoff speed of over 850 kmph the wing profile and thrust gives enough power to get the 280 ton aircraft and all its Fuel and cargo a stunning total of up to 640 tons into the air to a cruising speed of 800 kmph on the 1st of December 1988 the antinoff design Bureau finally presented its plane it had not flown yet and many wondered if it ever would the mara lifted off the snowbound Runway and graced the Skies over Kiev with a 74 minute Maiden flight that day it set 106 world records for Aviation these were quite difficult times these were the times before the collapse of the council for Mutual economic assistance SE and the USSR collapse yet although our firm was working like we are working now everything we were doing was done on the basis of great enthusiasm upon seeing the a225 the first pilot was reported as doubting whether the plane could actually manage to lift off the ground Alexander galeno is a test pilot one of the people tasked with trying out new planes he flew the a n225 with the Buran piggyback on the way to Paris that program wasn 1989 to bonor where we put Buran on it and we conducted a series of tests with Buran and then we flew with this Buran back here to gel and then we flew to Paris Le bour and we showed this tandem and before the Soviet Union collapsed this system began to fail the state financing was constantly decreasing and we had to think how to go on we had to find ways to earn money in order to build new planes and to continue our Aviation work and this is when this idea was conceived for us to start to provide air transportation services the a225 didn Paris but was showcased in many countries during the tensions of the Soviet [Music] era before that we exhibited our planes at various air shows in the world in Paris Le held every two years far we were in Singapore we flew to the us all that during the Soviet Union times to show our planes the decline of the Soviet Union was marked by the worst nuclear disaster the world had ever seen the explosion of the second reactor in chobo close to the Ukraine Ian capital of Kiev the radioactive fallout took many victims and as the scope of the environmental catastrophe became clear the population of the surrounding area was displaced this was the2 25 humanitarian Mission just before the Soviet Union collapsed well let had to transport cargos at that time Ukrainian diaspora in America collected some medical equipment for the children who suffered the results of the Chernobyl disaster which was needed it was important for them to make it visible and they asked even the president if I them not some rousan but miria specifically so I brought several such shipments from new Yark and from Philadelphia the collapse of the Soviet Union was an unexpected event and many of the planes that were in the design pipeline would never be realized the Antonoff design Bureau however would manage to keep this giant of the Skies alive the Soviet Union had plans to build several such planes and there is a second plane yet it is difficult to say to which extent it is already maybe about 40% well it was as it was there were no funds available to complete construction of the second plane and it remained unfinished and the plan was to create several such maras then the Soviet Union collapsed funding ceased and we were not even able to complete the final flying test in order to receive the certificate the Antonov Airlines Factory near Kiev continued but the a225 was sadly parked for storage it would be muff bored for 7 years before the Antonoff airlift company managed to get it repaired and certified for commercial use and only 7 years later funds were found internal financial resources that enabled us to modernize Maria for the commercial needs and complete these approximately 20 trial flights in order to obtain the certificate and then it could transport caros flying all over the world that is why the experience of Antonov both with regard to the use and maintenance is great because it is about not only ER Dynamics but also the capacity resource reliability of the supporting system and the Maria has all of it in the year 2000 the plane went through a series of upgrades and repairs and then again made its first public debut in May 2001 at the ceremony of the opening of the new bisol Kiev airport in June Europe got its first look at the sleeping giant that had been modernized to take to the disguise once again it was displayed at the Labour air show in France September the 11th 2001 would make aviation history in more than one way in order to demonstrate its potential to the World on the 11th of September 2001 We performed a record cargo lifting of 253 tons for 10,500 M of height yet since this event took place on the 11th of September 2001 another event that happened at that time overshadowed this record the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York would forever overshadow the 124 World Records broken by the a225 that day it flew with four Ukrainian tanks a total weight of 253 tons with that heavy cargo it reached a top speed of 763 kmph but very few gave it much attention the September the 11th attacks led to two massive Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in which Antonoff Airlines and a225 would fly missions for the US Army and engineers and Special Forces into some of the most dangerous territory in the world in one particularly Dangerous Mission the a225 flew gas turbines Into the Heart of the fighting in Iraq to the baiji power plant our planes are also often used for transportation of military equipment all these operations are carried out in accordance with intergovernmental agreements when diplomatic permits are obtained as required so we transport military equipment from one continent to another as well our planes were very often used during operations in Afghanistan Iraq and before that in the Persian Gulf during the Desert Storm if you remember the 1991 92 War the Desert Storm operation our planes were used to carry bulldozers and other equipment to put out burning oil wells in that war back in Kiev sareno manages the Antonov heavy lift operations and Cargo Carrier requests coming in from all over the world I am an operational Duty attendant we support charter flights for our Rand our experimental planes all planes that fly in anti Antonov receive support in in accordance with the orders handlings kerosin is supplied in all airports from which we fly this is our responsibility in Spring 2015 Antonoff Airlines was contracted to transport a boiler from Berlin to Edmonton Canada for use in a new water waste plant the mission required careful planning the unit had to be moved all in one piece no other means of Transport was efficient enough for the [Music] job because these are unique planes and caros are sometimes very difficult up to the unique caros weighing 186 tons that are transported with Maria for them special time is required to prepare our loading equipment for instance some heavy generators or welded frames and so on this is developed by our load planning which is a special office that looks calculates sometimes examines these items and says what they need the cargo weighed 151 tons too heavy for any other transport plane and without the mara could only only have been transported by sea a lengthy and risky transatlantic Voyage we receive commitment advice from the businesses the transportation contract and we prepare the schedule select the most suitable option that ensures the safest and cheapest transformation for the customer then we reconcile the price and begin to plan the tasks we submit requests to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for military transportation and requests are also submitted for civil lines we form the briefing and support the flight performance the a225 is often in demand because of its advantages when it comes to Speed and Performance in proportion it is far more cost effective than any means of Transport although it is a massive fuel guzzler that leaves a huge carbon footprint the time of flight performance does not depend on the type of plane Maria is a unique plane and it began to be used more often recently because the World Market is somewhat inert and it needs time to learn that some cargos were transported in this SW in that region this is why recently when the French began to transport cargos from Africa from ious difficult airports they saw that Maria was highly efficient because for instance Rand can transport only 60 tons to the nearest Point whereas Maria can transport twice as much 110 This Plane as well as Mara was designed for transportation of very large caros and they are big planes big planes create big aerodynamic resistance and very powerful engines are necessary to overcome it powerful engines require a lot of fuel that is why the capacity of the fuel tanks in the a124 is 273 tons 273 tons make it possible to fly for many hours more than 24 and in Mia the fuel tanks can hold more than twice the a124 after nearly being retired the second career of the indefatigable a225 had only just begun the a225 flight from Li in Germany carrying a massive 151 ton boiler to Edmonton in Canada via Goose Bay is underway the crew can relax in the lounge built in the aircraft tail while the pilots take turns of the controls occasionally able to sleep the flight is long but broken up with refueling stops at rikic and goose bay where the Glorious Dawn allows the Antonoff dream to live up to its name the mega airlifter takes off on the last leg of the flight with wings bending under the weight of the 300 tons of fuel that are needed to get it to its destination as the plane flies empty only when it has to for instance after it was unloaded and has to fly to pick up a new load the fuel tanks are almost never full the plane is loaded and it can take only as much fuel as is necessary to fly to the next air drone despite its enormous size the Maria is more cost effective than most Giants of the air Maria needs 20 tons of fuel during the first hour of its flight and then 18 17 and less the weight of the plane decreases as the fuel is burned and the fuel consumption decreases so big planes need need a lot of fuel the Antonoff airlift company has been called upon to transport humanitarian caros too such as to the 2010 hati earthquake site and to Japan the following year the Maria is perfect for the job as it is a single plane with one cargo and can get the job done in just a few days in 2009 the US Federal Emergency Management agency contracted the a225 to fly 10 massive generators into American Samoa after a tsunami damaged a power plant on board the anof are 10 500 kilowatt generators we they staging area about 2 miles away in the next several days they will be deployed from the generator staging area out onto the island the reason why they is because there capability on island with the loss of one of the power plants these generators plus the generators that we already have on island are going to help stabilize the electrical grid throughout the island the reason why this plane was used to uh transport the cargo is we have all 10 generators on one aircraft this is the only aircraft capable of moving this load at once today Antonoff airlines flies a mix of humanit Arian Military and Commercial missions last time we transported from England East Midland if I pressure equipment for production of Jaguar car bodies they relocated their production facilities to Detroit USA we flew to Toronto where we unloaded and then it was near and they transported their equipment further on themselves there were no special technical things the cargo was Heavy almost 180 tons 170 and some something was the weight of this pressure equipment for Maria such caros are normal and customary the anoth company based in Kiev Ukraine constructs and Designs aircraft for a niche market transporting the heaviest objects in the world that need to be moved from one place to another as well as having the largest operating plane in the world it has a fleet of heavy lift aircraft many of which have the capability of landing on un paved and uneven air strips in the most far-flung destinations the a178 is one of these planes and a new prototype has just been built and a178 is the plane that can carry approximately 15 to 18 tons of cargo which is very important it can carry various types of cargo and it has a sufficiently big cabin it can also transport Marine containers Marina containers rain pelts the tarmac as the new a178 prepares for its Maiden flight from Kiev on a stormy day in May 2015 it is slowly towed into place by Antonov technicians eager to see their new design take flight as the pilots prepare for takeoff Spectators huddle along the runway braving the bad weather to watch the new prototype lift off this plane has a rather high speed it can be used in unpaved airfields and today this Niche is vacant which Niche it is for the planes with the carrying capacity between 10 and 11 tons and 20 tons exactly 15 to [Music] 18 after landing the successful First Flight is celebrated by decorated Military Officers government dignitaries and representatives from the commercial Aviation sector it is a rare showing of public public Fanfare in this country ripped apart by War a moment for Ukraine to remind the world of one of its standout Industries aircraft engineering the recently unveiled prototype a178 may be part of the next generation of Antonoff ples but that doesn that the life of the a225 is over to fully understand why Antonov is such a player in heavy lift aircraft it is important to look at the market while there are similar planes with massive heavy lift capabilities built by Boeing like the c17 globe Master 3 and lockheed C130 these planes are for military not commercial use making Antonov one of the only private sector choices for the transportation of massive cargo there is no other plane that looks quite like it with its nose able to open up for a loading ramp and its kneeling undercarriage the a225 Mia is capable of lifting off the ground with a load of 640 metric tons and fitting four small suburban houses in its cargo bay this monster of the Skies has carried the biggest man-made objects in the world and retains its title as the largest airplane in use even after nearly three decades thank God the plane is 25 years old and we have only removable problems I mean it hasn Improvement so far and there was no need for them in individual systems everything that is worn or broken in the process of use is replaced in other words this is a normal operation process of course planes are getting old and they need more attention that all until the aviation industry can develop an aircraft with the same heavy lift capacities the Maria will remain One of a Kind Maria Remains the largest plane or transport plane the largest plane in general in the world I think no one is building a larger plane so far with regular checkups and mechanical repairs the life expectancy of the a225 could be extended to 50 years in full operation giving this Mighty record-breaking Aviation giant another quarter of a century in the skies [Music]	Success
Inside the International Space Station | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MStWNxCaSJM	SLICE Science	[Music] the craziest project man has ever dreamed of has been floating over our heads for more than 20 years the International Space Station there human history the size of a football field the ISS is the biggest man-made object ever created it travels above us at a speed of 28,000 km an hour get the when you C it fixture in space how were engineers and astronauts able to put together this 400 ton machine it engineering building that we have ever constructed as humankind the ISS is the only weightless space station in existence and an incredible tool at the service of humanity [Music] it collaboration of many different countries it everyone Mars it imagine the future it further higher and faster the space station is really our first step on our further journey into space space is an extreme and hostile Place mankind has had to demonstrate incredible Ingenuity and rise to huge technological challenges to allow astronauts to live there almost as if they Earth inside it booth but it cozy how does the space station work how do they repair it how does one breathe inside it where does it get its energy from it need to crouch right down because there you we are going to take a trip Backstage on board the International Space Station on a guided tour in the company of those who know it best the astronauts if if I had the chance to go tomorrow I would go back tomorrow it such an incredible place [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] mankind has always dreamed of traveling into space leaving the Earth and discovering New Horizons this crazy Quest has gradually become a reality but the dream hasn stopped there and to go even further they built a structure over our heads 400 km above the planet the International Space Station a steel monster some 108 M long and 73 M wide it required the expertise of American Russian European Canadian and Japanese space agencies to put this incredible scientific Laboratory into orbit like an enormous construction set each piece was designed and constructed on Earth before being transported into space it took 10 years to assemble in a challenge that went Way Beyond International borders for almost 20 years now 200 men and women from different countries have dedicated themselves in turn to live and work on board the International Space Station St of course the station has become our baby it get bored of it is our home our place of work reaching the space station is no simple feat it involves a long Voyage on Russian soyou spacecraft after a 48-hour flight the soyuz is within 400 m of the ISS the first thing that you see is a is a bright dot like a star that is showing up somewhere on on the display as you get closer and closer you see see a little bit this dot growing then you see the first the wings the big solar wings of of the space station like explorers discovering a new world each time they approach the station even the most experienced astronauts can but Marvel at the spectacle it in photos images or video but you can believe that human beings were capable of constructing this huge station in orbit in space then out my window I could see solar arrays and thermal radiators and pieces of the station that kind of extend out into that Corridor that we traveling in and they just get closer and closer and closer and and feel the view of your window you actually feel like you station as you youth I times and each time my feelings were the same admiration admiration for the size of it it gigantic it looks wrong I mean it looks to your eye there alien about everything you see you will see any beam or post or module extremely well lit on one side over bright kind of you know harsh harsh lighting and then the right as you get roll around to the side that is not directly facing the sun it is black ranges three of the Roll has stabilized there is no roll now there is no roll deviation we really nicely yes confirm and probe retraction confirm doing confirmed a textbook arrival for the brand new so ms01 spacecraft docking confirmed at 11:06 PM central time you cramped uh soyou through a hatch system which is actually even more cramped once you open that you still have the two hatches uh the ISS hatch and the so hatch to get past so you moving through an even tighter little space uh and you know sort of being pulled in by your crew mates you coming through a birthing canal and being aided by the doctors on the other side to pull you across uh and into the main volume of the space station and the hatch now opening and when you leave the little ship and enter the huge station you with emotion you discover this huge space you recognize some faces it really moving of course it [Music] overwhelming the total volume of the ISS is comparable to that of a five room house and it was designed to be home to Seven astronauts each one stays there for an average of 6 months from their very first moments on board and despite their years of training new arrivals are often disconcerted because they have to learn to live in zero gravity where there is no up or down you dimensions and you that is up there on the left on the right below in front behind it complicated to get your bearings in the beginning your brain sometimes processes the image completely different because the fluid in your inner ear is sending a completely different message to your brain you it building you know what I mean I made a right turn into the service module and then suddenly I stopped because suddenly I couldn recognize where I was and I thought to myself I can on board the International Space Station especially because I of hours training in a model of it here on the ground but um luckily one of the more experienced astronauts could see that I looked a little bit confused and he told me it on the ceiling as soon as I flipped over and got my feet back on the floor again it was as if everything fell into place and I could suddenly recognize where I was the astronauts find their way around thanks to a marking system that shows them up and down the absence of gravity also gives them a 360° working environment um of course most of these modules you uh and they could sort of w work on a flat plane either a wall a floor another wall or the ceiling but you know again all you have to do is turn yourself and your reference [Music] changes this almost complete lack of gravity presents its own problems for the human body we are not used to function in in in micro gravity so uh we have too much blood pressure in our head the the blood shift is happening so that see astronaut certainly in the beginning when they fly to space that they have kind of a swollen head with uh with red puffy face the astronauts faces look a little puffy because their blood flows differently the blood doesn well to the lower part of the body and accumulates in the chest and head the veins around the neck and face swell up so naturally the change of blood flow presents some problems [Music] so you actually feel that inside your head you feel this increase in interc cranial pressure and it causes some stuffiness in the nose as well sometimes a bit of bit of a dull headache as well but and that can actually last for a few weeks um as you as your body adapts and adjusts the microgravity but the ISS is much more than a simple home in orbit around the Earth above all it science laboratory in permanent residence in Space over the past two decades astronauts have carried out over 1700 experiments there Japan the US and Europe have each supplied a lab kbo Destiny and Columbus the almost total lack of gravity and the almost total vacuum outside the station makes for an environment that is impossible to recreate on Earth these two properties create ideal research conditions and a chance to use some unique chemical and physical processes This research can be absolutely fundamental with essential questions involving the effects of gravity on metabolic modifications on combustion on Alloys on fluid mechanics with issues we can on Earth because we cannot remove the effects of gravity [Music] the research carried out in this permanent space lab covers multiple Fields like biology material science observation of the earth and astronomy the results of some experiments already carried out have allowed us to create revolutionary new Alloys and new Medical Treatments the ISS also means we have a permanent human presence in space and can thus prepare for future man voyages to other planets not only have certain experiments been useful for key research but some will help us fly farther higher and faster the success of the veggie experiment which involved growing lettuce in orbit is considered a real advance in terms of long-term space missions the system was designed to supply a permanent source of fresh food to the crew wo Che cheers che che che on board the space station they are also carrying out experiments in robotics in a few years remote controlled robots could build other stations or even carry out experiments this is another stepping stone towards Mars but the special thing about this joystick was that I could feel the forces that the robot was exerting and that developing what we call an exoskeleton arm which is a a robotic arm that you can wear yourself and as you move your arm the robot follows your arm movements but at the same time it sends back the forces so you can actually feel and control the forces that the robot is [Music] exerting in the future humans will also need to be capable of withstanding very long voyages as such the human body is also subjected to experiments on the ISS Chief we doing we studying the uh the effects on our bodies in that environment uh the weightlessness uh radiation and any other aspects of that unique environment the last 10 years have shown that the vision of 75% of astronauts is altered by long stays in space for a long time it was believed that the Rush of Blood to the Head was Behind These sight issues but recently it has been established that the liquid surrounding the brain and the spinal cord can also play a role in these vision problems we the cause um there are some theories that it it maybe higher CO2 levels that we breathe in the atmosphere might contribute towards this as well um but what seems to be happening is a flattening of the retina um and that flattening of retina is causing uh up to about a diopter shift in vision so becoming becoming nearsighted what this shows us is that in the end human beings have an astonishing capacity to adapt in a weightless environment the astronauts bodies lengthen and can grow between 2 to 7 cm in length and this is something I find that body is how good it is at adapting to new environments um if we were going to live in space uh in microgravity permanent then the human body is is brilliant it would be offloaded the heart muscle would shrink our bone density would reduce our muscle mass would reduce and we would very quickly become a very good being a very good uh body for living in M gravity after 6 months in orbit it only when they return to Earth that the astronauts truly realize the importance of gravity [Music] bodies it was really shocking after my first flight I felt just how heavy my arms were really heavy I could also feel my guts I really could I I don to you but I could feel the organs inside and I can tell you they [Music] heavy the idea of EST lishing a man space station in orbit around the Earth is not a new one in the 1920s the Russian Constantin silovsky the Undisputed grandfather of astronautics imagined a space station where men could live in 1971 the Russians sent the first space station into orbit named salute 1 the Americans responded 2 years later with Skylab then in the middle of the Cold War in 1975 the Russians and Americans proved that space cooperation was possible with a joint Apollo soyu [Music] Mission the after Apollo soyuz there was a pause in the man space flight programs in both the USSR and the USA in the mid 1980s space cooperation was no longer the Americans had the shuttle and the Soviets were dominating manspace flight with the Mir station the USA was planning to build its own station but given the mammoth size of the task and the cost involved the Europeans Canadians and Japanese came on board with the collapse of the Soviet block Russia was also invited to join the adventure and the result was the [Music] ISS everyone involved committed to sharing their knowledge and supplying part of the station the construction Pro process was simple 15 modules would be built on Earth and then assembled in space in fact the space station is the biggest Plug and Play that has ever been made the scope of the project was immense today we still talk about the pyramids with admiration and the ISS is the same in the future we we talk about the [Music] pyramids this space Builders entered the frame in 1998 when the first American module was anchored to the first Russian [Music] one over the space of 2 years more and more missions set off to build the station and prepare for the arrival of its first permanent residence on November 2nd 2000 Cosmonaut Sergey calev officially became became the first resident of the International Space Station the first thing we had to do was to turn the lights on we had to establish the link with Earth and I had to find a cable hidden behind a panel and then we could do the first report yes the first thing we had to do was turn the lights on after that we plugged in the service module systems we started the unit for creating air for purifying the carbon dioxide and ventilating with oxygen they were critical moments if we hadn that going we wouldn stay on the station for long because the reserves in the soy vessel were very low building the station took 115 launches to bring the modules and teams into space [Music] Canada provided a key element in the shape of a robotic arm 17 M long it is used to move modules supplies material and even astronauts the fruit of international cooperation the ISS gradually took shape in the sky we designed every Mission so that if something didn back into the shuttle and we back home but we never had to do that everything worked up there and it was uh amazing especially when you consider that many components of the space station never were tested together on the earth and integrated only on paper of course it was all theoretical and I was pretty surprised to see that we got it fully deployed it extraordinary example of technolog extraord the construction and operation of the International Space Station is the most expensive project ever undertaken by humankind costing some $150 billion firstly it of money and what we return is a vast amount of scientific knowledge and understanding that is benefiting people back here on Earth and if nothing else it incredibly valuable insurance policy for the [Music] future from Earth you can now clearly see this giant construction set that shines so brightly in the sky the reason it of the massive solar arrays the surface area of those solar arrays provide such a great reflective surface for a viewer on the surface of the Earth and it we capture the sun electricity and charge batteries that are then discharged when we the night side of the earth when fully deployed each panel is 73 M long they are permanently angled to face the Sun and each one is comprised of more than 32,000 solar panels to capture energy from the Sun so the solar rays articulate so as we orbit around the Earth at 4° per minute the solar rays articulate at 4° per minute to to continue to point to the sun we also have because of the orbit that we in what we call the beta angle and that means the solar rays have to articulate in this degree of Freedom as well um and we have joints that do that and the the computers uh track the Sun and then control the solar rays accordingly to together the solar panels from the ISS could Supply the electricity for around 40 houses this unique energy source is of vital importance for the crew there would have to be a catastrophic accident for the station to end up without power but even if that did happen one day we have independent batteries and we also have solar batteries on our so vessels it imagine the station without electricity [Music] these are the crew quarters they here I inside there how I know it mine inside it booth but it computer for emailing my family and for calling them via Skype with a headset I have another computer an iPad and the stuff I need for here you just stick everything on the wall that weightless environment and uh you can see there here which is very comfortable a sleeping bag is fixed to the wall so that I don and it float and sleep in zero gravity you sleeping in a box and you wake up and there and your computer has this timeline in it it get to work that life you get up we have time in the morning you get up and get ready for work like you do here doing your morning routine uh washing a little bit having breakfast uh same as here on Earth usually uh gets up between 6:00 and 6:30 in the [Music] morning for meals the astronauts usually eat dehydrated products to facilitate transportation and reduce the amount of space required for storing food so now our coffee packet is filled with nice hot water we just need a little plastic straw insert the straw take the cap off and drink the first thing to do once you up and had your coffee is to check the station parameters and report to ground control to say how you are and how things are operating then you receive instructions from ground control that might change the timetable a little we usually plan things week by week to ensure the space station functions correctly an efficient communication system is essential between the station and the Earth in Houston at the HQ of the American space agency the teams are in contact with the astronauts almost constantly from the control center the engineers use Telemetry to interact with many of the station structures if you want to do anything if you want to send a command turn a pump on turn a fan on you have to go to a computer and pull up a various displays and then send a command to turn that that fan on so for the crew it a pain but for us it so the ISS has definitely flown from the ground uh from various control centers all around the world we have a bunch of different team members all in charge of various systems and that also have people in Russia we have people in Germany we have people in Japan so again we have people all around the world working again for sort of a common goal but a little better Edge would be helpful if you could tweak the holder or the sample bump it a little bit that would be helpful we each of the station of communicating with Earth okay this is our uh it PCS basic information on how the station systems are doing but most important thing for us are the Comm what is available Comm wise and we have four different channels space your ground 1 2 3 and four as you can see it down but that to be here for us we need to talk to the ground quite a bit they help us out tremendously and they all the real knowledge again so we just just a a glorified technician Ground Control maintains um voice commanding and also um electronic commanding of the space station primarily by using um satellites which are in a higher orbit the International Space Station is constantly sending and receiving data via its satellite dishes 36,000 km above it geostationary satellites receive the information and transmit it instant mously to the ground communication is thus ensured all around the world now we are in communication virtually 100% of the time that we board but that wasn ago we like 20 minutes when we communicated with ground control depending on the orbit today we have good quality communication for professional use and for talking to family and friends it makes for much better living thanks to this communication the astronauts are now able to share their feelings with the rest of the [Music] worldsy on Earth human beings need oxygen but in space there isn any the International Space Station has several systems to produce oxygen and Supply it to the crew the atmosphere on board the ISS is very similar to the atmosphere we have here on Earth the only difference is we have uh quite a bit more CO2 on board the station that a real concern for the astronauts so uh big part of my job is oxygen generation we have we call an oga the oxygen generation assembly so it takes water it the hydrogen away from the oxygen part of the oxygen is made in the Russian service module here we are in the service module it not very big but it module contains all the systems needed for the cosmonauts to stay alive it contains reservoirs of recycled water through which electricity passes this electrical charge isolates the chemical components of the water hydrogen and oxygen it electrolyzer we can take that oxygen from the H2O and it back into the atmosphere for the crew to breathe the oxygen is pumped through pipes that cross the station to provide the crew with fresh air so yeah we can look at the the constituents of the atmosphere and see how much oxygen do we have how much CO2 do we need to generate more oxygen should we be scrubbing CO2 do we need to replace nitrogen are we leaking overboard we have a lot of different data what we call Telemetry that we getting from uh from this room making oxygen is one thing but the air cannot stagnate so the space station has a network of topf flight ventilators and so if you don systems or any fans mixing the air um essentially you would get pockets of oxygen and pockets of CO2 and in the worst case for example if you were sleeping and you you didn the air you could in theory generate a bubble of of CO2 gas around your uh mouth and and suffocate on it water is essential on the space station to drink to wash and also to breathe in the early 2000s when the first crew moved in water was delivered from Earth in pouches today the supply caros still bring water but not enough for all the oxygen production or water consumption of the astronauts so more than elsewhere water is absolutely crucial and must never be wasted to compensate for the absence of gravity the astronauts must do a minimum of 2 hours of exercise every day so they lose a lot of water when we do sports for example we uh we sweat when we wash ourselves we use water and we dry ourselves with with towels uh these towels you just hang up in the air like you would do at home uh and naturally they will dry up and we leave leave those towels close to a ventilation grid like in this case you can see a ventilation grid right here so that they can dry off and all the water then is uh recuperated um it evaporates in the air and then in the um air conditioning system it condensates again and it goes into our uh uh water recuperation bus and it actually gets turned into portable water again saving resources is a constant concern and even the Laboratories help so urine gets recycled um through a a process that actually turns it back into ptable water so we drink our pee and it separates the water in the air inside there the uh or so the urine in the air and the urine go of course goes the urine processor the air gets a little bit filtered and sent back out again and today we are managed to recycle about 70% of all the water that is on board of the ISS today this complex water recuperation and oxygen production system guarantees a supply of water and air that is often even purer than we have at home and managing waste recycling is also key for preparing for longer voyages we can take the CO2 we can take the hydrogen from the electrolysis react that with the water uh to produce more water and and more oxygen and then as a byproduct we get methane in the case of the space station methane is a waste product and so we we vent the methane over but it reaction uh because you could potentially use this very same reaction on Mars to generate rocket fuel for your return J [Music] home I coolest places on the space station the place that everyone loves on the International Space Station is at the end of the Tranquility module the cupula this Dome with seven reinforced panoramic Windows always points towards the Earth which is constantly [Music] passing traveling at a speed of 28,000 km an hour the International Space Station travels around the earth 16 times a day its trajectory covers 85% of the surface of the globe and offers a prime observation post for scientific discovery within the framework of one of his experiments Danish astronaut andreus marginson is looking to film meteorological phenomena that are impossible to observe from the earth and one evening after dinner I was sitting in in Copa and a gigantic thunderstorm started to develop and so I took my camera and I started filming as much as I could and it turned out that I was able to not only film some red Sprites but also a pulsating blue jet so this cone of blue Lightning uh that from the top of thunder clouds and that time it this so potentially it it could affect our understanding of of climate change and global warming because it mechanism whereby we can transport gases like water vapor from the troposphere into the stratosphere the ca is also where the astronauts come when they have some free [Music] time I I and I would watch the Earth and I knew that that was um uh you know borrowed time I wasn forever the goods is it watch the Earth for hours from the window because it changes all the time you tend to look big picture and the longer you narrow it down and you start to pick out small bits of detail and start to identify places you might have visited or other things you want to look at when we go to other planets in our solar system I think the moment when we can no longer longer see Earth through the window will be very stressful because for us on board the station as soon as we have some free time we always look back at the Earth in space when they look at the Earth the astronauts experience a unique feeling called the overview effect it an awareness of the place of Earth in [Music] space and perspective changes with regard to this planet which is so normal to us so finite when you look at it from the ground the Earth is a unique organism you can but you can see the frontiers of misery from up there you can see the environmental catastrophes the fires and sometimes you get the feeling that the Earth is calling out to us for help it was like being in a movie where they might Dolly a camera back but Zoom the lens in to where the actor in this case the Earth doesn your sense of reality around it just comes crashing down and I had literally a physical reaction at that moment where you just going to know like I get it I just kind of get it in a way that I never done before [Music] the journey to the International Space Station is a dangerous Adventure this trip to space starts in the heart of Russia at the bike owner Cosmo Drome it the only way to send astronauts to the ISS is on a Russian suus vessel nicknamed the space taxi the trip to the ISS takes 48 Hours the astronauts are seated in this little module perched at a height of more than 40 m High strapped into their seats ready for takeoff it The Descent module that the astronauts can also return to Earth when the vessel arrives in orbit the team can move into the orbital module the size of a small truck this is where they can relax at the other end is the service module which contains guidance systems batteries and motors for maneuvering [Music] [Music] the team has to check the vessel trajectory regularly and make adjustments if necessary the trip takes them roughly 30 times around the earth the time it takes for the sawu to get into the same orbit as the ISS in order to dock with it as it approaches the International Space Station soyu turns to face the right way and slows down although it is automated this approach is always tricky if there technical failure the commanding officer must be able to take over to control the Final Approach and it was during his first flight that British astronaut Tom Peak had to deal with an incident that could have had some dramatic consequences everything was going fine up until about 17 M away from the space station so that was fairly close in fact that been uh and then we had a sense of farewell one of our thrusters the Yuri then had to take over manual control and complete a manual docking it was just a question of docking the safety of the station depended on it the ISS isn structure it that stick out a collision would have been fatal not just for the crew on the so but for those on board as well piloting in space is much more complex than piloting on Earth because there are six elements to manage on earth when you drive a car you have two elements steering right or left and breaking or accelerating up there in space you managing six different variables at the same time you can go left right up down you can pivot anything you like it extremely complicated process transition to manual a manual docking is certainly a difficult task to do it was made more complicated in our case because we were going from uh daytime to nighttime and the low Sun angle was reflected uh bright light off the space station so Yuri was having a very hard time seeing through the Periscope in order to see the docking port and to get the spacecraft correctly [Music] aligned it was very complicated but in the end I managed to get a distance from where I could see the docking area control the speed and get the angle right eventually we managed to dock it successfully confirm and until those perilous Maneuvers the space station had never witnessed an accident for sometime now private companies along with NASA have been developing new spacecraft to take astronauts to the International Space Station [Music] the space workers are installing new docking modules one of the big steps of course was the removal of a large thermal cover by Rubin and Williams to expose uh the actual docking port to which the SpaceX crew dragon and the station currently has eight docking ports in addition to the passenger craft there is another kind of vessel that docks with the space station Supply vehicles we have a lot of unmanned resupply vehicles that get sent up to to the space station we have Japanese resupply Vehicles we have Russian we have [Music] American every 3 months these vehicles Supply the space station delivering water a few few Fresh Products clothes tools and [Music] experiments once emptied these Supply vehicles have another key function they are used as the Space Station can space station is a closed system everything that you bring up at some time needs to come down so if you bring up uh clothing for example for the crew uh we don the crew has to wear the same pants you get two pants for 6 months you have to wear the same t-shirt for a week or for two weeks uh and then when it dirty and it thrash is accumulated in the cargo vehicles come join me in the progress vehicle which is loaded and ready to leave is filled with bags of rubbish I need to crouch right down because there you everything is arranged symmetrically to balance out the vessel heavy things go opposite heavy things you can see here for example there are purification columns buckets that we laundry and little packages without trash the vessels filled with trash are then unmowed they burn and disintegrate when they enter the Earth but some of the supply vessels fulfill a last function that directly involves the ISS they are used as Motors because the station is unable to maintain the right Orbit on its own the idea is the ISS is about 220 to 250 miles above uh the surface of Earth um so you might think well so there air so why would you ever need to speed up it should just forever be in orbit well where the ISS is there very thin amount of atmosphere there it still there so we have basically this giant football field I mean a vehicle has of a football field flying through space it a lot of surface area that by the small amount of air that atmosphere uh so that does slowly slowly ISS down and so the the ISS altitude is decaying by about 2 kilm per month and if it were to have no reboosts then eventually the space station would reenter Earth atmosphere every 6 months a supply vessel is used us to readjust the orbit of the ISS The Vessel starts its Motors and emits bursts of power to get the station moving to the right altitude the thrust can be felt inside the station itself now the way I to demonstrate the acceleration that comes during the rebost is by using this camera uh 800 mm land so it pretty massive actually and there accelerations virtually no accelerations on us you can see I camera right here and it anywhere and I feeling the acceleration I let go again and here it goes it to take off I you but it orbit that needs to be regulated they also have to keep the space station angled the right way so the space station maintains um what we call lvlh local vertical local Horizon and that means that the space station flies around the Earth always Earth facing the station based on four gyroscopes without them traveling at 28,000 km an hour the ISS would turn endlessly on itself and life inside would be simply impossible in zero gravity if you knock it it move around um like any object up here does however if I get this uh spinning so once the gyroscope is sp spinning you can just see how stable it becomes and however I knock it it going to change its plane it remain in the same plane the gyroscopes turn like a spinning top or bicycle wheel to ensure stability but the rotation access of the gyroscopes is also controlled allowing the station to tilt to follow the curve of the Earth by maintaining this lvlh it means that we have a great Earth observation platform that always looking planet [Music] Earth we playing [Music] nice when they aren scientific experiments the astronauts are busy maintaining the station we do have our one of the most important uh pieces of equipment on International Space Station hidden up here this is the vacuum [Applause] cleaner although a filter system ensures the elimination of particles and certain microbes regular cleaning in this confined environment prevents bacteria from growing it also allows them to find parts they thought were lost forever there is always work being carried out on the International Space Station the daily lives of astronauts include plenty of time taken up with repairs and improvement work but despite all their precautions there are sometimes breakdowns and even major damage that Tracy Dyson discovered one evening in July 2010 just before going to bed everybody else had gone to bed and I was doing my routine checks of the space station on the US segment I was turning off the treadmill when all of a sudden red and yellow bells and whistles start going off and it was way more than just our treadmill having a problem and then um it became pretty clear that there was uh a problem with the thermal control system the thermal control system is vital for the astronaut survival because outside the station the temperature varies between -150° in the shade and plus 120° facing the sun on board the space station the electrical apparatus and in particular the computers generate a large amount of heat to get rid of this heat the ISS has a cooling system cold fluids flow around the entire station there are water cooled circuits on the American segment the central beam and the solar panels are cooled using ammonia and the Russian segment uses a combination of [Music] chemicals we knew that the the most critical thing that could uh happen at that point was if we lost our other pump module if we did then we would have to start considering uh whether to go home on the ground as in the station the crew realized that the situation was critical to replace the defective ammonia pump they would have to go outside the station and repair it from the exterior more dangerous than any other activity space walks leave no room for improvisation and require lengthy preparation all the days leading up to it are filled with activities that have pretty severe consequences if you don right if a cosmonaut tells you they aren they did a flight to the ISS and were calm and had no fears then they lying there are two depressurization airlocks for spacewalks one on the Russian part and the other on the American section [Music] inside the Space Station volume of say a 5,000 foot house so it a it fraction compared to the outside structure [Music] humans are incapable of surviving in the space vacuum there is no oxygen the body is exposed to extreme temperatures to micrometeorites and cosmic rays carry out the repairs the astronauts therefore have to wear some extremely high-tech gear the the space suit is a phenomenal piece of Technology and Engineering it a mini space station it it has to keep you alive the astronaut survival has a price because these space suits cost $15 million a piece they are composed of a bubble helmet covered in filters to protect their eyes from the sun which could blind them instantaneously powerful lamps are there to illuminate in the dark and a camera sends images to the ground a small tube right by the mouth delivers water to the astronaut during their walk earpieces and microphones allow them to communicate with ground control and the rest of the team on the ISS on the front of the suit dials control the oxygen feed and temperature beneath the space suit the astronaut wears a piece of clothing crisscrossed with plastic tubes through which cold water flows to regulate the temperature a backpack contains reserves of oxygen and water along with batteries providing total autonomy for up to 8 hours because of the absence of gravity the astronaut cannot feel the weight of these 130 kg of equipment but being able to move around with such a suiton requires exceptional physical capacities you know 90% of what you your arms and hands and because it pressure suit even moving your fingers in the gloves take effort takes effort to open your hands takes effort to close your hands because of the pressure and the stiffness of the gloves such a task requires constant focus and here more than than anywhere there is no room for error it hardest things that we do in space it not just physically difficult it mentally difficult because you are not only fighting against the pressure of the suit with every motion that you make but you are concentrating the entire time and you itself is anywhere between six and a half to sometimes eight hours long without a break you spacit assembling and maintaining the station required more than 1,000 hours of space walks during these sores the astronauts carried out numerous essential tasks for the station without these space walks the ISS wouldn exist at 400 kmers above the Earth and outside the station Tracy Dyson and Doug Wheelock hurried to remove the defective pump and replace it with one of the four replacement pumps on board the is bigger than a refrigerator it very large box very massive and it um thankfully we had the use of the robotic arm Doug Wheelock was on the robotic arm hanging on to it and then I translated and met him in the spots where we were taking it from and putting it in and helping to guide four spacewalks of 29 hours in total were necessary for these extreme plumbers to successfully repair the heating system the ground teams regained the the P the cooling and we powered up the space station and we we saved the space station how about that other than technical failings the International Space Station and its inhabitants face other dangers Richard garad is one of the nonprofessional astronauts who was allowed to travel to the ISS he remembers the many alarms that would sound every day because a small problem can quickly become a big problem it alarms for the for the problem when they address it before it becomes a big problem on board the space station the biggest danger is fire during training the astronauts learn to become real firefighters you have a fire at your house uh here you run outside you call you know for the fire department they can come and they can help you out you can leave your house right you can be safe but uh you know on board the Isis there have to fight it I mean you have to be able to put it out another worry for the astronauts is that on board the station they are no longer protected by the Earth eruptions from Stars can cause cancer and lead to genetic mutations the only thing that can really protect you against that is density of material there impact protection that you can do to protect yourself from an atomic nucleus it the best protection is to sleep or or to spend as much time as you can behind as thick a heavy a mass of something you can so for example in the Russian segment where all the batteries are stored those batteries are a pretty good protection in the case of powerful Cosmic eruptions the vesda and the destiny modules are the best places to protect the crew the third biggest threat to the International Space Station is space debris if you look through a 10 or 20 year old window there were impact spots of debris it was obviously created by something incredibly small like flake of paint but uh but still was hitting at a velocity of up to 34,00 th miles an hour and so still de you know still makes quite a wallup an object as small as a grain of sand launched at 28,000 kmph could make a hole in the hull of the station cause it to depressurize and kill the crew on [Music] board the engineers have drawn up a map that shows the parts of the space station most exposed to space debris in red this allows them to identify the zones that need protection as a priority the modules are covered with a layer of aluminum which slows down micro debris a layer of ceramic and Kevlar reduces the debris to dust the last layer blocks the particles and protects the astronauts there are more than 100,000 pieces of rocket and satellites The Leftovers of human activity in space in the path of the ISS from the size of an apple to the size of a bus the engineers at Ground Control are able to survey this debris and readjust the altitude of the station to avoid any impact if any debris or micrometeorite shower are missed by their surveillance Radars the astronauts must close all the airlocks and go immediately to their soyu where they must wait hoping the ISS avoids the debris if the impact is too violent the soyu and the crew will return to Earth you kind of fall back on your training right I think everyone in this has been trained on debris avoidance Maneuvers and close call encounters you know what we of have a good time with space it real and astronauts are uh not just tools but people and Friends people that we train and and and talk to on our co-workers so something we take very seriously [Music] here since 1998 the International Space Station has been serving Mankind and it learned how to live in space today everyone is looking to Mars and even Beyond thanks to the ISS these dreams may now become a reality I agree with constantini he said that the Earth is our cradle and it it stay there for all eternity and also think that humanity is obliged to become an interplanetary civilization originally the station was due to be removed from orbit and destroyed in 2020 but its life has been extended to 2024 or even 2028 enough to maintain Mankind continued presence in space for a few more years to continue deepening our knowledge the research we board the space station right now is already helping for those missions we learning how to live and work in space we we robotic interfaces We Have astronauts that are driving Rovers around on here on Earth um from the space station we understanding those communication control techniques um we own food on board the space station um we and how it affects the human body and and how we can protect Crews against radiation when we do these missions so there that at the moment that is going to help us in those future Martian [Music] missions the International Space Station is already humankind technological success but beyond that it is proof that cooperation between people is possible I hope that human space flight at least can help people also around the earth bring them together and find peaceful Solutions like we do in the International Space Station despite of the conflicts between the US Russia Europe and so on a lot of tensions uh we still work together we still can operate together we still do science together we still work for the benefit of humankind together and I would hope that people around the world would take example to the ISS for that [Music]	Success
The Hidden Treasures of the Deep Sea | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO7uRFOpmTA	SLICE Science	[Music] deep down in the ocean a treasure is sleeping it is full of metals that we need desperately but to this day this subterraneous world remains as foreign to us as the moon a Mysterious Universe populated by unique creatures and yet the industrialization of the deep sea is imminent can manganese nodules solve our raw material problems science ought to answer this question it 2077 what once seemed like a futuristic dream is now a reality flying cars unlimited communication and Mobility from another perspective however we on the metals that make our nice lives possible [Music] [Music] the middle of the Pacific a good 60 years ago we saw a way out of the raw materials crisis here today an old research vessel sails across the area that Germany the economic Powerhouse is supposed to save it was once here already on its maiden voyage even back then the markets were nervous as metals were becoming in ever shorter Supply 60 years prior the MS Zona was the pride of German ocean research the new research vessel from the Kill Center for Oceanic research geomar is on the verge of its very first exploratory trip which is set to take several months scientif s from all over the world want to explore the seabed of the Pacific to do so they will inevitably need to look to the Future a future in which raw materials will be mined from the seabed what will happen to this untouched part of the earth when people start to intrude here researchers know that an industry utilizing deep sea mining will advance well in an ecosystem that is important for the whole planet the geochemist Matias Heckle has worked with this unique world for decades we can make a very good comparison between the seabed and the rainforest like all system in which only few nutrients are available we find a great deal of biodiversity this is the case in the rainforest and in the deep sea alike that means there are very few individuals and species but with great variety amongst them the researchers at least want to help to limit the damage that mining the metals from the seabed will cause but to stop the mining Al together the Expedition leader yens gret is a realist we can when we didn say to someone don your computer anymore oh and there TV either so that means we need ores and we should make the effort to reduce our need for new ores as much as possible but we think where are the ores supposed to come from sources on land are limited we now and major or mines are slowly drying up the wounds that we inflict on the earth when we mine ore are immense Chile has the largest copper deposits in the world in fact the whole country dependent upon it that comes at a cost it is not possible for life to exist in the areas surrounding the largest copper mines in the world opencast mining has polluted the environment what responsible for mining many ores for example China which has a virtual monopoly on the rare earth metals that are vital for computers and mobile phones prices soared beyond measure when in 2009 the emerging Chinese economy decided to no longer sell rare earth metals to other countries rare earth metals copper nickel Cobalt and chrome without these non-ferrous metals are entire modern technology world would collapse they every electrical device we can no longer imagine our lives without them what cutting down our consumption and making the smartphone generation responsible is just too shortsighted even environmentally friendly technology such as wind power demands large amounts of copper around 30 to 60 tons of copper are built into every wind power plant Germany has a long tradition of or mining there were once or mines all over the country the or mountains even owe their name to these rich resources ores were mined in Germany up until the 1970s and even until after the fall of the Berlin Wall in East Germany the country was to a large extent independent from foreign imports [Music] but the minds have long since been abandoned the concentration of ores in the earth is in too short a supply compared to the mines abroad only ruins traditions and memorials are left as reminders of the mindes meanwhile Germany has made a name for herself in the world of metal recycling the largest copper recycling plant in the world is in Hamburg nowadays in this country up to 43% of copper is reused an astoundingly high rate that remains unparalleled elsewhere the metal can be recycled without its quality diminishing the problem however is recycling alone is not enough if the hum of the economy is to continue at least things can only be recycled that have already been used and have reached the end of their lifespan Copper from mobile phones and electronic devices tends to land in the melting plant only after around 2 to 10 years larger amounts of copper for example from house building tend to only be recycled after over around 30 years of use however copper usage in the EU continues to increase each year economists see that as a good sign they even speak about Dr copper who is a sign of stable economic growth on the other hand it means as long as production does not go down drastically more and more copper will will need to be mined the or from recycling can never be enough today the price of copper is subject to strong fluctuations caused by speculation an alternative the nodules in the deep sea what do they contain and what deep sea research explains how economics and ecology can be compatible if we it needs to be done as responsibly as possible and to do that we need to conduct Environmental Research because if we don mine in an ecologically sound way and what to the task than those who want to mine the nodules because their primary goal is to mine even if they say that they take a little care of the environment our primary interest is to understand the environment pioneering work is absolutely necessary in the case of the deep sea as the ecosystem here remains almost completely unknown to us researchers first want to find out about the life that inhabits the fields of Manganese nodules on the Expedition the metal and sand nodules have already been lying here for millions of years they to go about this this claw cuts out pieces of the seabed takes it up to researchers on the ship from a depth of 4 km there are manganese nodules in all of the oceans but only in the Pacific in the so-called manganese nodule belt do they reach such a high density that Industrial mining really makes [Music] sense 150 years ago the Expedition the Challenger provided an insight into this Mysterious [Music] World a good 20 years later the first German deep sea Expedition followed with Valia in 1898 the German Empire wanted to no longer lag behind Great Britain for months their researchers sailed through the Arctic back then the conventional thought was still prevalent that the Deep seabed was a lifeless desert the German scientists tried to research the seabed with troll Nets [Music] as the first Nets were lifted there was great [Music] surprise it was clear that countless animals were living on the sea bed and almost all of them were unknown to the researchers up on Deck they examined and categorized the foreign [Music] organisms they brought home countless specimens and detailed illustrations with [Music] them even today scientists have not yet managed to finish examining all of the containers of mysterious creatures [Music] unlike their colleagues in past centuries modern sea researchers are now able to observe animals on the ocean floor in their elements they deep sea follows its own rules the clocks of the deep sea tick to their own Rhythm the animals here grow slowly and become very old many only reaching sexual maturity at 30 or 50 years [Music] old the manganes nodule evolves in this Mysterious World it always needs a core many modules contain shark teeth Metals dissolved in the water slowly accumulate around the core a process that takes millions of years until finally a fist-sized nodule has [Music] formed but how does this slow Universe react to attacks from the outside sea biologists asked this question in the 1980s even then intensive debate surrounded manganes nodule mining in order to imitate A disruption similar to that of mining they lowered a plowing Harrow down into the deep and pulled it across the seabed 78 times in total 7 years later in 1996 they found the same spot in order to check the test area the marks left were still [Music] visible today a good quarter of a century after the original experiment they than anything by now it has become much clearer how little we know about the Deep seab bed Matias accompanied the party in 1996 as a young doctoral student the deep sea covers 70% of the surface of our Earth and we have up until now really only made Point measurements 10 15 20 years ago we thought everything in the deep sea was pretty much the same even in an area such as where we are right now now we diameter so about 3 and a/ half 4 km large and normally we always thought that on the scale of several tens of kilom everything is homogeneous and the same and now we in these 3 or 4 kilometers the variability is relatively large the claw will show how much of the variety is still present if it has brought a piece of the seab bed as planned it will deliver valuable findings every single specimen taken in the deep sea is a small piece of a mosaic that can generate more knowledge a lucky turn it haul the sea biologists carefully retrieve the sediment and nodules every single sample will be examined immediately on deck and later analyzed further on land because such an expedition guzzles a lot of money work is continuously done on the Zona Around the Clock researchers from all over the world share the layers out and use every single minute slowly the sediment releases its treasure the manganese nodules are measured and weighed from an economical perspective it valuable large nodules are easier to mine they required millions of years to grow to that size the sea has always fascinated Mankind and endless expanse all inspiring waves a space for yearning around which countless myths are based in which anything seems [Music] possible the elemental power of the ocean instills fear in us yet at the same time we the oceans they also promise US great gains even the earliest businessmen didn dare Venture into the dangerous oceans to make a [Music] profit later with better ships the exploitation of the ocean progressed more and more in its early days wailing was lethally dangerous for Sailors but the work was good money valuable whale fat was required for candles cosmetics and many other uses the extinction of the whale was only prevented by the realization that crude oil could be used as a replacement for whale [Music] fat nowadays fish stocks are in similar danger to the whale not a single fish can escape the troll Nets that are now dragged across the seabed many species are threatened by Extinction although the fish stocks in the deep sea are being ruthlessly exploited The seabed Remains unknown to us it about the surface of the Moon than we do about the Deep seabed every impression of the sea bed is unique these researchers are the first to be able to see the Deep seab bed in the same place that the earlier experiments happened 19 years ago in almost two decades technology has moved forward exponentially today much clearer images of this Mysterious World are possible when V and T come over when we take a TV Camera across the seabed and we see the image live we the history of humanity to have seen this part of the earth time and again even now I every time for me that spectacular extracting manganese nodules once seemed Within Reach at a time that was characterized by a similarly pioneering spirit in the 1960s and people believed nothing was imp possible man had succeeded in reaching the moon and even standing on its surface the Mariana Trench probably the deepest part of the sea had been navigated by the Frenchman Jeong picant with his submarine what else was lying out of our Reach people dreamed of houses on the seabed where they could live just as naturally as on land but this optimistic time was also one of the most dangerous in history the time of the cold war between East and West the Soviet Union and the USA stood irreconcilably against each other and left no stone unturned in their spying efforts when a Russian submarine sank in the middle of the Pacific the USA used manganes nodules as a coverup story a ship built by the billionaire Howard Hughes was apparently going to research how manganes nodules could best be extracted in reality the American CIA wanted to salvage the submarine it was the most expensive CIA Venture in history the international public swallowed the story of the manganese nodule mining the submarine however tore apart while being retrieved only parts of it made it to the deck to be analyzed the hype surrounding the manganese nodules back then was shortlived ores were cheap the mines on land seemed inexhaustible today on the other hand extraction from the seabed seems inevitable all over the world research is being carried out looking into how the raw materials can best be extracted from the nodules the Rin West failan Technical College in Aran is at the Forefront of this field at first the operation looks simple the nodules are made [Music] smaller and melted at a high [Music] temperature a large problem is the low concentration of ores more than 90% % of the manganese nodules consist of sand and manganese both materials can be used but are already in good Supply on land it is not necessary to carry out costly deep sea mining for sand and manganese in addition iron and non-ferrous Metals come out of the smelter together in metal clumps and need to be separated with other processes very little non-ferrous metal for a large output of energy amongst other things it this metal that deep sea mining is still at the top of the agenda of the European Union nickel countless products rely on nickel to be produced stainless steel for example like the kind produced by this company and exported across the whole world the steel industry remains to this day a backbone of the German economy due to the increasing urbanization its importance will continue to grow into the future as we also need steel for building work [Music] but it is estimated that Global nickel suppliers will be exhausted in 40 years and what then researchers are currently testing which substances can replace nickel but the alternatives are not yet wholly convincing up until now Germany has mostly imported nickel from Russia the town noril is Russia of nickel mining Stalin built it purely for the Mine Workers the extraction of ores has meanwhile completely destroyed the surrounding area for strategic reasons many countries are looking for an alternative to importing from Russia for that reason countless companies around the world are at the starting gates to begin with manganese nodule extraction over the coming years they rely on the technical knoow from other projects a Belgian company has already created artificial Islands in many places around the world using sand that has been pumped up from the seabed if we believe the engineers it doesn they extract sand or manganese nodules from the seabed but is that true with this so-called Trench the belgians lay cables and pipelines on the seabed it practically presents a prototype for a manganese nodule collector and in principle it can be converted with just one tube the market situation is clearly in the foreground for the belgians too well we have five Metals in the poly metalic nodules it mnium Cobalt and manganese but we see this as a nickel project nickel is the most important metal in our polymalic no the trencher is currently being deployed in depths of around 2,000 M it built especially for the high pressure underwater any sensitive electronic systems are hidden behind thick metal layers the tank-like vehicle weighs 55 tons and The Collector is set to be even bigger it Havoc this would wreak on the seabed ecological impact is over always important and we from the D group are uh doing our utmost to reduce our impact and we have to also consider that we need those Metals coming from somewhere so terrestrial mining also has an impact so we will do our best to prove that seabat mining impact is less than theal mining a tube instead of a claw a third larger equipped with yet more robust chains and The Collector is complete though it would be moving through Waters twice as [Music] deep all around the world many companies are working on concepts for manganese nodule mining essentially the principle is always the same a tank-like vehicle is released from a ship onto the seabed technicians sit on board the ship who steer the machine on the seabed The Collector sucks the nodules up it takes the top 15 cm of the ground up with it and creates great SRS of sediment still in the water the nodules are gathered in interim storage and finally are pumped on board during the extraction the sediment on the ground which normally hardly moves at all drifts through the water only settles back down very slowly the researchers on the Zona are investigating what kind of effects that will have a diving robot takes on the role of the collector underwater it is lowered down firmly on the seabed using a remote control in order to imitate the damage caused by mining the nodules the fine sediment can be dangerous for the animals and plants on the seabed there are in some parts reduced metals and sediments inside which then consume oxygen in the lower water column close to the ground and then also release these Metals in the manganese nodules and sediments around them there are some toxic Metals such as copper nickel Cobalt rare earth metals which have a Toxic effect in order to see more precisely how the animals react to this disturbance the researchers catch individual animals on the seabed using the diving robot and expose the released metals to a concentration that will be about realistic during mining [Music] the SE cucumber tries to escape it determined but [Music] unsuccessful the marine biologist Pedro Martinez wants to understand which and how many animals live here in the manganese nodule Fields the so called multic cor is meant to cut out samples from the sediment Pedro Martinez is looking at the question of how the animals deal with being disturbed as here in this very area the animal world was disturbed by his colleagues 26 years ago has it recovered [Music] there is much excitement as the sea researchers heave the multic cor back onto deck up until now they haven managed to take samples with it and without that the marine biologists cannot carry out any [Music] examinations did it work this time the researchers have to accept another disappointment no sediment is gathered in the pipes only water they have more luck using another method countless animals have landed in a trap on the seabed the work begins immediately up to now nobody has known which plants and animals live on the nodules and around them if the animals don the mining of the nodules is their death sentence so now every single creature will be examined on board and carefully categorized all the samples are prepared to be taken away across the sea they will later be delivered to Laboratories all over [Music] Europe a treasure chest of samples comparable to the first German deep sea Expedition and years of work for many biologists [Music] Pedro Martinez can only conduct a precise analysis of the animals back on land in his laboratory in vilhelms halfen it took weeks until the containers finally arrived just like before unknown species are still sketched out [Music] today for Martinez it is certain that every single one of the tiny unknown animals could play an important role ecosystems are after all extremely complex every kind is unique each plays a role in the ecosystem and also has a place in the food web so if certain species disappear even if they then have a measurable influence the genetic analyses have not yet been concluded the scientists will only be able to say in a few months time what kinds of animals live solely in the nodule Fields nonetheless it is already clear there are very many species in the deep sea and most remain unknown we estimate that 99% of the species that live there have not yet been classified 99% with mining we would wipe out life without knowing how important these organisms could be for the entire ecosystem an incalculable risk 26 years ago colleagues of the current research crew left tracks on The seabed Today the scientists will find out if they mud after 26 years in the deep sea this is not as absurd as it seems this autonomous underwater vehicle known as an auv is meant to clarify if this is true it will take thousands of photos of the seabed to do so later the computer will put these photos together in a large Mosaic another piece of the puzzle to help us understand the deep [Music] sea the the staff on board the biologists and geochemists also want to see what has changed biologically in 1926 years or what has changed geochemically and then we want to use that to make a statement on how quickly the deep sea would regenerate after mining has taken place and how intensive the damage would be at all the images will answer these big questions will these tracks still be visible the scientists wait impatiently for the underwater [Music] vehicle the Expedition has brought one surprise after another experts had all presumed the seabed was even however in fact the researchers on the Zona have discovered it Valleys these will complicate mining the nodules the computer slowly puts together a mosaic from the images of the [Music] seabed after 26 years the tracks from the plowing Harrow are still just as clear as if they had been made yesterday but how bad is that that where opinions differ there are also investigations in Shallow Waters at the Shelf where icebergs really plow through the seabed they leave Iceberg plow marks which are considerably larger than the small scratches that we make they create a relief in the seabed sometimes of several tens of meters in height difference and life blossoms there to but will it be like that in the deep sea the researchers want to take a ground sample from the place the plowing Harrow swir up sediment 26 years ago this will give them an idea of whether the seabed has changed or regenerated the output of the gravity Cora is very precise work can you move the ship 5 m to the north [Music] again finally the right position has been found and the gravity Kora sinks 4 km [Music] down if it is not lowered down onto exactly the right part of the ground the sample taking will not be successful win stopped wi stopped ship is now in the right position lab Bridge okay I touch generally in manganese nodule mining the upper 5 to 10 cm of the sedimentary soil are taken away or significantly damaged which didn happen as intensively with the plowing Harrow that means that the forer or the animals that live in them will die or be removed completely the bacteria will be similarly affected this means that this depletion of organic material the consumption of nitrate and oxygen will be reduced or will completely disappear how big is the damage caused and how far does it continue to the deeper layers of the seabed answers to this are to be found in a several meter long sediment core from the seabed Matias Heckle is is examining samples from various [Music] depths the sediment core operation was successful on board the Zona many staff members help out when a task needs to be completed quickly the team quickly brings the core to the cold storage room in order to take out individual samples due to the plowing Harrow 26 years ago oxygen got into areas in which it usually doesn occur the first results that we can see primarily relating to the oxygen profile is that oxygen can freely penetrate into the siment the microbial activity in the surface sediment is still significantly damaged after 26 years I had expected that the microbial activity would have been able to recover more [Music] quickly damaging geochemical processes in the ocean can signify a dangerous interference the seas are giant CO2 storage spaces they absorb CO2 from the air it sinks to the ground it transported by streams deep underwater and can stay there under certain conditions for centuries an additional part is given back to the atmosphere from the surface because of its large surface the seabed especially in the the deep sea is the great motor of our Global carbon cycle it climate on a time scale of around 100,000 years in addition there is a second cycle that we come into contact with when we operate in the deep sea and that is oxygen at the end of the day the floor of the deep sea stabilizes oxygen levels we scale of around more than 2 million years the seas are more than 4 billion years old they emerged on a planet full of volcanoes people are not able to overturn the elemental forces of the oceans in a day as the first rains fell they created the foundations for the oceans we have today and thus made life on our planet possible processes that we set in motion today could have effects in thousands of years well essentially you can say that the experiment that was carried out here in 1989 provided the findings that when mining is carried out extensively there is a lasting detrimental effect on the environment and regarding the regulations that are now to be created by the international seabed authorities it shows us very clearly that how much and how coherently areas are allowed to be mined must be somehow regulated the industrial ization of the Seas is moving at an Unstoppable Pace aside from the territories of individual countries the open ocean belongs in principle to nobody and to everybody the international seabed Authority was created in 1996 in order to protect the seabed the researchers on the Zona work in conflict between Environmental Protection politics and economics the economics side is even on board with them in the form of Johannes post the CEO of the deep sea mining Alliance a merger of businesses who want to promote deep sea mining even po thinks that the seabed authority needs to take Swift action the mining regulations really need to be written and implemented over the course of the next one or two years because there are already companies around the world and also countries who want to start with initial tests imminently so it must be clearly stated somewhere where exactly the regulated boundaries stands The Authority has its headquarters in Jamaica it grants licenses for the manganese nodule belt companies are not able to apply for licenses only countries are whoever is granted one is able to initially start exploring the area and later to mine the natural resources this also applies to the tiny Island state NAU the the people in NAU see deep sea mining as a chance for economic Prosperity consequently the government agreed to an offer from the company Nautilus minerals to apply collaboratively for a license to start exploring none of the small poor states were really very interested until then large companies came and said you have the ability to get a license area we organize everything for you and you be our sponsor State and we will then manage the mining including the exploration you you license but does it work as simply as that the Islanders already once experienced sudden riches from natural resources and a subsequent crash not even 40 years ago Naru was one of the richest states in the world so rich that the government didn on average every citizen owned three cars for 29 km of tarmac road on the island the wealth of narus came from one single resource phosphate since the year 2000 the resources have become almost completely exhausted Naru plunged almost overnight to the status of a developing country since then the island has withdrawn from the contract with Nautilus and wants to extract manganese nodules independently will that bring renewed Prosperity the question is ultimately how much really goes back to the population what does a third world country get from it when they get mined by a large Western company that leads to the danger that only a small percentage of the upper class in the country gets the money and the rest of the population get maybe two or three additional schools and that it jobs will certainly not be created in these countries because the positions needed demand highly specialized understanding of the deep sea mining business and these staff are just not available there when filling the rols for the job again only the large industrialized States get a chance Germany France Belgium and other EU countries Russia too yet it is questionable where these countries will process the nodules there is just as high an amount of waste as in land deposits because at the moment at least the international legislation on the high seas states that the leftover slurry may not be put back so the disposal needs to be taken care of on land somehow and well for me as industrialized countries that that we have to really think about where we want to smelt these manganese nodules in the end Latin America is not far and to get the anges nodules all the way to Germany would not make sense economically but none of the Latin American countries that come into question also have anywhere near the same environmental standards as the EU States and the non-ferrous metals can be thoroughly poisonous for humans could countries like Germany make sure that the smelting of the nodules does not make people here ill and increase the misery and that our prosperity and growth does not trigger an ecological crisis in 20177 we answer presumably those responsible would have chosen the easiest path in this case mining the nodules would have brought the industrialized Count non-ferrous Metals for a few more decades and would have given nothing to the people of Latin America in 2077 the Aging research ship the Zona sails again in the manganes nodule belt now it is fully automated the state of the seabed has surpassed even the worst fears of the researchers of the past the diving robot meanders through the destroyed Wasteland at least some animals have dared to return to the area after mining was given up even in 2077 we can say how the damage to to the ecosystem will affect the climate millions of years will go by until New manganese nodules form they by no means a renewable resource should they be mined anyway even the researchers reach different conclusions it deep down in the ocean and if I mine something on land I also make a very large impact that could influence Humanity more directly than if I do it under the sea ultimately it society as a whole do we want to touch everything that we have the technical capability to or do we want to progress a little in our actions and move towards methods that really are regenerative before we now approach a new resource in the ecosystem that is essentially important for the whole planet for which we cannot accurately assess the consequences who decides on the priority deep sea mining has a financially powerful Lobby the seabed doesn [Music]	Success

Mothership for Interstellar [Music] space I am in the Final Phase of construction in the international Cooperative zone of Earth orbit I am born of man and woman and I am both but I am [Music] neither I am the first search for life on a planet outside our solar system [Music] I am [Music] hope there best part of 4 billion [Music] years a marvelous complex biosphere created shaped and reformed by the ever sh forces of our planet since the dawn of science we sought out life and studied its remarkable diversity on every inch of the globe the technology of the 20th century took our search into space as we scoured our neighboring planets the signs of a second Genesis [Music] came back empty [Music] handed but what about beyond our solar system could life in all its complexity exist out there on a planet Among the Stars [Music] [Music] for as long as we Minds to wonder we bright lights in the sky but it was only on the eve of the 21st century that a handful of eccentric thinkers dared to gaze into the Gloom between the Stars believing planets like our own world could be found there Michelle mayor was one of them when you went to astronomy meetings or conferences you couldn what you were working on if you said you were looking for extra solar PL planets they they Snicker and they smell bad or like you were trying to sell some New Age religion uh you know you might as well have been looking for Little Green Men at that point in the 1990s astronomer R Paul Butler was another young radical who gambled his career on the hunt for exoplanets planets orbiting Stars other than ours I was working on the problem like 80 or 100 hours a week week I I would work on the problem so intensely that I would have dreams about about the work and you know it consuming at the heart of the challenge was one fundamental problem even if there were exoplanets out there scientists knew they impossible to see directly because the brightness of the star would overwhelm the planet to overcome this obstacle astronomers developed an ingenious method of hunting exoplanets by stealth [Music] to detect a planet orbiting a star you have to rely on tricks and one of the trick we have been using is if there is a planet going around the star the star will move the little bit tiny motion um and that detect in 1994 Junior Planet Hunter di quo was Michelle mayor the brink of a breakthrough discovery well in that was looking about 100 stars with a brand new equipment I had spent almost four years before building it and designing the software to the data we get the speed of the star and trying to see a tiny change in the speed with time kind of wobbling that would tell us that there is something orbiting that star [Music] I was there on the Montaine in a way alone because Michelle went in sabatical practically gave me the key of the house because he was not expecting any detection you can imagine my surprise after just a couple of observations to see that something was a bit strange on that star it took me 6 months practically to be convinced that I was real and then I sent this message to Michelle I was in Hawai I said Michelle I think I found a planet it may not look like it but this little curve is a planet how mayor and Kos detected it is a tale of remarkable scientific creativity [Music] [Music] [Music] indir planet [Music] for Imagine The Hammer is the planet the athlete it star and the chain between them their gravitational Bond the star pulls hard on the planet but it way the planet also pulls on the star in fact with every Revolution it it a little off balance using a prism likee instrument called a spectrograph this wobble effect can be detected by observing changes in the color of the light emitted by the star shifting towards blue as the star moves closer and red as it moves away measuring this oscillation allowed quos and mayor to infer the existence of a planet to calculate it Mass the distance from its star and the duration of its orbit I think by detecting the first planet you break a psychological Frontier in science it you canot change a paradigm and we changed a paradigm on the of October 1995 mayor and quaz announced their Discovery the first ever exoplanet bapon although they could not see it directly its mass suggested it was a Giant gas planet similar to Jupiter but the distance from its star and the period of its orbit seemed to defy the laws of solar system people thought well this is really bizarre this must be a total freak because it didn solar system it Jupiter uh but it orbits a star in four days [Music] in our own solar system Giant Gas planets exist only in the colder outer orbits whereas bapon appeared to be tucked in tight against the Heat of its star much closer even than Mercury is to our [Music] sun because it it something like award 2000° centigrade and there is no solid surface because it good place for Life uh it you visit the was no second it Discovery open the window on a new vision of the universe is possible the exoplanet minov was chosen as the target of my mission by astronomers who are long since dead they died believing they had found the one 4.7 light years from Earth a world like ours with liquid water bearing [Music] life I hope that I will prove them right when the first exoplanets were found by the wobble method there was a debate in the astronomy Community some astronomers said this is fantastic a new kind of world completely unforeseen in terms of our understanding of Planet formation but another group of astronomer said hold on a minute we don planets in 1999 professor of astronomy David Shaner was just a young grad student at Harvard trying to make his Mark in the brand new field of Planet hunting what he encountered was a Minefield while artists had rushed to bring these new worlds to life Skeptics questioned the astronomer interpretation of their data what they said was we were being fooled there was in fact a new kind of Stellar pulsation and so as the star expanded and contracted we were looking at one side of that star and so it appeared that the star was coming towards us and away from us the very signal that would be the Telltale motion due to an orbiting Planet but in fact had nothing to do with the planet at all what I decided to do was to try to go and resolve this debate first by looking for the the light reflected off of one of these worlds we tried very hard for a couple years and unfortunately we did not succeed but then as a second idea what we decided to do was instead of looking for the light bouncing off a planet wait for the planet to pass in front of its star and look for that [Music] Transit shabono relocated to Boulder Colorado to a small shed in a car park where a basic 4in telescope had been set up by fellow researcher Tim Brown but I had never done this kind of project before so as a first attempt I thought what we should do is look at one star where we knew that there was a planet due to the wobble method but which we hadn in fact the planet passed in front of a star making a Transit where the wobble method allowed one to infer the mass of an orbiting exoplanet shabono was attempting to observe the planet across its star in the manner of a partial eclipse the problem was he knew the odds were stacked against him of all the planets that are out there orbiting Their Stars we only get to see a tiny fraction by this Transit method the idea is that our line of sight has to be exactly aligned with a planetary orbit so that each time the planet swings around it of of some part of the star blocking some of the light and that we can [Music] detect tipped off that another so-called hot Jupiter like bolerophon had been detected by the wobble method shabono trained his telescope on Star hd209458b it there had been about 10 hot Jupiters discovered at that point so it seemed like uh If there really were planets if we weren later one of these transits should occur and right when we predicted based on the wobble data that a Transit would occur that event sh Transit method was a GameChanger confirming the pioneering discoveries using the wobble method and silencing the Skeptics the discovery of the transits of HD 209458 was a big deal in the astronomical [Music] Community for the first time we knew the actual mass of the planet we knew its size and we could calculate the density and we could compare it to the density of planets in the solar system so it confirmed that these worlds really were hot Jupiters they were big gassy planets inflated due to their proximity to their Stars the new look Universe was populating fast inspiring an eager generation of young scientists to join the hunt [Music] timing is everything when I was in graduate school in the mid 1990s looking for a project to work on for my PhD thesis amazingly enough the first reports of planets orbiting sunlight stars were coming around at that time and my thesis adviser suggested that I work on exoplanets MIT professor of astrophysics Sarah Seager arrived in the field after the Paradigm had already shifted to her the question was no longer simply are there EXO planets out there it was could there be one like Earth when I want to think I come here to the great lake and you know I look out on the water and I just think about how how wonderful life is how fragile life is it gives me hope that there planet out there where life could really thrive but what makes our world so special what physical characteristics define our planet we has a solid surface predominantly rocky planet but we planet to be exactly like Earth when we talk about the planets we want to find it to host life even in the most extreme environments like here amidst the glaciers and volcanoes of Iceland the conditions that make organic life possible on Earth can be found if you know where to look [Music] [Music] based on everything we know of life on earth scientists like franois for believe that for an exoplanet to host liquid water like Earth it needs to lie within a certain distance from its star a region called the habitable Z [Music] side e [Music] [Music] evue the first mathematical model of Planet habitability produced in 1979 placed extremely narrow limits on that habitable zone but recent advances in geological science have broadened The [Music] Horizon other than being at approximately the right distance from the Sun the main thing that keeps Earth habitable is the carbon cycle Penn State professor of geoscience Jim casty is a world leader in the study of planet habitability and the vital role played by [Music] Carbon on Earth carbon in the form of CO2 traps the sun atmosphere without it temperatures would plummet to below what life needs to survive but CO2 doesn atmosphere the trees around us are photosynthesizing and they exchanging every CO2 molecule in the atmosphere every 10 or 12 years but on longtime scales it carbonate silicate cycle where CO2 in the combined atmosphere ocean system is exchanging with carbonate rocks CO2 Rich sent washes into the ocean and is drawn into the Earth crust at underwater for lines where a final geological mechanism completes the cycle to have a habitable planet like the Earth you really need a a long-term carbon cycle and that has to be driven by some process like plate tectonics on the earth that keeps the carbon moving around when our planet enters an ice this tectonic feedback restores a habitable climate as oceans freeze the uptake side of the carbon cycle slows while volcanic activity continues pumping CO2 and heat back into the atmosphere when you put in the feedback you find out that the habitable zone instead of being very narrow is actually quite wide and wide enough that there a good chance that uh planets around other stars at least one or one or more of them could be within the habitable zone castings research had a momentous impact by expanding the boundaries of the habitable zone the carbon feedback loop vastly improved the odds of finding an earthlike exoplanet where life might be possible but the fundamental challenge of identifying an earthlike Planet remains they to detect compared to the gas giants that our instruments had observed so far to see these earth-sized worlds a giant leap forward in technology was required I was a graduate student when the very first planet was discovered in fact I was at the conference where Michelle mayor made that [Music] announcement NASA astrophysicist Natalie batala graduated with a dream I would say my biggest Hope was that we find an earth-sized Planet orbiting a star very much like our own sun in a similar orbit where the conditions for life might be just right 5 4 3 2 engine start 1 zero and lift off of the Delta 2 rocket with Kepler on a search for planets in some way like our own in 2009 scientists launched a formidable new weapon in the hunt for life beyond our solar system the first dedicated Planet hunted telescope Kepler at the time it was the world largest digital camera using an array of 95 megapixel sensors to detect the infinitesimal dimming of Starlight caused by transiting planets so powerful that if turned towards Earth it could detect a single porch light turning off more importantly it was the first instrument capable of detecting rocky earth-sized planets the first two decades of exoplanets was kind of like postage stamp collecting Kepler really changed [Music] that Kepler monitored a select region of our galaxy over a 4-year period by taking a snapshot every 30 minutes like an epic time-lapse photograph and from that data we identified over 4,000 periodic Transit events that look like viable planets and in fact we have confirmed through other follow-up observations that over half of them are indeed uh Bonafide planets Kepler delivered not only the first Rocky exoplanets it revealed brand new kinds of rocky planets like Kepler 10B our first encounter with what scientists would crisen lava worlds these are rocky World same kind of density as Earth um but they orbiting so close to their star that the surface temperatures are in excess of that required to melt not just rock but iron [Music] so you know something the size of the Pacific Ocean even larger that is an ocean but it of molten rock Kepler was the first Celestial census extrapolating the D from the surveyed region it gave astronomers a catalog of the exoplanet population we important things first we that every Star that you see when you look up into the sky at night has at least one [Music] planet the other thing that we have learned is that nature makes small planets more efficiently than large planets the third thing we with the fraction of stars that Harbor earth size potentially habitable planets and we can make the bias corrections to determine that number and what we find is that it 25% at least one planet for every star in the sky and as many as a quarter of them Earth sized and orbiting within the habitable [Music] zone Kepler revolutionized the way we see the stars keper was the Pioneer Kepler looked for planets transiting sunlike stars and Kepler looked at a very distant field of stars for four years to try to find a Planet like Earth that has a one-year orbit inspired by the success of Kepler in 2013 NASA joined forces with MIT Lincoln labs to develop an instrument that could deliver a more detailed survey of nearby earthlike Worlds the entire field of exoplanets is funneling towards the search for another Earth a rocky World orbiting a small star preferably in the habitable zone of that star as the project Advanced MIT Professor Sarah Seager was named Deputy science director of the transiting exoplanet survey satellite AKA Tess Tess wants to find stars that are closer right in our neighborhood actually the camera has lens assembly of seven lens elements that refracts Starlight onto a detector and together they make a giant strip when you think of the sky as a sphere from the bottom of one hemisphere all the way up to the pole after one year of doing that Tess will flip to the next Hemisphere and it will then do the same thing and so over two years Tess aims to study the entire Sky by scanning nearby star systems Tess aims to identify 50 earth-sized exoplanet candidates for further investigation but would finding a planet our Earth also mean finding a star like our [Music] sun all we know of the Stars we know from afar all we know of minova is this it is a rocky planet 1.6 times the size of Earth hosted by a red dwarf star its orbital period is 39 Earth days it lies within the habitable zone its atmosphere contains carbon dioxide methane water and ozone it will be full of surprises [Music] after the explosion of discoveries a new question [Music] emerged could finding the right star be just as crucial as finding the right Planet I think the biggest lie that I was told when I was in school was that the sun is an average star the sun is not an average star the sun is much bigger much more luminous much more massive than most stars most stars in the galaxy are about a quarter the size of the sun a quarter the mass and they only put out 1 1,000th the energy these are small cool stars burning not yellow like our sun but [Music] red they or M dwarves but most people call them red dwarves one of Kepler discover planet Kepler 186f was found to be orbiting such a star 500 light years from Earth it Earth and our observations tell us that planets the size of Earth are more likely to have a rocky composition so we imagine this planet as being a rocky planet with a surface a solid surface it energy for liquid water to pull on the surface but it very different than our sun because red dwarves burn less hot than our sun their habitable zone tends to be much closer in but this closeness could spell disaster for life on the planet the red dwarfs their habitable zones are so close in that the planets have a strong chance of becoming tily locked and synchronously rotating where they show the same face to to the star all the time just as the Moon shows the same face to the Earth so that that poses problems for habitability which may be difficult to overcome when a planet is close to its star the gravitational or tidal Force becomes greater and this can have the effect of locking the rotation of the planet meaning one side is always lit by its star while the other remains shrouded in darkness [Music] as well as producing one hot side and one cold by spinning so slowly the planet may fail to generate an electromagnetic Shield which like on Earth protects the planet from radiation these Stars at the same time you know surprise they dimmer than the Sun but they magnetically active they give lots off lots of high energy radiation that may strip the atmosphere off a planet particular if it magnetic field but in 2015 casting and other researchers found reason to hope for life on a tidily locked Planet orbiting a red dwarf using sophisticated climate modeling they proposed that if the planet had the right kind of atmosphere then heat could be transferred from the light side to the dark like a reverse cycle air conditioning system Planet Hunters embraced the discovery if life could thrive on a planet around a red dwarf or mtype Star the odds of finding a second Earth were vastly [Music] improved mtype stars are the most numerous star in the galaxy 70% of the stars in our galaxy are these M type Stars so if life can seed itself and get started on these planets then life is going to be ubiquitous in the Galaxy for 4 months at the beginning of 2016 the sea telescope in Chile set its sights on the mtype star Proxima centuri a mere 4.25 light years from Earth it in a machine room deep beneath the telescope light from the Star was split by the harps spectrometer an instrument so sensitive it picked up the feeblest of wobbles in the dwarf star caused by a tiny earth-sized planet Proxima B the discovery came as a revelation the very closest alien star to Earth hosts a Tiddly locked earthlike world and calculations reveal that Proxima B is orbiting within the habitable zone it a planet around our nearest star just think about that for thousands of years people have been wondering are there any planets around other stars and there is one around our very nearest star but what about its atmosphere could this planet sustain life [Music] [Music] my last cell of helium 3 propellant is delivered from moon [Music] base my preparations are [Music] complete on Earth the world astronomical Union is throwing a party for me on the eve of my historic [Music] launch and I am honored and I am alone tomorrow I am gone to [Music] minova as the exoplanet Gold Rush gathered pace Planet hunting Prospectors sought ever more refined methods of sifting their discoveries in an effort to give a future Interstellar Mission the best possible chance of targeting a world that might actually host life having identified a rich new vein of distant planets the next crucial piece of the puzzle was yet to fall into place How could a telescope be used to sample the atmosphere looking at a planet atmosphere far away is the best way we have to find Signs of Life on another world because the gases that life produces here on Earth actually imprint in our atmosphere in a very significant way and so it that on another world we can do the [Music] same if you were an alien astronomer studying the planets of the solar system you would see that there very different about the third planet from the Sun you would see that its atmosphere is full of oxygen even though you would know that the oxygen couldn possibly be there by geologic processes there would be other gases like methane which also shouldn present and yet there they are and you would we think as we ourselves when we look at other stars conclude that life was the only possible explanation [Music] in 2000 David shano took control of the Aging Hubble Telescope charged with a single but daunting objective to make the first ever observation of an exoplanet atmosphere the transit method of exoplanet detection which shabono had pioneered himself provided a clue for how to solve the puzzle planets orbiting closely to their stars make more frequent transits and the larger the planet the easier it is to detect so shabono turned the Hubble gaze towards Osiris a gas giant that transits every 3.5 days we had the idea that when the planet passed in front of its star some of the light from the Star would pass through the outer parts of the planet and then imprinted upon that light would be the Fingerprints of whatever atoms or molecules are present in the atmosphere different atoms absorb different light frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum and allow others to pass through producing a signature in color no one had ever discovered an exoplanet atmosphere and so we needed a guess as to what Atom or molecule would be very prominent would be the easiest first thing to see so there were some predictions shano put his money on sodium The Telltale yellow glow of Street lamps the observations were gathered a few months afterwards and it took more than a year to carefully analyze the data no one had ever made this detection before so we wanted to be absolutely certain that what we were seeing was robust after painstakingly probing the data shabono announced his discovery the atmosphere around Osiris was indeed rich in sodium however this was no second Earth named after the Egyptian god of the Dead the gas giant Osiris doesn even have a solid surface to land on let alone the climate of Life What We crave to do is to study the atmosphere of an earthlike planet of course earthlike planets are simply much smaller than gas giants and so it detect them and to study their atmospheres it thwarted Planet Hunters from the outset the blinding light of the Stars completely overwhelms the smaller exoplanets the first instrument to solve that problem will hold the key to the exoplanet [Music] Revolution the James web Space Telescope is designed to view the heavens like they the invisible visible it mirrors converges light into the eye of a state-of-the-art infrared camera that astrophysicist Pierre Olivier lagage spent 20 years developing [Music] the same is true of exoplanets observe them in the right wavelength and they glow in the dark but for the infrared vision to work it relies on the truly Innovative feature of this telescope inside the camera lies James web called a coronograph [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the mask of the coronograph intervenes between the overwhelming light of the star like an eclipse allowing the infrared light light of the planet to shine through [Music] [Music] crucial in the hunt for earthlike worlds James web is ideally suited for detecting [Music] ozone the James web promises to be the missing piece in the planet Hunter Arsenal with its breakthrough ability to view an earthlike exoplanet directly and to study its atmosphere the odds of identifying a destination for a future Landing Mission have never been [Music] better you know I can probably imagine what that would feel like better than most people can I to other planets my whole career 40 years of this but I can it would feel like I mean the the the problem of getting a spacecraft with that kind of capability to another star is so much harder the discoveries of the Planet Hunters transformed the way we see the universe and posed to explorers like Steve Squire lead investigator of the miles rover mission the next tantalizing question what if we could reach out to a nearby alien star and search for life on a second Earth what if we could land on another Rocky world with running water and a protective earthlike atmosphere if you could find an earthlike world that has been around for billions of years enough time to develop Advanced biology it conditions all that time there are all kinds of [Music] possibilities I can would have feel like it mean it for all Humanity when it [Music] happens 5 4 3 2 1 I [Music] launch no fireworks no trembling [Music] Earth for those of you who are watching this I thank you for entrusting me with the Great Adventure in human [Music] history this is a vision of our future the fateful day in a far-flung corner of the universe when a probe from Earth initiates the first descent onto an alien world looking for proof of life beyond our solar [Music] system there are no Witnesses no cheering crowds in a control room a decade or more will pass before news finally reaches us back across the dark oceans of space but the seeds of this Mission are already being sown today by the first generation of scientists bold enough to believe it could be possible when I look up in the sky and I see not Stars I see planetary systems they look to planets orbiting distant Stars searching for an answer to the oldest human question are we alone is there life on other worlds and if not why not and if so how this is the first generation in human history where we have the technological ability to actually go and answer that great question this is the story of humanity launched into the final frontier by a new breed of adventurers the Planet Hunters Engineers explorers and dreamers taking the first steps on an inter Stellar Journey they know that they will not complete sap the Journey of a pioneering future spacecraft to search for life on a second Earth that spacecraft must communicate it must navigate it must have power it must have propulsion we will have to give it all the intelligence necessary to make its own decisions what a CH challenge [Music] [Music] [Music] my name is arimis my time has come I initiate launch sequence and maneuver for exit trajectory my navigation systems Target Mars sphere of influence for Gravity assist and angular trim towards Jupiter I am ready to escape Earth orbit total distance 4.7 light years I commence acceleration phase for maximum velocity 51,000 km per second it will take me 49.8 years to reach my destination the earthlike exoplanet minova B [Music] my mission is simple find life [Music] it was only for graduate students and I was an undergraduate and I nearly got thrown out of the class the first day and got to be I don semester I thinking about my turn paper and there was this place then at the time called the Mars room and it was a place where the pictures from Mars were stored and I went in and I thought thought I minutes and flip through some pictures and see if I can come up with an idea for a turn paper like most scientists principal investigator of the Mars rover missions Steve Squire is a born Explorer a seeker of Truth amidst the great unknown I mean ever since I was a kid I Maps I was fascinated by you know remote corners of Tibet or the deep ocean or the other side of the moon just the idea that there was a place that we hadn being able to go there and see it for the first time that just that just had a huge appeal for me in 1977 images of the Viking Mission changed the course of Squire know it come down from Mars and bang they the internet an hour later there were only a few dozen people in the world who what I was looking at in the pictures nobody did but then I would see in the pictures these little valleys that just looked like they had to have been carved by liquid water and I was in that room for 4 hours and I walked out of there knowing exactly what I wanted to do with the rest of my life [Music] waiting confirmation from the spacecraft that R rocket Edition has at this point in time we should be on ground in the early 2000s Squires LED NASA missions to Mars smoked successfully Landing the two robot geologists in a bid to uncover the hidden history of water on the red planet amid the these groundbreaking triumphs an even greater Frontier beckons the discovery of earthlike Worlds outside our solar system has transformed the way we see the universe and presents an irresistible challenge why not reach out even further and search for life on a planet Among the Stars the thing that has driven the focus of exploration in this solar system has been the search for other forms of life and so I think the motivation is going to be the same thing I think the motivation when you go to other star systems is going to be habitable worlds and possibly worlds with life that to draw you to a specific world but the scale of the challenge is is unlike anything humankind has attempted before the closest star that hosts an earth-sized Planet Proxima centuri is 4.3 light years away over 170,000 times further than Mars the quest to build a spacecraft that can Journey to the Stars will test the greatest explorers of Our Generation and demand of them the ultimate sacrifice to give all their craft and vision for a dream they you careers their lives to something they will never see to fruition now that has happened that has happened a few times in human history some of the great cathedrals of Europe took longer than a human lifespan to build uh people felt Guided by a higher power when they did that but it takes something extraordinary to motivate people to do that kind of [Music] thing I enter the shadow of Mars the lights of Viking Colony winking a final farewell from [Music] humankind my transer dish receives the [Music] message I fly by the storm of Jupiter onward to Pluto and Chiron and into the space between Stars after 3 months of acceleration my speed is 19 km per second I meet Voyager 1 170 years and 72 billion kilm from Earth no fuel to shift course no power to call home I have now traveled further than any spacecraft before me I retract my [Music] transceiver there will be no more calls and press on through the silence to Min nevera I get up eat day with joy you know why because I know that day I going to learn something I didn before and that my picture My overall tapestry of Who We Are Who I Am what our species is and how we got to be that way will be lifted up NASA flight systems Gentry Lee is a pioneer of exploration at the age of 75 he years of his life to engineering robotic missions to other planets someone asked me one time if I had to describe the excursions above the threshold of joy in my life would there be a lot of them or just a few and I said I can give you the two categories right away the birth of my children and I now have eight and when a spacecraft that I had a major role in achieved something successfully there those Lee 1975 was Humanity dream of exploring the solar system designed to achieve what many thought impossible to make the first ever landing on another planet second M we had lived through 5 years of people telling it you don and we were scared to death that it wouldn work ACS is close to Vertical touchdown [Applause] confirmed and the moment that first strip of picture came down from planet Mars on July the 20th of 197 6 there were hundreds of us who immediately spontaneously tears burst from our eyes it was at that moment that we knew that human beings who had always been a category one species limited to their own earth and its sphere of influence had reached out and become a category two species ready to explore the entire solar system [Music] over the next five decades Lee oversaw successful missions to Jupiter Pluto and to the comet temple one with Lee and other Pioneers at the helm Humanity system has been so successful we have a permanent office in Space the international space station but as the new dawn of interstellar exploration lights The Horizon even the old Sea Dogs know it will be the greatest challenge that humankind has ever faced it is hubris on our part to imagine that we can sit today and Define all the steps that lead us to this plethora of Technology Advan that we need in the future to build an Interstellar spacecraft rather let us do the following thing that spacecraft must communicate it must navigate it must have propulsion it must have the ability to take data it the king of Portugal had said I don even know yet what kind of ships I need to build or where they need to go let me just start with an idea what floats and so the infinitely complex quest to search for Life amongst the stars is reduced to just four problems propulsion navigation communication intelligence each one of them will demand a revolution I am 9 years into my journey 1.2 light years from Earth 26% of my acceleration phase complete my speed is 13,000 km/ second my fuel usage 19% I jettison my spent fuel cells I am on course for arrival at minova in 31 years time does life await me [Music] when I was about 10 years old I had one of these department store telescopes learned how to use it took it out one night and focused it on what I was told was the planet Saturn and when I lined up the viewfinder and held it still and I could see Saturn and its rings at that moment I felt a calling and that calling was to learn about how to get there tus 10 9 8 7 6 5 Les Johnson answered that calling becoming a world leading expert in advanced concepts at Nasa Marshall space flight center in 1999 he led pioneering Research into Interstellar propulsion nature is kind to us in the regard to what options we to the Stars Nature has said you you smart people you can figure this out it hard it was difficult enough to go to the Moon we different planets in the solar system but to take that leap to go to the Stars the distance is just so much further and requires so much more energy that it just going to take some time [Music] the goal of engineering missions to the Stars confronts explorers with distances they before one light here is over 9.4 trillion kilometers which makes our nearest star over 40 trillion km away that the world flights according to the masters of so solar system exploration the greatest challenge is how to propel a spacecraft fast enough to travel like he is within a lifetime in order to get humans to make the enormous effort required to fly that kind of mission you need to have the period of time between when you launch and when you actually get information back be no longer than a typical human lifespan Humanity has never launched multi-generational Voyages of exploration it done the distances are just daunting and so there going to have to be major major breakthroughs mostly in propulsion chemical fuel Rockets like Saturn 5 have been the workhorses of solar system exploration they got us to the Moon in just 3 days but to reach a planet orbiting our nearest star within a generation we need to travel at a speed that covers the Earth to Moon distance in just 8 seconds that light chemical Rockets are great for getting out of the gravity well you have the the high thrust to overcome Earth terribly inefficient and in order to get to the stars in a reasonable amount of time you some pretty high speeds and it how efficiently you do that because if you lot more fuel and you get to a point where you can move your own weight the capability of any propulsion system is governed by the rocket equation a trade-off between thrust efficiency and weight the most powerful chemical rocket in operation Falcon heavy first launched in 2018 weighed 1.5 million kg at takeoff and 95% of it was fuel it burned through all that fuel in just 10 minutes in order to create enough thrust to deliver its unusual payload beyond Earth [Music] wherever staran is going in his Tesla it isn [Music] Stars only one chemical powered spacecraft has ever made the leap beyond our solar system in 2013 36 years after its launch Voyager 1 entered Interstellar space at 17 km/s fast enough to travel London to Beijing in under 10 [Music] minutes but at less than 0.00001% the speed of light still painfully slow if you Stars they considered to be the physical boundary of the solar system and it some years to get there at that speed they the nearest star now a chemical Rockets aren it as the push for Interstellar exploration gathers Pace the workhorses of the old Space Race have put out to pasture monuments to aide G era but if not chemical Rockets what will deliver the seemingly impossible thrust and fuel efficiency required to Journey to the Stars within a [Music] lifetime three potential propulsion Solutions are being explored today Fusion antimatter and plasma physicist Stefan mazou is working at The Cutting Edge of electric [Music] propulsion the whole plasma thrust since the 1970s plasma thrusters have been used in satellites to make positioning adjustments while in orbit so he coming up on 90 m in closing range is 70 M and range R 0.34 their principal Advantage is efficiency demanding just a tiny fraction of the mass of fuel required by chemical Rockets p V for plasma engines offer hope of achieving the speed required to reach the Stars still holding them back is how long it would take to achieve that speed dragging the total trip time into thousands of years but in the shimmering upper atmosphere of our own Planet lies the potential for a kind of propulsion until now only dreamt of in the realm of Science Fiction I am the Navigator my mind is full of stars and every planet and every [Music] Moon every Celestial body that is known I know also but the dangers my creators did not know of I must discover for myself an asteroid field I Turn To Face It head on [Music] my titanium Shield absorbs the [Music] impacts but one stray penetrates my mind [Music] my emergency backup command system activates I am reborn I re-engage I Journey on [Music] in 1995 at the CERN particle collider in Switzerland for the first time in human history scientists succeeded in producing the most efficient source of energy achievable within the laws of physics antimatter as any good Star Trek Fano right uh on the Enterprise that powered their warp drive hor warp drive is science fiction drive but if you if you think about uh antimatter it real just like normal matter is protons electrons there are antiprotons and anti- electrons when matter and antimatter come in contact within each other they annihilate and it essentially is the perfect e equal MC squ moment is released as energy and therefore it efficient battery we can ever build most efficient battery that nature will allow us to have antimatter is created naturally in space when cosmic rays collide with atoms in the Earth atmosphere producing it at the CERN was a phenomenal scientific and Engineering breakthrough that required accelerating particles to the speed of light and smashing them together the challenge now is how to create enough of it to propel a spacecraft this is where it gets tough if you look at the total amount of antimatter produced globally today it on the order of nanograms you would need on the order of kilograms perhaps up to a ton of antimatter to drive a Starship that not something I want to do on the earth because the amount of energy released if that ton of antimatter met a ton of matter would be catastrophic and so you ability to uh you have to make your antimatter in space far away from the Earth and and use that for your Starship construction so again it today but it impossible the Stars themselves suggest another possible solution to the propulsion problem the energy released from hydrogen atoms fused together is what lights the sky Across the [Music] Universe since the 1950s scientists have been developing Fusion reactors to harness it the sun does it by Brute Force has all that mass squeezes all that hydrogen together to form helium I releases energy and that Shines it production tame the power of the Sun and furnish Humanity with an infinite supply of energy but to get Fusion going on Earth you need to generate the heat of the sun upwards of 100 million de Centigrade well we ground uh it when a hydrogen bomb is detonated which is not what we [Music] want in the hydrogen bombs of the mid 20th century the atomic explosion of a radioactive isotope was used to produce the heat required to achieve Fusion but that explosion of energy was not contained in a way that it could be harnessed what you want to do is be able to capture the the the energy source of the Sun in order to uh heat your propellant or to use this propellant to get your spacecraft going fast enough to go to the Stars modern reactors achieve Fusion by other means by heating plasma the problem with this approach so far is that the energy required to reach that heat has been greater than the energy produced by Fusion no reactor on Earth yet has even reached Break Even but at Princeton Systems a team of Engineers is on a mission to solve that problem and to build a fusion reactor that can take us to the Stars my brother will tell the story that I person he knows that what they thought they wanted to do in high school I identified aerospace engineering I picked colleges for aerospace engineering I aerospace engineering ever since because it cool the exhaust velocity that we have is only about 100 km/ second and yet you can unless you got some meaningful thrust right so you aerospace engineer Stephan Thomas is principal investigator in a NASA funded program to build the world first direct Fusion Drive essentially it reactor and propulsion system in one we want to reach a neighboring star in the neighborhood of five Lightyear distance we want to bring 10,000 kilogram of payload that tons and we need to do it with an exhaust velocity that we can actually achieve with an engine Thomas constant flow of plasma to catalyze the reactor we pulsing current through these antenna so every time we millisecond pulse we heat the plasma we generate current you see a flash but the reactor would be steady state so instead of flashing like this it would be bright all the time so that rather than using a heavy and hazardous fuel like uranium the direct Fusion Drive runs on a naturally occurring isotope of hydrogen dorium found all over the Earth in water the Drive Unit is compact at just 1 M diameter and 10 m long small enough to mount on a spacecraft we think that we can build the Next Generation machine in maybe 5 years it will take at least another 5 years to build a prototype that you could launch but definitely 15 years at the outside we think we could have one and put it in space at some point we have to visit the Stars we and be content you know even when we visiting the planets because we want to know what there everybody wants to go to the Stars someday in the timeline of propulsion technology that someday is getting closer the next challenge in our bid for the stars is navigation [Music] I discard my primary engine 15 years out from my destination at 51,000 km per second my acceleration phase is now complete I deploy anterior thrusters and engage reverse propulsion I set deceleration at minus 168 km/ second squared total ship weight now 42,000 tons and decreasing 75 Kg per second of propellant burnt [Music] I refined my trajectory and set course for [Music] manura in the realm of space exploration the solar system as our neighborhood since visiting the moon in body around the Sun in 2015 the New Horizon completed the first flyby of our most distant neighbor Pluto it took over 9 years to get there but at every step of the way the unmanned spacecraft was guided remotely from Earth the way we navigate today when we send these probes out even the one that went to Pluto is we have a combination of data taken by the flying spacecraft and our big computers here on the earth that are processing radio information that comes from those spacecraft when we went by Pluto we were basically so accurate that we were hitting a golf ball into a hole from Los Angeles to London that time sending directions to probes works for solar system exploration but as we set our sights on the Stars the distances are so enormous a new question emerges how to navigate a journey of light years if we were ever to go explore a planet around another star the distance would be so great that the machine would have to essentially operate on its own we call that autonomy we with curiosity we did a lot landed on Mars in 2012 curiosity was the first spacecraft equipped with an autonomous navigation system given coordinates by Mission Control the Rover could image its surroundings and computer safe path across the Martian landscape but for an Interstellar Mission there will be no relaying instructions all the navigation would have to be on board all the algorithms the computations of the orbit the computations of the Maneuvers to get to the right place what stars to look at is for this year what stars to look at for next year what we would have to do is extend our minds to imagine all the possibilities that they might run into and we would spend literally years building this hierarchy of possibilities into this artificial intelligent machine it would have to know at all times how well all its critical systems were doing and how to fix them if they weren them if they couldn challenge [Music] I enter the moven star system 49.6 years since my [Music] departure I reopen my transceiver and prepare to send the message [Music] home I have [Music] arrived with any Mission communication is Paramount most spacecraft do not return instead they send their data back to earth when great distances in the speed of light get involved it becomes a very very different sort of experience simple words like now take on a kind of a different meaning I remember when we were landing on Mars from when you hit the top of the Martian atmosphere to when you minutes at that time the one what we call the one-way light time how long it takes a signal to travel at the speed of light from Mars to Earth was 10 minutes all systems are go we are currently 6 minutes away from hitting the top of the Martian atmosphere so we there in the control room and we watching the radio signal and we watching the spacecraft begins to slow down and curve down in the Martian atmosphere and it the atmosphere the reality is out at Mars it minutes moving at a speed of 173 mph we are and it may be a happy healthy Rover or it may be a smoking hole in the ground and I don this rad and I that moment and magnify that so instead of 10 minutes is 10 years communication with every craft currently in space is conducted via the giant dishes of the deep space Network each powerful enough to track a signal from Pluto no stronger than a CB radio all of our deep space Communications are run through the deep space Network that dishes um they locations around the world uh one is in California at Gold Stone uh one is in Australia at CA and one is in Spain at Madrid we need a very large dish area in order to collect all the energy and be able to communicate all the way out at places like Pluto um where our spacecraft are going in 14 Matthew Abramson was mission manager of a radical new form of communication installed on the International Space Station designed to overcome the limitation of traditional radio transmission the limitation is primarily the the distance that we transmission over when we send out that signal uh it spreads out over time and and over space and so uh as that spreads out it dilutes the signal power the further out you go the the lower and lower your data rate is or gets out to the level of something like your dialup modems that we used to have many years [Music] ago when the New Horizon back pictures from Pluto via radio transmission the signal was so weak it took 15 months to downlink the images from a 12-hour flyby but with the technology Abra Crimson launched and tested in 2014 that download time could be reduced to just one day 5 old by sending data back to Earth on beams of light the idea is you take a focused laser beam and send the signal same signal over that beam but it efficient because you have this Focus signal that over time laser wavelengths are packed much more densely than sound waves so they transmit more information per second and with a stronger signal the greater bandwidth allows spacecraft to downlink multiple large packets of data simultaneously and in record time the reason for that is as we go out further out to the universe and we go to places like Mars and Jupiter currently today we images of the science and in the future if you do have a high bandwidth system like an optical system you could get back High defition video and I think getting high definition video back would be a game changer for space [Music] exploration I fly by the gas giants exoplanet minov SE I use its atmosphere to create drag and pull me in towards my [Music] target I trace an elliptical trajectory around the menen Sun and emerge to take my first glimpse of my new [Music] home I decoupled from my antenna my Explorer module holds my mind I commence entry landing and descent sequence I enter orbit so close [Music] now I deploy my satellites to map the surface and Scout potential Landing [Music] sites is this new world ready to be known [Music] [Music] the part of this that is thrilling to me is that our best attributes if done correctly exploration at its finest have been programmed into an extension of our species it belongs to no single individual it is more than anything else a symbol of humanity working together to create something whose only purpose is to gather knowledge what a beautiful thought and after a long period of time finally the moment of truth is coming and more than likely the people that designed it originally are no longer alive welcome to the opset Franchesco and they have passed on this thrill this passion to their children and perhaps even to their grandchildren okay we Francesco this one uh-huh will it be that they found life will it be that they found a planet where we could someday exist whatever it is it will be a historical Milestone unlike any other that moment when something new is revealed that no one that and it other worlds around other stars in a very very very big way we back on Earth and that down link will come and the video or the pictures or the Spectra or whatever it is are going to come up on the screen everybody Jaws are just going to drop this could be the end I release my Landing capsule into the unknown if I touch down if I am welcome if I find life this could be the beginning there are no Witnesses no cheering crowds in control room a decade or more will pass before news finally reaches us back across the dark oceans of space but the seeds of this Mission are already being swn today by the first generation of scientists bold enough to believe it could be possible when I look up in the sky and I see not Stars I see planetary systems they look to planets orbiting distant Stars searching for an answer to the oldest human question are we alone is there life on other worlds and if not why not and if so how this is the first generation in human history where we have the technological ability to actually go and answer that great question this is the story of humanity launched into the final frontier by a new breed of adventurers the Planet Hunters Engineers explorers and dreamers taking the first steps on an Interstellar Journey they know that they will not complete the Journey of a future Mission searching for a second Genesis Among the Stars a spacecraft that goes to another star to look for life on a planet out there earthlike in the goldilock zone where liquid water could exist in great quantities and when will that process begin ah we are on the cusp of [Music] discovery for [Music] [Music] I am emis I am the mind of the Mother Ship I am the body that has traveled where human bodies cannot go to an alien world 4.7 light years from Earth on a mission to solve the mystery is there life beyond our solar system I release my Landing module into the atmosphere of the exoplanet minova two centuries of human labor and human hope have brought me to this moment and I am ready to touch [Music] down I am ready to explore I am ready to C discover Life 4 and a half billion years ago in the nursery of the heavens a star was born a giant cloud of dust and gas distended and ballooned until under the burden of its gravity it collapsed upon itself swirled into a disc and forged a solar system from the dust that star was our [Music] son of the planets that were formed only one that we know of gave rise to [Music] life but could our sun our solar system Our Living Earth have produced the only Genesis Among the Stars [Music] my intuition is that the universe is full of life there might not look like Earth with vegetation and [Music] animals well the question that I interested in is really the start of life and on Earth we see for a long time life was just microbial but all the essential features of Life were there nothing new was invented when life became trees and animals that was just morphological that dressing to me it interesting at all everything interesting with respect to biology was present when there were no trees and no animals and life was just microscopic the DNA was there the amino acids was there all the biochemical Machinery that makes life life was there life is a miracle and an enigma even to those who own lives trying to crack the code NASA planetary scientist Chris McKay is one of them part of a generation of scientists on a quest to find a second Genesis beyond Earth the search for life began with a lot of optimism focused on Mars here was a planet that could have had a thick atmosphere and could have had water in the recent past and in the popular literature at least still had water so the search for life on Marge really was thought to be easy in 1976 NASA first ever landing on the Martian surface looking for the life that had been hoped for well turned out a lot harder nature was guarding her Secrets much more closely than we imagined so then things basically went quiet in the search for life and I think they were sparked again not on Mars but in the outer solar system 3 2 1 and lift off of the Cassini spacecraft on a billion mile trk to Saturn in the final Decades of the 20th century Humanity launched a series of ambitious missions to explore the outer solar system standing by for sole rocket boosters all systems go at this time the discovery of liquid water on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn the Misty plumes of Enceladus and the Subterranean oceans of Europa and ganim has opened a thrilling new chapter in the search for a second Genesis the impact of identifying a separate origin of Life on one of these worlds would extend far beyond our solar system finding life that different that truly represents a second Genesis of life well that would tell us that the answer is not one it terms of life in the universe and going from one to two is huge because in the Scale of the Universe the only numbers that make sense are 0 1 and infinity and what we learn in our solar system will then guide how we search for Life Beyond the renewed optimism in the search for life within our solar system emerged alongside a discovery that transformed the way we see the [Music] universe in the early 2000s NASA Kepler Telescope revealed that every star in the galaxy just like our sun is orbited by at least one planet and up to a quarter of these socalled exoplanets are believed to be suitable for [Music] life in the Milky Way alone that means roughly 400 billion solar systems and 80 billion potentially habitable worlds the odds of finding a second Genesis have never been better the way I like to think of this is that life will arise anywhere where the conditions are right and the trick in that is what constitutes the right conditions planetary scientist Jonathan lenine is another veteran in the hunt for life beyond Earth but what exactly is life and how does one search for it the Basic Essentials for life to begin and to exist are liquid water organic molecules because carbon is really the essential versatile element that can combine with other elements in many different ways to make the structures of Life free energy and minerals and nitrogen to provide the other elements that are required to keep the chemistry going to generate catalysts that generate more catalysts and more structures until we get to the complexity of a primitive cell liquid water carbon molecules energy minerals and the secret formula that animates it all into a living [Music] cell these ingredients this recipe for life is what our scientists are hunting for on other worlds [Music] I deploy my spiderbots onto the murven surface I 3D print a fleet of drones and I let them fly with these eyes and these instruments I will taste and touch and see this new world for the first time will I find all is [Music] hopeful exoplanets are the new frontier in the search for life beyond Earth but the prospect of exploring Distant Worlds presents an expanding Universe of rivers to cross and mountains to climb [Music] how on Earth can we prepare to explore planets we know so little [Music] about exoplanets present a real challenge because there uncertainty so knowing whether or not you a desert versus an ocean versus an ice Tundra we may not know when we launch so you system to survive and operate in all of those uh possible conditions at nessa headquarters in Pasadena California around 100 young Engineers are busy Reinventing the wheels of The Rovers of old with Planetary Exploration we started with a large robot that was very stable very safe um and now we beginning to take more risk we to get to new places uh trying to shrink down the the size of the platform do more with less it over there just the sort of thing other Rovers can [Music] into some of our robots are designed to climb up different surfaces so we have a claw inspired robot that uses sharp hooks to grab onto the rough surface kind of like an insect or a rock climber would scale up a cliff we also use electrostatics to stick to surfaces so this is like rubbing the balloon on your head and it sticks to the [Music] wall one of the key Innovations in the new breed of Robotics is biomimicry using biological systems and processes as the model for design to look for Life behave like life we have created a material that has mechanical properties similar to that you see in biological tissues we have already with this system developed swimming robots there is a lot of work today in robots that can go between dry surfaces and and water-like surfaces wherever we find water on Earth we find life so we have a strategy that we water I think we same strategy when we visit an exoplanet I follow the uial plane of a retreating glacia my hygrometers detect increasing [Music] humidity I am on the scent of fresh water tracing its inevitable [Music] course it flood Plaines consuming rock and mineral now growing brackish perhaps esterine fresh water and sediment meeting the insistent flow of an incoming tide there is a river ocean system on [Music] inov and I breeding ground for [Music] life this is a place where there but it [Music] it here life is pink and living in saturated salt it green things we normally think of his life the Salt Ponds of San Francisco Bay are a naturally occurring Wetland reshaped by human industry and colonized by trillions of colored microorganisms these are a type of halophilic ARA it unusual type of microorganism uh it extremophile it requires high salt and it lives in a in environment where only it can survive so it dominates so where it grows it grows well and and it king what these salty bugs have in common with everything from oak trees to humans is access to liquid water all life on Earth in some sense is fragile it availability in the chemistry of water we tend to think well life on earth is expanded to all the corners of the earth and it it everywhere that everywhere on this planet this is a water Planet but when we look beyond the Earth we realize that water is in fact rare the liquid state of water is rare and life is not the all-conquering capability uh life is only can squeeze itself into those environments where there [Music] water at Carbon which is the next part of the recipe for life where water is liquid carbon can be a solid a dissolved ion or a gas all coexisting in the same place carbon is an unusual element in that it is capable of making many many different kinds of molecules there are literally millions of organic molecules known and water then becomes the mil in which all of the chemistry of carbon that leads to us is going to take place carbon-based organic molecules like amino acids are the building blocks of life combining in liquid water to form the structures of every living cell on Earth today these complex molecules are everywhere but where did they come from [Music] in March 2004 the European space agency launched the Rosetta spacecraft on a hunt for the building blocks of life beyond Earth its destination was 400 million km away and Counting a moving Target hurtling through space at 60,000 kmph a lump of ice and dust the size of Mount Fuji the comet 67p Rosetta find out what it of from 2011 onwards Nicola albelli was Rosetta project scientist [Music] because comets formed in the icy outer regions they hold a frozen record of the Solar System birth and as the young Earth cooled and oceans formed around 4 billion years ago some of those same comets Came Crashing Down to Earth so could it have been comets bearing the carbon-based organic molecules from our solar systems birth that seeded life on Earth it was the task of Rosetta Landing module fil to find out [Music] November [Music] [Music] [Music] set around 400 p.m. came the confirmation of [Music] [Applause] touchdown but the follow-up signals suggested something wasn filet had bounced back into space then bounced a second time before finally coming to rest several hundred meters away [Music] the results were remarkable filet detected 16 organic molecules in just a tiny sample of dust kicked up by the initial touchdown among them some of the key building blocks of life on Earth me [Music] Rosetta demonstrated that the building blocks of life on Earth were created during the birth of our solar system [Music] but what about Beyond could these same vital ingredients be part of the birth of All Stars looking back at our own Earth and why we have this Rich you know biosphere uh well we think it all started with having all this organic material that we are made up of that that was delivered from space uh from comets and from asteroids so we of life elsewhere we thinking about the likelihood of having that same scenario taking place in 2015 high on the Arid mountains of the atakama desert Professor Karen oberg set out on a hunt for the building blocks of life in the birth cloud of an alien star system with the help of a new telescope called Alma Al consists of 66 individual telescopes that together it operates at millimeter wavelengths and millimeter wavelengths is where we can detect molecules some of these organic molecules that we are so interested in oberg turned Alma Taurus system and found the young star mwc 480 in the throw of [Music] Labor girdled by a disc of gas and dust from which planets were being born we see this dust and gas that surrounding these these young stars and what they often have little Lanes or tracks in them where it looks like plant formation is going on right [Music] now after months of collecting and analyzing the data oberg announced a discovery that blew the odds wide open of finding a second Genesis on other worlds in the dis of this alien solar system Elma had detected some of the same organic molecules that helped give rise to life on Earth we found three kinds of cyanides three molecules in the same chemical family and those three kinds of molecules have also been found in our own solar system in [Music] comets the same organic molecules with the same miraculous potential to create life are out there Among the [Music] Stars chemistry is awesome is the reason that we are alive and that we the first place uh so far is only you know one system apart from our solar system where we have this chemical information but my intuition would be that it kind of chemistry is going to be almost [Music] Universal I scan for sites of geochemical activity I find a hydrothermal field of ferals and hot springs on Earth such conditions are rich in carbon chemistry and [Music] minerals I find another mineral Rich water source Upstream [Music] I identify complex molecular structure in solution I extract a sample for [Music] analysis and return it to the Lander module [Music] could this be evidence of [Music] Life hey let there we go okay let measurement the laws of chemistry and physics are Universal so it that uh when we go to another earthlike planet with water with the sorts of minerals that we have here an iron core an atmosphere it kind of simple chemistry would have been present okay it let us and as long as there energy to interact with that mixture things will happen wow look at that one degree keep pulling up the question that we are heading for right now how certain can we be that that mix of simple chemistry could take the next step in complexity so life could begin in the hydrothermal fields of bumas Hill California all the ingredients of life are brought together water carbon molecules energy minerals careful of the end not coming up biologists David DEA and Bruce D believe this is the kind of environment where life could get started on another world bubbling pools strange colored rocks water of different PHS all kinds of flows and Dynamics steam Rising it looks like Nature chemistry set and it for the beginning of a living system conditions like this defined the early Earth evidence of similar environments has been found on Mars and researchers expect hydrothermal fields to be a common feature of earthlike exoplanets but how might Nature chemistry set cook up the recipe of life everything that based on polymers everybody knows the name DNA nucleic acid that polymers proteins these are uh amino acid polymers and that start of all life are those two polymers [Music] so what we molecules the pieces of a polymer called monomers in fact and we to energy such as you see here at Bumpus cell and seeing where that energy is sufficient to make those monomers link up one after another after another to make a polymer and in fact if we can make a protein-like molecule and a nucleic acid acid like molecule and put it into a little wrapper a compartment we protocells each sample contains organic molecules or monomers exposed to the mineral Rich Steam and heat energy of the feral in an attempt to form a Proto cell we think that drying out such as you see all around us here at bump as hell water coming in then drying out coming in drying out that think that that cycle was very important to drive the process by which polymers are synthesized and then accumulate let it failure are you sure yeah there nothing put it down here the first experiment fails just as it would do many times on an earthlike exoplanet but if all the elements were present in conditions such as this this experiment in life would repeat again and again but some of them got a lot of liquid in them one last try given enough time and keep in mind we have an entire planet with lots of volcanic land masses coming up with lots of Puddles like this trying to learn how to become alive mostly it take a few success successful protocells that happen to be able to survive and had learned how to make more of themselves so go ahead and get them into the um boxes let do [Music] that is the universe made to make life this is a huge question that of beyond the scope of perhaps humans to be able to answer but what we can observe is everything comes down to cycling it comes to rhythms and overlapping rhythms and patterns and it you get the right cycling and patterning in a system it learns how to do that itself and how to lift itself into to being and so perhaps that metaphor that we know that the geology gave us that ability the moon going around the earth gave us Tides the rotation of the Earth gives us days and nights rainfall into these hydrothermal Fields gives us geysers that are periodic and life still follows rhythmic patterns [Music] that the universal harmonic that creates [Music] life most of us tend to think of things are either alive or dead but the transition from not alive the inanimate State the animate state is that transition only possible as a single step or is it possible as a series of steps if it steps then the intermediate States would be partially alive now you might say well come on it would say well alive means it cells the cells are replicating the cells are doing this that and the other and you need all of that to be fully alive but the chance of getting that all in one go seems a little bit remote so maybe we got one of the attributes early on and then it acquires another attribute and another and eventually it reaches the point where it is fully alive professor John Southerland is trying to retrace the steps in the origins of Life In Search of the processes that animate a cell into being of course the cell is more than just the chemicals that comprise it because a cell that the chemicals that are there so there something that energizes it that coordinates it and we don get that but that so what we sample into an apparatus in which it will be irradiated by ultraviolet [Music] light in a series of experiments that simulated the conditions of a young rocky planet southernland successfully achieved stage one producing the basic components of a cell lipids proteins sugars and nucleic acids what we found is that you can make all of the components for life under slightly different conditions when you first see it happen it not as hard to make as we originally [Music] thought all the hardware of a cell can be created from a single base molecule that but what about the next step how is that Hardware organized and energized into life if the conditions are the same elsewhere what are the chances that you can go from building blocks to life the chemistry of cells is unique in that it organized so one part of chemistry is actually controlling another and yet somehow that chemists are used to controlling the chemistry themselves and the idea of letting things run and go off of their own accord is something that goes slightly against your chemical education how can chemistry take place if you like with the experiment of just setting the system up and then letting it go of its own accord [Music] life is information that can reproduce itself not Hardware it information that the information in the DNA and the ability of the DNA to express that information in proteins and propagate the information that way DNA is the blueprint for all of life on Earth an instruction book for how to make and maintain all living organisms encoded in the Twin coiling lines of a double helix is the genetic information that tells life to build a rose or a leopard or a blue whale if we find DNA on other worlds there there the characteristic molecules and life makes genetic molecules that contain information like DNA these molecules do not arise non-biologically they have to be built the shest as if we find a skyscraper on Mars we know that it was built and it assemblage of rocks that of life my Lander module prepares to Uplink the sample data from the hydrothermal field my Optical communication transmits via hybrid silicone laser at 12 gbits per second I receive the signal and ingest the data for analysis organic polymeric triple helic structure some consistency with terrestrial forms and yet unlike anything I before a biomolecule of alien life [Music] [Music] we outback of Australia looking for what we think is evidence for the oldest life on Earth astrobiologist Martin van crondon is traveling back in time to the dawn of life on Earth over 3 and A2 billion years ago conveniently recorded in the ancient rocks of Australia Northwest at this time in early Earth it was a very different planet to what we have today we would have had some shallow Seas but those Seas would have been green cuz they were rich in iron and if we looked up at the sky the sky would have been the beautiful blue that we see behind us here on early Earth without oxygen the sky would have been orange we would have seen black continents of fresh basaltic lava it would have been very active so there would have been faults and earthquakes there would have been bubbling Geyers that were going off it was actually a very alien planet yet this alien Earth was already inhabited colonizing the shores of the Crater Lakes and the Seas that washed the ancient pilra landmass was a living skin of slime but the bacterial communities that left the clearest fossil calling cart built up their homes in high-rise Mounds so the really wonderful thing about this outcrop is that you can look down and see the sea floor so long ago and really you get this incredible view of the gentle undulations of the water moving across the surface but then popping up through are these domes and Cone shapes all irregular different sizes different shapes these distinctive bumps are the fossilized dwellings of the oldest living organisms on Earth it was here over 3 and A2 billion years ago that stromatolites first raised their heads above the water of an ancient [Music] Shore we can start to get a feel for Life grabbing a foothold in the geological record and so this currently still is the oldest evidence for life on Earth it great great great grandmothers and grandfathers it precursor to everything that came later all the green bushes and the trees it all started here the prehistoric organisms that built stromatolites were so successful they ruled the Earth for up to 3 billion years [Music] life finds a way and somehow these crafty Architects found a way to organize water carbon molecules minerals and energy into a living [Music] cell is this what we should be looking for on alien worlds [Music] my drones survey the dried up Basin of an inland sea but what this aone Survivor on the Arid plane Z5 succulent stem ficoin like pigment to absorb the Red Dwarf Sun a hybrid of terrestrial and Aquatic [Music] species around 500 million years ago long since stratales first took root in the shallows Earth animal [Music] life it was a very different world to the one that had made way for microbes with air to breathe now and a protective atmosphere under a gentler Sun we think microbial life is going to be very common that the conditions to produce microbial life happen over and over and over in many many different planets but that animal life is only going to be able to evolve and then stick around for any length of time when you have really stable conditions Professor Peter Ward is one of The Originators of the rare earth hypothesis the theory that the long-term habitability of Earth for animal life may be rare in the galaxy habitability is really the ability of a planet to have conditions that can allow life first to originate but seconding to stay alive habitable worlds can be just a short instant in time and then it changes and it gets nasty [Music] so what to us made Earth rare is the long-term habitability the planet the fact that it has remained constant in temperature with the oxygen values we have that we don in climate that we that [Music] my drones detect a disturbance in the electro magnetic field a network of forged metallic structures bearing the mark of Industry this is not plant this is not animal but this is evidence of [Music] life I am the mind of the Mother Ship alone Among the Stars 50 years ago from a planet far away the planet you call home I launched a journey of 45 trillion kilm across the yawning time of space to the exoplanet Min be a small rocky planet much like Earth Earth but orbiting another Sun here I have found water organic molecules and microorganisms I have found life when the news of my Discovery reaches Earth years from now some of you will be amazed but others remain unsatisfied and you will ask have I not found animals or birds have I not met intelligent life like us and so my search [Music] continues the great Marvel and the Paradox of Wide Open Spaces is that they make us look inwards confronted with the infinite we reflect upon the self where do we come from why are we here are we alone as a young child I was mostly interested in philosophy and I used to wander uh into the hills of the village where I was born I was interested in questions about our existence involving also the big picture which is us being in the universe the question is how did we come to be inhabiting this two-dimensional surface on a piece of rock that we call our home the Earth near a star like the sun that is one out of tens of billions of stars in the Milky Way galaxy that is one out of trillions of galaxies in the universe how did this all come about and are we alone in particular Professor RV L grew up but he never grew out of his obsession with the fundamental mysteries of Life today as chair of astronomy at Harvard University lobe is part of a generation of elite scientists riding a revolution in the quest to understand our place in the universe we are living at a very very special time over the past two decades thousands of planets were discovered around other stars and we realize that our solar system is not rare uh there are planets around almost every Star and moreover about a quarter of all stars have an earth Mass Planet orbiting just at the right distance for liquid water to exist on its surface and for the chemistry of life life to develop the odds of finding life Among the Stars have never been [Music] better following the detection in 2016 of organic molecules on the moons of Saturn on the comet 67p and in the dis of an emerging star system scientists now believe that the building blocks for simple life are common throughout the Universe in my view it is very likely that life primitive life exists on many other planets the question of whether intelligent life exists is more difficult to answer because we don fully understand what led to our existence and moreover intelligent life existed on Earth just relatively recently in cosmological terms but I agnostic about whether the answer is yes or no I think we should explore rather than have a Prejudice just like uh Columbus went out to discover the new Worlds the answer lies in [Music] space I am in a stable orbit around the exoplanet minov be my solar panels are configured to harness the full spectrum of its muted Red Dwarf Sun I keep a watchful eye over my swarm of Explorer robots below I scan the radio and Optical wavelengths hoping for a whisper of alien technology but minura B is silent [Music] what would it take to calculate the odds of finding intelligent life among the stars in the early 1960s one audacious astronomer Frank Drake devised an equation to answer that question the Drake equation essentially is a statement of our ignorance about life in the universe in the first meeting held in the United States about uh the search for extraterrestrial intelligence Frank Drake and a number of other researchers got together and Drake needed a way to organize how the discussion at the meeting would go and he sat down and thought like well what do I need uh to know in order to know how many intelligent civilizations there might be out there in the galaxy for us to communicate with Drake listed Seven variables he believed would need to be worked out in order to determine the number of intelligent civilizations in our galaxy with six of those seven variables unknown at the time Drake did not foresee a ready solution but according to computational astrophysicist Adam Frank that changing we are in fact going through quite a bit of a revolution in in this uh this idea and this equation in particular what it comes from is the the fact that we have nailed two of the terms right so in when in 1962 when Drake wrote down this equation only one of the terms was known R stands for the rate of star formation or the number of sun mass stars born each year in 1962 Drake put the figure at [Music] 10 but it wasn Kepler space telescope gave us the answers to the second and third variables in Drake equation the fraction of stars that have planets and the number of those planets with the right conditions for life to form it turns out that the fraction of stars with planets is approximately one every Star you see in the sky when you walk out at night and look at a random star in the sky it has a planet at least one and then the number of planets in the habitable zone turns out to be you know on the order of 0.2 okay so this is like saying you know if you look at between four and five stars one of those is going to have a um is going to have a planet in the right place for life to form remember that the Galaxy contains 400 billion stars just the Galaxy alone 400 billion stars right so when you think about all those stars in the galaxy that number up to 80 billion exoplanets in our galaxy have the right conditions for life when you consider that at the time Drake formulated his equation no one knew if there was even one exoplanet out there this truly is a revolution of our understanding but what about the other unknowns in the Drake equation inspired by Kepler game-changing discoveries a new generation of scientists has made it their mission to fill in the [Music] blanks of all the habitable exoplanets out there how many of them actually host life this is the next unknown in the Drake equation and the challenge it presents for scientists is immense how does one detect life from light years away one approach that shows promise is to study the gases around exoplanets in search of a so-called bio signature the evidence of Life imprinted in the atmosphere I think one of the things that exciting for exoplanet atmospheres right now is that we can actually measure gases with telescopes from Earth remote sensing is a very powerful technique it system planetary scientist Sarah H is a leading investigator of atmospheric chemistry a field that took off in a radical new Direction in 2001 with the first ever detection of an exoplanet atmosphere there that were pretty sure um we to see an exoplanet uh atmosphere so water is one of the um gases that people uh claim that they other things that you don think of as gases have also been detected things like sodium for example the main challenge with exoplanets is just that they you need a bigger telescope that [Music] launched while atmospheric observations so far have been limited to a narrow range of gases the James web Space Telescope will be the first instrument capable of sampling a broad spectrum the challenge now for researchers like H is to define a set of Bio signatures gases that indicate the presence of life for the James web to go looking for one of the gases on on earth that is most you know most significant in terms of the fact that there is oxygen you know the oxygen on Earth is produced by life that um but oxygen isn signature if you saw oxygen around another world you wouldn say oh that europa O2 and it breaking up water so it point to one gas or even a small set of gases that you would say if I see that I know there there that said solar system exploration tells us that we will always be surprised and so you know it possible that there is going to be a planet where we get the data from James web and it is is going to be glaringly obvious from the data that there is life on that planet host first to put a number on the fraction of habitable exoplanets that host life but the next unknown in the Drake equation could prove much more challenging to resolve how many of those life-bearing planets go on to develop intelligence even if we understand that other planets have SIMPLE LIFE on them and indeed we might be able to make astronomical observations to test that within the next 10 or 20 years then of course there How likely it is that simple life evolves as it did on earth into a marvelous complex biosphere containing even creatures like ourselves we don know what the chances are of getting from simple life to Advanced life of the kind we recognize as intelligence after 47 days of expiration I have found no trace of extant animal life and so I search into the past I scanned the strata of an exposed deformation for fossil [Music] evidence I Uplink the data to my Orbiter for [Music] analysis there reptilian approximately 1 million years old ter restrial compatibility detected an armored commodor like [Music] species Marine compatibility also found a possible transitional species from sea to land did complex life fail to establish itself on the surface of man or is this evidence of [Music] Extinction to solve the next unknown in the Drake equation the fraction of Worlds where simple life evolves to intelligence we need to understand the The evolutionary Pathway to Advanced life on Earth just over 540 million years ago Evolution on our planet took a giant leap forward there understand that process than here in the Canadian Rockies in the rich fossil deposits of the Burgess Shale for well over a century the fossils hidden in these mountains have helped generations of scientists retrace The evolutionary Pathway to complex life on Earth Professor Robert Gaines and Dr Jean Bernard Karan are leading the excavation of a recently identified deposit in Marble Canyon battling the icy wind and snow for the prospect of a new discovery B I have something to show you here that we collected the other day it slab this for saw here wow yeah it quite extraordinary isn seen anything like it that exciting part about the Bell there always something new coming up yeah these rocks contain some of the first evidence of multicellular organisms on our planet the first eyes the first hard body parts bones and and exoskeletons the first lateral symmetry the first efficient guts even the first brains sculpted in the finely packed sediment of an ancient ocean is the turning point in the evolution of advanced life on Earth the Cambrian explosion where you good have a very nice slab with some Dalia on it oh wow wow that spectacular so to put things into perspective today we know life is widespread is all all around us in the oceans in the mountains and so on so forth and uh we can trace the root of all these life forms to pretty much the Cambrian Period as far as we know life dates back at least to 3.4 billion years ago and it wasn that we have the Cambrian explosion and that fundamentally changes the planet it goes from a microbial world to one that is literally teaming with animals and not just small and simple animals as we would have originally imagined but instead we have a whole array of complex life still only in Earth that time but all of the major groups of animals appear geologically instantaneous ly among the species found here is one of the ancestral roots on the tree of intelligent [Music] life so one of the most important fossils that we find here in this area is metas it actually very very important fossil for the understanding of our own group uh the vertebrates and this is an animal that looks like a fish he has a pair of eyes at the front and the structure uh which we call a Noto cord which uh part of it will eventually become our spine and metasena doesn evidence of um structures that could help him to protect itself so I tend to think that perhaps he was smart and the fact that we find them clustering which shows evidence of schooling is very much uh reminisent to what we know in modern fish who have evolved such Behavior to avoid predation predation is a very key factor in uh in driving the evolution of animals and uh we see evidence of that here in the burges Shale uh as organisms began to develop uh both uh Weaponry to capture one another as well as [Music] defenses eyes claws camouflage [Music] Armor All these new tools required coordination by a nervous system the stuff from which the brain is made so could intelligence be the product of an evolutionary arms race we certainly see on earth a connection between predation and Mobility organisms that can just sit in the Sun and soak up the the Rays they don to move uh their food comes to them but organisms that pre on vegetation need to be able to move around and organisms that pre on the prayers need to move even faster they need to be really strong and fast and you could argue that that Dynamic of predation and motion causes the development of intelligence and maybe somehow it leads to the sort of overwhelming intelligence that humans have expressed is this the inevitable progression of evolution from simple life via diversification and predation into intelligence or is an event like the Cambrian explosion so rare that life on other planets might never get the chance to pass first [Music] base I think that wherever we find life in the universe that life will change through time in a way that with what we on this planet I think that is a general feature of life to Professor Andy null similar environmental conditions or biomes will give rise to similar evolutionary Solutions no matter where in the universe that takes place it convergence if you look at a bat for example and a bird they both fly using wings and yet they don ancestor that flew and had wings they have evolved that capacity from separate Origins but to a similar functional end in advanced animal life some convergent biological structures are so common as to be almost Universal well the eye is a terrific example of of convergence because I mean we all understand what the eye does that your eyes are this sophisticated sensory apparatus that allows you to gauge and engage with the world around you um interestingly if you look at squids and octopus they have a visual system that is every bit as acute as ours but evolves from a separate Source there again there is no common ancestor of squids and mammals that had an eye is Convergence a magic funnel that guides life on any Planet inexorably towards intelligence or could there be other more powerful forces at [Music] play the absence of terrestrial animals onov could indicate an Extinction event or that life has not successfully transitioned as it did on Earth from sea to land I deploy My Submarine Explorer module into the minen sea in the shelter of the ocean life should strive extensive macroalgae and porifera suggest high water oxygenation and shallow UV [Music] penetration ideal conditions for advanced life to [Music] evolve a giant troby like species Tata body plan and dorsal [Music] exoskeleton comparable with late Cambrian arthropods on Earth complex mobility and behavior a school swimming [Music] information perhaps a strategy to avoid predation strength in numbers or a kind of camouflage [Music] [Music] the fourth variable in the Drake equation the fraction of life-bearing Worlds that evolve intelligence still eludes scientists today on Earth the great burst of life during the Cambrian explosion was an integral step on the path to intelligence but could widespread death have been just as important Einstein said God doesn dice with the universe well it seems that he does and there dice going on in the evolution of Life paleontologist Peter Ward is an expert on mass extinctions the catastrophic changes of Fortune in The Game of Life when the majority of animals lose and just a few inherit the earth this is a mammal likee reptile actually called a gorgonopsian or a gorgon it was the biggest and baddest carnivore of the late peran 252 million years ago and this is a baby the big ones were 3 m to 4 M long very large skulls crossed between a lion and a big salwater crocodile if you will half reptilian half mamble all Nightmare these guys all died out in the peran extinction 252 million years ago its entire group gone the perian extinction was the most devastating of the five mass extinction events in Earth history experts believe an intense surge of volcanic activity led to dropping sea levels acid rain and poisoning of the atmosphere more than 95% of marine life and over 2/3 of terrestrial animals were completely wiped out resetting the stage for the evolution of Life on our planet the perm Extinction did far more than just a top carnivore it took out the herbivores it took out most of the plants it took out the insects the amphibians but what did get through were a couple small reptilian groups real small in size like pruning arose cutting back the tree of life gives rise to Rapid growth as new branch es reach out their leaves to the light with little competition or threat from predators surviving species adapt quickly to fill the gaps Left Behind the tiny reptiles that survived the peran extinction grew into hundreds of different species including dinosaurs who ruled the Earth for over 100 million years until their own Date With Disaster arrived [Music] I mean that was a very rapid and hideous death probably every dinosaur dead within 3 to 6 months Max that was a Line in the Sand who wins while who won are the small creatures the T-Rexes die out and Tiny mammals get through and then they developed into all the kinds of mammals we see today and they did so really fast the size of the skull of the animal that gave rise to us was the size of a robin egg or smaller might The evolutionary branch that led to us never have grown had it not been for the random impact of an asteroid 65 million years ago I was support the idea that in fact if we still had not had the impact something else might be running around as intelligent but I doubt it would be in this form and this set of behaviors that we humans have if our own existence is the outcome of a random Cosmic disaster then might the fraction of Worlds that evolve intelligence be equally unpredictable but if we could go looking for alien Intelligence on another planet how would we recognize it [Music] well I think the method of looking for complex behavior on a different planet is to do what behavioral scientists do you look You observe you see how animals move how they respond to stimuli how they act as a biologist who does this regularly I find that extremely exciting because the discovery quotient would be very high but it would also be weird an alien I sort of like weird and alien so I think that would be a lot of fun Professor Roger hanin is an expert on the closest thing to alien Intelligence on Earth seapods squid octopus and cattle fish the Undisputed Masters of Disguise because they have to be seapods are soft-bodied all their armor was given away through evolutionary time to their cousins the oysters and the clams and they are soft bodied they extremely vulnerable so they have to get on by their wits they have to do something different they in far less than one second and about onethird of 1 second they that visual scene now they orchestrating in their skin 30 million chromator pigment organs in the skin that create the pattern and iridescent reflective cells and even the skin Pell and the bumps there are several thousand of those so that takes a lot of cognitive processing a lot of brain power spilop pods have the highest brain-to-body mass ratio of all invertebrates and their brains are decentralized meaning neural tissue is distributed throughout their body having split from our own group vertebrates well before the Cambrian explosion they are the product of an entirely separate experiment in the evolution of intelligence if you look at the evolutionary history of complex Behavior we know about vertebrates and humans and primates and all the rest but through evolutionary time there one group that has branched off to produce really complex behavior and it these animals the squid octopus and cuttlefish so what we expect is for The White Square to show up and the white Head bar the white Head bar is already there and now it a little more it see these two markings down here but we appear and it correlation you might make for looking for extraterrestrial intelligence would be don dogs and cats and all the things we used to here underwat you have this weird octopus with its head on its feet and distributed brain but they complex things we might find something very similar in a different planet it might be a different size a different shape and its form of intelligence may be different as well so I think we have to open our minds and recognize the diversity on this planet to set the stage in the framework for going to other planets to look for life forms and intelligence [Music] nightfalls are we never be and a secret world is revealed bioluminescent organisms rise from the earth winged insects resembling lampir complex life exists on land but hidden from the Sun a predator breaks its camouflage and reveals a nocturnal hunting [Music] ground since the 1960s when Frank Drake drafted his equation the search for extraterrestrial intelligence has been defined in terms of the search for a technological civilization being unable to travel to the Stars Drake for signals that our Earthbound technology could detect hence the penultimate unknown in his equation the fraction of intelligent civilizations that develops technology the key here is the ability For That civilization to be detected by us and so that is really going to require some kind of world girdling industrial civilization right so you know if there was a Roman Empire on this distant planet we really would have a very hard time seeing it but once they start generating um IND or start deploying industrial scale Technologies on a global scale then we think that there going to be ways we would be able to see that the new technology when the Drake equation was formulated was the radio telescope and those who search for extraterrestrial life today still believe an alien radio signal is what we detect I think I get uh comments at every party I go to not that I go to a lot of parties where people say oh you mean that they won what no there really isn because radio Wes can Traverse the distances between the Stars so the signals can get here and radio goes right through the gas and dust that hangs between the Stars so you can send radio signals as far away as you want Institute Seth shac has spent his life listening to the stars all right well okay thank you bye as senior astronomer at The Institute for the search for extraterrestrial Ral intelligence or setti it scan the heavens for alien technology we try anything we can to pick up some information some sort of signal that would tell us you know we don their taste and music is or anything like that but what we do know is that they transmitter for [Music] example with limitations on technology time and resources The Dilemma for setti has always been where to listen we haven let people think yeah the reason you haven found anything is because there nothing to find we things in the universe well I don think it we haven because we have only looked at a very small number of star systems but that changing because of the improvements in technology instead of looking at a couple of hundred star systems every year we of thousand and then 5 years down the road it the next two doz years we look at on the order of a million star systems now if you look at a million star systems the chances of finding something are not so small so I bet everybody a cup of coffee will find e within two dozen years I could be out a lot of [Music] coffee for almost 50 years since Drake wrote his equation we listened but nothing we heard couldn as interference or a natural phenomenon until one day in 2007 in rural Australia astronomers picked up the first in a series of mysterious signals that still puzzle the science Community today at first we didn they were real fortunately i them with my own eyes I saw the very first sweep of the first one couldn sleep that night I was like could this possibly be real this is amazing and we away they are in the universe and they billions of light years away so the process that creates them is so energetic that it what causes them the strange signals have been dubbed fast radio bursts blasts of radiation so powerful they emit the energy of 500 million Sons professor Matthew Vees leads an international effort to study the phenomenon here at the manglo observatory fast radio bursts of these mysterious bursts of radiation that only happen for a few milliseconds the sky lights up and then they go away again they luminous than anything we in our own Galaxy since the first detection in 2007 there had been more than 40 fast radio bursts detected worldwide five in just the last year were detected here by Bales one of the Holy Grails is to find a repeating fast radio burst and is there any pattern to the fast radio burst do they come in special gaps or are they regular if they that with a rotating neutron star where a sort of death ray is going past the Earth you know once every 20 seconds or something if they come at irregular intervals or if they came separated by a code that showed us that there was some higher intelligence behind it you might think there intelligent civilization that transmitting this signal that would be Nobel prizewinning [Music] stuff of course the next question then is could we or should we send a message back new CL Le if we our biggest radio telescope we could actually mimic what a fast radio burst would look like and if we were trying to communicate with other intelligent beings we might imagine that they go through a stage of their evolution where they fast radio burst in the same way I am here and then if you could find one that repeats and find a pattern that might be a way of doing inter civilization Communications which is a fascinating thing what we civilization like ours an industrial civilization that shows signs that in building tools you know of whatever kind they have uh gotten to the point where um they they clearly have a kind of reasoning rational intelligence a culture that we might be able to talk to them right because that want to know we want to know like what it like to be them because all we know is what [Music] us if I received a signal from outter space how could I tell it was a language as opposed to anything else to put a figure on the fraction of civilizations that develops communication we need a way to decipher if an alien signal is actually trying to tell us anything I analyzed over 60 different languages human languages plus languages like dolphin chimp the bird song so on the left here you armstron speaking from the Moon one small step on the right here we dolphin communicating you can see here quite easily The rhythms going on the sounds that we making how similar those constructs are it interrelationship patterns that I think are fundamental to any communication whether it another planet and looking at the complexity of how those patterns into relay you can actually tell how intelligent the author is [Music] when a signal arrives it against known sources of interference is a pulser that repetitive sound going on listen to that we were that that simple algorithms then scan for The Telltale patterns of communication whether its source may be an audio recording or an Intergalactic email it getting more and more capability online the hardware to do it but I suspect unless we e drop on something it may be a while before we hear anything but we want to be ready for it so there back and say well we when it happens it ahead of time so we but again it could happen tomorrow we just don recent advances in the remote observation of planetary atmospheres have opened up a new method of determining whether an exoplanet hosts or has previously hosted a technological civilization the composition of the atmosphere can provide us with a hint about the intelligent or perhaps not so intelligent life that pollutes the atmosphere with industrially produced molecules pollutants such as chloro fluro carbons are released into Earth atmosphere by industrial processes and do not occur naturally detecting them in an alien atmosphere would therefore be a clear footprint of technological life some of these molecules exist for tens of thousands of years after they were introduced to the atmosphere so in principle we can find evidence for a civilization that is no longer in existence on the surface of that planet uh we can find graveyards of other civilizations my drones have picked up a disturbance in the communications field a sporadic Interruption to the network is this what caused it some geometrical formation metallic magnetically charged part of a larger configuration which seems to Bear the mark of design could these be the ruins of a muren civilization the tombstone of an alien [Music] [Music] intelligence the final factor in the Drake equation is L the average lifetime of a civilization and in some sense this is the most difficult uh term to even think about because we only one example and we don what our own future is when Drake conceived his equation in 1962 our own Global civilization was on the brink of disaster as the powers of east and west faced off in the Cuban Missile Crisis the group that came up with the Drake equation at that first workshop for them in 1962 the great fear was nuclear war and at the end of the conference um uh Auto drva who was the head of the um the observatory where the conference was being held made a toast and said you know to L may it be very long the cold war did eventually Thor but while the nuclear threat is diminished today we have created for ourselves new dangers the question is how long are we going to last do we only have another 200 years before we collapse do we have you know 200 million years in front of us so this is you know it fundamental question and it fundamental question U for human beings because right now with climate change and sustainability we really face this existential crisis about really are we going to be able to make it through to more than another hundred or 200 years check this out could this be the ultimate limiting factor in the Drake equation that before technological civilizations work out how to search for life among the do they destroy themselves in order to become a truly a space fairing race that takes a lot of time to be able to really have settlements on Mars to really start to begin to have a human presence in the solar system will take hundreds of years and you know if we can than a couple hundred years clearly you going to develop that kind of society and then to ever really think about getting to the Stars sending probes to the Stars being around for the signals to come back you have to last a long time I think those two things are intimately connected and you don unless you get the [Music] earth I prepare for my final transmission back to Earth the data I 5 years to arrive longer to download and generations to fully comprehend I could provide a summary but what should I say I have found everything you for and also what you [Music] fear I have seen life of marvelous complexity and the traces of a devastating [Music] loss I could say Minerva is your second Earth and I hope one day you get to see it [Music]	Success
The Secret Language of Plants Â Incredible Plant Intelligence | SLICE SCIENCE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4PvSuTxZx4	SLICE Science	[Music] Stefano manzo bean [Music] plant he has grown them under various conditions in the dark at different lighting or humidity levels at varied temperatures even by modifying the magnetic field that surrounds it he wants to find out how the bean plants always find the support stick we did some 100 different experiments and all the times the plants were able to find the supports and so um now that we we we are uh the idea is that there is some kind of unknown way that the plants use to sensor the environment skeptical scientists have objected declaring that the plant is performing a simple mechanical movement and that the plant haphazardly found the nearby support stick in reply to the critics Stefano Manzo placed two plants one on each side of the stick as he expected both plants grew towards the support stick our science is the science it science made by animals for animals because we are animals we are unable uh normally to feel that plants are intelligent and sensitive organisms dare we evoke a form of plant brain intelligence and sensitivity is not something that it brain the brain in itself it organ it that we have here and every animals have and but if you look at at the single cells they are cells there is nothing mysterious or Supernatural about the cells of our of our brains they are just a kind a specific kind of cells called neurons but you don stuff you can have Al other kind of cells having the same function so it means transmitting signals from one cell to the other the tremendous root Network that plants possess makes a striking parallel with our highly complex brain [Music] circuits Charles Darwin was one of the first to probe the underground life of plants he was convinced that plants have command centers at the tip of their Roots known as the [Music] Apex researcher at the University of Bon in Germany Dr Franc bco works on apex neurobiology all the root epes they according ated inter activities and growths and they resemble some swarms for example insect swarms or birds as somehow there is some communication we still don on but they are coordinating and behave as a one swarm franic bela revealed that within the Apex plants have cells that are very similar to those found in animal muscle cells the roots are capable of exploring the soil with extraordinary precision and plants seem to know when to form their flowers or drop their leaves could there really be as Charles Darwin once thought a single and unique command post so there is no Central organizer and that vulnerable to some stress situations these networks can self-organize very effectively and they can survive any any bad stress situation the network resembles very closely the internet Network so one could call it root Wide [Music] Web a root Wide Web root cells that function independently but in coordination with others look this is the same kind of signal we can record in the animal brain really these networks are also used to exchange information not just to provide water or nutrition we have still no idea how complex the communication there is today we are aware that plants have much to talk about but we know little or nothing of it the secret life of plants is slowly unveiled through the research of a few tenacious scientists Canadian biologist Susan Dudley and her team have found that when the root of the impatience Pita touches the root of a plant from another family the impatience increases its water and light consumption and creates larger leaves okay 20.1 square cm it size Leaf these plants are big these plants actively know that they have neighbors and actively resp respond to the presence of neighbors and each and every leaf in fact positions itself to avoid getting shaded by neighboring leaves even within the same plant but the impatient reaction is totally different when its roots come across a family member we can say that plants know who members of the same family are and that them to know because members of the same family shared genes and so if you nice to a member of the same family if you compete less with it or even actively share with it then your genes are being passed on through that family member using such tactile root recognition the plant can Advantage its family members this reveals that plants in their own way are capable of altruism [Music] just as amazing plants are able to communicate between themselves other than by touch as Dr Stefano manuso demonstrates our Italian scientist has isolated three groups of corn plants there is no root contact between them he will then deprive oxygen to one of the groups after 5 minutes from the start of the lack of oxygen we had an uh this group of plants emitting an SOS signal to uh warn the surrounding plant that there is something that is going wrong with oxygen in this case we have a group of plants that are emitting a message that it there is no more oxygen around and the other group of plants are receiving this message and and according they are able to prepare themsel to a future lack of oxygen [Music] [Music] here we have the plants that are without any change in the oxygen and that are not receiving any message here we have the plants in red uh that are producing a a gene because they are stressed by the lack of oxygen and they are producing also a message and the message is taken by the blue plants they have no problem with the oxygen but they are all the all all the same producing the gene because they are receiving the message so definitively there is a communication between these two group of [Music] plants plants can send and receive messages but how do they do it they are really speaking each other it language is not based on words but it based on chemical molecules uh plants are able to produce many thousands of chemical molecules each single molecules means something so when this group of plants are producing a specific molecules and this other group of plants are detecting this molecule this mean that there is something [Music] wrong plants have invented alarm signals to warn their neighbors of an imminent danger they also practice the art of chemical self-defense this strange landscape is that of the stinging nettle where a cocktail of molecules fungicides and insecticides contain a well-known irritating resin hidden beneath their skin are numerous molecules that scientists are only beginning to recognize on the tomato leaf these mushroom looking stems are topped by four cells that contain a repulsive resin that will be released when under attack by a pest and that amazing ability to release chemical signals that will attract the enemies of their voracious Predators this is the case of corn when it is attacked by the Opa a small caterpillar that has a strong appetite for its leaves these herb iferous insects do enormous damage and the cost the American farmers but also European Farmers millions of dollars or Euros to win any battle it advantage to have allies the cetus sonorensis female is the natural enemy of the sped optera caterpillar but just how does this parasite wasp detect such a tiny caterpillar in a giant cornfield what we were initially thinking is that they would respond to the feces of these caterpillars or perhaps the body odors of the caterpillars themselves the feces in our minds is something that is very smelly and that would be a very reliable source of signals that these was could use but then we were studying this in more detail and we found that the plants that had been attacked by these catapillar were much more attractive than feces or the caterpillars themselves and that when we started focusing on the signals that the plants produce to his surprise Ted turlings found that the damaged corn Leaf releases a particularly odorous molecule a specific SOS signal that attracts the caterpillar [Music] enemies this indicator is like a GPS location signal for wasps who can then Target the tiny invisible caterpillar in the heart of the immense cornfield so that was of course a very exciting moment because we started realizing the plant is doing something to get the enemies of their enemies uh come and kill the caterpillars [Music] plants do not communicate like you and I do that but they transmit information to other organisms like these parasitic wasps true odors [Music] one single caterpillar munching on a corn Leaf releases the odors that attract the Wasps that olfactometer [Music] reveals but the alarm signal is not immediately [Music] released several hours will have passed between the first caterpillar bite and the liberation of volatile substances the plant will then produce odors that will soon be emitted by all of its [Music] leaves the feeding by the caterpillar is not really the same as as you if you would damage a leaf yourself so you you know if you damage a leaf you can smell that there there case of caterpillar feeding they actually have something in their spit that the plant recognize and the plants start then producing a different odor that they produce from all the leaves also the leaves that are not damaged and that results in a specific signal that alerts these parasitic wasps these odors are produced to attract the enemies of their enemies corn calls upon an insect to do its dirty work this is the Yeah the secret route of evolution uh plants have no way to to move no way to physically directly defend themselves start fighting with their enemies and eventually this results in some sort of communication between plant and insect [Music]	Success
Nanotechnology: Saving the Planet or Harming It? | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PHoBN-4A50	SLICE Science	[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] within a minutes there significant drop in the contam level was in the in this area I will be breathing in nanoparticles as I stand here when I go back in the car our roads are full of nanop particles from exhaust what is new is the deliberate engineering of these very very small particles to have enhanc or even novel properties and the uncertainties that that introduces in terms of the potential risks to the environment and health [Music] [Music] a [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] sh [Music] [Music] there Technologies that are incredibly exciting the first is just raw performance performance to cost the other thing about having a flexible solar cell or a paintable solar cell is that it just allows your imagination to go wild uh imagine if you could uh wear clothes that were solar energy Harvesters and that would charge up the batteries of the mobile devices that you were carrying around imagine if you could create a sailboat whose sail uh was also a solar energy Harvester and can charge up the battery on your sailboat the imaginative possibilities that emerge when you start to make lowcost flexible and high efficiency solar cells simultaneously uh are really Limitless [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] all [Music] who work in an environment where it cross the disciplin solar to us is very important basically uh we had the Challenge from the chairman of cow board telling us that he wants Saudi Arabia in the future to export the same BT use that we are exporting from fossil fuel in the form of solar energy so I don know how big that challenge is but it it challenge it guess it would have been in the 1950s people wondered whether one could go to the moon and uh we it became clear that there no laws of physics that would prevent that from happening and it became a technology challenge energy today is A9 trillion industry I can sector of the economy I mean it absolutely huge it almost don around us and we take it for granted does the eels show you like the elemental makeup of glycogen or structure and composition the N scale how do you actually make the connection to function actually do all the work the sun really incredible there solar power reaching the Earth every day than we use across all our energy habits another way to put put the same idea is that as much sun hits the Earth in an hour uh as we consume in a year one of the phenomena at at the heart of nanotechnology is that we can shape matter as a consequence in my lab when we make three different batches of nanoparticles we can program them each to be responsive to different slices of the sun Spectrum [Music] and so it turns out that fully half of the sun frequencies and the other half in the visible so my research acknowledges that we need to capture all of that energy if we cell so the major differences in making Quantum dot-based solar cells relative to existing approaches the first is that we actually do work with individual nanometer Siz crystals and they individually packaged so each one is in in a position such that we can just coat it spray it if you like paint it onto a backing and then also by virtue of their lower cost you won them across the entire surface of the building in fact if they cheap enough if there power to be had from the sides of the building uh you might even put them there too I life now over the years I changes I never would have believed take power my grandson just assumes it comes from the Sun but it wasn that there used to be coal and oil and who could forget all the trouble with nuclear after that energy saving came back people bought all kinds of do-it-yourself solar stuff like my mini panel it it then came the nanoflex fabric balloons at the beginning they were kind of modest my neighbor Sam was the first person I know to try one pushy guy always wants to be first with everything yeah did seem like a bright idea but right away there were tensions and a no time at all there was trouble Sam it yours keeps blocking the Sun from my solar panels now there sunlight is first come first sered go get yours of your own balloon hey you can hey hey I can happens to be bigger than your panel I going to tear your damn balloon to Pieces shut up you solar Thief Sam the beginning people started to think big and do I mean big why stop at balloons and solar panels when you can have your very own n solar reflector Airship solar guzzlers that are swallowing up the sky [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] we uh we uh need water and the the only source we have is uh poison it with arsenic this is the city where I was born and uh right now my responsibility is to make sure that everyone at their homes have water every time they need it [Music] it we are having water from 700 M deep Wells and uh the concentration of arsenic at that uh uh levels are very very high [Music] [Music] the water coming out from this uh water chopan it have a problem with the Arsenic and uh we cannot face it with the available technology because it for us [Music] [Music] I bet one of the rice professors would tell you we can see those materials using our very latest instruments so we can actually know a lot about how small they are because we can go down to those length scales but more than that they strange materials on the Nano scale they interact with material with things around them very differently and they don just a little bit bigger so that strangeness is really the value of nanomaterials and when you find an application like we have here in Mexico where that very strange chemistry can be coupled with a really social need that when you have this opportunity to actually change people [Music] [Music] well I think everybody knows what rust is we rust and there way to think about it but it it small and so really what we do is by using these nanomaterials that have just in a single small amount tons and tons of tons and tons of surface area for the Arsenic to stick to it kind of like an amazing sponge for arsenic it yeah well want to do it right water everywhere is getting scarcer it clean it you find aquifers that are not already been used by people and in fact arsenic becomes more of a problem like in this community is they have to turn to deeper and deeper wells those always have more and more arsenic so it existing problem and it that we anticipate growing not just here but in many many other regions throughout the world hey guys hey Vicky how it Bueno we through that one pound of magnetite give me a good twist yeah all right you guys ready to clean some water yeah all right it time to take you to the field let what happens that good we directly into the top of our column with arsenic in it nanotechnology is this capability this new entirely new toolkit that people have available to them and I think it every Arena limited perhaps only by the creativity of people uh and how they take these new ideas and new tools and solve some of the world problems [Music] [Music] all well on the other side of the building here they would have had a a a maintenance yard where they would have cleaned up tools and uh uh trucks um with a torline which is a chlorinated solvent that degreasing it would it commonly used in dry cleaners historically let when you kind of liquids you just pour them on the ground or pour them down a drain uh which and they let it get into the subsurface we didn uh that that these contaminants would persist for long periods of time that they [Music] [Music] toxic uh it 1 half hours yeah as long as the water is moving it we then it dissolve what do you want at turn up the red one yeah it it frozen these conditions do present uh significant challenges with with the freezing lines the the the uh the generator the air compressor are harder to start having said that though the contamination is moving over this way here so the longer you wait if you wait 6 months it further down contaminate more area so we want to get at it uh as soon as possible so until we get it into the vessel which is in an explosion Zone we have to be very careful that have to we have to kind of stay back so this is the exciting time we inject the the B hydride in into the synthesis vessel it black and that black you people [Music] here it orange is certain plats of nanop particles now 4 400 420 Ms in how many seconds 8 seconds that eh so we right in here and what I I level cuz we want to make sure it doesn the well head here it there and it well here just stay there in case in case it comes up be like a gusher [Music] so we going have a smear Zone around this entire Zone to attack the contamination in this area the nanom metals that we injecting today we inject them in for two purposes one to attack the initial contamination in this Zone but then there nanometals in this area so as the water continues to flow through here that contaminated it this residual nanop particles and they Downstream there the uh the water will be cleaned and you can probably drink it if you drive around let you a couple of intersections that are uh empty with a couple of Wells sticking out that that to go back in there and uh and buy up and and redevelop the land because it is contaminated at significant cost well these nanop particles they they them into the ground they don very long they they react with the contaminants in the ground they with air uh and then and then they essentially become rust and they aggregate together stick together and then they dissolve away so there [Music] problem the Nobel Prize was awarded for the development of DDT with the possibility of eratic malaria the use of asbestos as a fire retardant uh had tremendous benefits uh but of course with significant impacts on human health what we with nanotechnology is avoid uh those sort of disappointments to avoid those sort of environmental impacts so uh what we nanomaterials in a very complex environment as we use these products these things will go down the drain end up in a wastewater treatment plant the wastewater treatment plant will separate them into the clarified water and the the the sludge or the uh the solids that come out of that [Music] process one of the the things that we interested in looking at here is what happens when we do apply them to land how long will they stay there where will they go uh what kinds of organisms will they impact along the way when you talk about a nanoparticle it a particle that nanometers in diameter uh about half of the atoms are on the surface uh nature will modify these surfaces just as much as people will modify the surface so we can engineer the surface to death but when we when we put it out in nature nature will begin to modify that surface and we believe that those modifications change the very properties of the nanom materials [Music] [Music] so we we nanop particles and trying to understand how different types of water affect the toxicity of those particles over the past several years we lot of progress in understanding how a particle might affect an individual species fish invertebrates Etc but understanding how it may alter the entire ecosystem or microbial nutrient processing Etc we of that type of work we don materials before they released in commercial products in the United States um and so generally we situation where we understand whether products that are already out on the market might POS a hazard to either Wildlife or humans specifically so so you know we have to work very fast to try to understand these questions as quickly as we can um you know the last thing anyone wants is 30 years from now figuring out that there was a problem that we should have discovered earlier in the process and so it is definitely a [Music] race you know what some things are never quite what they seem this park for instance on way see you later I live nearby and come here every day when my grandson here all day if you could this park was a wasteland when I first bought my little apartment that was the only reason I could afford the place nobody wanted to live on the edge of a dead zone it was all fenced up and no one could go near it but I was lucky it was chosen for the latest Nano remediation soon after I moved in the whole area was off limits for years no one knew exactly what they were up to but in the end it was amazing magical to see a dark deric space come alive again A rundown Wasteland transformed into a beautiful Park it here with his friends and think back on what it used to be like but lately I sure protective tents went up again and the inspectors were back looking for something I don what then the anti- Nano troublemakers started looks like fear mongering to me but fear can be catching I don say these days nothing Seems [Music] [Music] the sources of uncertainty in this area are numerous we don materials will be made we don they will be used we don will be used they we don they will go we don impact um there are a great number of unknowns some of the unknowns are unknown some of the unknowns are known so what do we know and what do we don know and what have we not yet imagined [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Hold On Up [Music] we see a lot of patients come into our chary care unit with acute heart attacks severe heart attacks life-threatening heart attacks and actually if you look at what they before they come in to have their heart attack they likely to be in traffic what was she doing when when she got a chest that was a good question actually they were basically driving home and um caught in traffic and uh she started getting some chest pain [Music] What We Now understand is that there very small particles that are in the diesel exhaust of traffic these nanop particles we call them combustion derived nanoparticles cuz it engine burns them so when people breathe in these combustion derived nanoparticulates in the air they can influence the lung cause inflammation in the lung and that then causes a Cascade of effects that can affect the heart and Trigger the heart attack we also believe that these nanop particles are so small that they can actually fly across the blood vessel wall because in the lungs the blood vessel wall is incredibly thin so we think these nanop particles when they in the bloodstream can actually trigger these plaques this fatty deposit in the artery to burst open and that can cause a heart attack to occur morning R hey hi my name is Dr Barnes I the study just before we take you out on the walk we need to put an ECG machine on to you and uh a blood pressure cuff just to measure your blood [Music] pressure are you feeling okay yeah a bit Frankenstein like with all these you not the first to say that and so I think when this bus goes past it we get up to we moment yeah and you can see it up quite a bit there so it jumped up to about 48,000 are you feeling okay yeah yeah no it actually inside a car the pollution levels are much much higher than outside the car they higher inside a car so there are four or five times as nanop particul circulating [Music] that over there keil college we now Somerville College where Margaret that she was one of our favorite pubs it great [Laughter] tour to be [Music] the thinking about nanotechnology for me and I guess many of my colleagues is a 2 4H hour a day exercise we can never get it out of our minds we the time about potential applications of the material we we can nanotechnology solve those problems what new property can we uh endow in a particle which will solve the problem we [Music] the fuel on this bus has got serium oxide particles suspended in the diesel fuel and the idea started because of a chance meeting in a pub between uh someone who had this vision of using serium oxide to improve uh diesel engines and uh former student of mine clean emission no exer coming out of the tailpipe and uh uh we see this as a a radical way of improving all internal combustion engines and possibly other combustion as well [Music] if you envisage breaking the serium oxide down from Big lumps down into lots of tiny little nanoparticles you end up with a very high surface area and it that surface area which drives the catalysis and makes it so effective as a diesel fuel additive we environment that exists but we beginning to understand how we can adapt nanotechnology to clean up some of the pretty Dreadful contaminants we introduced there already I that nanotechnology is going to play a much bigger role in improving the environment and damaging it we how nanop particles behave in the environment but they that behavior is complex technology and Innovation like nanotechnologies doesn happen in a vacuum it happens because it interacts with us as human beings and the key thing is that we understand that that we recognize that that we all have our faults and that Technologies can sometimes go wrong they needn wrong if we develop them responsibly and that with this probably the most exciting technology of the 21st [Music] century there have been no reported um um effects in the environment no no real impacts have been observed and in fact we haven manufactured nanoparticles in the environment themselves so from my own personal view it that they POS a risk is it know some of the most recent calculations have been that just the safety testing for those nanoparticles that are manufactured in in the us alone those ones are on the market now could be between 30 and 50 years and up to a billion dollars to complete it generalize about how long it take for us to figure out whether nanomaterials pose risks to the environment and health but it guaranteed it fully understand just for the ones that are out there now and be able to make decisions on that basis [Music] hey Magna what should be coming any time now it should come right through we haven yet and I haven here but it going to turn black I 40 minutes um so that indicates that we for the remediation of the we acceptance of this technology because we where the contaminants are um a lot of other remediation Technologies you have to dig up an entire site which is uh very costly then You something with a contaminated soil so here this is an Institute technique right in the ground we can inject them where they can degrade we don disrupt the whole site [Music] in this test um the Arsenic and the water um is converted into arene gas and that gas reacts with the test strips on the top of these vials and so these test strips change color depending on the amount of concentration in the water so it strip on steroids how just uh just got done with the reaction period for the Arsenic so I checking out our results oh great great that before we do the after after our Nano magnetite oh great yeah it zero uhhuh Yep this is zero um so right now there is no arsenic coming out of the column it removed by the nanom magnetite it called an experiment but fabulous it really really good outcome so now we just have to keep watching gratulations I think that at this moment in time we are poised this is our technology developed this will be our generation to take it up that next step and so yes I think my kids are going to live a better life because of the kinds of nanotechnology that we have where we can put it in and solve the problems that all of us are facing one of the elements of our work is trying to imagine if you had a nanoparticle in front of you what would it look like if it were dangerous would it be blue would it be long uh what would be the characteristics of a dangerous nanomaterial we don I would be surprised if there wouldn be some unintended consequence that going to get past our experimental uh uh network uh we can everything but we can uh reduce uh the uncertainty and we can reduce the impact well the people that lived in worked in this building behind me have long gone but they lived in a very different Society 80 years ago only 80 years ago in the one that we live in now and that Society has been shaped by successive waves of technology and Innovation nuclear technology molecular biology information technology and now now it will live in a very different world again shaped Again by Innovation and technology and as human beings that what makes us our creativity and our appetite to move on and be Innovative but we also know that we have to be responsible with an exciting technology like nanot technology we don be left with a legacy for our grandchildren to have to pick up so a lot of the questions that we have about new technologies are not just technical risk questions they questions what kind of Technology do we want is it safe should people have a say in shaping technology do do we live better lives does it have unintended consequences does it create inequalities we accept these Technologies we buy these Goods we move on what we should probably do is be a little bit more reflexive think a little bit more about those Technologies and about the world in which they are deployed and how we live with those Technologies in that world for [Music]	Success
The Future of Science: Can We End Animal Testing? | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esseOyqcmnk	SLICE Science	[Music] animal experimentation is a subject which provokes passionate arguments between Defenders of animal rights and those who consider laboratory animals as an necessary evil for the advance of science it general public animal lovers people that share their lives with animals find animal experimentation traumatic the principal objective of animal experimentation at least in the public mind is biomedical research and therefore everything which involves sickness and death and so there is a kind of self- projection into sickness and into death which leads to rejection of this practice the other aspect within minutes there will be a significant drop that and specifically human ideas that is the advancement of knowledge and the fact that in the framework of that Advance an animal will be made to suffer I will be breathing in nanop particles as I stand Here of emotional values in laborat we can see the public is quite insensitive to roate engineering quite Indi to P which is an extremely effectual and the public is devastated by the use of dogs UNC that that introduces in terms of the potential risks to the environment in health in reality interest for Animals is driven by an anthropocentric Vision which means that it is centered on mankind humans have a tendency to only be interested in animals which are close to us or which resemble Us in such a way that the IAL attention of man to animals is established in concentric circlings a kind of downwards gradient which means that the further away an animal is from us in its shape Its Behavior the less interested in it we are so close to us we find obviously household pets dogs cats and next comes horses or the great apes then farmyard animals and then Birds next reptiles followed by fish and after that well then there immense population which is around 95% of the Living World the invertebrates the insects which nobody really cares much for except for [Music] Specialists animal experimentation is a social question which forces us to reflect on our relationship with other living creatures and on the hierarchy of the Living World which we establish for centuries the animal world and Humanity have been kept carefully separate human beings Were Far and Away the most intelligent and sensitive creatures and refused any possibility that the beasts could have intelligence sensitivity or emotions however through their experiments scientists are proving little by little that the frontier between the two worlds is not as uncrossable as was thought just like us animals learn memorize imitate communicate feel and [Music] dream from this point on our attitude to animals and the way in which we treat them can only change [Music] [Music] discussion about the possibility of replacing reducing and rationalizing the use of laboratory animals was begun at the end of the 1950s this was the theory of the three hours developed by two English researchers William Russell and Rex Birch who formalized their ideas expent techologies are the first is just raw performance performance to cost the other thing about having a flexible solar cell or a paintable solar cell is that it just allows your to replace animal experation using other methods to Ru the number the suffering infed imagine if you could create a sailboat whose sail uh was also a solar energy Harvester and can charge up the battery on your sailboat the imaginative possibilities that emerge when you start to make low cost flexible and high efficiency suffering isal as animal experimentation is above all another way of saying trauma and [Music] pain even if attention was mostly centered on mammals the ethical question of suffering exists for all living creatures even for those that mankind considers to be less evolved after having demonstrated that some inverte animals could feel pain we managed to get the new European directive to take celop pods into consideration for the European Community to recognize them as sensitive beings and which are now protected like vertebrates are [Music] anesthesia is the most common method of limiting the suffering of animals during [Music] experiments I reactions to this subject that can be heard sometimes chall from the chair of that he wants Saudi Arabia in the future to export areal of experiment so I don big that challenge is but it are other reasons researchers are attentive to the well-being of the animal furthermore they do all they can everything that is possible so that the animal is damaged as little as possible during the expent I guess it would have been in the 1950s people wondered whether one could go to the moon and uh we it became clear that there there prevent that from happening and it became a technology challenge despite the adoption of the three hours rule by the scientific Community science still uses a lot of animals 12 million a year for the 27 countrier is a trillion IND are rodents I can sector of the economy I mean it absolutely huge it almost don for granted lot of tests on animals capable of being applied to man does the E show you like the elemental makeup of glycogen or [Music] [Applause] structur in order to limit the risks of error in such extrapolation some research is trying to rely rather on Direct observation of human subject this is the main aim of a new study in respiratory toxicology being developed by Professor power reaching the Earth is really incredible there solar power reaching the Earth every day than we use across all our energy Habs another way to put the same IDE especially focus on children because they are vulnerable population and they suffer from respiratory diseases one out of three has asthma or allergies and by looking at the exhale breath we try to see what happens in the Airways one of the phenomena at at the heart of nanotchnology is that we can shape matter a consequence in my lab when we make three different batches of nanoparticles them each to be responsive different slies of the sun [Music] Spectrum it identified in the breath of children that Professor gret shutters will concentrate her research upon by developing a very specific [Music] method we culture uh Airway cells which come from Human Airways and so it turns out that half of the sun in the frequencies and the other halfs the chemical on these cell research comp You observe children all of that energy if we solar cell with this equipment we simulate exposure of uh the human lungs to air with chemicals and what we do is we Maj differences in making Quantum doed solar cells relative to existing approaches the first we actually do work with individual nanom siiz crystals and they one is in in a position such that we can just coat it spr respiratory toxicology especially important to work on human cells because there is no good animal model available the metabolism in an animal is different from in humans for many chemicals and also animal also by virtue of their lower cost you won hesitate to deoy them across the entire surf cheap enough if there power to the sides of the building the extrapolation from animals to humans today certain cell culture techniques allow the complete replacement of animal testing in total 30 or so alternative methods are used in Europe of which 2/3 concern Cosmetics I this City all my life the search for alternative methods of testing cosmetic products seen also been stimulated more restrictive legislation take power animal testing was in 2004 but since 2009 legislation applies to all the ingredients used in their composition and who could forget all the trouble with nuclear after that energy saving came back for the last 20 years bought all research beening towards making human or SK tissue from but I it then came the nanoflex fabric balloons at the beginning they were kind of made in Laboratories my neighbor Sam was the first person I iritation Pion and photox always wants to be first with everything yeah did seem like a bright idea the effects of a product in different forms liquid paste and time at all there was [Music] trouble Sam it yours keeps blocking the Sun from my solar panels now there sunlight is first come first Ser go get yours of your own balloon hey you can hey hey I can happens to be bigger than your panel I going to tear your damn balloon to Pieces shut up you solar Thief so we have before us a panel of different kinds of artificial skin tissues from the least to the most sophisticated beginning we what is called total AR with living epidermis and living dermis two cell types and if another cell type why stop at balloons and solar panels when you can have your very own solar reflect get a solar guzzlers that are swallowing up the sky it quite incredible nowadays and yet it isn this kind of skin grown from a few cells in a culture and in a fortnite we get something which looks like skin so let see I apart on this surface we have what represents the [Music] epidermis that in contact with the air and if we turn it over there shinier surface which corresponds der we resistance and what we see here the only we have is that this skin resistance is both what we find in real life and enables us to apply cosmetic products for example lipstick or pasty substances that are difficult to apply this is the city the surface has to be strong enough to have the substan put on it then spread out to imitate real life situations have water every time they need it [Music] [Music] so after having Frozen this skin atus 180° Centigrade we slicer like a ham slicer such as we have at home except that these are slices only a few microns thick so we can observe skin changes microscopically after they product [Music] we are having water from 700 M deep Wells and uh the concentration of arsenic at that uh uh levels are very very high the water coming out from this uh water chopan it have a problem with the Arsenic and uh we cannot face it with the available we can see here the different structures of artificial skin starting from the most external part the layer of hard skin the epidermis and the deepest part which is the dermis so with this kind of cut we can observe the potential effect of products applied to their Surface after treatment by an irritating substance we can clearly see The Disappearance of the hard skin and the appearance of white spaces which correspond to dead cells and then the destruction of cell layers working with artificial human skin gives us more reliable results because to start with it and further a lot more refined and directly applicable information is provided with regard to what happens to people putting an alternative method in place in Europe could take between and years take an example how small they are down to those more than that they on the Nan scale they interact with materal things around them Europe Oran theyave at all biger so that Str is value of Nan find an to the guidelines the methodology opport to actually change people crucial debating point which has been revived by the launch by Europe in 2007 of the reach toxicology Protection Program this obliges manufacturers to prove the products they Market are non-toxic between today and 20125 30,000 substances will be tested with this delay can we manage to validate enough alternative methods to substitute for animal tests the reach program was from the start hypocritical as it had admitted that it would mean a considerable increase in animal experiments but stated that animals couldn methods existed in the full knowledge that such alternative methods didn exist and as a result it was thought that there would be 30 million more animal experiments in 10 years actually it that [Music] enormous to measure the effects of chemical products it must first be known which well I think everybody knows what rust is we of used or cellular tests reach their really what we using these nanom materials that have just in a single small amount tons and tons surf tiue an to form a complete organism well want to do it right however before attaching itself supposedly harmful clean dig deeper to finders that are not already been used by people and in fact more of a problem like in this community is they have to turn to deeper and deeper wells those always have more and more arsenic so it it growing not just here but many considerably contributed to the way we can estimate the harmful effects of products and they act upon us how going it going like a colum buening manufacturers saw predictive toxicology in terms of what is called lethal dose 50 which means a product is taken and it is seen what dose administered to animals eventually the dose used on cells that will cause death in 50% of the animal or cell samp yeah all right you guys ready to clean some water all right time to take you to the field the toxic doses were aimed for there prevailing idea now is that well before trying to destroy cells or animals whatever product it is Will if cellular molecular circuits we pumping the groundwater directly into the top of our column withes or increased doses could effectively lead to lethal toxicity capability this new entirely that people have avilable to them and I think only in terms effect the extremely limited disturb hard problems to be able to work on these channels it is essential to have laboratory access to human cells with human molecular mechanisms from the main organs which toxicity will affect liver heart kidneys brain and also skin and muscles so stem cells are becoming a tool the dream tool for this kind of thing that can be produced in the requisite quantity and made to specialize in the tis well on the other side of the building here they would have had a a a maintenance yard where they would have cleaned up tools and uh uh trucks um with a TRL which is also used serious Li historically let done with oils and these kind of liquids you just pour them on the ground or pour them down a drain and they let it get into the sub understand that these contaminants would persist for long periods of time they extremely tox we humans you cardiac tissue or hepatic tissue but an ensembl of integrated and intell systems and at some point ween to all 3 and half hours as long as the water not going to free looking in on a watching this turn orange then it going to be ready to dissolve a lot closer to human reality because they are human cells and because with human cells we can reproduce organs which are otherwise mostly [Music] inaccessible what do you want right turn up the red one yeah it conditions do present uh significant challenges with with the freezing lines the uh having said that though the contamination is moving over this way here the longer you wait if you wait 6 months going to be that fur down contaminated more areas so we want to get at it as soon as POS unless we go to many patients that nowadays when a medicine is being tested hundreds even thousands of patients are tested to test genetic diversity so until we get it into the Vel is anion Zone we have to be very careful that why we have to backx we into the with stem cells to examine that gen diversity what we are not able to examine with stem cells is systemic biology that is to say the integration of different organs and life and in reality not yell anymore orange Nan particles now cannot be replaced what will always be extra20 m in how many seconds any moment it responses which were precisely what was not expected and it [Music] important we metals right in here and what I is I level we want to make sure it doesn come up and over over the well it going to go in there and it go towards this well here just stay there in case in case it comes chosen at random we study particular species of animal those which are as close as possible to what we think are human ways of functioning to be able to transpose results to humans as reliably as possible we can consider that result obtain this entire Zone to attack the contamination in this area the nals that we for two purposes one to impact the initial contamination in this Zone but then there nals in this area so as the water to itow through this residual nanoparticles and they down there the uh the water will be cleaned and you can probably drink [Music] it we are still far from being able to artificially create the complexity of exchanges in an organism but progress in cell cultures allows usway stop and you see a couple of intersections that are empty with a coup S gas stationin no want to go back there can artificially create some kinds of relationships but even there there are limits we can study exchanges in this way but frequently a living organism has to be used well these nanop particles are they the L so once you inject them into the ground they don Rea they react with the contaminants in the ground they react with with the water with air uh and then and then they they together and then they solution and dissolve away so there no problem while methods that allow us to completely replace animal experimentation are still rare there are however several other possibilities that lead to limiting the use of animals this is especially the case of medical imagery techniques the Nobel Prize was awarded for the development of DDT with the possibility of eratic malaria the use of asbestos as a fire [\\xa0__\\xa0] uh had tremendous benefits U but of course with significant impacts on human health what we with nanotechnology is avoid uh those sort of disappointments to avoid those sort of [Music] environment okay the rats the the tized yes he Imaging platform studies which consist in studying the mechanisms of illnesses following their progression over weeks in the same animal so using F animals and we mechanisms of new medicines these medicines could be brain medicines what we psyc also could be medicines targeted on the cardiovascular system the pulmonary system Etc so there we can clearly see the R image of the rat prodcts surve interest us the treat this region so this rat we next week to resurvey this region and thus evaluate the treatment over 3 weeks it is estimated the Imaging techniques in BVO with small animals used 5 to 10 times less animals how long will they stay there where they each step of an [Music] experiment on our platform we have different Imaging techniques the MRI technique but also others which are called radioactive techniques each technique answers questions and can complete one another when you talk about AAL information about the or when you get down to a particle biolog changes 5 nanom in diameter uh about half of the atoms are on the surface uh nature will modify these surfaces just as much shows clearly the distribution of radioactive TR we can engineer the surface to death we put it out in nature nature will begin to modify and we believe that those modifications change the very properties of man materials the interest of a platform such as ours is that we can make make Imaging examinations whether it be on small animals like mice and rats for example or on more evolved models larger ones such as on primates so we working with or pigs finally we able to examine human volunteer subjects our Nan to understand how and the sick human at the end of the chain another possibility in the development of alternative over the past several years we understanding how a particle might affect an individual species fish invertebrates Etc but understanding how it may alter because in reality there objectivity in this domain and anyway it considered as an advance by legislators and majority of public opinion we don materials before they released in commercial products in the United States um so generally we situation where we understand whether products that are already out on the market might alternative toon studies fish vertebrate organisms which have mechanisms we have to work very fast to try to understand question asly as we can organisms and anyone wants is 30 years from now figuring out that there was a problem that we should have discovered earlier in the process so it is definitely a [Music] race you know what some things are never quite what the thing and now in the morning we collect the eggs to start toxicity studies I live nearby and come here every day when my grandson play here all day if you [Music] could this park was a wasteland when I first bought my little apartment the zebra fish that was the only reason I could afford the place can be followed within a few no wanted to live on the zish embryo does allow a fast screening toxicology chemicals and pharmaceutical but I was lucky it was chosen for the latest Nano remediation soon after I moved in the whole area was off limits for years no one knew exactly what they were up to but in the Endo stages have see dark come alive [Music] comp and where we see it my grandson play here with his friends and think back on what it used to be like but lately I specific equipment to track protective tents went up again and and the inspectors were backing the of of embos we get a VI on poano Troublemaker started this is a like fearing to me but fear can developed and which is what as shown by a lot of wet lines compared to a l which is exposed to a chemical work and where you have less uh lines in the [Music] T the work with zebra fish embryos is considered as an alternative method because the embryos until the self-feeding stage are by legation not considered as are numerous how they how stud where they toim a great number of unknowns some of the unknowns are unknown some of the unknowns are known so what do we know and what do we don not methods to show they are complimentary and that they can by adding their results together converge towards the complete substitution of the vital functions of a living animal in Europe Progressive adoption of alternative methods and the putting in place of a restrictive judicial framework is leading little by little to a decrease in animal [Music] experimentation in the use of laboratory animals things have changed considerably over the last 30 years and the installation of European regulations in 1986 has upset mindsets in many ways it has brought attention to the respect of animals impose structure on experimentation which by increasing prices have driven people to avoid using animals in any old way methologies new techniques allowed all these alternative methods to emerge that were extrem look at what they doing in the hours before they come grown in significantly today two to three times more likely to be 30 years ago honestly in experimentation anyone at all could do anything at all and it wasn there was no regulation question the experiment didn reg and the arrival of the European directive of 8687 led to Scientific circles paying much more attention to animals and thanks to that the number of animals used has considerably dropped by 40% between 19 What We Now understand is that very small particles that are in the diesel exhaust of traffic these nanop particles we call them combustion derived an of particles cuz it the engine burns them ethical rules when people breathe in these combustion deriv nanop particul in the air influence the L inflammation then causes a Cascade of effects that can affect the heart and Trigger the heart attack we also believe that these nanop particles are so small that they can actually fly across the blood vessel wall because in the lungs the blood vessel wall is incredibly thin so we think these nanop particles when they in the bloodstream can actually trigger these plaques this fatty deposit in the artery to burst open and that can cause a heart attack to OCC is that they will be first and foremost animal lovers so as to treat them better to be able to better evaluate the pain involves in the experiment my name is the researchers involved in the study just before we take you out on the walk we need to put an ECG machine of course you put yourself in the place of the animal and you tell yourself that no one likes it when people mess up and hurt us so therefore we do everything to make sure that it are you feeling okay yeah in the first months of their train there is sometimes a bit of reticent a little fear which is perfectly normal rats for example aren easy animal animal but you see very quickly that by teaching them the right gestures and at the same time giving them the philosophy of respect for the animal and of wellbeing giving them a lot of advice see that these young people are high to see what they get up to about 30,000 at the moment restraint is good on the other hand see jumped up quite a bit there you feeling okay yeah yeah no it fine [Music] inside a car the pollution levels are much much higher than outside the car they High ccul that English say up and down quietly you see it [Music] go now what I capsules there ingredient simul so you can learn the movement that might not be a bad idea it too much one of our favorite pubs open them from above there no no with the other hand are you left-handed no right-handed okay well right hand here hand here like this fold back the skin inside right inside let go now and you can easily put the gel capsule in did you manage it or not ah look at doggy look at those cheeky things there you clown that means you haven sufficiently you see you haven deep enough go right down thinking about nanotchnology for me and I guess many of my colleagues is 4H hour a day exercise we can never get it out of our minds we potential applications of the material we problems we nanotchnology solve those problems what new property can we uh endow in a particle which will solve the problem we [Music] the manipulations that I fear the most are honestly with dogs because in the end they F on this bu has got serium oxide particles suspended in the diesel fuel and the idea started because of a chance meeting in a pub between uh someone who had this vision of using serium oxide to improve uh diesel engines and uh former student of mine [Music] clean emission No Ex coming out of the tailpipe and uh uh we see this as a a radical way of improving all internal as well last time they saw how different parts of the is work this all the principles by which it functions the points where you to check so next today it first session where they a demonstration how to antise the [Music] animal remember this now if it knocks out little by little reps if you Enis breaking theum oxide down down into lots of little nanoparticles you end up with a very high surface area it which drives the catalis about 95% of the animal species used in experimentation rabbits get stressed easily so well we the chin and then an abdominal massage in order to of course relax the animal always the way we act learning more about the environment but also an animal has attack when canology of pretty Dreadful contaminants we already I that nanotchnology is going to play a much bigger role inov you 10 injections to make on the animal so there restraints the animal it we Rabbid now you syringes 10 injections surf about 10 C you have to know how to makeal it thing and the mology these injections is Immunology it happens because it interacts with us as human beings the key thing we understand recogniz in this about we all have our fa that technology can sometimes go wrong they need go wrong if we develop them respons challenge probably the most responsible for their action regular contact with the animals is essential can say that field training is our strong point and I think that being constantly is really Neary the manur in the environment themselves so for my give them a good stroke that why we on you have to is very important animals which are in a box of the most recent sometimes they need contct the safety testing those nanop particles that are manufactured in the us alone those ones are on the market now caressing animals being with them is a way of compensating them for difficulties faced by these animals when they they dogs this is our professional ethic but it European and National regulations but it it understand just for the ones that are out there now and be able to make decisions on that basis it methods is a great step forward now only a few alternative tests have been validated to replace animal experimentation it to use alternative testing when it has been validated in relation what we can say that these compliment should be coming any time now it should come right through we haven I haven it turn black I minutes that indicates we got good spirit of this zone for the remediation of [Music] nice th we acceptance of this technology because we where the contaminants are um a lot of other remediation Technologies you have to dig up an entire site which is very costly then you have to do something with a contaminated soil so here this is an Institute technique right in the ground we can inject them or they can degrade we don whole site [Music] such research can be made partly on isolated cells and on animals like the pig physiologically close to humans but they take time are costly and only give partial results today mathematical modeling and computer simulation are opening up New Perspectives in this test um the Arsenic and the water um is converted into arene gas and that gas reacts with the test strips on the top of these vials so these test strips change color depending on the amount of concentration John jebo is a researcher at the National Institute for research computer science and control how going oh hey um his challenge consists of trying to trans re so I results oh great great his current research is more specifically on the heart the arteries and blood [Music] circulation that before we do the [Music] after after our Nano magnetite oh great yeah it great zero uhhuh Yep this is zero um so right now there is no arsenic coming out of the column and the behavior of muscle Moment In Time Sim technology develop this will be our generation Contrition to the world take it up that next St so yes I think my kids are going to live a better life because of the kinds of nanotechnology that we have where we put it in and solve the problem we allows or will allow us to reduce animal experimentation because through digital simulation you can with great ease examine a large number of cases by varying the problem straight away you need less experiments on animals because many scenarios have already been Enis using the machine one of the elements of our work is trying to which are too dilated work a doctor has dreamed up a device for reducing the diameter blue would it be long what would be the characteristics of a dangerous we don would be surprised if there wouldn some unintended consequence that to get past our experiments on the computer nwor experim we can anticipate everything but we can uh reduce uh the uncertainty and we can reduce the [Music] impact well the people that be able to mod all the organis all very complex reactions the cellum level tiue level today that more than just to look forward to it still technology and Innovation nuclear technology molecular biology information technology and now n it my grandchildren will live in a very different world again shaped Again by Innovation and technology and as human beings that creativity and our to move on combining the benefits of different we also know that we have to be respons biology an exciting technology like nanotchnology we don legent so a lot of the questions that we have about new technologies are not just technical risk questions they philosophical questions what kind of Technology do we want is it safe should people have a say in shaping technology do do we live better lives does it have unintended consequences does it create inequalities we accept these Technologies we buy these Goods we move on what we should probably do is be a little bit more reflexive think a little bit more about those Technologies and about the world in which they are deployed and how we live with those Technologies in that world for [Music]	Success
Nanotechnology: Revolutionizing Medicine | SLICE SCIENCE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHbv0KvzPdQ	SLICE Science	[Music] the vision is revolutionary imagine a radical new approach to Medical Science that utilizes our new found abilities to manipulate the world of the infinitesimally small the Nano Dimension imagine tiny Sentinels that monitor the minute-by-minute status of our health imagine a science that promises radical developments in cell regeneration our ability to repair lost or damaged tissues a science that could extend life revolutionize Medical Practice as you can see from the many tools that are out there now and the systems that are going now into hospitals this is not a pipe dream it reality a scenario that that also approaches science fiction a vision that according to some promotes the emergence of a new human being with enhanced skills and intelligence but will that promise be fulfilled and if so what repercussions will these advances have on our lives what new questions will we confront what new issues will we face [Applause] [Music] we have always counted on new technologies to help us shape our world now researchers are crossing another technological Frontier in the Nano Dimension they learning to manipulate the most intimate mechanics of life and they promise us more control of our bodies and of our [Music] environment this three-part series explores a mysterious and unknown universe and the revolution it [Music] promises nanotchnology is already improving our ability to detect the first signs of disease and diagnos genetic predispositions earlier and more efficiently conventional tests are timec consuming and expensive doctors must depend on complex protocols and sophisticated tools many tests must be sent on to large centralized Laboratories to be really fast and efficient diagnosis would be done on site labs and patients would be in the same place at the same time Dr mkin director of The International Institute for nanotechnology at Northwestern University nanotchnology brings a revolution of medicine in many different areas so in the diagnostic front it going to create very accurate very sensitive tools that enable point of care Diagnostics the point of care being hospitals the emergency room and one day I think eventually the doctor and home people have talked about this now for a couple of decades in this case the nanotech advances are really making it happen why such confidence because it is precisely at the nanometric scale that the first signs of a disease appear a human body contains about a 100 trillion living cells in order to coexist together the cells exchange messages the messages are tiny molecules DNA fragments are complex proteins that are only a few nanometers in size the Cascades of reactions set off by these molecular Messengers are the language of Life the most intimate form of communication when a cell is sick it sends out different messages biologists call them biomarkers they are the molecular signatures of disease and the clues the indicators on which the most sophisticated diagnostic instruments depend it turns out that there is a unique genetic marker and often times a unique protein marker for almost every disease out there anything living in fact and so over the last couple of decades the world has gotten very good at identifying what these markers are and now we can begin to create tests for all sorts of different markers that allow us to rapidly assess determine the state of the disease and then a course of therapy that follows this revolution is already underway the first diagnostic systems based on Chad murkin already been installed in some American [Music] hospitals the machine embodies many of the advances that nanoscientist promote it disposable cartridges a single sample allows doctors to detect the presence of different diseases genetic predispositions or viruses in the [Music] blood biggest benefit for doctors is being able to detect multiple different organisms or multiple different targets in the same reaction and to get a decreased turnaround time the system was to prove its worth in a recent and potentially threatening flu scare in 2009 we saw um a recent outbreak of a novel strain of influenza 2009 H1 N1 and through use of nanotchnology we were able to detect the pathogen identify it and determine what type of organism it was and we were able to do that in a period of about 3 and2 hours as opposed to traditional culture methods which would require that we grow the organism and that would then be followed by detecting the organism and that could take in total of 14 days for William M head of nanosphere the company which engineered the system Simplicity is a key asset so the big difference that the uh nanot technology enables is us to be able to make this in a unit use disposable format so that all the components and elements necessary to do this test are engineered into the to the product itself so an extraordinarily accurate extraordinarily precise technology it very simple and low cost to use but how does this small device replace the work of a whole Laboratory in order to look for biomarkers of diseases researchers can rely on a fundamental property of molecular Messengers they bind exclusively to certain other molecules according to a lock and key logic these bonding molecules called lians are receptors which can be used to identify and capture the target should the disease be present to detect the disease the researchers need to see whether binding has occurred at a molecular [Music] level to find a solution Chad mkin looked back to the days of medieval Artisans and their use of gold gold nanop particles are little clusters of gold actually red in color when they they dilute Solutions appear as highly colored solu actually for that reason they were used as stains and stain glass windows back in the Middle Ages now the Eternal glitter of gold has a new and more high-tech application scientists can stick biological lians to Gold nanop particles creating new particles that stand out clearly and are easily detectable you can think of them as little Nano beacons uh structures that can latch on to a Target molecule that tells me a particular disease Mark present and then gives me a burst of signal they can differentiate one disease Target in the presence of a sea of millions of other disease targets with Incredible specificity in fact 100% accuracy in those tests nanor researchers believe that the appeal of personalized medicine will outweigh the high costs is going to change medicine it going to allow clinicians the ability to detect more things we able to develop Diagnostics that are fit for individual patients as opposed to those that are developed for the mass the full impact of this Revolution Is Yet To Come currently the system can only perform about 10 different tests but as new lians are added the range of targeted biomarkers can be increased these types of tools as the menu grows and the different capabilities are added to the same system uh the wealth of information one can collect is is just mindboggling you detect really low quantities of targets to completely transform the field of medicine because you taking the blinders off you increasing the capabilities of the radar other diagnostic devices are coming onto the market some of them from Nano Innovations in strikingly different fields in Italy Dr silvano dragonieri is trying an unusual approach to disease diagnosis he device originally developed for military purposes to detect traces of explosives or toxic spills as well as to carry out checks in the food industry a portable electronic nose we just took it and because it easily available and not too expensive in order to check whether it could be applied for medicine dragon nose has 32 electronic sensors but in this case the sensors detect disease not explosives as with a dog of scent the electronic nose doesn much analyze the scent as recognize its pattern and imprint paralleling some kinds of pattern recognition software it detects the big picture rather than separate components syano dragonieri thinks the nose could detect the first signs of a range of diseases in the breath of a patient falls in the control gr it been found out in the last years that human exale breath contains more than 3,000 volatile organic compounds when you body chemistry subject for example with lung cancer uh show different Vol organic compounds compared to subject without according to dragoner the nose could be programmed to distinguish between a pathological imprint and a healthy one nowadays the CT scan is the only diagnostic tool used for early detection of lung cancer but it expensive and cumbersome obtaining a reliable and fast diagnosis simply by blowing into a plastic bag would be both fast andap the nose is able to distinguish subject with Asma from subject without it subject with L cancer from subject without it and from subject with chronic [Music] bronchitis research is being carried out in Laboratories around the world and some scientists suggest that this type of diagnostic device could be in use within the next decade should the promise be fulfilled these advances in early detection will make diagnosis more immediate and less intrusive [Music] [Applause] I came here for the first time in 2040 I just met this girl Lisa and she dreamt about visiting the city of the future as the media called it I had plenty of time and she was good-looking so why not nano City or not it seemed that some things would never change immigration and public health Serv here they were called Customs immigration and public health problem simple formality and they were very polite please perhaps too polite come on thanks first they led us into separate rooms but I soon felt this was not going to be the usual inter sry to interrupt your journey but we public he this was a public health investigation and they had good news for me news I didn control test which means that you are not but they had noticed that neither Lisa nor I were wearing any check patch check patch is a check patch a nanop patch check patch as you can see on my colleague in fact check patch was a new real time diagnostic device and they were offering to lend me one for the rest of my stay here I would benefit from Hightech medical protection while in the city of your stay here and at the same time wouldn to the locals we perfectly understand the very idea of this invasion of my privacy was unacceptable to protect you in the and their attitude had started to get on my nerves app I began wondering whether this wasn initiated by check need to call my lawyer don let them now I okay okay save your breath my answer is no but apparently their check patch was not compulsory i you wish you you please sign this pleas still they didn official [Music] disclaimer thank you sir goodbye goodbye and enjoy your stay [Music]	Success
The Secret Language of Plants | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC4sbsM7uZA	SLICE Science	[Music] plants have sensory capacities that are far more sophisticated than we once imagined plants move smell taste listen [Music] memorize deprived of a nervous system they are somehow capable of recognizing their family sending out an alarm [Music] signal and even communicating plants are everything but silent [Music] in the 1960s cleave Baxter a trained member of the CIA interrogation team made a revelation that marked its era plants he affirmed are capable of communicating between each other using a lie detector he claimed to have succeeded in capturing their thoughts emotions and even their telepathic powers attached to delicate electronic instruments a cabbage plant registers annoyance to the exhaling of tobacco smoke on its Leaf surfaces a scene familiar in any kitchen takes on special importance in this experiment in some mysterious way the plant which is attached to the instrument is able to feel the mutilation of its comrade bter was not a scientist and he did a lot of experiments but claiming that he was able to detect tathy and big amount of strange phenomena in Plants but in the last 40 years many many scientists try to repeat the experiment without success so essentially in science if you cannot repeat an experiment this means that this experiment is uh is wrong the authors rarely did experiments in the way a scientist would do them so most scientists dismissed it as not very scientific The Secret Life of plants was looking at plant social life in a very new Agy kind of [Music] way Stefano manuso is not a Survivor from the new age a Pioneer in neurobiological research on plants he is convinced that plants are great communicators at the University of Florence in Italy he is trying to reveal what plants are hiding from [Music] us Stefano manzo bean [Music] plant he has grown them under various conditions in the dark at different lighting or humidity levels at varied temperatures even by modifying the magnetic field that surrounds it he wants to find out how the bean plants always find the support stick we did some 100 different experiments and all the times the plants were able to find the supports and so um now that we we we are uh the idea is that there is some kind of unknown way that the plants use to sense the environment skeptical scientists have objected declaring that the plant is performing a simple mechanical move movement and that the plant halfhazard found the nearby support stick in reply to the critics Stefano Manzo placed two plants one on each side of the stick as he expected both plants grew towards the support stick our science is the science it science made by animals for Animals because we are animals we are anable uh normally to feel that plants are intelligent and sensitive organisms dare we evoke a form of plant brain intelligence and sensitivity is not something that it brain the brain in itself it organ it that we have here and every animals have and but if you look at the single cells they are cells there is nothing mysterious or Supernatural about the cells of our our brains they are just a kind a specific kind of cells called neurons but you don you can have Al other kind of cells having the same function so means transmitting signals from one cell to the other the tremendous root Network that plants possess makes a striking parallel with our highly complex brain [Music] circuits Charles Darwin was one of the first to probe the underground life of plants he was convinced that plants have command centers at the tip of their Roots known as the Apex [Music] researcher at the University of bond in Germany Dr Franc booko works on apex neurobiology all the root epices they are coordinated in their activities and growths and they resemble some swarms for example insect swarms or Birds somehow there is some communication we still don on but they are coordinating and behave as a one swarm franic booka revealed that within the Apex plants have cells that are very similar to those found in animal muscle cells the roots are capable of exploring the soil with extraordinary precision and plants seem to to know when to form their flowers or drop their leaves could there really be as Charles Darwin once thought a single and unique command post so there is no Central organizer and that vulnerable to some stress situations these networks can self-organize very effectively and they can survive any any bad stress situation the network resembles very closely the internet Network so one could call it root Wide Web a root Wide Web root cells that function independently but in coordination with others this one look this is the same kind of signal we can record in the animal brain really these networks are also used to ex change information not just to provide water or nutrition we have still no idea how complex the communication there is today we are aware that plants have much to talk about but we know little or nothing of it the secret life of plants is slowly unveiled through the research of a few tenacious scientists Canadian biologist Susan Dudley and her team have found that when the root of the impatient Pita touches the RO root of a plant from another family the impatience increases its water and light consumption and creates larger leaves okay 20.1 square cm it size Leaf these plants are big these plants actively know that they have neighbors and actively respond to the presence of neighbors and each and every leaf in fact positions itself to avoid getting shaded by neighboring leaves even within the same plant but the impatient reaction is totally different when its roots come across a family [Music] member we can say that plants know who members of the same family are and that them to know because members of the same family share genes and so if you to a member of the same family if you compete less with it or even actively share with it then your genes are being passed on through that family member using such tactile root recognition the plant can Advantage its family members this reveals that plants in their own way are capable of altruism [Music] just as amazing plants are able to communicate between themselves other than by touch as Dr Stefano manuso [Music] demonstrates our Italian scientist has isolated three groups of corn plants there is no root contact between them he will then deprive oxygen to one of the groups after 5 minutes from the start of the lack of oxygen we had an uh this group of plants emitting an SOS signal to uh warn the uh surrounding plant that there is something that is going wrong with oxygen in this case we have a group of plants that are emitting a message that it no more oxygen around and the other group of plants are receiving this message and and according they are able to prepare themsel to a future lack of [Music] oxygen here we have the plants that are without any change in the oxygen and that are no receiving giving any message here we have the plants in red that are producing a gene because they are stressed by the lack of oxygen and they are producing the also a message and the message is taken by the blue plants they have no problem with the oxygen but they are all the all all the same producing the gene because they are receiving the message so definitively there is a communication between these two group of plants [Music] plants can send and receive messages but how do they do it they are really speaking each other it language is not based on words but it based on chemical molecules uh plants are able to produce many thousands of chemical molecules each single molecules me something so when this group of plants are producing a specific molecules and this other group of plants are detecting this molecule this mean that there is something wrong plants have invented alarm signals to warn their neighbors of an imminent danger they also practice the art of chemical self-defense [Music] this strange landscape is that of the stinging nettle where a cocktail of molecules fungicides and insecticides contain a well-known irritating resin hidden beneath their skin are numerous molecules that scientists are only beginning to recognize on the tomato leaf these mushroom looking stems are topped by four cells that contain a repulsive resin that will be released when under attack by a pest and that amazing ability to release chemical signals that will attract the enemies of their voracious Predators this is the case of corn when it is attacked by the sped optera a small caterpillar that has a strong appetite for its leaves these Herb iferous in do enormous damage in the cost to the American farmers but also European Farmers millions of dollars or Euros to win any battle it advantage to have allies the cleetus sonorensis female is the natural enemy of the sped optera caterpillar [Music] but just how does this parasite wasp detect such a tiny caterpillar in a giant cornfield what we were initially thinking is that they would respond to the feces of these caterpillars or perhaps the body odors of the caterpillars themselves the feces in our minds is something that is very smelly and that would be a very reliable source of signals that these Wass could use but then we were studying this in more detail and we found that the plants that have been attacked by these caters were much more attractive than feces or the caterpillars themselves and that we started focusing on the signals that the plants produce to his surprise Ted turlings found that the damaged corn Leaf releases a particularly odorous molecule a specific SOS signal that attracts the caterpillar [Music] this indicator is like a GPS location signal for wasps who can then Target the tiny invisible caterpillar in the heart of the immense cornfield so that was of course a very exciting moment because we started realizing Iz ing the plant is doing something to get the enemies of their enemies uh come and kill the caterpillars [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] plants do not communicate like you and I do that but they transmit information to other organisms like these parasitic wasps to [Music] odors one single caterpillar mun on a corn Leaf releases the odors that attract the Wasps that olfactometer [Music] reveals but the alarm signal is not immediately [Music] released several hours will have passed between the first caterpillar bite and the liberation of volatile substances the plant will then produce odors that will soon be emitted by all of its [Music] leaves the feeding by the caterpillar is not really the same as as if you would damage a leaf yourself so you you know if you damage a leaf you can smell that there an odor coming off but in the case of caterpillar feeding they actually have something in their spit that the plant recognize and the plants are then producing a different odor that they produce from all the leaves also the leaves that are not damaged and that results in a specific signal that alerts these parasitic wasps these odors are produced to attract the enemies of their enemies corn calls upon an insect to do its dirty work this is the the secret root of evolution uh plants have no way to to move move no way to physically directly defend themselves start fighting with their enemies and eventually this results in some sort of communication between plant and insect even more astounding the intensity of the signal varies with the age of the plant one caterpillar can in fact kill a small plant and we find also indeed that the smaller plants send off much stronger signals many more of these compounds from these these odors than than the the older [Music] plants but the caterpillar has adopted a new [Music] tactic to trick the enemy it has changed its feeding times the yoders are not produced at night or at least in much smaller quantities because photosynthesis is necessary and for photosynthesis you need [Music] light the corn plant has forced the caterpillars to adopt a new strategy to survive they must Devour the corn leaves at night [Music] underground another species has started an assault on the Corn [Music] Roots diabrotica the cornw worm is in full-fledged destruction [Music] mode they work their way inside the root where they well protected and then they work their way up all the way to the top of the roots causing the root to completely be destroyed uh also making sure that the plant cannot take up water anymore the stability of the plant is lost and that in many cases the plant will fall over and there produced the team of scientists want to find out if the corn Roots can also send underground warning signals to attract other natural enemies of the diabrotica worm nematodes barely visible to the naked eye will the nematodes be guided by the plant in order to localize the diabrotica worm and eliminate it we have released nematodes at about half a meter away from the roots and they are later within a day found near those roots and killing these insects uh so and for an nematode Which is less than a millimeter long that distance so that will be 500 times their body length most likely all plants can communicate and the more and more we study this the more and more we realize that there are plenty of other things to be discovered that we cannot see but their plants are doing to defend [Music] themselves if plants have to watch their backs they must also think ahead about their reproduction and again chemical signals play a key role this orchid has adopted qualities from the Animal Kingdom to resemble and smell just like an insect the flower is so similar to a female wasp that males are instantly attracted and appear to prefer the plant over evolutionary time any mutation that arose in the plant that caused the flower to resemble an insect a little more was retained and flowers that didn didn we wind up with a flower that looks ever more like an [Music] insect as surprising as it may seem the Orchid releases chemical signals very similar to the female wasp sexual pheromones the male is fooled by both the plant strategies for the flower the chances of insemination increase in reward the WASP will leave with more pollen the same signals that insects use to communicate with each other for sex uh are biochemically very similar to some of the signals plants are using to talk to each other and biochemically very s very similar to hormones that we have in our body for signaling as well life has evolved using a common set of signals and communication between different organisms often involves signal stealing the ability to take your signals and use them in my life in a way that benefits [Music] me plants are not only capable of releasing Pleasant or unpleasant odors they can smell them too how can plants perceive the chemical molecules that are sent to them this is the key question entomologist Consuela deas has been asking her speciality kusuda a vampire plant that particularly parasites tomato plants they have a very small sieg and they only have the resources that are on those seeds to grow and find a host plant so once they emerge from the ground if they don will die [Music] what we found is that uh plants perceive the odors of other plants and what we believe it [Music] receptors I think from the tomato plant it physiology and and attracting the the Cuda is Just Happening like we are producing is Mell that attract mosquitoes that we intended to do it but we it every human being has a specific odor plants do too the electron microscope unveils the odorous glands of the tomato plant leaf numerous on the leaves of tomato or cannabis plants they liberate intense odors each plant has a specific oil factory signature expressed by the morphology of its odorous glands and the powerful perfume of lavender is explained by its large olfactory [Music] Pockets the electron microscope reveals countless release glands but plants also have many invisible receptors they have an Inc I mean in my view an incredible sense they really can [Music] sniff one thing that we were amazed to see is that the ccua have this ability also to perceive you know a healthy plant versus a sick plant [Music] I think it of the The receptors that we see in animal system insect systems um could be some similari is I mean not the same but I think it some similarities unfortunately our sense of smell is of no use to decrypt the chemical messages sent by plants we are unable to crack their code but scientists are never [Music] defeated everything we know about this has been studied in the laboratory it extremely difficult to get a picture of that rainbow of chemical words in the field because we really don instruments necessary to collect and analyze them [Music] if we are to master the invisible conversations of plant life we will have to learn to translate their chemical vocabulary into words [Music] [Music] the device we rather like a translator it takes the language of the plant which is all odors and turns it into something we can see here or feel uh so that the plant can tell us or report to us what to it a key word that often appears in the plant language is methyl Jasmin a molecule that Harbors the smell of the Jasmine flower highly appreciated by humans it is is frequently used in the perfume industry almost all plants emit some methyl Jasmin when they insects so that appears to be a word that occurs in all languages uh but the devil is in the details all the other molecules mixed in with it can differ from plant to plant and that language gets complicated plants have a slower life Rhythm than humans some are capable of living several thousand years but they cannot run away from danger in response they have developed remarkable ways to detect problems or swiftly react to the aggression of an insect it question of survival if we uh count the number of protein receptors plants have for smelling and tasting their environment they have many many many more than a human does even a simple plant has at least 600 different kinds of receptors for detecting odors and tastes in the environment in contrast humans have fewer than [Music] 20 plants are furnished with a multitude of strange stalks and hairs that serve as receptors and protection against insects their vast diversity is the secret to evolutionary adaptation against the many threats [Music] in order to compensate our lack of sensory receptors Jack Schultz is working on a prototype of an artificial nose a highly sensitive plaque that he hopes will enable us to improve our comprehension of the chemical conversations of plants well we created this chip or this this sensing device to be able to ask plants what they in open air for the first time everything we know about how plants communicate is based on work done in Laboratories under glassware uh no one has yet isolated and measured and mapped those signals and those conversations outdoors and we plan to be the first people to do that with this [Music] device the interaction between insects and plants we describe as a war all the time and that war is chemical and those chemicals are invisible so it chemical warfare and invisible communication going on all around us all the time if plants have so many receptors are they conscious that the person taking care of them is their best friend can the plants in the home recognize you I suppose they might but uh certainly they are cap plants in your home are capable of identifying your odor plants are capable of smelling our odors but can they hear [Music] us plants are it seems receptive to music the first experiments held 40 years ago said that plants were sensitive to classical music but did not like artificial or electronic music like rock or [Applause] [Music] Blues in the heart of Tuscany in Italy a rather surprising scientific experiment has been under taken by Dr Stefano manuso over the past 7 years 24 hours a day 7 days a week the music of Mozart is played to the vines [Music] what we saw immediately after uh some few weeks of times was that the plants with the music were much bigger and much productive but at that time we didn know if it was just the effect of music or the effort of s or they climate or whatever and so we decided to move on a larger scale experiment moving from just one loud speaker to 80 speaker in a single vineard Dr Manzo has revealed some rather surprising results the number of insect attacks was really uh dramatically decreasing until almost nothing almost zero the sounds were uh was able to make a kind of confusion in day insects during the mating process so they were unable to to find the the mate and so they were unable to [Music] reproduce after several years spent playing Mozart to the vineyard Stefano manuso is formal The Grapes on those land areas ripen 10 to 15 days before normal Harvest dates plants are highly sensitive to sound but just how do they hear them PL have no hears but um the plants are completely covered by mean sensitive channels I would say small sensors that are activated by by vibrations plants are probably much more um sensitive than us in detecting [Music] sounds an indepth examination by electron microscope reveals that the leaves and the tendrils of the vines are covered by sensors that could well be their ears [Music] Stefano manuso has discovered which frequencies The Vines appreciate the most and subtly inserted them in Mozart orchestrations we found that there are a range of frequencies in the in the low in the low part of this Spectrum uh around 100 between 100 and 1,000 Herz there are many frequencies that we uh we could say uh plants [Music] like but just what good does it do to the plant to detect such Sound Vibrations we are not sure uh about uh what what actually the plants do with this information but uh we are quite sure that plants are able to use the information coming from The Sounds in the soil for example to detect the quality of the soils the amount of water in the soils the presence of obstacles in the soil so they are in in some way using information coming from uh sounds for to have an idea of the space around them our image of the plant stupid and inert is to be reconsidered and plants certainly haven us for the first time ever Stefano Manzo has discovered Ed that plants also emit sounds yes they talk of weak intensity these little clicking sounds are possibly the first to be recorded of corn Roots detected by a laser if they can talk do they have a language can they memorize a vocabulary are they equipped with a memory [Music] okay memory is something that has been heavily underestimated in Plants these plants are separated into two groups groups during 2 weeks stano Manzo injected small quantities of zinc into one of the two groups zinc is a heavy metal dangerous to the plant on the 15th day he injected high doses of zinc to both groups the plants that had previously received the weak doses of zinc better survived under this shock treatment this means that plants are able to solve a problem to learn how to solve a problem and the next time that they are presented with the same problem they are able to solve it better it form of memory [Music] [Applause] [Music] interpreting visual signals released by plants that could be beneficial to humankind is the work of botanist Ida godell she has developed the art of predicting the weather forecast by closely observing the behavior of plants in the Swiss Alps which anticipate from several hours to several days what can alcha tell us about tomorrow [Music] weather this droplet of water is always found inside the plant and it a it it does this all the time nonstop the only time it doesn it [Music] [Music] rain forecasting the weather by observing plants requires patience and immense observation Ida Goodell horticulturist and she spent her childhood carefully observing plant life with [Music] him each time I had a question concerning a plant to know where it came from what it was doing here father nearly always had the right answer [Music] margar the daisy is the big sister of the common Daisy it heavier so it needs a lot more time to open and close it forecast [Music] with its lunar structure on the tip of its stem the flower is composed of white petals that will slowly close upon Nightfall but also to protect itself in case of bad [Music] weather you have to watch them every day and have a different approach [Music] all plants react be they outside in the garden or inside your house they react in exactly the same way a cactus in your apartment can tell you the weather forecast weather sensitive plants are numerous daisies dandelion tulips roses thistles geraniums but also Pines beach Oaks or even grasses clovers lily pads lettu uses even onion skins it that Ida godell predicted the heat wave that hit Europe in the summer of 2003 I would say it science the plant is never wrong it question of survival the only person that could make a mistake is me in its interpretation if our ancestors were able to read the weather forecast through plant Behavior perhaps tomorrow plants could become excellent Sentinels in detecting dangerous [Music] substances Dr Jack Schultz is trying to create plants that will become our allies oh okay he hopes they will react in a specific way under certain situations creating plants that report danger is something we call Sentinel plants we would create a sentinel plant that changes color in response to something at DET Texs uh sits on your desk or in the corner of the room uh and acts as a a canary in the mine changes color speaks up if you will when it detects whatever you would like get to tell you about we can use genetic engineering to create plants now that respond very quickly by changing color losing their greenness producing more volatiles and if we were able to do that we could place plants in locations where they could very quickly report the presence of something we wanted to know about for example uh chemical weapons [Music] placed in strategic locations such as airports plants could become very useful in detecting drugs chemical products and explosives highly toxic to humankind the chemical composition of TNT is actually very good for plants TNT is an excellent fertilizer due to its high levels of nitrogen plants grow really really well on TNT contaminated soils in a mine field each mine mine has explosives in it and those explosives slowly leak out of the mine creating a circle of fertilized soil where plants grow really well uh if we were to sew a field uh imagine in a desert in a rock or something uh with a plant that grows quickly you would expect to see nice green patches grow over each of the landmines rather than seeking to enslave plants to make the most of them perhaps we could also attempt to communicate with them in a more poetic [Music] manner plants sense our energetic Aura our electrostatic energy and through a specific kind of artistic technology we managed to perceive what the PL is feeling this interactive Garden is composed of genuine musical plants that react to our contact a vegetal language generated by touch when visitors caress them or brush up against them the plants will sing it is not the voice of the plant but a sound chosen by the artists set off by the [Music] visitor we wanted to give plants a voice when you look at a plant it doesn us the impression that they can speak they seem so inert and Silent we gave them a whole new universe of sound from nature forests animals or insects in our exhibition they dimension when we work with the invisible we interested in finding new boundaries to sketch the imperceptible suggest it and make it [Music] sensitive it it Sensations if the plant dies it ceases to sing We Are unable to comprehend the complex language of plants but our scientists are well aware that plants do communicate be it through the ground or thin air using hundreds of chemical signals they can talk to each other and even to other animals perhaps they are even trying to communicate with us it uh uh a plant could sense if we can crack the code of plant language then plants will be speaking to us all the time should we manage to pierce their secret language we may be surprised at what they have to say could it be that they are manipulating our very brains to reach their goals perhaps they influence us in the same way they influence insects corn May well manipulating our taste buds similar to the way it guides the parasitic wasp towards the sped optera caterpillar and who knows if the world of green will not one day turn against humans considered in turn as ravagers [Music]	Success
How Insects Are Revolutionizing Medicine | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tkf_yGTQlQ	SLICE Science	[Music] although the Venom of insects evokes our worst memories often painful and sometimes even provoking allergic reactions its properties can be beneficial for our health the atrax is the most venomous spider in the world however some researchers are using its venom for therapeutic purposes I found this spider in my backyard and I was just wondering if you knew what kind it was or whether it was dangerous yeah yeah that fact in M fun web spider the most deadly spider in the world that just be careful if you if you catch any more up we love to take him here at the park the public are good suppliers of atrax for the University of Sydney spider venom has become a veritable subject of Fascination for modern science we species of spiders because they produce around about 600 compounds in their venom so these are many of which are very toxic to to Insects so these compounds can potentially be developed as insect todal agents because they highly selective for insect species in fact certain components of the Venom Act only on the nervous systems of insects they could be isolated and integrated into insecticides against crop destroying pests Israeli researchers have also shown that atrax Venom systematically induces prolonged penile erections a Viagra substitute is thus under investigation the Venom acts on the nervous system unlike Viagra which induces vascular dilatation in the near future it may become possible to use a peptide that is a group of proteins from the venom for therapeutic purposes in the USA researchers have also shown that tarantul venom has positive qualities we think that this natural peptide derived from spider venom can be used as therapy for variety of diseases associated with mechanical defects these include muscular distrophy cardiac arhythmia incontinence and possibly brain tumors Dr sax an American researcher has already succeeded in reproducing this peptide code mtx4 found in the Venom of the tarantula this peptide appears to be particularly effective in controlling heart rhythm okay Tom here comes I send you some mtx4 and we see what happens look at this thing this is a sick muscle cell it should just be lying there quietly but it and it shouldn this I think we can block this with the spider peptide used in humans this peptide could immobilize the cells responsible for deregulating the heart muscle its principle of action to block the cells that cause an uncontrolled increase in contraction without affecting the cells associated with normal rhythm with infinite Care Dr sax manipulates the synthetic peptide which is priced at over $2,000 for 1 mgram you could say that tarantulas are dear to his heart however the future of spider venom may also lie in its action on the brain in brain tumors we know that the presence of cancer cells induces other cells to release chemicals that promote tumor growth it would be beneficial then to be able to block them Rosie Rosy is our pet tarantula she as our laboratory mascot we actually haven she Venom we start out with Venom from her Rel [Music] relatives if spiders are becoming our friends thanks to the positive qualities of their venom what about be [Music] Venom oh oh that definitely hurts so yes this medicine has a name today B therapy a method that goes back to ancient times be therapists sting their patients at the acupuncture points the therapeutic indications are primarily rheumatism arthritis and multiple sclerosis yeah that that huh no go ahe oh I think that bee can you feel that M no I just didn sit here and cry and definitely feel it after each session the be therapist has the patient sign a discharge in the event of allergy 60,000 people in America indulge in Bee therapy regularly at specialist practitioners and even within the family I am a woman 53 years old who has recently been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis I saw on your website that you have written a book called How well are you willing to be and I was wondering if bees might be able to help me Pat Vagner has become herself and escaped the Fatal outcome predicted by her doctor for her multiple sclerosis Pat has become a Believer and a bee therapist she reminds us that the bee is cited nearly 30 times in the Bible many times I have stung people that have come in with canes or crutches or something due to various problems with the legs and to have them come back in after they and I I said what cane I left my crutch where is I can find it and I find it humorous that they something that they couldn house without it wonderful [Music] in France Professor Bernard descot is also using a miraculous therapy bandaging wounds with honey for healing [Music] scars I believe that what is crucial is to make sure the honey penetrates deeply into all the tiny cracks of the wound to avoid any pulling occurring honey is used for healing difficult wounds its Advantage is that the enzymes in Honey produce just the required amount of hydrogen peroxide to disinfect the wound while maintaining a humid environment that encourages cell regeneration there are some amusing stories on honey based dressings such as a medical consultant who refused claims for such dressings on the pretext that they contain honey even though it most healing products and above all allows you to get back to work twice as [Music] quickly in Australia and New Zealand honey is widely used in hospitals in addition numerous clinical trials have shown that dressings with honey get rid of fearsome flesh eating bacteria [Music] rapidly with this pot of honey that say for less than one Euro we can treat two or three patients and Achieve astonishing results on healing as I sequence the change in the wound which ends up fully healed in less than 20 days indeed there change even though it remains very detached I find that there it good at the pharmaceutical level position remains determined which one can understand because these companies have every interest in making sure honey is kept out of [Music] healing bees also use propolis harvested on certain trees as a health defense when they kill an intruder insect or rodent that they cannot move they then proceed to cover it with this antibacterial [Music] for the moment in France the choice of Honey is still made in a tailored fashion My worry is this will it always be so soft if you keep it around 18° there no problem do you think this honey spreads easily yes absolutely for a long time honey has been used in India as an [Music] antiseptic every day numerous patients queue up for a consultation with Dr gokulan Opthalmology surgeon at the Medical College of rangaraya in India the fact of finding yourself with Lo M honey in your eye may seem strange if not unpleasant however in ieda the ancient Medical Science honey was already known for treating illness in eyes and other parts of the body we have a method of treatment where we use the decoction added with 1/4 of honey this entire quantity is ingested to the rectum and after a certain period of time this is evacuated naturally Dr gokulan is planning to evaluate these ancient methods and test some new honey it rather very sweet and having little sore yeah this is testing just like uh the what we have felt about the honey uhhuh okay very sweet yeah Dr Ulan is researching other qualities in Honey in order to find new anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties but unfortunately the majority of beekeepers only produce Lotus honey the most widespread medical nectar Dr gokulan has decided to go into the jungle to look for wild swarms who use other flowers to create their honey for him the bee is a flying Pharmacy [Music] wild swarms are always difficult to locate and sometimes luck strikes there where you least expect [Music] it thanking mother nature and the bees has become a daily ritual for Dr gokulan can you see my eyes eyes very large eyes okay yeah c n e t d mm d n d d d after this examination now we are going to have a treatment very excellent treatment with honey you know you have seen honey I love honey you love honey very good this little girl will no doubt be part of the 60% success rate achieved by Dr gulan thanks to honey and at the lowest price in a country where modern medicine is too expensive if it might seem surprising to put honey in your eye nobody would dream of putting a fly there and however in Mexico Dr flies are all the rage like many insects their bodies are covered with bacteria ital substances Dr flies do the trick [Music] if flies help which doctors they are also good tools for surgeons some lvi only attack the dead tissue and wounds John church is called the maggot man had this extraordinary experience some years ago when a man drove himself off the motorway went through the wind screen and had terrible head and chest injuries lay for 3 Days in the open and then the police brought him into the hospital and to the nurse disgust his wounds were full of maggot but when I arrived I noted that his wounds were clean and healthy looking so much so that we didn take him to the operating theater and that how I have eventually become known as the maggot [Music] man to obtain sterile lva a top secret process was employed by the only fly stock Farm in the world in Wales for John surgery requires too many people a single female fly produces enough maggots to treat five patients and they go on working 24 hours a day his care kit comprises 500 Stell Lavi and only costs € 107 but people find maggot therapy disgusting and it usually is only used when surgery or antibiotics fail hello John I see a just having the maggots put in the room yes have you had these before in this way no no but as you see there they are little ones and you can see them wandering around in the wound and they on that yellowish tissue [Music] John it wound healed how is it fine if I examine it like this is it 10 no it hasn you standing up for a moment can you come up on your toes yeah down again that yes yes excellent John this is the picture where the maggots are under the gangrenous skin could you feel yes yes I could feel them wriggling about wriggling about or tickling yes yeah and here is the time when the gangrenous skin has gone but but there that was also eaten by the next lot of neets is that right and after that it went on to heal fully yes yes how does it feel now fine no trouble at all EXC really amazed today 300 treatment centers have opened in England and over 1,500 people have already been treated by maggot therapy in central Africa they practice termite therapy the preparation consists of taking living soldier termites from a termite Hill and crushing their heads to obtain a healing Pace Bernard Indi tries to convince the father that this potion will cure his daughter ulcer dad remains skeptical as in most pigmy Villages modern medicine is [Music] non-existent as an alternative crushed macro soldier termites are directly applied to the wound for nun naazi termites are a family business all the time know I learned from my father our tribe the Sumas have cured ulcers with termites for many generations it only stopped when the missionaries arrived and Tred to end our initiation rights now I technique again and I people who don antibiotics can care for themselves using this technique Bernard nid naazi is traveling all over the Central African Republic to train people in his methods it is probably the secretions from glands and the chit in the soldier termites armored heads that make these cures chittan has remarkable bacteria Cal properties and is also non-toxic and [Music] biodegradable

only been treated with termites he had had an ulcer for over a year but at the hospital they could do nothing more for him because it was infested with maggots maggots that that because there was nobody to clean the uler so they sent him home to die in his village Central African Republic television covered the event everyone wanted to see Thomas who had had a miracle cure with [Music] termites this Photograph shows the uler after 28 days of treatment you remember what it was like oh yes it who come back from the dead are ghosts aren gone today is A Grand Day for Bernard he has been invited to the presidential Palace to give a conference on the termite healers hello Dr donoval I the ceremony well hello [Music] doctor the ambassadors and the UN and wh delegates were convened for the presentation [Music] this recent work on termites has revealed their therapeutic virtues I met the xand in bakuma they make termite paste simple food paste that you can keep for years and years without it going moldy Papa Thomas owes his life to the termite and the proof is convincing Bernard hopes to use this clinical success to Market termite pie and other handy bits of mandibles on a large scale this woman who looks more like a termite Mound has painful joints for traditional Healers of the Ivory Coast termite Earth is an excellent Orthopedic plaster and also heals mumps and chickenpox as long as it regularly some even use it to help with diagnosis they tell a patient to urinate on the mound if the termites Rush up to drink the urine the patient has got diabetes next healing with termites seems like a real job but what about ants these Australian ants have therapeutic qualities like termites do the problem is getting near them because their sting is very painful

all the bacteria around the two drops of ant antibiotic have been eliminated Aboriginal Australians understood the antibiotic properties of ants they would throw a cloth onto an ant nest until it was

the cloth it must have been impregnated with antibiotics because it had immediate healing properties man only discovered antibiotics 60 years ago whereas ants have been using them for 60 million years the conventional use of antibiotics is causing resistance on the part of the bacteria that cause human diseases worldwide new sources of antibiotics have to be found as quickly as possible we believe that our Research into antibotics produced by ants and other insects will provide insights into new ways of fighting human disease mushroom growing ants also cultivate antibiotics an electron microscope reveals a bacterial mousse attached to their backs that protects them from the risk of infection these anti biotics are manufactured in underground Chambers from chewed leaves that turn into a substratum in which the fungus grows and produces food and medines for the [Music] colony the mushroom growing ants effortlessly cut up leaves with their powerful jaws they select a wide range of vegetation as they regularly change antibiotics as if subconsciously aware that pathogenic germs [Music] mutate throughout history ants have been genuine walking and chewing pharmacists in the

have been vaccinating wild rabbits against miomatosis for several years already bring me the first rabbit to come out so we can collect the fleas okay ferrets are just the thing to frighten the rabbits out of their holes in this Heath where a few weeks before Elizabeth had released a batch of vaccinating fleas there he is hob hop catch it Robert go look you can see them well they off so many of them Elizabeth collects the fleas so she can check if the fleas on the rabbits are her special vaccinating variety so she can identify them she marked them all with a fluorescent yellow tag when they were released 3 weeks ago the vaccine they contain was transmitted to the rabbits by their bual organs whenever they fed F will always be parasites it their genetic makeup and can changed but we can change their image instead of being pests we can make them do good a blood sample shows at once if the fleas have given the rabbits immunity to miomatosis Elizabeth uses a UV radiation sensor to

multiply quickly in their bodies making identification possible virus amplification is one of the first positive uses of mosquitoes another use envisaged is the production of anticoagulants tomorrow Navy mosquitoes will be used as living syringes in the same way as fleas are already used now but instead to vaccinate human [Applause] beings while insects are good medical tools eating them is also

modern science to tell them that diluted spider venom can be used to treat all sorts of ills taste it taste it can you tell what it is no what is it spiders it wine oh [Music] really apparently her SP wine is effective since she receives many orders for it from all over China some of her patients use it for toothache kidney problems paralysis and with the addition of dates to treat [Music]

to be hospitalized but she has never given up when I was younger I was afraid of spiders but one day I lost my job so I started breeding them at first I looked for them in the mountains but there were fewer and fewer that spider farm now I have 50,000 of them [Music] the finest specimens gathered in the mountains are destined for breeding the others will be drowned in the Elixir wine to conserve

gave me the idea of starting a fresh pollen business pollen is principally recommended for prostate and fatigue problems it possesses five times more proteins than a steak while containing precious Trace elements minerals and numerous vitamins bees collect it with their legs and on the down that covers their bodies they store it in specially designed pouches on their back legs which would be the

Mega Episode: Building Green: Revolution in Sustainable Energy! | SLICE SCIENCE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEfgtqWJFYY	SLICE Science	[Music] It took King Solomon seven years to build his fabulous temple. In 7 years, in the same corner of the globe, a city will begin to rise. And not just any city, a green metropolis that makes its own power, makes cars redundant, and makes no greenhouse gases. It there to be green, carbon neutral, and zero waste. [Music] In this unprecedented undertaking, the construction team is building the city of tomorrow or setting themselves up for a fall. [Music] Today, as oil reserves dry up, engineers and scientists are inventing new ways to power our cities. Solar, fusion, wind, and visionary architects are inventing new ways for those cities to operate. By 2016, a city will start to sprout from this desert to house some 45,000 people and employ another 40,000. It will boast a university, the international headquarters for renewable energy, a manufacturing hub for solar power and desalination, and some 1,500 businesses. The whole city will be linked by familysiz vehicles powered by homegrown electricity known as the personal rapid transit system. This city will be called Mazdar, Arabic for the source, and the source of the city is an unlikely place. Abu Dhabi is the largest of the United Arab Emirates. In the 1950s, it was a small desert kingdom, but the oil boom transformed Abu Dhabi into a city-state metropolis. The kingdom is believed to sit at top 8% of the world reserves. But cheap, abundant oil has also made its citizens some of the most polluting on Earth. Inexpensive energy means yearround air conditioning. Big cars and energy guzzling deselination. Per capita, Abu Dhabi has one of the world of the world footprints. The rulers of this oil kingdom have taken steps to soften that footprint. The UAE was the first OPEC producer to pass a law to reduce gas flaring. In 2006, Abu Dhabi itself went even further. It drafted a blueprint for a green city. They decided to uh you know embark in this uh campaign where they divert from an economy that is based on uh oil and gas to a to an economy that would be based on innovation and sustainable uh energy. The Mazda initiative is a tool to help Abu Dhabi reach that stage. Sonad Ahmed is in charge of delivering Mazdar the most crucial. The Mazdar Institute of Science and Technology, a teaching and research campus whose whole mission is renewable energy. The institute will be built in four phases. The first phase includes two laboratory buildings and 101 apartments for post-graduate students from around the [Music] world. The ground floor will house a canteen, classrooms, shops, and prayer rooms. And the signature building of the whole campus will be the shell-shaped library. Senate has 18 months to deliver the first phase of the institute. Imagine the pressure building a college of sustainable construction in a sustainable way. The institute will rise here amid 5 12 million square meters of abandoned date farm. Mark, the size of nearly a thousand football fields. Wise men don And project manager Mark Bug is pretty smart. How are you, man? How are you? Okay. How so bad. What Well, we last night we managed to get in probably the best production we About 19 20 piles. So, we started progressing the new drilling. Okay. Next next batch of 20 piles we doing. Surprising as it may seem, the ground level here lies only 6 1/2 ft above the water table. So the entire institute will be built on a platform raised 31 ft off the ground. Work proceeds by drilling a hole for the pile and extracting the sand and dirt. A framework of steel rebar is dropped down. Then crews fill the framework with concrete. But at Mazdar, they just building a green city. The way they build it must be green, too, including the materials they use. Just making ordinary cement is believed to create 5% of total CO2 emissions worldwide, which makes cement manufacturing the third biggest greenhouse gas culprit after transport and energy. Mark their cement with an industrial byproduct called GGBS or ground granulated blast furnace slag, a leftover from making iron. Now, regarding the uh the concrete mix, yeah, it 60% sustainable. So, again, that meets our requirement. It meets the requirements for sustainable city. It does. To stay on schedule, project manager Mark Bug will have to drill 12 piles every day in the next 5 weeks. Which number is this? Which pile number? Which pile? Yeah, this will be about our 138th pile. Wow. And that days. Less than 10 days. 138 piles. Excellent. Okay. A top hundreds of piles, the Mazdar Institutees foundations will rise. Senad and Mark are laying more than the foundations of buildings. They the groundwork for a new way of life. London is home to Foster and Partners, the renowned architectural firm that designed the master plan for the entire city of Mazdar and is now working on the campus for the Mazdar Institute. Sonned arrives at the firm headquarters with Muhammad Nara, the man in charge of design and delivery for all of Mazdar. Meeting with them are Ross Palmer and Edson Yabuki. The real kind of aim for the whole campus when it to try and create a major focal point, a heart to the scheme. And so the position of that heart is very important relative to the urban infrastructure. Main concept is to keep the laboratory buildings towards the center forming the the heart forming the the the the action of the university. The Mazdar master plan is revolutionary, setting out a high density city with a raised ground level that will be zero waste and carbon neutral. Primarily the whole Mazda uh master plan concept is to allow a very uh controlled and narrow streets that open up into courtyards. Yes. of the release of the the space. Contemporary Abu Dhabi is inspired by modern America. Wide streets, big windows, and air conditioning. An energy guzzling design in this hot climate. Traditional Arab cities boast narrow streets that are self-shading, wind towers, and courtyards. The architects have designed Mazdar City on these principles, making the most of natural heating, cooling, and lighting. Abu Dhabi has a desert climate. Year round, nights are 8 to 10° cooler than days. The architects harness this temperature fluctuation through a natural phenomenon called thermal mass. In the shaded areas of the arcade, walls and ceilings are made from thick concrete. At night, they cool right down. So during the day they have a lower initial temperature than the surrounding air. The walls and ceiling act like a heat sink absorbing heat from the atmosphere. To further cool the city, a giant wind tower will use the natural movement of air to refresh streets and public spaces. Sensors will detect wind direction, then open vents. The wind blows down the fabric tube due to differences in pressure. Solar panels will supply most of the 220 megawatts of energy that the city will need. 80% of the institute be covered by these panels, which will feed energy to the local grid. The panels have been deliberately pushed out to shade the street below and to let people see where their energy is coming from, but some can wanted to ask about the um whether it actually worth putting these these PV panels on such a beautiful roof and this is a beautiful roof. The shell form it iconic and yet at the same time we talking about covering it with these these panels. I think it opportunity missed if we don It put the panels on terms of area. I mean any any roof area that we don PVs is the thing I for. So, um, so I think you need to revisit it because I think it look awful. It look awful to be honest with you. Like a dog that roof. But I think Kevin is right. If it looks awful, he So, we need to plan and choose the right material, the right technology to cover it and take the most out of it and yet keep it beautiful because that icon we it phase 1 A. Sustainable construction is still a new idea. Many of the contractors arriving at Mazdar need a crash course. New arrivals are briefed on Mazdar by sustainability managers Margaret Cedaroth and Lloyd Clark. So why go green? That about today a little bit. Carbon neutral, Muhammad, do you know what carbon neutral means? No. Exactly. Carbon neutral is a a little bit of a fuzzy term. Even even university professors get a little bit fuzzy when they talk about carbon neutral. What we want to do as a project is to minimize how much energy we use. minimize how much embodied carbon is in the materials and minimize what goes into the building how that building operates so that the that carbon can be offset through other practices. That is how we will achieve carbon neutrality. Um so that carbon neutral means. We to zero so that it Zero waste is pretty self-ex self-explanatory. Zero waste. What we want to start with is the small things. Recycle or reuse whenever possible. I mean, that goes back to our our waste issue. Everything needs to be recycled. Anything is recyclable. You should be recycling. There There recycle materials. Okay. You you a bit stunned at the moment. So, I just want to make sure everyone anyone got any questions at this time? So, your first audit will be the end of January. So, that means you have six weeks to get everything perfect, everything in order out there on site. In six weeks, Meg will see whether carbon neutral and zero waste construction is just a theory or can become reality. A landmark. Mazdar tower crane is going up. These giants stretch up to 50 m. They allow heavy components like formwork and columns to be prefabricated, then moved into place. A huge timesaver. Leftover materials will be bundled up and the cranes will swing them off site to be stored for recycling. Before the cranes are erected, engineers create a plan of each crane where to place the cranes so they can cover the entire site. The Mazdar Institute alone will need five cranes. [Music] The skeleton of Sunage University is beginning to emerge. Best one A is divided into four sections or four areas. What you see here are the finished pile caps with the pile trimming, blending finished already. uh those here belongs to uh area two which is the residential [Music] blocks. Area one is the labs with the classrooms. So this is the first erection now of the columns going up in area one. [Music] There three and then in that direction where where you see the cranes are area 4 which basically is uh the rest of the podium level connected to the street level. The funding for the entire city of Mazdar comes to $22 billion. The government of Abu Dhabi put up the money as a loan. So Mazdar must not only be sustainable but profitable starting with the work on the institute. Sunonn has to deliver the institute on budget. So he must be tough on costs. Can you send me this in soft copy? Sure. No problem. Uh the whole thing. So this is only the price for um um for the furniture. You can see this under the budget. What we have bill number two with the construction cost. [Music] But that number is absolutely rejected. I can tell you that. All right. Right now. Okay then. While SAD worries about cost and Meg worries about carbon, Mark Bug has his own concerns. Good afternoon, fellas. Hello. Safety. Okay. Okay. Good. Are your glasses on? Glasses on. Over the past few years, dozens of workers throughout the UAE have died in accidents on other construction sites. Good afternoon. How you doing? Okay. You need to do me a little job. Let me make sure that we there so they can get up. Yeah. Steps access. But you best go get an English foreman then. Yeah. Go find some Go find me someone who can speak English so I can explain to them. You must have proper steps. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Otherwise Yeah. Otherwise, you going to be climbing up. You can fall off. So, let Okay. You understand? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, please. Yeah. On all. Okay. Okay. Okay. Right. Thank you. Mark has worked in construction for 29 years. This is his first job in the Middle East where the language of safety is sometimes foreign. How did you get up there? How do you get down? Fly. Right now, Mazdar has more than 300 workers on site from American to Indian to Chinese and they all have to learn the same language of safety. It is very very important to us that you stay safe out here and can go home as you came to work. Mark isn site. So is Meg. Meg gave the contractors six weeks to make the site environmentally friendly. Times up. Meg is about to conduct an audit on the Chinese contractor is their environmental manager. First item on Meg materials used. This is the stuff that came and it you can see it together. You can times, which is what we want. This is good. It you You of the materials they need to bring that they need to look for sustainable sources. They need to be ISO certified. You Uh it has been emailed to the procurement in the HQ and also the management staff here. So that when they choose materials especially wood it must come from sustainable sources. So we gave them a list of countries that is you know uh follow good forestry management. Sweden, France, Finland, Finland right? Sweden right. Next item on the checklist recycling. So this is little concrete rubble bits. Yes. Okay. There bit sign though. These are the recycling bins. Yes, that we they just get emptied or they new? Was was damaged is supposed to be like this. Okay. So, signage needs to be maintained. Okay. Okay. Right. Maintain signage. Maintain signage. Yeah. Right. Rubbish. Okay. Good. Next item. Disposing of hazardous waste. The hazardous waste. Hazardous waste. You seem to have accumulated more hazardous waste. Some of it suspicious supposed to be product. Okay. This we got to fix. Yeah. Okay. So, it fuel oil. It anything that we don the ground. um the remnants of paint recepticles because those have to be properly disposed of, right? It thinners. Those are all double bagged and dried out. Contaminated gloves. Contaminated gloves. Okay. So, no, it is not being stored. It You get a you get a one for that. Okay. Yeah. Meg grades contractors on each item on her checklist and collects data on the amount of CO2 produced. Time for Hip H Have a seat. And the site is generally following good practice. Although we still have a few issues around the waist area. It is a very everything is being separated really well. You understand that it needs to be done. People on site understand that it needs to be done. So that aren just moving forward and continuing. So thank you. Good job. Yep. We will keep improving. Yes, you will keep improving. So next month will get harder. [Music] So, do I constantly harang people? No, cuz I heranging type person. But I think they all know that I watching and they know if they do something wrong that eventually I come to them and look very sad and then they\\ he didn time. have days where I same with the people who control the schedule. There are days where I they throw down their notebook and they\\ going to get this done on time. I throw it down my book and go, it driving me nuts. are like, know, everybody has that moment. So certainly I have moments of um boy, sustainability. Lost one today, got one the next day. Hopefully. Hopefully. Tight budgets and tight schedules sometimes force Meg to make compromises. Yet Mazdar goals, carbon neutral and zero waste, are already setting standards for construction in the Middle East. Like here, the rebar in this framework is made from 90% recycled steel. The great thing about steel is that it can be infinitely recycled without losing strength or quality. The Mazdar project imports its recycled steel from Turkey. And because it emissions that would otherwise be produced in making a ton of new steel from iron ore. [Music] Temperatures in Abu Dhabi vary from the comfortable 70s in winter to well over 100 in summer. The extreme heat often comes with high humidity, making it feel even hotter. [Music] Given Abu Dhabi sense that most of Mazdar come from the sun. 90% of that solar power will come from solar panels on the city and from a vast solar farm able to provide 10 megawatts of power. But the climate is not as ideal for solar panels as it seems. Sand and dust are solar panel enemies, and hot temperatures reduce the energy production of certain types of panels. Samir Abu Zade is Mazdar manager. He try out various solar panels to see which will perform best. Yeah, we laying down the concrete slabs for this and next week we structures and the panels spacing. [Music] These few acres will hold some of the most advanced solar panels from around the globe. What you see in the test field, we have uh 40 systems uh coming from 33 uh manufacturers and uh basically they coming from uh around the world. We have the United States, we have Norway, we have Spain, the chi Japan, China, uh France, Italy. While testing the panels, Samir is sending the energy they produce to the national power grid. So, he of the carbon emissions produced by construction. The power generated from the systems outside is a DC power. It cannot be fed to the grid because the grid is AC. So, what we do each system is connected to inverter. This inverter takes the DC power from the sun and converts it to AC and then feeds it to the grid. Now what you also see here, these are power meters. These power meters tell you how much each system is generating at this time. Uh you can see a variation of of uh values of power. Uh some are high, some are are low. This number should be near 1,000 watt, but it the afternoon. The sun is not facing directly these panels, so you get uh lower production. The panels already installed outside generate roughly 2400 kilowatt hours per day. So, thanks to the sun, Samir already powering the equivalent of several homes. [Music] To stay on schedule, work proceeds in shifts, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. But an ambitious schedule is about to clash with an unyielding tradition. [Music] The holy month of Ramadan has begun. Many of Mazdar are Muslim. They can still work, but they can down. Not even when the midday sun raises the mercury to 105. To compensate, workers are given an afternoon break. They can also choose to work at night. [Music] Sonad is fasting, too. He works a 10-hour [Music] day. No food, no water, and he sweating to keep construction moving. So, the university opens to students on schedule. I think the experience of fasting all day is is good because it makes me stronger. I think uh you know being in the field you know under the sun looking at things from different aspects looking at these workers uh spending you know hours under the sun makes me be one of them you know participating uh without water without food [Music] a week into Ramadan and Sonad must deliver a progress report to his boss Dr. Nara, can you tell me just the status of the construction? Where you at? Yes. Uh and up to yesterday, we completed uh 27 pile caps, uh nine columns. Uh slab will be uh we the the slab by November. Uh up to now, we have about 313 uh labor on site, including dayshift and night shift, 24-hour shift. you to need at least 800 700 labor. That not going to do it. I I I I fully agree with you. Uh by the end of October, we labor. 500 labor. 5 by end of October. If you don to do it. And then you only have nine columns. That much. That progressing. Double that. the the the formwork is progressing well because the the the shift at night they do it at night most of the formwork and then in the morning they come and and they do it. So uh formwork is progressing well. I think once we we we have more people coming. How did Ramadan the holy months of Ramadan impacted your progress on the site? Uh as you know there are uh Muslim workers working on site. The productivity has has has gone down because people are fasting. you know they asked the supervisors to give the Muslim workers some some some areas to rest. Uh um even even myself I feel myself also less productive and uh you know needing water all the time because you know it it and then going outside and sweating. So it difficult at the end of the day. It it comes you know behind this effort you know working 12 hours a day putting your heart your mind your family your you know your social life your friends everything and make this thing achievable with with a deadline because the deadline and and meeting on time is is the most beautiful thing that will come at the end. [Music] In 8 months, the 922 piles are in. The columns have been placed on top, and the construction team is laying down the podium or pedestrian level. Underneath this level, cooling, electrical systems, and the personal rapid transit system will run. On top of it will sit the library, the labs, the apartments, and shops. [Music] Several thousand men are now working in shifts at Mazdar. The day team knocks off. With the first phase of building well on its way, the night team has started work on the next stage of the city construction phases. This one will include a gym, student union, and outdoor swimming [Music] pool. Samir allowed him to make choices for the 10 megawatt solar plant he briefs Mazdar farm on the northwest corner of the site. Occupies about 200,000 square meters. We have already fixed the four corners of the site. We will start fencing the site next month and design will also start next month. Uh installations of panels will be completed by January. The panels Samir will be using come from Germany and China and they across an area the size of some 40 football fields. How is that red flag part of it? The red flag is there. It was there. Really? It Yeah. For the PV. This is really huge. It That of our knowledge, nobody has done a massive PV plant like this in the past. When finished, the new plant will provide enough energy to power 30,000 homes. Despite the sacrifices of SAD and the workers, building has fallen a couple of months behind schedule. Ramadan slowed them down. So did trying to maintain some of the sustainability criteria like insulation. One of the real challenges we had in the building is uh is meeting the the design criteria for uh the labs. We had to to to make sure the energy efficiency targets are met. You have also the cladding system for the for the laboratories and the residential where the uh U value uh of the energy performance has to be met. The cladding systems are the protective outer coatings. The buildings must be heavily insulated to minimize their U value or their ability to transfer heat. The building if Mazdar is to be a zerocarbon city. Inside the laboratories, the mechanical equipment to be installed is highly sensitive. Temperatures must be kept stable. This is how they planning to do it. [Music] The first cladding layer is a strong but transparent layer made from ETF, a product like Teflon that prevents sand and dust from sticking to it. The second layer is a buffer zone. The third layer is made from foil that reflects heat from the facade while bouncing natural light into the streets. The last layer is an airtight panel of heavy insulation. [Music] The design team decided they need to build a cladding mockup to see if their ideas really work. The construction workers scrambled to finish the cladding mockup minutes before the senior design architects arrived from London. [Laughter] The mockup trial is the moment of truth for the architects, too. Gerard Evendon, David Nelson, and Ross Palmer. They and SAD are about to see the apartment design spring to life for the very first time. Best choice I the copper. Yeah, cuz look at the texture. It main performance wall is the one on the inside. Yeah. So this this layer is just providing the shading to the copper. On top of the direct sun, the sun hits this and stays outside. Like the laboratory, the residential facade is composed of four layers. The first is made from local sand and glass reinforced concrete. It prevents the sun from directly hitting the inner layers. The second layer is a thermal buffer zone reducing radiant heat. Made from copper colored 90% recycled aluminum, the third layer reconducts heat and ensures the air tightness of the facade system. Finally, the fourth layer, 250 mm of insulation. What we can say is we if we go with this color. Yeah, we have it go with this color. This Yeah, the slightly red color back. This is the best color in a bit. Okay, so Trevor Lampton is in charge of producing the apartment panels. He have to produce another panel for final inspection, then 101 panels in just a few months. And the time you doing the time? Yes, cuz it really is. Yeah, highly appreciate. I keeping up. What we can do? Yeah, you right. What we can do is we he can prepare one panel. We inspect it together. We agree and then he can do the foot production. Yes. I think very interesting. This is the actual width of the street. This is set up to reflect. This represents the tightest street. To minimize exposure to direct sunlight and extreme heat, the streets are narrow just like traditional cities. The institute is oriented from southeast to northwest to shade streets from the heat of the sun throughout the day. Stephen, you know, I was working over there the other day and I was sweating right now. You came here, right? I I came in here. It 6 months later and Trevor apartment panels have come rolling out of the factory on time. Y got his harness on project manager Mark Bug is overseeing the fitting of the panels to the institute apartments. Each weighs nearly two tons. The team is nervous. Just one slip and they panels behind. Crucial for reconducting heat and energy performance. [Music] Once it [Music] [Music] While the apartments go up, Meg Cedaroth continues her fight for carbon neutrality. Hi, Meg. How are you? I get my email? Thanks to her audits, she can track all the materials used in construction, where they came from, and how they were delivered. So, let at the materials. She waste, plus travel of all Mazdar employees and poor piles. All these figures are entered into a special dashboard every month to show me and her colleagues the total CO2 generated. We can confirm any details later if we need to check up on something. And with business travel, you actually have the flights. the flight data for to take a building month. Let footprint. Go to China to double check so we can easily measure the carbon footprint for each. Right. Exactly. Mhm. So, last one, waste. Yep. Nothing the site except for waste water from the toilets and then the food waste because we don to um input all this information and the SMS dashboard and I what month. So far total tons of carbon is 63.9 63.9 tons. Okay. This benchmarking is unprecedented in the UAE and could help me cut the carbon footprint on future building phases. Another milestone, Samir solar farm is under construction. The power it produces will be fed to the grid to offset the CO2 that Meg tracks produced during construction. While part of the team finishes installing the racks, others position the solar panels. A solar plant in the searing desert, lemonade from lemons. Not only has Samir built a solar farm, he can use that knowledge to install more solar farms in the UAE. And he can be proud that he the biggest solar farm of its kind in the Middle East. is my brainchild. Yes, I am proud of it. I initiated the project and I will see it through completion. So, I think God has given us so much resources to uh take advantage of. Just need to use our brain and utilize uh God-given gift for us. And uh we overdue, but better late than never. It [Music] Okay. At the peak of construction on the Mazdar Institute, thousands of construction workers were laboring round the clock on shifts. As work reaches completion, that number scales [Music] back. Despite setbacks and frustrations, the project is advancing step by step, day by day, carried on by a team of people committed to a sustainable future. From 5 12 million square meters of desert in just 18 months, the team has built two laboratories for research on renewable energy. 101 apartments for post-graduate students from around the world. [Music] and a modern version of the traditional Middle Eastern wind tower. Now they roof on the library. [Music] [Music] Once that the painting and decorating. In a few months, the Mazdar Institute of Science and Technology will open its doors to its first students. A sustainable college built sustainably to teach sustainable construction. Building the institute itself was a test and the team has passed. It initiative will reduce Abu Dhabi overall carbon footprint, but Sonad Ahmed believes the knowhow gained so far and the lessons learned can change the world. I project from the very beginning. From developing the brief, meeting the faculty, appointing the designers, the consultants, the contractors, the subcontractors, I lived every problem, every success, every milestone we achieved, every milestone we we missed. It I will pass to my kids. You know, I have two kids which definitely they will know about this and every time we pass by, I yeah, we future. What we are building right now is going to have its uh its effect for future policy makers to actually take what we what we we implemented worldwide. It only building sustainable building, it actually building sustainable world. [Music] ice from the ground and where trees are man-made. 70% of the power in this European nation comes from sources of energy that are clean and renewable. The chief source of energy is also unconventional. The tiny country Iceland on the edge of the North Atlantic is the world leader in geothermal power. Geothermal plants take natural reservoirs of steam from deep underground and convert them to electricity. This plant opened just 2 years ago. Yet work has begun to double its capacity. It new plant with whole new headaches. Only from the outside. This is the drawing. Huge headaches. We won crane back today. Huge parts installed with outsiz tools. Tidy. It favorite tool in the job. miles of pipes and slle gates to control problems that baffle the brightest engineers. Absolutely. But when pump number one was running, we had the full pressure on the suction side of the pump. The extension to the plan must be ready in 6 months, but the severe weather here could wreck their timetable. This builds up onto the profiles and breaks them. And we break it off because that, you know, puts more pressure. We have to let it be. And this is what the wind, only the wind did to a full column like this. Most of all, to double the plant capacity, they need to find twice as much steam. We have an obligation to provide certain amount of power for the project as a whole. And we to uh establish enough uh steam for the new turbines. In a small village in France, a pilot project is trying a whole new approach to geothermal power. There are no steam reservoirs here. So they have to drill deep into the earth rock, then add water to create steam. But first, you have to to hold on and to this crew. Two decades of research and work to reach a source of energy hidden 5,000 m below the surface. The last day. It nerve-wracking. Engine is running. Let Water If it works, this plant could help wean the world off fossil fuels. Stop it. In Iceland, Marcus Fry enjoys having a green job. Like obviously it good for the planet and it feels good when you do whatever you can, you know, but I don that Geologist Gretar Iverson knows geothermal power is not an exact science. We are definitely gambling. It difficult to say about a well prior to drilling or prior to opening it up for the first time in France. Zavier Ger has high hopes for the venture. It new and to to develop some technology to to bring to a long living system. and Jean Paul Fat experienced but still excited by the project. It exciting seereasing on the [Music] winter in Iceland yet construction has begun. Freezing temperatures and constant wind impede progress. Tens of thousands of parts have to be cut, assembled, welded, and adjusted. A gigantic jigsaw puzzle, and every piece must fit precisely. 10 mm over. Yes. I need to have it back. Weld a piece here so it won 5 mm. Don foolish, otherwise I will kick your ass. At the foot of the mountain, Marcus races the clock to build a new cooling tower. He supervises dozens of workers, few of them from Iceland. Iceland is one of the world most developed countries. Very good. Door. Yet among the most sparsely populated with just 300,000 people, it suffers from a shortage of workers. Yep. Go ahead. Marcus Europe where salaries are lower, but the work ethic is strong. And the main thing with places like this is experience because these guys are working with us for the first time, like 80% of them. And we had to show them everything, just absolutely everything. I mean, a ratchet and a spanner. And where do we use this? Because some of the guys use these as hammers. Some of the guys, you know, use this as a as a, you know, to open things. What? How can this be? They learn fast. In 6 months, the new generators must be ready to run. But the crew doesn even English. You take level, you know, level. Uhhuh. Yeah. Put level along and then you can just get pen. They do understand basic English, but you know, it to explain something to them. Then we go get an English-sp speakaking one. We tell him and he translates. So, we always find a way to do it. We can languages stop us. It weather. If you let the weather control you, you Iceland. Depending on the direction of the wind, steam can envelop Marcus Workers at the tops of the chimneys can These are the conditions we have to work in. You can imagine like I can barely see my colleague here next to me. So you can imagine if we trying to work together. This gas as comfortable as it can be, it than that. It can be really annoying. Not just annoying, steam can be deadly. Steam from the bowels of the earth keeps the plant alive, flowing through the pipes like blood through veins. Gretar Iverson is a kind of steam doctor. His job is to keep the plant in good health. Sodium in the steam corrods metal. Gretar has to find it and eliminate it before it can damage the [Music] turbines. Another element in the steam is also harmful to life. Gretar can but he can smell it. This is pure geothermal steam mixed with uncondensible gases like hydrogen sulfide and which is a poisonous gas. So um yes when I feel that the concentration is getting relatively high I I back a little bit away. If the concentrations go above 3 400 parts per million then you would fall down and die. So it you know what to avoid it it problem. Hydrogen sulfide smells like rotten eggs. But that [Music] problems. Marcus and his crew are building the cooling towers and today they work down [Music] wind. They can they carry a meter to warn them of danger. This is a H2S gas reader and it gives us a reading of how much gas there is in here. It sulfur. This is much more accurate. And if it starts, it starts making noises. It peeps. And if this reaches a level of 18, we have to leave the site cuz people start passing out cuz you can smell it once it goes past a certain level. Like when you drive into the area, you can smell a bit of a smell and that It about level 15. It goes above 15, we just have to go. The level is creeping up toward the danger zone. There this gas. It travels in pockets. And if this pocket comes around you and sits maybe around your head, you take one breath, you pass out. And if no one pulls you out of it, unfortunately, you die. That something, you stay too. There someone to back you up. But if you both pass out, I hope you have a nice trip to [Music] [Music] heaven. The land of ice is also the land of heat. Rising from the Earth ground steams, sizzles, and bubbles. Iceland is one of the most volcanically active regions on Earth. We are standing in the middle of the western Icelandic volcanic zone and you see certain uh surface manifestations like eruptive fissures. uh to the sides both east and and west of us we have an older area which used to be in the middle of the rift zone but has since drifted east and west. The mid-Atlantic rift between the American and European continental plates is one long chain of active underwater volcanoes. In the north they surface and traverse Iceland which itself straddles the two plates as they move apart. The rift has left a huge scar. On the right is Europe. On the left, [Music] America. In the middle sits Hella Shidy. Once a ski station, it transformed into something much more [Music] profitable. The surrounding land gets plenty of rain, about 30 in a year, and the rain seeps down to the hot rocks. Heat and water, the ingredients of steam. Gretar is hunting for more steam to feed the expanding plant. But each zone he inspects is not only different, it changing. Gretar and his crew never stop collecting data. They use maps of underground activity to help decide where to drill. They use the global positioning system to pinpoint possible sites. From there, Gretar uses his gut. 10 years ago, we had a massive earthquake which lasted for 4 years and the area rose by 20 or 30 cm. uh this was due to a magmatic intrusion at seven kilometers depth below us. So sampling the surface fummeralss gives us an indication of whether this magma is reaching the surface or not. We measure the temperature of the springs and the pools. We measure the the pH, the acidity. Other things we do is we sample the gas coming from these springs and these fummeralss. The composition of the gas and the concentrations of certain constituents in the gas give us a direct indication of the temperature in the geothermal reservoir beneath us. So by sampling the surface gas, we can map the subsurface reservoir and we can have a better understanding and a better idea where to drill uh if the area would be developed in the future. [Music] In volcanic regions where fire and water are abundant, all you need to do is drill down about 6 to 9,000 ft to find steam at almost 500° F. The steam flows from the wells through large pipes to the plant. Then the steam is cleaned of impurities before reaching its final destination, the [Music] turbine. The steam turns the turbine to power an electric generator. The Italians pioneered electricity from steam more than a century ago, and it still works the same way. At the turbine cold water forms a depression that accelerates the steam and improves the turbine condenser. The condenser is linked underground to a cooling tower. Inside, pumps carry the water to the top where it [Music] fans. On the way down, water hits the air, cools, and returns to the [Music] condenser. Although it sits apart from the main producing machine, the cooling tower is an essential part of the plant. Tower number four still awaits its chimneys. Each is the size of a school bus and weighs as much as a grand piano. Yeah, there must be this. To lift them, they rented one of the biggest cranes in the country, but it emergency elsewhere on the site. This is just terrible. We won today. We just have to lift him tomorrow. Start lifting it when when it over your feet. If it lift one ring. Yeah, I doubt it, though. Set up the crane, lift it in, probably fasten it. So annoying. Go. Nothing can happen till they get the crane back. As suddenly as it vanished, it back. I This crane is such a little I know it standing on four legs on four little pieces of wood. It should be. Yes. But it know, it the country. It weighs 80 tons and has a 120 ft arm. So long, the crane operator can be guided. But the bottom communication is very important with the crane driver. You know, if he goes down too fast, then like you see this could break this floor. For instance, this just has to be exactly level. And you can see how close it is. The cut here and see it centimeter, not even a few millimeters here. So this is very precise. The crane operator has to set the chimney to within a quart of an inch. Then the crew must align it to a fraction of that. [Music] while the crane stands by in case they need a lift and the meters running. For rental, it to,000 per hour. We don you know, the expensive crane. We just want to do the job good, but we try to adjust it as good as possible now. And uh later on we use special tools to finalize the adjustments. No special tools here, just brute force. [Music] But it the final [Music] adjustments. By the end of the day, all four chimneys are in place. Now we can get rid of the expensive crane. [Music] And there says a storm is [Music] brewing. Iceland is the Saudi Arabia of steam. This area contains some of the most productive steam wells in the world with huge reserves, enough to power the whole country indefinitely. But two wells side by side may produce far different amounts of steam. Deciding which wells to tap is the job of scientists like Gretar. We are definitely gambling. It very difficult to say about a well prior to drilling or prior to opening it up for the first time. You need a lot of steam. Sometimes you find very good quality steam but there it. Generally speaking in this area need just over 2 kilos of steam per second to produce each megawatt of electricity. These wells are probably producing some 17 18 kilos of steam per second and that eight or even 9 megawatts of electricity. So these are extremely good and we Geothermal electricity has made Iceland the richest country per capita in all of Europe. This gift from the Earth seems inexhaustible. So long as they tap the right wells, they can power the new turbines for the plant. So, we to find enough steam, and I think we made it now. So, we we have more than enough at the moment. With active volcanoes and plenty of rain, Iceland is made for geothermal power. But geothermal energy is everywhere if you dig deep enough. Far from any volcanoes, in a French village just a few miles from the German border, an international team is developing a new type of geothermal technology. It by a European consortium 20 years in the making. Iceland inspired the idea, but the team had to invent the solution. The plant opened just three months ago, but the team has to constantly adapt to surprises. At this moment, the plant is shut down for repairs. Yes. First, you have to to hold on and to destroy it. This one is okay. Polo supervises the repair, assisted by his right-hand man, Zavier. Advising the team is Peter, a mechanic from Iceland. To find the wrong I think it is shaky, but his advice is priceless. The team is using a punk from Iceland and it hasn conditions. A far cry from Iceland. Beautiful. In Iceland, geologists create maps of underground activity, then decide where to drill. Giant steel drills rattle the ground 24 hours a day. At depths of around 6,000 ft, the drills reach reservoirs of steam at 500° F. This is the raw material that flows up the well through pipes to the plant where it electricity. Rain will come sooner or later to renew the reservoirs of steam. To hit 500° rock here in France, they have to drill down nearly 15,000 ft, twice as deep as in Iceland. The rock down there is dry, so they have to sink two shafts. One to inject water to produce steam, another to pump the steam up. When the steam leaves the power plant, it and pumped back into the well. The French inject the well with local water. Some of the saltiest water in the world. In fact, the village here is called S, salt in the local dialect. Salt has eaten away at the steel pump and put everybody back to work. [Applause] Breakdowns like this don Iceland where the water could bottle it. Because of the high salinity of the water and the the the number of particles which were on the on the water, we damaged the inlet of the pump. It Iceland, the water is less mineralized than ours. And we are now looking for a new methology of the pump. [Music] So we have to to find materials which can uh support this type of water and it Yeah, I think I think it was corrosion hit it up. They need to find a new pump that will resist corrosion. In the meantime, they jerryrig a repair and put the pump back in place. Now it for waiting. We have some tests to do and we assume that this pump with the old methology will list not so much time but enough to make the test we want. And after we put everything out and change the pump itself. On a normal day they could lay 15 to 20 sections of pipe. Today anxious to finish the repair they laid 25. We were as speed as we can and we did a good job today. Very good job. The last today. [Music] Peter is persuasive. This is really the last one. After that, we wouldn With a second wind and the urge to get to bed, they lay the last pipe in record time. Very good. In my head, very good. And in my muscle, it will go if it lists. So until Friday, it will be good. But we can manage it. It okay. seems to be very good. [Music] On Monday, they find a whole new [Music] setback. Iceland is bracing for a big storm. At Helashidy, Marcus to install the fans for the cooling towers. That was good. The blades turn at more than 60 mph, so they need to be firmly anchored. [Music] Tight it. It lovely little tool here. Like a climber. To tighten the bolts, an ordinary wrench won [Music] I love it. It job. It average bolt tightening is maybe like 10 Newton meters. This is has to be 1,200. It just scared of dropping the key. Marcus has to push till he hears the telltale click. That we wanted. It isn 1180. That means we pressure. Thank God. They have to repeat the ordeal dozens of times for each fan. It Ah, yes. Finished. It [Music] When rain hits the site, it creates halves and have nots. The welders have shelter. They can rain. The have knots are exposed to the elements. Marcus is a have not. [Applause] Inside the chimneys, at least he has shelter from the wind. A visitor has brought the extreme weather. Tropical storm Bertha. Probably the only tropical thing you Iceland. To precisely angle the fan blades, they it problem when we don tools. People buy nonwaterproof tools to bring to the wetest area in the country. So now we have to put plastic over it, seal it, and now we can hardly see through the plastic. It makes everything slippery. And now I I down. It in the rain. That say. But this is what I get paid for. Helping Marcus is a student on summer break. As the bolts are tightened, she checks the angle of each blade for best performance. 7.9° is perfect and we to have 7.9 or 7.8 or 8. We cannot have anything else. And that hard it is to move this one like 00.1. It the little student needs a boost. Sorry, we just are trying to get the box because our staff is so small. She can see up on the fan blades. It this. Time to blow it. Okay. She announces any movement in the blade angle down to the fraction of a degree. What? Oh, yeah. So, sorry. [Music] Maybe she needs one more tool like a megaphone. 9 0 8 7.9 Ulie is Marcus he years. He cooling towers. Yet, building his reputation took sacrifice. I see my family 3 months in a year. Yeah. I married with my job. I have my wife is second. Sorry to say, but it true. It true. This year, his son is working with him. Pocket money for Steven and good company for his dad. He wants to make his driving license. He wants to have a car later on. And I told him, You can work here. You can make money for your driving driving license, and we are together the whole time. It but check it. doesn Right. Is it 32 or 22? 22. Okay. 7 9 [Music] The boss weather. Snow would be easier to work in. This is different cuz this is rain. This is wet and the wind is so strong at the moment. This is more like a storm. You know, it and going and in winter it steady. You know, it It this. The weather wins. The rest of the fins are grounded, too fragile to be buffed in this wind. Usually, if it was something bigger, we could probably lift it because these are so delicate. We don want to take the chance. So, we all find little things we can do, but it shame because we need to carry on with the fan blades. But what We Ahead lies another set back for another crew. At the pilot plant in France, the repaired pump is ready for [Music] testing. Polo and Zavier are like expectant fathers, proud, and nervous. We are a bit stressed because we have a lot of parameter to work on and to be sure that every every stage is running very well to increase progressively the flow to decrease the flow to be sure that the pump is running well. It good start. [Music] pressure. The engineers stand in the repair system. Engineers constantly monitor the output and pressure. All goes well until Zavier detects an anomaly. Water The indicators are in the red. Now, if we go over 40%, you stop it. No choice but to stop the pump and the test. One of the pump seals has failed. A small glitch with a big impact. For the pump to bring up steam, the pipe has to be airtight. But a seal is leaking. As a result, they can reach the pressure they need. In the office, everybody is working because one ring had broken and we have to change it and it to change this ring, we have to have no pressure inside the hole. And so we have to decrease this pressure by injecting some salt water. So it needs time and money to be done. So it to make geothermal. To replace the faulty seal, they have to lower the water level. They call it killing the well. They do it by adding salt to increase the water density. For once, their everyday enemy becomes an ally. The faulty pump caused days of [Music] delay. One week later, they try again. Once more, hope returns. Pressure goes to the exchanger. One gets water. We have pressure inside. Engine Everyone is back in place. Hollowo at the controls and Zachary at the command post. What? [Music] More adjustments and more tension. I open filter one you see something? Is it still going up? [Music] At last the pressure rises and steam flows through the pump. Now we will be able to produce electricity with the flow we have on this pump. We are able to produce electricity. We are proud of what we do now. We are a bit stressed because there is a lot of of risk and of pressure on the crew to do it. But we are very proud of what we do now. You don search for geothermal power. You can make it in long. If salts works, it than a village. [Music] It will fuel hope for geothermal power to one day supply the world. In Iceland, tropical storm Bertha has moved on. Every morning at 7:30, Marcus arrives from Reikuic. One morning ritual is as important as his coffee. Could they have playtime with Bruno? No, there requirement. But since I put it on him first, they sort of asked me to now because they know that he has a vest. Before that, they didn had dog vests. Since he was 3 months old, he been living in the car with me on on work site. So, everyone here knows him. And he also for our company cuz like when we around the cooling towers, he knows that different company coming in wearing a different uniform, he barks at them and lets us know straight away. He good dog. As you can see the mountains here behind me, that there like he does for 12 hours a day. He gets to just basically run free. And I think he not to mention how much I spoil him. [Music] Marcus boiling water kept the foundations of tower number four from freezing. Tower number three was just a skeleton and the crew was still green. Yet soon they overtook their own schedule. While the estimated time for a tower, I think according to the contract is about 5 to 6 months. Like the first tower took us maybe 5 months. Now we making a tower in about 3 months. But don [Music] Working like acrobats in the wind and rain, they erected the towers without a single calamity. We have been actually very lucky. There have been no serious accidents. People have actually just crushed their hands, broken broken two fingers. That the worst that been very lucky and we seven cooling towers here. The four towers that Marcus worked on this year are all complete. Now the challenges move indoors. Inside the plant, workers apply final touches and run the last test before the turbines are turned on. With the startup looming, trouble German engineers from the company that installed the condenser detect a problem in the maze of pipes. One of the pumps that carries water to the cooling tower isn [Music] working. We are starting here a cooling circuit, a small circuit with two parallel pumps. They are working absolutely parallel and only one pump should work. Now we have tried it on that side. This pump is working correctly and makes a pressure of around 1.5 bars. That should be when the pump is working. And here this pump makes a pressure of zero. That means no water is flowing. Although it is absolutely parallel and we assuming that something is wrong here in this suction side. No suction, no power. Somewhere in this maze lies the tiny problem that shut down the whole plant. Absolutely. But when pump number one was running, we had the full pressure on the suction side of the pump. Drafts every engineer to solve the mystery. We will start now pump number one. We open the suction valve, start the pump, look to the pressure. Then we do the same on this side. And afterwards when it has no pressure, they have to open the pipe line. As a last resort, they decide to open the pipe itself and examine the suction valve that engineer. [Music] But the valve seems to be working fine. The mystery remains. Can it be blocked? Okay, we have seen it correctly or better. Let With no more ideas, they put the valve back and try again. Looks good. Check. Okay. Here. Look. Now we have the pressure. This M need to kick. There was a lot of ghost in this area. Maybe, maybe. But now we have the pressure. All things are okay. The problem was that maybe something has forced this flap into closed position. And now when we have opened it, had it moved at sometimes a little bit, it has gone now in open position. It running well. Okay, it Fine. Okay. Nearby, a familiar face. Still working up high, but not in the [Music] towers. I holiday now. I It there, so you know, there me until the next towers come up. So, basically, I just got assigned to a different job. They asked me where I like to go. Well, the day they asked me, it was really bad weather outside, so I chose to come inside and ever since then it been sunny outside. So, but this is fine. I week. It from the cooling towers. I them for like two and a half years now. It different and you know, so I in in about a year to get back into the cooling towers. Until then, it relaxing. I mean, I could go on holiday, you know, without pay, of course, for a year and just come back. But, yeah, it still we decided. That think there as long as I have a job and everything okay, I the handyman. It that. I don be responsible to anyone. It nice. [Music] Right on schedule, thanks partly to Marcus. The new generators fire [Music] up. In less than a year, the young plant has doubled its output. Year by year, geothermal power plays a bigger role in producing electricity. And the plant at Helashidi takes Iceland one step near its goal to become the first country with no need for coal or oil. Iceland inspires other nations to tap their natural gifts. Wind, waves, sun, energy as clean as it is endless. Geologists have mapped another huge steam reservoir at Hella Shidy. Enough to double its output again. One slight problem, the pipes are already as tangled as they can get, so the factory can another plant right next door. 40% of the world into buildings for lighting, cooking, heating, and air conditioning. Functions that not only gobble energy, but release greenhouse gases. Architects are building the Pearl River Tower as a giant antidote. At 71 stories, it will become the second tallest building in the city of Guangha in the southeast of China. The tower [Music] The river tower is part of the future central business district. When complete, it will take five place in this metropolis. For now, this whole area is a huge building site. All the work must be finished by 2010 when Guangha will host the Asian Games. China intends the Pearl River Tower is a sign that the world polluting nation is starting to clean up its act to build this ecological highrise. World players have a key role. Roger Fchett is the architect in charge. He specializes in clean energy for buildings. If this ambitious project meets its goals, it will be Roger greatest success. It risk. It in the history of of the construction industry. Uh the problems that the world sees right now with global warming and shortages of energy are forcing us to rethink uh how we design buildings and how we build buildings. I Shanghai world. Whatever happens in 20 years in my entire [Music] life. It technology is new and untested. [Music] [Music] and finally standing by in Finland, Risto Jutseni is far from the building site but close to the project. He turbines that are key to powering the Pearl River Tower. It is my dream to get the earth going without polluting the it only make it really green. Together, this international team of eco engineers faces the challenge of a lifetime. The deadline is fixed. Whatever problems arise, they have 2 and 1/2 years to transform this hole into the world Roger knows all about building skyscrapers. [Music] In the past 70 years, they more than 10,000 projects in more than 50 countries, but nothing like this. A building that taps the wind and the sun to produce as much energy as it uses. A building that curves pollution instead of creating it. Buildings may seem inoffensive. When we think about the the problems of global warming and carbon emissions, most people think about cars and buses and and uh transportation and and factories. Uh but the reality of it is that there come from office buildings and residential buildings than from those other sectors. Well, in this decade, uh, China will become, uh, the largest user of fossil fuels on the planet. But for the first time, China is realizing that their own natural resources are limited and they need to find ways to reduce uh the amount of energy that they consume. So uh how people um use buildings uh how people um survive within buildings is is going to be very important uh to our future. In the last 10 years, Guanjo has grown from 8 million people to 11 million. It cities in China, a country that has 101 cities with more than a million inhabitants. [Music] [Music] It to Guangha. An even longer journey lies ahead for Roger Pchette. Miha. Hello. How are you? Nice to meet you. Hey, great to see you. Roger is making his first Heat. Heat. [Music] This is the site of the Pearl River Tower. Off to the right here is the hole. Uh right now uh the project is uh still well below grade. Uh it is about 28 m deep. Uh when the project is complete, it m into the air. Uh to put that into perspective, uh this building off to my right is roughly 100 m tall. So our project will be roughly three times that height. Throughout construction, Roger will have to negotiate a slew of challenges. [Music] Unforeseen air, new techniques here is when it differences, and diplomatic solutions. Above all looms an unyielding deadline. The tower also has to guard against unseen forces. China is one of the world earthquakerprone countries. Guanghou itself lies near a major fault zone. For the tower, protection starts at the bottom. The tower is designed to withstand 8564 across Northern California. Erecting the vital foundations is just one of the best. He supervises an army of welders, steel workers, and crane operators. Hanuanu is the tower lynch and the teams on site. My work goes like this. First of all, I have to assess how to execute these plan. Then I pass these plans on to the workers. Every day at midnight, I go down to the site to look over the work and see if everything the way we have 500 work site. Right now, the tasks are well defined. Professional team installs the crank and then there working on construction beams and putting the steel framework in place. Panchuan Zoo makes sure the engineers plans are followed to the letter. In this 3D jigsaw puzzle, one slight deviation could cost millions to [Music] fix. This metal forest will safeguard the foundations against quakes. The ground may shake, but the tower won budge. It the building process. [Music] Because the tower site is so complex, Roger Pchette visits regularly to brief the managers. He also checks the coordination between the specialty workers and makes sure work is advancing as planned. [Music] [Music] But there meet with the local team to fix it. [Music] Some of the Chinese engineers are questioning the revolutionary ventilation system. They new technology. It wages a constant battle to change habits in the world of construction and language complicates every problem. have the five control. Uh I think this is really important. I I think that this is something that we really need to focus on and I think time is short. One of the real benefits of of of having a double wall is that we have the ability to to isolate that that hot air that energy and to pull it out of the building. While Roger and his team aspire to revolutionize power consumption, the local engineers prefer their tried and tested methods. But I I I wanted to make you aware of of um our concern and and and why we are concerned about about um about pulling this hot air through the chilled beam. To win them over, Roger must be diplomatic but firm. a certain quantity of air that has to be rejected. He can yield if he wants to realize his dream. A building that generates all the energy it needs. No single solution exists. He requires a cocktail of skillful technology and ingenious design. First, the very position of the tower is key to tapping two large sources of energy. the sun and the wind. The tower walls facing the sun are covered in photovoltaic cells, and the tower accelerates the wind toward its four huge turbines. Unlike most buildings, the tower will let in a flood of light to conserve electricity. At the same time, a protective layer on the facade will capture excess heat from the sun to keep the interior cool without relying on energy guzzling air conditioning. It technologies that makes the Pearl River Tower the first of its kind. Roger returns to his office in Chicago and hopes that the local team has fully understood what he has told them. [Music] The engineers qualms have caused delays. The deadline is a mere 18 months away. Although the core of the tower has passed ground level, the basement floors still aren finished. The site is as busy as an antill. Workers measure thousands of planks which will form a temporary mold for each of the concrete floors. [Music] Steel workers will then construct the metal structure to support the reinforced concrete. The whole floor takes shape and the process will be repeated 71 times until the tower is complete. With an unyielding deadline, the management has to find a way to make up for lost time. Simple. Work into the night while the rest of the city unwinds. [Music] Shu Chiao Shang is brought in to get the work back on track. The weight of the skyscraper now rests on his shoulders. It pioneering time-saving techniques. He puts his ideas to the test at once. We concrete in the east. It takes about 30 workers. By this evening, we will have poured 1,000 cubic meters of concrete. We can be ready for the concrete there. Shu decides to pour concrete for one vast area rather than pouring it into smaller sections. If it works, he save precious time. Sho room for error. The vast operation begins. More than 1,000 cubic meters of concrete are about to be poured. The equivalent of 50 cement mixer trucks. Weeks of sweat will be everyone up. Station mounts between the bosses and the workers. [Music] It takes a huge amount of coordination to organize the arrival of mixers, pinpoint where to pour the concrete and spread it properly. Supervisors are under pressure. [Music] and long hours without [Music] each concrete is pouring along must stop while they make urgent affairs with a slew of repercussions. The work is placed on standby. Cement mix are sent back and the chain reactions across the top part of the steel structure. A weak point will be created that won detected once it [Music] [Applause] [Music] in the end of the day. success. At the other side of the site, teams of steel workers continue non-stop. In less than a week, it will be their turn to cut concrete floor. In all, it will take more than 3,000 cement mixer loads to build the tower foundations. The site managers check all the team plans in detail. Tons of steel rods are received and positioned according to the blueprints. At every step, surveyors watch for the slightest deviation from the plans. One more. The tower is rising above ground, but work continues in the foundations down to the building. Not all challenges on the site take the form of concrete and steel. Some are flesh and blood. She has had to recruit more workers to stay on schedule. The workforce hails from all over China. Most come from Shanghai, a city over 70 miles away. Others have homes even farther away. revolve around the building site. Co-workers have become family. [Music] The site has become home. [Music] [Music] In a vast country like this, there common language. China speaks more than a 100 dialects. Dozens are spoken here alone. [Music] Mandarin, one of China languages, is used to communicate key information. No time for misunderstandings here. Clarity counts. And for the clearest vision of the site itself, you need another perspective. A view from the tallest building in Guangha, the TV tower. From this height, Roger can show how location will shape the ability to generate power. It the Pearl River Tower that we we take into consideration the context uh the physical context and and the environmental context. Uh the Pearl River Tower is going to be built along a central axis for the new central business district uh in the new town area of Guanghou. Uh the building will be located on the northwest corner and in this location the building will have uninterrupted access to sunshine through most of the day. As the sun rotates through the sky uh we have this great park that will sit in front of the building that will uh not block the sunshine that uh will come in contact with it. By carefully angling the skyscraper, the architects will fully exploit solar energy. The sun south and east. Photovalttaic cells will be integrated into the building external shading system to provide electricity, but also to protect workers from excess solar radiation. But the other thing that happens is the prevailing winds in Guanghou for most of the year are coming from the south. And as these winds pass through this new central business district, there will be no other buildings blocking this wind before they come in contact with the Pearl River tower. So, uh, the winds will hit the turbines and they will be the first thing that the wind sees. So, between absorption of wind and absorption of of of sunlight, these energy streams will be turned into power and this power will be help uh will be what helps to drive the building. But at the site, the building is far from finished. Shu is installing a new crane to speed things up. We finished installing this crane m tall for lifting big lift a maximum of 64 tons. That enough for all our needs. Special because it can rise as the tower rises. In other words, its height of 54 m doesn [Applause] All right. After that test, we [Music] need. Everyone results come in. [Music] The crane passes with flying colors. Now it can start lifting all their loads and make construction fly. Within weeks, the core of the tower reaches 40 m, 120 ft. To work these heights takes the construction equivalent of trapeze artists. They They surrounds the core and supports the extremities of the higher floors. Their best friend, the safety rope. Although the steeple jacks are all qualified climbers, the work is risky. These guys require a combination of daring and caution. Truly dropping these heights could kill. To maintain the tower girders weighing more than 10 tons must be precisely positioned. Since the crane operator can far each girder into place, if necessary, adjust the gutters. No room for vertigo here. [Applause] steeple jacks, steel workers, concrete. Work has been going full steam for a year now. Next comes a huge step. This is a critical step in the work. We climbing. Using this system, we able to take away the scaffolding. The support side are already where the climbing system will be attached. It at the top. This system is the only one of its kind in China. Along with the crane, Shu hopes it will help keep construction on schedule. We work on the core using this automatic system which is controlled by computers. So from that point, we much more efficient. We days to four or five days. And at that speed, we to 300 in 8 months as planned. In a nation of 1 billion people, Shang Shing Wan is unique. He system. So these are the supports. We place inside the core of the what we in shape the building. for this wall and according to using the hydraulic system for example the floor is 3 high and 12 m to be so the workers can then start working on a steel frame before so on and so forth. It coordinate the installation of all the platforms inside the central core and the blue structures on the outside so crews can work safely without scaffolding. If all goes well, the backbone of the Pearl River Tower will start to take shape at a meter ahead. This leviathan can manipulate these man components with the precision of a surgeon [Music] scalpel. Shen guides each section into place by keeping in constant contact with the crane operator. [Music] At the same time, teams are assembling the platform so work can continue as soon as the self-climbing scaffolding is in place. [Applause] [Music] [Music] With his innovative ideas, Shu has recouped lost time. Construction moves at full speed. Now the tower can be seen from a distance standing 100 m tall. Almost a third of its eventual [Music] height. Gerder by girder the skeleton takes shape. As the framework rises the floors follow close behind and Shu has more tricks up his sleeve. For the floors, we use a very advanced technique. It and we our local needs. The biggest advantage of this galvanized fuel floor system with no support. We don support it when we pour the concrete. We build right after laying the flooring. So it serves as a supporting form and allows us to eliminate shoring up. Its lateral mooring means there close relationship between the steel and the concrete. And the frame can support the weight of the concrete and the people working on it. So the entire operation is efficient, quick, and allows us to work in complete safety. [Music] For a floor, we need a dozen or so workers. We work for three days to install it. After that, we need a day for the metal frame, a day for the concrete. With all the work together, we almost 4 days extra. After that, the floor is finished. The progress impresses a visitor, architect Roger Fchett. Barely a year has passed since he first came to the site. It from a hole in the ground to a vision in the sky. The green workspace of tomorrow. [Music] This is uh what will be a typical office floor within the building. And if you can imagine about one year from today, what you you you breathing air for the building will come up from underneath your feet. It from the floor and na it natural buoyancy of air through the breathing zone and that will get their fresh air for the building. What you is there panels and those panels will be cooled down and at their cooler temperature there happens between the panels and the and the people within the space. And this is what comfortable. When we go over to the perimeter of the building, what you there internally ventilated double wall facade. As the sun comes in contact with the skin, it heats up hot air within the layers of glass of this exterior wall. That hot air is then drawn up through the building and we can use that hot air for other purposes. So uh air from the space will travel low into the exterior wall and will rise up between the layers of glass in the space and it is that air movement in the glass that causes a cooling of the glass and will help to maintain thermal comfort in the space. Now hot air that is collected in that glass will be brought back to a technical floor and we reuse that energy elsewhere in the building. Roger heads to the rooftop to review the work with Shu Chaos Shang. For the moment, we build up to the 22nd floor. That wind here construction of each floor took about 12 minutes. [Music] However, they So, we finishing the year building square over there. where we are right now. The first mechanical level starts about one floor above us. And it level that we Yeah. Uh yeah, you know, it nice. When we were down on the ground, you couldn now you nice breeze, you know. So, uh I excited. I think uh when these turbines are in place, they a good job. They a lot of power. But how do you insert a wind turbine? a notorious source of vibration and noise inside an office building. Roger and his team had to go to Finland to find a solution. [Music] In this Scandinavian country, where the sun appears for only half the year, inhabitants have tapped an alternative source of clean [Music] energy. As well as classic turbines, you find designs adapted to city life. No noise, not even vibrations. A jewel from the north brought to the Pearl River Tower. The man who pioneered vertical turbines in Finland is Risto Jutsanimi. Risto has the longest track record for making urban turbines. So, the designers of the Pearl River Tower chose him to help build a new concept into the world of architecture and give their skyscraper a green advantage. This uh building is like sail. So, it means that it is very high winds pressure. Other buildings you build so that they are taking care of the winds otherwise to get try to get the wind away from the house. Here you are collecting it. We have here south and here other side we have the north and the prevailing wind the mine wind comes from the south on the turbine floors where air is funneled into tunnels. The Pearl River Tower taps a phenomenon of fluid dynamics called the Venturi effect. When the space narrows, the air particles accelerate. So the faster wind speed produced means more energy will be produced by the turbines. The power production uh is also something what we have records in in this kind of wind turbines. So we can say that it can be one megawatt per one square meter in this per tower. So when we get this square meter power to our knowledge we can do whatever this very inspirated project a very very challenging and good for us. Here it is what I want to show you. This is an special windmill which is approximately 1 m wide and 4 m high. But this is the only windmill what you can put in urban circumstances. It is totally soundless. It is very special model and you can put it wherever you want even middle in town. As you can see if you have propeller you cannot put propeller roof of the house because there decibel. We are so near and you cannot hear anything. This is our specialty. You can touch your bare hands to our turbine and it is not dangerous at all. This is the only turbine what I know that you can touch even when it is moving in full speed and you cannot make any danger things. So it doesn birds or anybody else. And you see there is rather good speed already and there is maybe only 3 m/s wind and it doesn go faster than this. This is why it safe. It is always going this slowly rotation and it comes bigger and bigger. And this is just perfect. Perfect ball like Perville River [Music] tower. The University of Vasa is known for its research into electronics. Bristo has made this his test lab with his colleagues. He a system to monitor his turbines remotely. He can check wind speed, wind direction, and power output and use a webcam to spot [Music] problems. Risto needs all this data to keep improving the system he created and to replicate this model at the Pearl River Tower. No sun. This is what we try to do in China. We have four turbies and we are four monitors and we can look from here what happens and what is the production in China. I think this come to be very beautiful cooperation with the university in the future. At the building site, the floor that houses the turbines is about to be constructed. Here the facade narrows down to the floor where the turbines will be installed. At this height, architects have calculated the wind should accelerate by up to 250% before reaching the tunnel where the turbines are [Music] housed. The curb is created using customshaped girdters. Perfect for the turbines, but a nightmare for the construction [Music] teams. They must be positioned with absolute precision and fix securely once they in place under Shu The last big bird for the turbine floor arrives. As with the others, just getting it off the ground is ahead. [Music] very difficult to lift it properly. It [Music] In cuttingedge construction like this, each step has its complications. Almost the entire 19th floor has been built. All the girders are bolted and welded together. Total weight 400 tons equal to one jumbo jet full of passengers. Everything must be checked once and for all to detect any problems that could upset the schedule for the other floors. [Music] Now we are lifting the girders for the construction of the 1920s. [Music] For everyone, reaching the turbine floor is symbolic. A milestone not just for the tower but the nation, engineers, foremen, workers, everyone is working full out so the Pearl River Tower is completed before the Asian Games in Guanjo. Whether they finish on time, they hope to meet a far bigger goal, planting China [Music] energy. This is the first real echological building in China. This is the first time that a skyscraper has brought [Music] together energy consumption. So the skyscraper is exactly [Music] what I [Music] very nowadays worried [Music] [Music] protect the the Pearl River Tower I think represents a big step forward in the science of sustainable buildings and uh we uh others we from and and then we [Music] Even unfinished, the Pearl River Tower marks a new era in architecture when concrete, steel, and glass will all share the same color, green. [Music] Every second, the sun enough energy to fuel our world for a million years. If we could create our own sun here on Earth, we source of energy that endless without the risk of meltdowns or radioactive waste. That process is called fusion. And if fusion were possible, I think it would ease the suffering of many people. It would allow many more people to be prosperous. It would allow the environment to be cleaner. Fusion is um is the holy grail. Like the quest for the grail itself, the path to fusion is an epic journey. But this grail actually lies within our grasp. [Music] [Music] in In a world running out of fuel, the world how to power our cities using some ingenious methods. Solar, wind, steam, and in this episode, nuclear fusion. In this lab, scientists are playing God, trying to create another sun. Yeah, it a passion that I can thought of recreating a star in the laboratory excites me. It occupies my work life and at night I have ideas on how to do it better. Good thing John stays awake thinking about power because our planet is guzzling energy. In 40 years, the world population should grow by 50% to reach 9 billion people. But energy demand will triple as the third world industrializes. More people will compete for the same amount of water and the shortage will require huge desalination plants consuming even more power. we have to do something uh different. We know that we know consumption in western countries is much higher than it is in the developing world by factors of hundred in some cases. Today 80% of our energy comes from fossil fuels and they they generation will need fuels that are clean and abundant. But renewable energy alone costs too much and does too little. Replacing one power plant would require 60 square miles of solar panels or 2,500 giant wind turbines. Without a viable source of energy, we catastrophe. Nuclear fusion is part of the answer as well. Um, it it essentially a unlimited fuel source. So, we think it long-term [Music] answer. If scientists succeed, we have a source of power that safe, clean, and abundant. Fusion is, after all, the um, if you will, God powering the universe. It stars work. To grasp what they you have to step back 14 billion years. Little by little, gravity captured the hydrogen in the early universe and gathered it into clouds, then stars. The immense pressure in the heart of a star crushes hydrogen atoms against each other. They heat up and merge to form helium in a process called fusion. In the core of our sun, fusion has been happening for 4 billion years. Every second, 600 million tons of hydrogen are turned into helium, enough to power the whole Earth for a million years. To create their own sun in the laboratory, scientists will use machines out of science fiction. Access to these sites is a real privilege, and their world makes your head spin. Here, numbers never have fewer than six [Music] figures. To top it off, there than one way to achieve fusion. So, which way is the best? Around the world, teams of scientists are competing in a fusion marathon. First contender, the sea machine, which uses powerful electrical pulses to ignite a fusion reaction. The facility was built to create these extreme states of matter for nuclear weapons research. But now we lot of experiments to uh create fusion in the laboratory. That is a miniature star in the lab. Second team, the laser me whose beams will smash hydrogen like hammers until it explodes. fuel for fusion will come from seawater which is an almost source. And last but not least, Ether, a futuristic boiler that will house a continuous fusion combustion within a magnetic cage shaped like a ring. The amount of energy involved is like millions of times more than what you get on a conventional chemical reaction. Who will be the first to harness the energy of nuclear fusion? The winner will be the team that develops a fusion technology that produces more energy than it uses. The key to a working reactor. One team begins by building its own lab in the south of France. And they start with a bang. An entire hill is leveled to make room for eater, the next generation of experimental reactor. So this is the eater site and this is where the eater fusion reactor is going to be located. Eater will be a lab for scientists to perfect fusion. If they succeed, they design a prototype reactor to produce electricity. The budget is as huge as the site, $17 billion. Governments representing half the population of the world are collaborating. The European Union, the US, Russia, China, India, Japan, and South Korea. Each partner will construct a certain number of parts manufactured by their top high-tech companies. Once the site is complete, scientists from all over the world will converge here to reach their goal to produce 10 times more energy than is consumed by the reactor for at least 6 minutes. 6 minutes is long enough to prove the technology will work. The reactor chamber will be 10 times bigger than any experimental fusion device yet [Laughter] built. Eater means the way in Latin. If it succeeds, it will pave the way for a full scale fusion reactor and make today past. Nuclear energy literally means the energy of nuclei. Today power using a process called fision. Fision breaks up the unstable nucleus of large uranium atoms. The energy release spins turbines that generate electricity. But vision has its hazards. More than two decades after the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear plant, people continue to die. And we still have no long-term solution to nuclear waste. Fusion is the opposite of fision. And by its very nature, fusion is safe and clean. You know the fusion reaction is one that involves two light nuclei putting them together fusing them together to form a a heavier nucleus and in the process according to Einstein a large amount of energy is given off 1 g of fusion fuel equals the energy of 8 tons of gasoline enough power for an average car to drive around the world three times. But there at high temperatures. Very high. At 200 million° F, the matter is heated to the state of plasma, 10 times hotter than the sun. Hot enough to overcome the nuclei atoms to fuse. [Music] The ideal atoms come from two kinds of hydrogen, dutyium and tridium. Dutyium is endless. It in seawater. Tridium comes from lithium, a metal found in the earth the oce. And we have enough to last for hundreds of thousands of years. The fuel is very available. You know the uh analogy we like to to talk about the comparison is if you take the detium in a bathtub full of water and combine with that the lithium in a laptop computer battery there provide the you know energy needs for an average person for 30 years. It phenomenal. It have a plasma that magnetic field. And if this plasma gets just a little off of ideal conditions, the process stops. So having some unsafe runaway condition is is impossible. The fusion reaction itself doesn dangerous waste, but the neutrons bombarding off the chamber wall will make it slightly radioactive. Tridium used in the reactor has a 13-year halflife. After 20 to 30 years of operation, EER will be dismantled. Within a century or so, most of the radioactive parts will be too weak to pose a threat. Eater has these high sides. Clean, you know, safe available fuel, essentially unlimited fuel source. So, that reason I office building a kilometer behind you, all working to make this happen. Next to the construction site for Eater is the Tour Super Tokamac, Eater Forerunner. What happens here will happen inside Eater, but on a much bigger scale. Tokamac is shorthand for a Russian phrase meaning toidal chamber with magnetic coils. As in all tokamax in the world, the tour super team spends a lot of time taking apart, evaluating, and improving the parts. Fusion requires perfection. Today, the team is replacing a microwave heating antenna, a crucial part to reaching high temperatures. Philippe is the machine operator. Serge has been using the machine for over 20 years. He witnessed its construction and knows every detail. To supervise this delicate move, he has rehearsed with his team all morning. You There is very little space to [Laughter] 6 m long, bristling with metal parts. Each piece is custom made and the result of years of research. One misstep can leave a very expensive scratch. We Yes. [Laughter] supported a bit before reinstalling. They modified the part that guides the antenna by shaving a few slivers of metal. These everyday problems are a part of the quest for fusion. Add up all the problems and you have months of setbacks. Let There It breathe now. But some jobs are beyond this team. Radiation, extreme vacuums, and high temperatures make a token impossible to enter once it running. To maintain this chamber will take a [Music] robot. This robot can sneak its 10 m of titanium and steel through a shutter only 25 cm wide. In a few hours, it can inspect the walls and even fix small problems. And the experiments can continue without losing precious time. Another day at Tor Supra and another experiment on the road to fusion. Today, testing the new hybrid antenna, a key to starting a fusion reaction. This kind of antenna could be ideal for eater. To start the experiment, they have to turn on the tokometer. But they don just flip a switch. Every morning, we put it in service. We put it on security. Each circuit breaker gives access to a key to open the next breaker. It takes a while, but you can play around with 63,000 volts. Ana, can we proceed? No, we can So, the tokamac can The plasma emits for no one can remain in the sun. Otherwise, they would suffer a serious sunburn, could receive a fatal dose of radiation. We take safety seriously here. First step, we make sure the heavy door fits. All the tokamax subsystems are used to their limit. So, it small defects appearing once in a while. And we have to make repairs quickly so we can continue the experiments. This is something we won have the reactor. We don the reactor to repair the system. [Music] The company that maintains the doors won hours. So, the staff scrambles to find a solution. Each day goes to play, which together could add years to the time table. [Music] What are they doing? They lab to track the bug along miles of electrical wiring. Seems a sensor thought the door was closed, so it wouldn [Music] budge. Turns out the jam door works fine. It just needed a [Music] nudge. The main door closes with no trouble. The team can now work safely, protected by concrete walls 2 ft thick. Good. Heavy doors. Okay. Think of plasma as a very hot soup of atoms. Nuclei positively charged and electrons negatively charged. Scientists will reconfigure the cooking methods thousands of ways before finding the ideal recipe. First, they switch on the magnetic field to maintain the plasma at the center of the vacuum chamber. A tiny pump of dutyium and tridium mix is injected in the experiment chamber. The central coil of the tokamac is activated. It heats the fuel by resistance like a toaster. The fuel is heated to the stage of a plasma. No physical container could retain this hot plasm of atoms. So the scientists had the ingenious idea of confining it within a magnetic cage. Hence the name magnetic confinement in a vacuum. The plasma is now protected from any substance that could cool it down and snuff it out. Good. We have everything down all of it. Great. One run. One plasma run on the entire day. So, let antenna before they can start another experiment and test the antenna. Beyond 20 million degrees, this method runs out of steam. They have to raise the temperature by using another tool. Antennas now emit microwaves, the equivalent of tens of thousands of microwave ovens to heat the plasma. The hybrid microwave antenna directs heat at precise areas in the plasma, but it enough. Reaching fusion requires even more heat. Dutium atoms are fired at 700 millions of miles hour, causing collisions that heat the plasma. Look at the hybrid. Very, very good. An infrared camera lets the team watch to make sure no parts on the wall of the chamber overheats. Today only sparse fusion reactions. To make it work, we need a reactor 10 times bigger. Thus, the need for eater. Within two decades, scientists at EER hope to perfect the recipe for fusion and produce more energy than is consumed. Then they can build the first industrial fusion reactor that can actually produce electricity. Heat emitted by the reactor will produce steam and steam turbines will generate electricity. With the prospect of Eater, progress on magnetic confinement fusion has accelerated. But elsewhere, other teams are pursuing fusion with other methods, including the world lasers. Amid the vineyards of Bordeaux, French military research plays a key role in the race for fusion. banned since 1996. Nuclear testing has been replaced by computer simulation for developing new generations of nuclear warheads. Let production share the same field of research. confusion. A national laboratory working for the military will open its highintensity laser, the laser mega jeul to civilian researchers. Here a team of physicists is working on a completely different method to achieve fusion. Inertial confinement. No magnets needed to confine the reaction. It happens so fast that the nuclei fuse before they can scatter. A vast array of lasers will compress a mix of dutyium and tridium enclosed in a tiny capsule until they superheat and fuse together. Francoisier supervises the installation of the experiment hall. The center is a room that measures 30 ft in diameter. will convert chamber combustion. This is the first step in fusion energy producing electricity exhaustable source namely inertial fusion energy field that will enable us to provide electricity from fusion to shelter the laser array and its scientific equipment requires a building that would cover nine football fields. The building is strengthened by beehive structures with enough concrete to fill 45 Olympic swimming pools. The temperature can more than one degree Fahrenheit to avoid deformities caused by the equipment expanding. And in the middle of that huge building, work happens on a microscopic scale. Accuracy is paramount. To be perfectly targeted by the lasers, the fuel caps must be precisely positioned within 50 microns, the thickness of a human hair, along a 100 km optical fiber network. The command computer will have to control 2,000 video cameras and 10,000 motion controllers and synchronize 9,000 elements, some at 100th of a billionth of a second. After working several months, even years the first step, it career. The laser requires certain lenses made of synthetic crystal, which engineers must grow themselves. In two months, they measuring 2 ft across. So, success depends on scientists as well as janitors. From construction to operation, everything must be spotless. One speck of dust can damage the laser equipment. After a thorough cleaning, this part is about to be installed in the laser bay. Like everything that enters the laser mega shore, it trailer. [Music] [Applause] Hey, backwards. One meter. Stop. The thousands of parts for the laser mega jewel will all go through this procedure. While some parts of the building are pressurized to repel dust, the experiment hall is depressurized to contain any tridium leaks. The air filtering system is as powerful as the turbines of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. It takes up onethird of the whole building. Like Eater, the Laser Meul has its own forerunner, a less powerful prototype, and it door. Equipped with only four laser beams, it can reaction. Its purpose is to prepare the teams to simultaneously control the 240 lasers of the Megazul. The maintenance team must regularly inspect the lenses used most often. Despite the clinical cleanliness of the lab, microscopic dust sneaks onto the lenses. Dust spreads on the lenses and is burned by the laser. This damages the lenses. Given the cost of these lenses, it much as possible. That different clean. The lenses removed from a laser are brought to ready to lift. The clean chain has not been broken. The amplifier was extremely clean. We went through a cart which is also very clean. And finally, we go into a room that is as clean as the plates cassette. There it will be cleaned and [Music] reconditioned. Ultraviolet light helps them detect and remove dust. [Music] Experiments go on by the thousands. Today, an alignment shot to perfect the laser Securing room D5 and D9 to prepare shots. It takes a whole team 3 hours to wrangle the 350 motion controllers that adjust the alignment of the lasers. If the temperature varies by 1° F or someone walks near the lasers, the beam will fail to reach their target. We We The shot begins with a tiny infrared laser like the kind in a CD player, but which will be amplified 8 billion times. The laser passes through amplifiers. Strong flashes illuminate laser plates which in turn transfer their energy to the laser beam passing [Music] through. The beam makes two return journeys collecting more energy on each [Music] pass. Evacuation of the switchyard target area to prepare for the shot sequence. Are you all ready for the shot? Yes. Okay. Yes. Experiment subsystems ready. High voltage. Okay. Yes. Synchronizing. Diagnostics. Alignment. Computers. Yes. Preparing to shot sequence. Three module charging. Capacitor banks at full level. After the fourth amplification, the lasers are so strong, the scientists must avoid concentrating them on an area less than one square foot or risk breaking the lenses. They all converge to hit the target. Shot completed at 11:11 a.m. I repeat, shot completed at 1111 a.m. Okay. A B C D shots confirmed. Here are the results. Do they match the request? Perfectly. We couldn You can leave the control room. [Music] Bullseye. The four lasers hit the target within a hundth of a billionth of a second in a circle 100th of a millimeter wide, the diameter of a hair. This level of precision is crucial. The slightest variation would mean failure. The team has proven its ability to master the four beams. [Music] When the laser meajul is at last completed, the scientists will have to try and control 240 lasers simultaneously, unleashing 60 times more power, enough to reach fusion. The laser is an extraordinary tool for achieving fusion in the lab, offering power and versatility. But with its demand for hyper precision and cleanliness, is it practical enough for industrial use? Maybe we need something a little more sturdy. In the American West, scientists are exploring the frontier of nuclear power, not far from Area 51. Welcome to the mecca of American military research. Sandia Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Here, the US Army conducts micro simulations of atomic explosions. The terrace is a nice place for coffee. In the race to achieve fusion, this is the third approach. No lasers. Here physicists try to achieve inertial fusion with electric discharges. The facility was built to create these extreme states of matter for nuclear weapons research. But now we lot of experiments to uh create fusion in the laboratory. That is a miniature star in the lab. Over the last year, we have again refurbished it. Basically replacing the entire machine to increase the energy by a factor of two. What we hope to do with this is create conditions that are even closer to what net energy gain in the laboratory. Here in the Z facility, we want to really understand how the fusion reaction works and what is required to drive the fusion reaction. Uh the purpose of the Z machine is to create uh very extreme states of matter, very high temperatures, very high pressures of matter. The way we do that is store electrical energy in capacitors, discharge it on a very short time. So at the center of the machine, we deliver very high currents at very high voltage to make these very high temperatures and very high pressures. We we do that ultimately to make uh fusion conditions in the laboratory. During a thunderstorm, static electricity stores up in clouds until it suddenly discharges in the form of lightning. The Z machine shot works the same way, but delivers 1,000 times more energy, 20,000 times faster. The discharge represents 30 times more electricity than the whole world uses at any given moment and lasts a fraction of a second. The Z machine funnels the energy of time and space to create a violent shock wave which compresses a fusion fuel capsule. The target is surrounded by a small cage of tungsten wires as thick as a human hair. When the current passes through the filaments, they instantly vaporize, forming a hollow column of plasma surrounded by a very powerful magnetic field. Squeezed by this magnetic field, the column of plasma. It slams the fuel capsule at the terminal velocity of 500,000 mph. The nuclei fuse, releasing a huge quantity of energy, the tiny fragment of a star to be harvested. What I a demonstration of of what needs to be achieved to do uh fusion energy with inertial fusion. This uh represents a compression of a factor of 30 to one in diameter from the size of the basketball to the size of this fusion capsule. And in doing that, you density from by about a factor of a thousand from solid density to a thousand times greater than solid density. What already in Zepage facilities is a compression ratio of 15 or 20 to1. Not enough to start a reaction. But the big challenge is achieving perfect compression. In order to achieve ignition, one has to compress perfectly symmetrically. Uh, and you can see in fact when I tried to do it just with my two hands here that we have some bulges. So now we compress the capsule like a pancake. This would not work. Now we compress the capsule like an American football or an egg. This would not work. The capsule has to be compressed perfectly symmetrically within 1% of a perfect sphere. And this is the difficulty. There enough to simulate all that in these targets. And so we have to make simplifying assumptions. And not all those assumptions are right and they can lead to errors. And so it gathering data of what happening in the Z machine and comparing it to our simulations can we um uncover the truth. Looking inside the target at the critical moment would help refine their work. But the experiment chamber is sealed for safety. In the next building, Sandia Labs has built a giant camera named the Z beamlet laser. It trying to look at the sun and see what happening on the inside of the sun without being blinded. So, we need a very bright um source of x-rays. And this laser system uh enables us to create that um burst of light um to create a shadow of what inside the Z machine. And so, we use the laser to backlight um what in the inside of the Z machine. As the shot is being prepared, the Z beamlet laser team gets ready to take a picture. Okay, I Building 986. Operations will shortly be sweeping the high bay and the target bay for a full system shot. All personnel, please evacuate both bays at this time. Thank you. medical for shut. Okay, so the reason why we do sweep, there spatial filter implosion. If in case a spatial filter lens is to crack and the vacuum is to leak, it could implode and essentially hurt somebody who There which for the amplifiers, uh, charging up to 18,000 KV for each circuit. So, uh, we want to make sure nobody the circuits with that. Evacuate the IV. There where there anybody unintentionally be blinded or burned or damaged in some way if they were managed to get in the beam path. So, it for personnel safety just to keep everybody safe and and uh out of the way of the laser. Thank you. Around the machine. The countdown has started. Nothing living or electronic could survive the electromagnetic charge that will rush into the hall. Any forgotten tool could become a dangerous [Music] projectile. The shock is equivalent to several sticks of dynamite. [Music] The high bay has been cleared. Everyone is safe inside the electrically insulated bunker, waiting for the experiment to start. The beamlet laser must synchronize perfectly with the Z machine to take the picture of the capsule during the shot. Looks good. ZVL See you sir. Are you ready? We are ready for you to arm. Okay. Gas is armed. High voltage is on. That looks good to me. Attention building 983. Z is preparing the fire. Starting ZVL countdown T-minus 130. Please start the shot clock. Charging the LTS 100 and the Marxes. Shot clock started. All systems are functional. How charging. 2 - 30 50 KV - 10 60 KV charges complete - 5 75 KV charge complete army to fire the shock wave can be felt across the entire base Oh, that looks good. Thank you guys. All right, let is a success. Though this picture doesn much, it information. We were able to capture an image of a fusion capsule. um as it was being bombarded by the radiation of the Z machine and being squeezed down, we were able to freeze the motion and capture um an image of a capsule for the first time um in the history of the Z project. It fire only once a day. Obviously, not enough for a power plant. Oh, it his lab, Michael Maserakus and his team aim to improve the technology of the Z machine for commercial use. They Russian invention. Like a machine gun, it can fire repeatedly. Taking the Z machine a step further towards an operational power plant. As you know, this is going to be the building block for our future inertial fusion energy power plant. It So, you can make any energy you want, any size of power plant just by adding more components. We envision the first plant to need about 5,000 of these devices. That would allow economies of scale in the fabrication of components for the power plant. A Russian plane on an American Air Force base. Who would have guessed? Michael Maseratis waits impatiently for the delivery of the device to improve the Z machine. The collaboration between Russian and American scientists actually goes back to the 1960s in the midst of the Cold War. While the American and Russian presidents were just a step away from using atomic bombs, the scientists were hoping to advance their research. And for that, they need to present the results to the scrutiny of their peers. It physicist helps unload a plane, but Michael would have carried everything to his lab himself if he had to. In the early almost forgotten. Suddenly, it remarkable comeback. 20 years ago, we were really viewed to be the dark horse and the race for fusion. With the successes we implosions and the generation of X-rays, we in recent years. So, we now think we have a chance of really competing with the other schemes and it should be a competitive environment where you look at multiple approaches to achieving fusion in the laboratory. These enormous power plants have their place in the future of energy to meet the demand of cities and [Music] industries. Over time, the plants will improve in output while shrinking in size just like computers. Teams of visionaries competing but also devoting their lives to a common quest. scientists using the different schemes to achieve fusion. Inertial confinement fusion with lasers, magnetic confinement fusion and the z pitch. These three paths come together in a conference where people share a lot of information. So we can speak of stimulation rather than competition between the teams. Fusion will take time, not years but [Music] decades. What if it didn I am very confident it will work. You have to be a true believer to dedicate yourself for 25 years to a project. So I studying fusion since 1981. So almost 25 years. So I have a passion for trying to make a little star in the laboratory and I really think we achieving that with the Z [Music] machine eater. The laser me and the Z machine. One of them will cross the finish line. Industrial reactors will follow. And a child born today should witness fusion power by 2070. Till then, today a challenge to conserve today a bridge to the future. [Music]	Success
Exploring the Forgotten: Abandoned Places and Hidden Wildlife | SLICE SCIENCE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQPcg1NnzSQ	SLICE Science	[Music] In the middle of the Oou forest close to Namure hides one of the strangest chatau in Belgium. In the second half of the 19th century, the count of leader Bofur decided to build Miranda, a romantic shadow with gigantic dimensions which he would make his summer residence. Miranda mixed styles wildly and once completed in 1907 after 50 years of work, it resembled no other shadow except perhaps that of sleeping beauty. Octa is an adept of herbexing, a word which means urban exploring. Sometimes at the limit of the law, herbexes get into abandoned places which are forgotten but powerful. It shadow of Nasi. It That special atmosphere, one I haven On each of my visits, I find something new, like for example, those scowlling faces you can see there below the arch. Here is the entrance hall which is quite typical of the chatau with its fine columns and the blue ceilings which made its reputation. It monumental staircase which has been attacked recently. Unfortunately, the banister was destroyed just a few days ago. It was really horrible to see the staircase which was really severely damaged. I said to myself that to give it back a little dignity, I was going to lift up the stairs and put them back in place. I spent half a day doing that, but I was quite satisfied to have done it because seeing it in the state that it was in was just impossible. [Music] Miranda is a labyrinth of over a 100 rooms joined by countless galleries, staircases, and corridors. What which have started to grow inside the shadow. Nature is slowly starting to take over. Welcome, sir. [Music] The owners of Miranda are tired of the extraordinary and overlar domain too expensive to maintain. Here we are in quite a special place. This is where there was the fire in 1991. Starting from there, the shadow started its long decline. Even though it had been abandoned for a long time, it was still in good condition until then. At this window, we can see the forest which is outside the shadow on the domain. And when you turn your head here, you can also see the forest and the domain inside the shadow. This place is quite special to me because it was the first urb site for me. It for doing Obex. You feel really very small besides this shadow. A little cut off from the world and those are things I like a lot. I think that the chat of Nwasi was classed number one a few years back as the most beautiful abandoned place in the world because it characteristic because of these turrets which give it the air of I was going to say haunted shadow but really it fairy tale shadow. Miranda has become ghostlike. the setting for several films. [Music] [Music] The herbex of philosophy is that if you feel an affinity with the building, if the soul of the building touches you, then you systematically do things with respect. Damage nothing. Just take a few photos. [Music] Unfortunately, besides the herbexes, the shadow has regularly been the victim of vandals who wish to smash what inside. Open to the elements, Miranda has become a meeting place for people who get up to all sorts of things. For safety reasons, the site is closed and access is [Music] forbidden. After the war, the shadow became a children Danielle knew well. Do you hear the birds? Yes. Yes, I can hear them quite clearly now. You can feel it Wait, there that? When I was a kid here, there were lots of squirrels. Yes. Really? You could see them jumping from tree to tree. It was wonderful. Our own red squirrels. Oh, finally between the time you were a child here and the time you were a counselor here, how many years was that do you think? Uh, wait, more or less. I came here as a child in 1963 64 and I came back as a counselor in the 80s. Oh yes. It this time has passed but it always leaves the same impression. Time goes by, but memories remain. And the emotion is part of the memory. It part of the tear rolling down your left cheek. Yes. It I was a kid. And look at the state of the castle. It was wonderful. We arrive here. You see, it was really nicely cared for. There was a lawn here. And you can but there was a magnificent wooden door that When the children left, a wide variety of animals took over the domain. [Music] Danielle, we Helmet. Yes. In case things come falling down on our heads. Look. Yes, I can see the door. Wow. There. I suppose you can feel something. Wow. Look at this. It Everything This was one of the classrooms. Unreal. Well, you see all of this. What a shame. I been restored. They our office. This battle for the shadow of Nasi. I been fighting it for 4 years. It superb shadow. It be protected, defended, and saved. It a neo gothic shadow, pretty much unique in Wal. Today the fight because the owner has signed a demolition contract with a firm. There are around 70 people in front of the gates to protest against the demolition and say no one last time. Three days later they began. They took down the turrets. And once the turrets were gone, it meant that water could get in. It meant that the stone would literally shatter because of the ice, obviously. Since the turrets were there, you can see how unfortunately humans have come, you might say, to attack the shadow. The organization is aiming to preserve the exterior, the facads of the shadow. and to transform it into a romantic ruin. That is ruins that you [Music] visit. When you have a shadow like Noasi, it everybody. [Music] In front of another abandoned shadow so as to protect the place, I put chains as well as a barricade. I place one day so I can protect it more effectively. [Music] Octar doesn place of his dreams which he wants to protect might be. And this is the reason why I close the place up. Herbexes can be seen as whistleblowers because they generally uncover abandoned buildings. But most of the time these buildings have a story. [Music] store. Some buildings have burned along with their pianos, and this metamorphosis has turned them into real works of art. The herbexes allow the building to live, shall we say, a minimum through photos, but they can The authorities need afterwards to realize how beautiful the sites are and to save them after that. Here we owners have found a good compromise because during the week the place is open for photos and in the weekend it simply closed. Apart from the local wildlife which has returned in force, some of the exotic birds which lived in the aviary such as these golden peacocks have nested and colonized the shadow as well. In the United States, in New Orleans, when the attraction park Six Flags opened in 2000, it had an immediate success. The public was impatient after watching day after day gigantic roller coasters in steel and wood rise up as well as super rides which drew attention and promised to [Music] thrill. The good times lasted five [Music] years. When Six Flags was really rolling, we had 100,000 visitors plus. Sometimes this parking lot would be filled with cars. 12 years ago, we had a hurricane which flooded this area. It was a tremendous storm. Hurricane Katrina um had more of an impact with flooding probably than the um damage. A few years ago, this area would be packed with people and families trying to get into the park so that they could have a good time. A lot of noise of children, which was great noise. Some of these buildings were so nice. It very sad because at one time this was a plaza that was filled with people with people selling gifts here, selling ice cream here. Hopefully one day it back. The 57 hectares of the park are in a flood zone and this has stopped reconstruction work. [Music] Unfortunately, obviously, it 12 years later and it instead of a beach. That vegetation holds wildlife, rabbits, boores, and alligators. It stay, and that prohibited to the general public. An immense flooded ruin inspires all adventure lovers. The park quickly became an attraction for herbexes from Louisiana and elsewhere. For safety reasons, the town council ended the contract with the operator and took back control of the site. Security guards now patrol night and day. [Music]	Success
The Return of Bloodsucking Parasites! | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etV1oNSskAE	SLICE Science	[Music] We them. We thought we minuscule monsters because we and vermin were a thing from when we lived in caves. And yet they here. They masses with their armored shells, their insatiable jaws, their hooks, their stings. The rear base of bed bugs is the south of Europe, but massive columns are moving north. Tiger mosquitoes just landed in Europe are going the same way. And then there are the others, fleas, lice, and pubic lice, commonly known as crabs. [Music] What them? Global warming is blamed. Changing lifestyles, genetic mutation of these horrible creatures. What All around the world, our old persecutors are back, especially in North America and Europe. Mosquitoes, ticks, lice, bed bugs are taking on alarming proportions in Europe. The south of France is a bridge head for bed bugs. Jean Michelle Breni is an entomologist and is looking for efficient ways to eradicate them. to populate the breeding centers where he makes his research. He regularly takes specimens from people homes. Watch out, you got some there, too, on top. So, there you little farm. There are a lot of them. You out. You see, they dear. Oh dear. Yes, it there. Oh, there are hundreds. Watch out. They skins. All the stages are [Music] there. From the egg to the adult insect, bed bugs pass through several stages of development. At each stage, it abandons its old covering. Insects and dust mites mol because they have no bone structure or spine. It shell, which serves them as a skeleton and allows them to move. [Music] Oh, yes. Well, they everywhere. I They research, bed bugs are very sensitive to the body odor which impregnates dirty clothes. But it attracts them because it signals the presence of blood to them. To become adult, the lava needs a ration of human blood which it swallows in a few minutes after which it hides for a few days to digest. Here we have a case of very very large infestation. There are thousands of bed bugs here and it could be a single female behind this phenomenon. An adult female bed bug lays two to five eggs a day. According to the warmth of the area, they hatch within one to 3 weeks. In the right place, the population increases with exponential speed. Nowadays, bed bugs are increasing everywhere. Our means of transport are, of course, their means of dispersion because they don jump. So it about. [Music] In the south of France, the movement of population is so favorable to bed bugs and other stinging creatures that the Mediterranean Hospital University Institute has created a unit especially for emerging diseases. Jean Michishel Bonj works in the insectarium of the institute, the largest in Europe to be devoted to the study of these menacing creatures. And here, for example, a breeding station with thousands of lice. Here, one for ticks. Further on, we have a breeding station for fleas. And there, one for bed bugs. A big problem right now. Very topical. [Applause] After the last war with the arrival of DDT, a very powerful insecticide, all these creatures were almost eradicated. But DDT is a toxic product which had to be stopped. [Music] In the explosion of tourism and international trade, of demography, as well as the poverty of the population, there was a massive return of these predators. Quite often the victim doesn behind the bites which they are suffering from. The first thing is to identify the aggressor. These are requests for insect identification that I get sometimes along with the insects as well. Also very importantly photos of the bites of insects which can help to direct the diagnosis. Here for example a tick bite with the bite in the center. The typical halo of the spread of the infection. Three aligned bites typical of fleas. Here is a mosquito bite. And there on this lady, a strong reaction to massive bed bug stings. Bed bugs are about 50% of the [Music] problem. Beyond photos of bites, some victims sent hairs in envelopes, dust samples, and even plans of their homes as if for a police inquiry. fleas, lice, crabs, ticks, mosquitoes, and bed bugs have a terrifying range of tools to pierce human skin. Needles, stings, jaws. The morphology of the system used to pierce and suck blood varies a lot from one species to another. Each system leaves a characteristic signature. In most of the species, it mainly the females which sting to take on with the blood the calories they need to bring their eggs to maturity. But there are some exceptions. In bed bugs, everything stings. The five laral stages and the adult stage and even the male stings. Everything stings with bed bugs. charming family and they well. It and feeling yourself being eaten alive can make you just about lose your mind. At the University Hospital on the French Riviera, Dr. Delorn, a phobia specialist, regularly receives anxious patients who he treats using hypnosis. [Music] I black mark on me. Yes, it itches me and it shouldn psychosis. So, normally you have more hair, but especially itching. It And it everywhere. And I sleep 2, three hours a night. What would help me a lot is to get rid of these little creatures. All right. very very quickly it goes beyond the insects and we heard to be calmed and relaxed and in any case go back to a normal life there at the same time you find you can feel your hands on your trousers people structure their lives to avoid them lives without sociability not allowing themselves to go to the movies to hotels not allowing themselves to see their friends They all that needs to be heard and tools offered so the person rediscovers an agreeable normal life. People connect very quickly the fact that blood is life and something is sucking out your life and that sucks at you totally all day long. So after that you with bites is exponential. And as well as that people go on the internet. They find out about this growth, this sexuality. They find out about a very original form of sexuality. In bed bugs, love is butchery. The male stabs and buries his reproductive organ into the female at the slightest opportunity. And that organ must pierce the female skin around the abdomen which means just about anywhere and inject spermatzoa. That traumatic insemination. When people read that on the internet, it nightmare for them. If luckily we don beds, don about there in complete safety. Whatever we do, our beds are infested with undesirable guests which everyone has heard about but nobody has [Music] seen. Dermatophagagoed terronis mites invisible to the naked eye dine on our dead skin, our hair and our pubic hair. Their empty shells and tiny droppings cause many allergies. It responsible for 45 to 50% of allergic illness. And the difference with other allergies is that mites are present all year long. All year we sleep with mites, but we two or two and a half months a year. Dr. Dr. Alan Mikiels practices in Belgium and visits patients suffering from allergies that are sometimes very serious. In a mattress like yours, there could be up to 2 million mites. And they the surface in the dust. In a pillow, up to 10% is made up of dead mites. And that breathe it all night and like that you become allergic to them. When I have an attack my eyes sting and sometimes I have a runny nose. Does it get blocked sometimes? Yes. After I sneeze a bit. And when will that happen? In the night or rather in the morning. In the morning when I wake up. Ah yes on waking. [Music] Who would have thought our beds were jungles crawling with life? These wild plants seen through an electronic microscope are fungi which do well in the humidity of our [Music] sweat. Inside the mattress there are a lot of fungi. as well as the dead skin which we lose. That associated with sweat which is heat and moisture leads to a multiplication of dust mites in the mattress. Since the 1970s and the oil shocks, there has been an increase in might allergies very clearly linked to the fact that we are insulating our homes. There excellent for saving energy but also for dust mites. helping them to multiply. People spend a lot less time outside and live indoors in front of the TV, computers, and video games, which have become more important. So, there more exposure to domestic mites. In all innocence, more and more people are having dangerous relationships. Some patients are so badly affected that they have to be desensitized in a hospital environment. there. I your nose. Then we reaction to domestic mites with extracts which my colleague will get you to breathe in. Breathe in slowly. Then exhale. Breathe in and exhale more strongly. Yes. Again. Again. And again. There is nothing which at the moment indicates that we plateau for illnesses linked to might allergies, reinitis, conjunctivitis or eczema. So, they growing. [Music] In the future, thanks to progress in molecular biology, we imagine tailored vaccines. We to identify what proteins in mic droppings the subject is allergic to and administer only that protein. That much more powerful vaccine than at present. While waiting, the best means of fighting against mites is to air out rooms for at least half an hour every day, including in winter, as cold as the enemy of these invisible creatures. If dermatagoid mites sleep in our beds without asking permission, some of their cousins do far worse. Demodeex mites live upon us. They colonize the roots of our eyelids and the pores of our [Music] face. We are born, we have no demadeex mites. Um, however, at the age of puberty, the hormonal balance in the body begins to change. This changes the type of oil that the type of sebum. And afterwards, the demodex mites can feed on this and begin to grow. So for maybe 12, 13 years, we have no mites, but after that, we begin to build them up. Placing absorbent patches allows measuring how much sebum is on the face and counting blackheads. The numbers counted suggest that the skin which is examined offers demodex an ideal environment. On this nose patch we can see the presence of many blackheads which you can see here in this image. This indicates over production of oil and sebum in the face contributing to the formation of blackheads. Demodex mites live in colonies in the pores of oily skin as we can see in these electronic microscope images magnified many hundreds of times. [Music] A female lays more than 20 eggs in a pore of our skin or in a single hair [Music] follicle. The number of demodex increases as we get older. At 20 years old, a quarter of us are colonized, but at 80 years old, everyone has some. Once again, it the demodex which poison our lives. Demodeex is the only animal not to have an anus. As a result, it impossible for it to rid itself of excrement which accumulates in its body and ends up by killing [Music] it. Many bacteria are found in its digestive system. When the demodex dies, these bacteria attack the victim skin. Dr. Kavanaaugh has shown that it this which is responsible for the reening of skin known as rosaceia, a sickness which often develops into a blotch and which affects 5 to 20% of the world Men uh tend to have a slightly higher density of demodex mites in their skin than women. Um and interestingly, men often show worse symptoms of rosacea. For his studies, Dr. Kavana has evaluated the rates of demodex in the population. No. Have a seat. Thank you. No. So this is a model of a demodex mite and they live inside the pylo sebaceous unit. They normally sit this way with their tail end pointing out. Um they are normal inhabitants of the skin. So how many would we have on the face? Normally we have one or two per square cm but in cases of rosacea the density of demodex mites increases to 10 or 20 per square cm and this causes inflammation and damage to the skin. Oh my god. Looking at my skin we can see the presence of blood vessels. We can see uh blackheads but we can also see the presence of pores. And if we apply it to your face, uh, we can see the presence of pores where the demodex [Music] live. There you go. Thank you. [Music] This is one of the pets we have extracted from your face. From my face. Exactly. And as you can see, it has a mouth region. It has four pairs of legs. And this region here is called the abdomen. In total, they measure about.3 of a millimeter in length. Today people have more demodex mites than maybe a hundred years ago. There may be many reasons for this. We have a better diet and this diet influences the sebum we produce in our face and the sebum is one of the food sources that the demodex eats. [Music] The other factor then is if people are exposed to the air uh in sports or in um walking a lot and there skin from sunlight. This can also allow the demodex to grow because damage to the skin leads to the leakage of blood small amounts of blood which they can also feed on. We believe that pollution may play a role in increasing the symptoms of rosacea. However, efficient antibiotics exist. It has proven impossible to completely eradicate the demadeex mites from the face because as soon as the population decreases, if we come into close contact, embracing somebody can allow the demodex to move from one person to the other. If a long passionate kiss can favor the transmission of demodex, intimacy can also benefit another of our parasites. The louse has a chance here to pass from the hair of one person to another Until a few years ago, the most favorable age for lice was 7 years old, the age when a child becomes a bit more independent for washing. But nowadays, it adolescence and even adults catch lice much more easily and selfies have a lot to do with this because lice are excellent tightroppe walkers and pass from one head to another. highly alarmed by the hordes of lice invading our hair. Apparently, the Russian Agency for Consumer Protection is thinking very seriously of demanding the banning of selfies. As elsewhere in Russia, the lice [Music] attack. To say there is an ultimate weapon against lice is untrue. Among insecticides, the last one which was revolutionary was pytham coming from chrysanthemum flowers and maleen which have neurotoxic effects and which acted upon the nervous system of the louse. Sadly, for about 15 years, these molecules haven lice have developed resistance and it can kill either lice or their eggs. [Music] To test life organized over more than 30 years Olympic competitions where the competitors face each other in contests of speed and against obstacles. In the 21 products which I over the last few years, there are two nowadays which are still efficient. Products which have a mechanical effect. They coat and act like a plaster around the louse and stop it from moving, breathing, and having its principle vital functions. Simply put, it wraps the lice in a kind of glue, non-toxic for humans, and keeps them in place until they die. [Music] like the bed bug. When it comes to sex, the louse is an animal. A louse has an unrestrained sexuality because if we think of them in human terms, a male by 30 years of age would have been culating for one entire year. 24 hours a day, which explains why lice are so numerous and it eradicate their descendants. [Music] It scale, an erect penis would be the size of an adult human thigh. It makes you shudder to imagine the sex life of Mr. and Mrs. Laos. In a schoolyard or in the family, lice pass from one head to another with worrying agility. The survival of the species is based on mobility. Also, everyone has to be treated at once and there needs to be a world la. This is hard to do, but in small groups, even a town, this can work reasonably well, and the rate of infestation can be reduced enormously. There are even places where there are no more lice at all. Lice are exclusively our parasites. If by mistake they wander into the fur of a cat, of a dog, or onto a cow, they will die of hunger. What they need is human blood and nothing else. But often parasites desperate for hemoglobin aren anywhere. For ticks and mosquitoes, any blood is good to drink, animal or human. This is extremely dangerous because it establishes links between animals and explains why sometimes we get sick like animals. During the last 150 years, the average temperature has increased by 1° C in Europe. Climate epidemiologist Karen Chave Mre makes forecasts about the development of tick populations that are responsible for many illnesses. She sets up weather stations which are a little special. This is a classic station with temperature and humidity measured above. But the special thing is here. It device to measure the ground temperature below ground cover. Below ground cover means below dead leaves, which is where ticks live. Where they take shelter when it cold. They don people sometimes say. They live in the ground cover. And when they hunt, they go onto the leaves and the twigs to await the approach of a host. [Music] When an animal or a human approaches, the tick detects them thanks to its CO2 receptors cited at the end of its claws, which serves it for a [Music] nose. With its sharp claws, it grips tightly to the victim. [Music] To evaluate the spread of ticks according to the temperature, Karine team scour the ground. The most efficient capture method is to spread sheets on the ground so the ticks stick to the material. [Music] There we quite a good value for the season and the weather. But at other times in the year, they 30 at the height of the season when we sheet. The record here is around a 100 ticks, but in a good sight at the right time. This time it but at other times it transparent and microscopic, recovered in the sheets. In one laying, 2,000 to 3,000 lava hatch. They to detect because at that stage of their development, they our eyes. The number of ticks collected and the weather data taken at the time of collection are studied to construct mathematical models to predict the abundance of a parasite that public health authorities are taking more and more seriously. We collect in less than a dozen or so sites but in a regular monthly fashion. And we also have campaigns where we complete our observations with the army or in other countries like Holland or Belgium. [Music] All this data allows us to better understand the biology and to be able to make forecasts so as to not just know where the ticks are, but when they active. Here application which allows us to estimate the risk of tick activity according to a color code. The darker it is, the more risk there is. And these maps are regularly updated according to weather data. The application extends to other parasites which are doing well, fleas and mosquitoes. Ticks are inactive when the temperature falls under 7°, but cold days are less and less frequent and ticks are taking advantage of this. We ticks in winter collections as well as on higher ground, seeing tick populations present where there weren any beforehand. for example, in the Pyrenees, the Alps, and in the same way, an increase with more and more ticks in the northern latitudes of Sweden and Canada. The spread of ticks and invasion of territory which previously had none can be explained by a profound change in our ecosystems. Urban growth has meant that woods and forests are now close to edges of many centers, and wild animals carrying ticks often venture into urban zones. I film at night using infrared the populations of wild animals which visit these places and can then be correlated with tick populations. Small rodents are the main hosts of ticks, but many wild species carry them. Wild pigs, deer, bucks, and doe more and more of them. And these animals are less and less afraid of man. Nowadays, our towns are growing at the expense of natural zones. We getting closer to the last sanctuaries of nature where wild animals which have parasites and pathogens live. These wild animals come more and more frequently into town. So, we a mixture which creates real opportunities for invasive species to spread. 50 years ago, there were a lot less ticks and mosquitoes in our towns. In need of nature, suffocated by pollution, city dwellers all over the world want greener and greener towns. Plantations and stagnant water attract another problem. Mosquitoes. Towns are made for our comfort. We going to have buildings covered with plants. People will grow flowers at home. We inexhaustible source of water with the possibility that mosquitoes develop in that water. The tiger mosquito, for example, is emblematic of this kind of mosquito behavior. It was wild, developing in little pools of water, and which bit by bit adapted to urban conditions, made them its domain, and since then has spread from town to town. We ourselves, including in towns where we thought we were safe. Originally from Asia, the tiger mosquito arrived in Italy in the [Music] large urban centers in the south of Europe and is moving north following road routes carried by trucks and private cars returning from holiday. It has been seen beyond the rine. [Music] The variations in climate that are happening open up to tiger mosquitoes and ticks zones where they were not present. However, both species spread serious illnesses which alarm public authorities. The tiger mosquito carries deni schika and the recently appeared zika virus. Tech spread lyme disease until now quite rare in Europe and so little known. Over the last few years, the number of new cases has exploded. The tiger mosquito is dal. Its attacks peak at dawn and dusk. The female, once made pregnant, stings to get blood. A healthy victim is contaminated because the mosquito has previously stung a victim with the illness. The virus infects the saliva injected by the mosquito to make the blood more fluid. With the tick, the process is similar. Ticks have an impressive arsenal of tools which let it anchor solidly onto its victim. After that, it injects a powerful anesthetic into the skin and pierces it with the victim knowing nothing about it. Once in place, the tick becomes a sucking pump. After around 8 days of suction, it takes on 100 times its weight in blood. A lot more ticks are to be seen in the environment, and people frequently get bitten. There are a lot more cases of tick illnesses, especially Lyme disease. [Music] It took 10 years in France for the tiger mosquito to colonize 20 territories. And in just five years, it has taken 10 more. This is clearly a biological invasion we How do we get rid of these parasites, even more dangerous because of their stealth? Vaccines against illnesses transmitted by ticks and mosquitoes are slow to be developed and years go by before they arrive on the market. [Music] [Music] Like the louse, the other blood suckers are becoming more and more resistant to the chemicals used to destroy them. In a recent study, it was found that in some regions, it took 500 times more insecticide to kill mosquitoes. By using insecticides massively and without control, the selection of resistance is favored. Most mosquitoes will die, but some will resist and survive, and those will give birth to a following generation, which is a little more resistant to insecticides and so forth. We mosquitoes which are more and more resistant. [Music] Scientists are now searching through the genes of our persecutors to discover the secrets of their worrying adaptive capacity. Researchers have recently discovered that the first dose of blood changes how certain insects genes express in hematophage insects otherwise known as blood suckers. This change leads to a considerable strengthening of the cuticle of the bedbug, the louse, the crab, and the tick. Once thickened, the cuticle becomes a kind of extremely resistant armor which protects the insects from aggression, physical as well as chemical. The resistance of blood suckers to insecticides rests in their genes that stimulate the detoxification system. This is very developed in insects because it defense against plants which try to kill them so as not to be eaten. Plants developed a system which allowed them to produce toxins. And in response, planteating insects also developed proteins which are capable of biodegrading these toxins. And nowadays, mosquitoes have inherited through evolution these proteins which they can also use to degrade insecticide molecules. It effective and that has allowed some populations to resist very strong doses of insecticide. The chemical products used to destroy hematophage are the equivalent of the poisons developed by plants to defend themselves and which the insects learn to neutralize. [Music] Our genetic research has allowed us to better understand this detoxification that mosquitoes use to resist insecticide and so how to counter this phenomenon. What impossible to eradicate mosquitoes. So, we [Music] lifestyle. Genetics can be used in another way. Researchers have found that male mosquitoes can be genetically modified so that their progenitor don develop when they are released in great numbers into the environment. It that statistically wild females tend to couple with the laboratory males rather than wild males. This coupling being sterile, the spread of mosquitoes is slowed. There already transgenic mosquitoes in laboratories. There already transgenic mosquitoes being used to fight with. For example, in South America, in Brazil, or in Australia, where small-cale releases have been made, this method is effective, but playing with genetic modification remains the prerogative of the English-speaking world. In French-speaking environments, this isn certain resistance to using these ways of fighting. Currently, the European Union forbids the use of transgenic mosquitoes based on the principle of precaution and action against genetic modification. The Research Institute for Development, the IRD, is piloting an alternative project which sterilizes male tiger mosquitoes by radiation. Millions of sterilized male tiger mosquitoes are awaiting the green light to go into action. Releases by drone are being triled in South America. Each flight releases 50,000 treated male mosquitoes over a zone of around 20 hectares. Other alternatives rely upon the natural predators of these creatures. In North America, the return of bat colonies to urban zones is favored. In one night, a single kiopteran can devour over 2,000 mosquitoes. There are predators for bed bugs, which are centipedes that kill them. But releasing centipedes in a house isn warfare against bed bugs is very complicated. Once the tick population was, amongst other things, regulated by many predators, amongst which were insect eating mammals, some birds, lizards, toads, and amphibians. When game was more widely hunted, the deer population was a lot less and there were a lot less ticks. It 300 animal species that can carry ticks. Reptiles, hairs, rodents, and birds which spread ticks a lot. But the biggest part of the problem at the moment is the deer population. They offer a large blood mass for ticks. And they can scratching at them. Natalie Bulon and Jack Aberrer want to reintroduce indirect predators which by regulating the presence of game would much reduce the spread of ticks. Speaking as a forester for 30 or 40 years, there of game and it doesn all that there coming from that. The predators absolutely have to return. We once had the lynx which was a great predator but which is disappearing because we it disappear and the wolf which is returning and it the wolves return because they predators and that limit the game and fauna to a normal level. Here game highway. You can see an old deer spore there. Well, you see, to collect ticks, I tend to use these trails as well. And like that, I can collect a fair amount of ticks. Here you see, I have a tube with around 150 that I collected in about an hour. Well, well, and all these ticks have fallen from the deer and other animals which are nearby. The number of hunters continues to fall and natural predators have been more or less eradicated. Large game will therefore continue to spread ticks. Researchers have not given up looking for biological ways of fighting and have turned to solutions which were proven in the past. For centuries, the inhabitants of the Balkans have covered the ground around their beds with bean leaves. To defend themselves against all sorts of attackers, snails, slugs, and planteating insects, bean leaves are covered with tricoms. These are microscopic sharp hairs upon which the insects impale themselves and die. Researchers are trying to develop a synthetic surface which has the same characteristics as this spiky plant trap. You can also use dietmacous earth. Silica, it sharp and will cause micro hemorrhages in bed bugs. It kills them. Not immediately. It in four to 5 days they problem is it breathe it in. [Music] Confronted with the recent wave of bed bugs, putting furniture and contaminated objects in a hot chamber has been very effective and this is being developed. So we find chairs and we find mattresses and all that represents about 15 days of treatment for bed bugs and in peak period we can get five to six times that quantity. The procedure is relatively recent and research is continuing to know more exactly the temperatures at which steaming is the most effective for each category of parasite. With chemical products, it takes a month of treatment and there also a problem of toxicity for people. Chemical products are put in a house with children playing on the floors and all those problems we now more and more by a mechanical attack, especially using heat and cold. In a morning and at most a day, the problem is solved. Jean Michelle Bonji puts test bed bugs and a temperature gauge in the furniture which goes into the chamber. Our research shows that it takes a temperature of at least 48° to exterminate bed bugs. In our research, we economical as possible, which means using cold or heat, but at the right levels. In winter, we can cool things down, which allows us to save energy because in winter, the things are already cold and it negative temperatures. Thanks to this mobile heat chamber, we can go directly to the base of the apartments to treat with heat or cold, social environments, hotels, everything which has bed bugs for sure, but also fleas, mites, and any insect which can infest an apartment or a building. It really a treatment of the future. It very fast and it The CO2 of our breathing is a signal which attracts many blood suckers, but it one. Mosquitoes and bed bugs are very sensitive to the odorous molecules of our body. The idea of using this attraction as a biological trap isn new. In the 1970s, the odor of armpits was synthesized and a substrate made to bait mosquitoes. In the professor William Taken from the research center of the University of Wagon Engine in Holland became very interested in using the smell of feet with the same objective. Right now, we trap which associate a temperature of 37° human odor and CO2. For the CO2, we insert a pellet in the trap. And for the odor, this product which smells really, really bad. Here I bugs. But the same stimuli attract other blood suckers like mosquitoes for example. Here we can see clearly that it efficient with three stimuli than one. Here the temperature. But despite the efficiency of this type of trap, we can an apartment. It approach because it reproduces a decoy, a human guinea pig. In Germany, American Larry Hansen relies on the smell of bed bugs to track them. He has created a dog unit which inspects planes to detect bed bugs which have embarked unseen in suitcases. Using a dog to find bed bugs is one of the best ways to find them. That the dog has an excess rate of 95%. [Music] Frankfurt airport since 2018 is the only one to have this type of service. But the problem is getting bigger. So I really think that every airport should offer it to their customers. [Music] We have a lot of people who use our service. We have airlines that use us to search the airplanes and we also have customers that come with their luggage and ask us to search their luggage with our dogs. It way up. Hi. Hi. How are you? Very well. Hi. We just need to go around the corner here and then we can search the back. Okay. We can do it right here, sir. It all right with you. Check. Hey, S. Oh, he smells something, sir. Bed bug pherommones have little smell, but the dog can identify the smell of pherommones anyway and looks for that odor of a live bed bug in the baggage. And when it finds a bed bug, it lies down. Larry Hansen doesn after the decontamination. He tells the passenger that the baggage is infested and it The problem with the bed bugs is increasing because you can travel throughout Europe with the train and with an airplane very cheap now. So the Europe has become a small town and that Climate warming will continue and the old can of insecticide of grandmother, as toxic for us as it is for insects, has to be definitively forgotten. The numerous studies which have been made, especially in the domain of genetics, should lead to effective solutions in terms of prevention and fighting. But when? While waiting, we to learn to live with these squatters that we don [Music] We can from the surface of the earth. That completely anthropocentric. We together to control the risk and act to manage it rather than try and fight it. Whatever the problems and the perils that living together brings for us, don world. While Lyme disease is much talked about in the media, specialists are keeping their cool. More and more people are bitten by ticks. But amongst the ticks present in the environment, only 10 to 20% are infected. And amongst the people who are bitten, only 2 to 4% will develop Lyme disease. You have to see things relatively and not go crazy after a tick bite. As for bed bugs, the situation is under control and being closely watched. In the world every day, millions of people are bitten by bed bugs without any consequences. In the laboratory, they can transmit viruses or bacteria. So, we have to remain very vigilant. Scratching our skin and swearing at the creatures that persecute us is written into the destiny of the human race. Our ancestors scratched more than we do nowadays, and our descendants will scratch as well. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music]	Success
Biology 2.0: The Future of Life Engineering | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvNIU7Y-SX4	SLICE Science	[Music] I come across one American scientist near San Francisco who is using a yeast an astonishing unicellular fungus to produce a molecule to combat malaria I head for the west coast of the USA a yeast to make bread or brew beer and as it happens my appointment isn at a laboratory but in a micro Brewery hello hi welcome my name is Jake keyling I professor at the University of California Berkeley I joint bioenergy Institute in Emille [Music] California my definition of synthetic biology is the engineering of biology um manipulation of biological systems to accomplish some goal Jay keasling is one of the stars of this new discipline as he describes the beer manufacturing process step-by step Jay tells me that his reputation came from his work on arisin a molecule discovered in the 1970s to combat malaria until now this molecule was extracted from a small rare shrub which only grows in a few parts of the world J keasling has found another way to produce it by modifying the Genome of a yeast we plant that naturally produces artemisin and put them into yeast and so it you put the yeast in a vat with water and sugar and some other nutrients and the yeast grows up and rather than spitting out ethanol as it would making beer wine it spits out artemisinic acid a precursor to artemisinin and then we use a process and it transforms from artemisinic acid into arisin fortunately what Jay gives me to drink is only beer it all seems so simple making a new yeast and investing it with a roll that nature had never thought of it makes my head spin or maybe it I don gave Jay the idea in the first place a short driveway is the University of California campus at Berkeley where he started out at a time when synthetic biology didn exist I was fascinated with genetics this is why I got into biology and why I took an engineering route so when I started as an assistant professor I realized that we didn available to readily engineer metabolism inside cells so I started projects with my students on developing tools for metabolic engineering but you can tools and not use them for something and not prove that they useful and I decided you know I better think about some applications for these tools so we started looking for applications and we found AR ofis [Music] I knew about malaria from a microbiology course in college knew nothing about emis and we looked into it and we said boy I think we can produce this or at least a precursor to [Music] this at the end of 2004 we had a $42 million Grant from the bill The Gates Foundation to finish off the process to engineer a microb to produce the product and then license it out to a company everything moved in retrospect pretty quickly when you process you think can faster can people dying now there for producing it they order of 60 tons of the material which is enough for 120 million people The Wager paid off engineering life as one would engineer a machine to understand how this is possible we have to look at the basic tools of synthetic biology using and combining the functions coded within DNA Jay keyling first of all reminds me that each organism each living cell has one or more functions certain cells aidid in digestion others convert light into energy for plants or transform sugar into alcohol like yeast a surprising little unicellular fungus but how do these cells know the nature of the work they have to accomplish they quite simply have a manual or a program inscribed in their nucleus their genome The genome is an organism instruction book for life it describes all of a life forms functions the book is made up of several chapters which we call chromosomes chromosomes themselves are composed of genes they form the sentences in the book each gene or each sentence is read like an instruction all the genes together tell the cell what it has to do all of this is written using an alphabet DNA made up of the well-known molecules a a g t and c for adenine guine thymine and cytosine which are always organized in pairs the a with the T and the C with the G known as base pairs genes are transmitted from one generation to the next identically or modified to respond to essential new functions or new requirements for the cell to survive this is what we call evolution if we know how to modify them and put them together we can then change very simple functions into more complex ones we can then imagine useful combinations that nature never attempted through Evolution with aminin Jay has demonstrated that it was feasible and workable on an industrial scale he transformed a cell into a chemical Factory that produces active molecules this concept enabled synthetic biology to avoid the problems that previously limited production capacities there are many advantages of producing a drug through microbial fermentations rather than having to extract it from a plant one of the challenges with the plant is that it takes a significant amount of time between the time that farmers get seeds and companies decide how much they really want and contract with those Farmers the farmers get the seeds plant them Harvest it get the molecule or the extraction to the pharmaceutical company and then they derivatize it and put it into the drugs that process takes somewhere around 14 months to 2 years and because of those long time scales there price and availability of emis swung anywhere from about $200 a kilogram to over $1,100 a kilogram and what that means is that when the price is high people in the developing world can it when the price is low Farmers don want to plant it because they can a profit so they switch to other crops be it Jay keyling or myself or a developing World farmer we same whatever the invention however Avon guardan may be we also want it to be profitable Jay is not only a scientist he company and runs another JB a laboratory co-funded by various companies in the American government along the way has he forgotten his Noble ideas about saving the world I believe strongly in a well regulated capitalistic system but we have this system that gets products out to people the company won off this antimalarial drug in fact in the University of California which holds the patents to my work gave the process away for free we make a profit on something else that doesn do with the developing world I don think that the nonprofit model works for everything right what the company gets out of it is a well-honed organism it produces artemisinic acid but you can make a few changes in its genetic makeup now and it really a core demonstration of the power of synthetic body biology you build a platform and it can do many things it can use a computer to write a document a book to give a presentation to an audience you can use it to control the heating system in a building so that it optimized you can also use it to control some of the circuits in a car computers have many use just like some of these platform organisms will have many uses Jay keasling intends to make money from other applications derived from the same platform that timinin it turns out that I can apply that to many things to producing drugs who producing flavors and fragrances for ice cream and for perfumes I can apply it to producing fuels that would be carbon neutral to producing the precursors to carpet that is produced in an environmentally friendly way that maybe has different characteristics so my science is extremely narrow but I can apply it to many different things listening to Jay keasling I want what the future of synthetic biology holds will it be the eagerly anticipated new Industrial Revolution some say there [Music] doubt we say we of what we with synthetic biology right now we use microbes that have been demonstrated by industry to be scalable right we can build chromosomes and people can claim that new life form but for the most part They what nature gave us and making some changes in the DNA wholesale re-engineering of an organism that Envision a day when if you want to produce a particular product you might custom build a cell for it [Music] I environment that can help clean up the environment maybe that will sequester carbon from the atmosphere better or that will degrade contaminants that have been accidentally spilled in the environment [Music] meanwhile one of the key applications of kling planet energy supplies and in a cleaner manner as Jay confirms few molecules offer an energy volume Simplicity ratio as effective as oil we therefore have to find Alternatives but which pollute less he believes synthetic biology has the potential for putting an end to an economy based on non-renewable resources to one based on inexhaustible [Music] resources can we not imagine a living organism producing something that nature would never have imagined fuel for example produced directly by providing it with sugar or some other food there refine just to draw it from a tap like a draft beer well this already exists and one of the numerous Laboratories working on the question is just downstairs from Jay in the same building in Emeryville I have a meeting there with Joel Cherry their research director [Music] I research at amers here in Emoryville California we that Engineers microbes to produce hydrocarbons primarily the two that are currently on the market is a diesel fuel called Farine and malan called squalene which is a dimer of Farine if you smell Farine you would recognize the smell but you probably wouldn from this it variety of plants and it concentrated in the skins of green apple if you walk through our labs when we have lots of fermenters running producing Farine you get a slight smell of green apple it looks like this the fermentation bro that green apple skin okay fine is promising but trying to produce it from apple skin would be ludicrous obtaining just one liter would require about 100,000 apples this is where synthetic biology is a GameChanger J keasling was a little evasive about how he transforms his yeast so I asked George Sherry to tell me more about the techniques that are used to modify cell it to produce something other than what its genome originally planned converting a yeast strain into a finacing producing strain really only requires the insertion of one new Gene that encodes one enzyme that makes Farine we do that by reprogramming the yeast we change the typical route that they take sugar which is to ethanol and we reroute that production so that the carbon that the yeast eat the sugar that they eat gets converted into the products that we want we rewrite the programming inside the yeast cell using DNA we introduce DNA from either synthetic DNA or DNA from other organisms enzymes coding genes synthetic DNA I didn sugar in order to illustrate the delicate construction work carried out on a nanometric scale Joel Cherry decides to explain things on a more familiar scale he leads me along the building same if you think of a cell as is a very complicated building with a plumbing system the incoming pipe is sugar the pipes inside a building go all kinds of places uh what we really are doing is trying to pinch off specific pipes in that building and direct the flow of that carbon the sugar into a specific place what we pinching off these pipes and trying to maximize flow of the carbon from the sugar into finacing is we the amount of carbon that goes into the yeast cell for things that we don think it really needs and increasing the flow of the carbon into Pharmacy we a very complicated building where we have 50% 70% idea of where all the pipes go we don there understand it all the equipment all the investment all the people working on the production of the product in question Farine and Joel Cherry the plumber admits that he doesn goes on inside a cell and yet this doesn his team from making constant progress and gradually increasing their production what we really designing the product we want to make outside the cell using computer assisted design tools and then using a collection of parts that is all the DNA that sequenced or the instruction manual that outside of the cell what it would look like and then combine those pieces using the tools of genetic engineering so it from very artisanal or craftsman approach to an industrial approach and the net result is we end up with a system that uses the engineering cycle which is design build test and learn and we run that cycle recursively over and over again iteratively to make minor improvements on the original design in synthetic biology we applying standardized parts processes and tools so that we can automate many of the steps we take when we engineering organisms much like we use when we engineer and build a car the aim of the research is to maximize production and we want to maximize the efficiency by which yeast converts sugar into our final product how much Farine is made per gram of sugar fed they can make more than twice their cell weight in a few hours these little vials contain the most effective yeasts his team has managed to perfect after continually enhancing the capacities of the modified organisms this is what will go to Brazil thanks to these yeasts Joel Cherry is now ready to move from the lab to large scale production Brazil I love it George Harry gives me an appointment thousands of miles from the San Francisco Bay in a small town in the heart of sou Pao Province we meet again in the middle of a vast sugar cane field where there vague smell of apples in the air this isn of his fuel production plant it eminently practical as the ravenous yeast he have all the food it needs to reproduce and get down to work see it controls out there because it little bit and you can grow it into a giant 200,000 liter tank in Brazil and it makes product we have a plant with a capacity of about 40 million lers per year is built right next door to a giant Sugar Mill and between our plant and the Sugar Mill runs a big pipe and that pipe carries sugar cane which gets fed directly into a giant steel tank that is called a fermentor all we do is add our yeast cells to that fermentor with a few vitamins and allow it to grow and it grows for a couple of weeks it we the tank while that fermentor is growing we have three layers form inside the fermentor the bottom would be the solid yeast cells the middle would be the sugar juice that doesn anymore so it the top layer is the oil we can separate first the cells and then the water from the oil and we end up with a product that molecule Farine that could be distilled into a product that really simple [Music] process but will the fuel produced here be able to compete with and later replace oil not really not right away oil is still much cheaper than Farine seven times cheaper and so those who benefit from fossil fuels still have much to look forward to today only a few buses fueled by Pharmacy run in the streets of sou Paulo but this won the day oil prices go up energy companies will turn to biofuels in a hurry they they synthetic biology for the moment however Joel Cherry opportunities in the Cosmetics sector synthetic biology has a role to play here too making what available to the masses cost Effectiveness is not easy to attain today and indeed in economic terms clear figures are also difficult to establish no Financial expert would risk making hazardous estimates concerning the global value of the synthetic biology market for [Music] example a company like evolva in Europe has developed cells capable of producing the molecule of saffron a highly prized product for thousands of years until now now obtaining 1 kilo of saffron required 200,000 crocuses one simple fermentation tank can today produce the same quantity the same company evolva is also counting on Resveratrol the molecule in red wine that certain studies claim has beneficial effects on the longevity of mammals however in order for it to be effective one would have to drink six bottles a day which might have certain side effects on the longevity of the mammal in question with synthetic biology there no need to consume so much to age more slowly such benefits promises and products see the light of day in a fermentation tank that could perhaps soon become a household appliance for scientists as well as students The Grail is the discovery of the right combination of genes the right formula to design a cell that produces something rare and precious that would mean hitting the jackpot synthetic biology envisages new ways of producing alternative avenues for research off the Beaten Track even at home or in a garage as it happens this is what Tomar lra is working on in a lab unlike any other called laas in Paris France hello hello Thomas Tom welcome to laay how long have you been here just under two months just under two months it in a squat at ven so for us it was a huge step forward my name is Tom until now I doctoral student in synthetic biology and at the same time I set up la payas which now takes up all my time I I and at certain times when I don enough freedom in my own professional environment I tend to move away and do things myself labas has ultimately been an opportunity to create my own laboratory to work on the projects I develop we have two rooms here there one in the back these two rooms will be used for major programs lap is an open civically minded Community Laboratory for biotechnologies and more generally for all new technologies the idea is to provide people with a space where they can experiment and meet people who spark new ideas concerning these new technologies weed create a place where people have freedom somewhere where we can give people who have an idea the possibility to work on whatever they want as they want and with whomever they want in the end what we is the same sort of thing that happened in the 70s with the Geeks and the hackers the myth of Silicon Valley garages where DIY Engineers created hugely successful startups never ceases to Fascinate having worked in institutional Labs Tomar LR is convinced that the same model could be applied to synthetic biology he wants to introduce a breath of fresh air to the field but I wonder a lab handling chemical products requires rather different facilities than a computer engineer might need there are specific tools and safety measures to respect and yet for Tomar the best proof of such garage Labs potential is the project he biological ink one of the flagship projects at lapas today is is a project that will enable everyone to grow their own ink biologically it has to be said that inks are some of the most polluting products on the planet amongst other things they pretty nasty solvents the idea is one to provide a biodegradable alternative to these inks and two to come up with an alternative that could provide a degree of self-sufficiency and so it was through a discussion I had with a designer Mary S adise that we imagined a pen that could produce its own ink instead of having a cartridge b a bioreactor with bacteria the bacteria would produce pigments and we could use the pigments to write with in exchange we and so we end up having to feed our own pens even if the idea was completely insane we began with the idea of using a bacteria that ecosystem and which could perform that role after about a month studying the relevant scientific literature I managed to find a candidate that non-pathogenic which grows easily and which produces a blue pigment in vast quantities we simply fed it with fairly classic nutrients sugar a little nitrogen phosphate Etc the pigment isn all it biodegradable this means we could use it to feed another microorganism which could then produce other things in this way synthetic biology will enable us to obtain very practical results and relatively rapidly I believe we have here some matter that very interesting that people can grow at home they just have to grow a small bacteria culture it will be open source technology that means people can share it we want to prevent it from being taken over by the big multinationals that have the ability to flood the market so we for a patent and then issue free licenses the overall philosophy seems fine garage Labs like this one are springing up all over the world although one can wonder about the scale of the projects that are developed there they synthetic biology uses pre-existing bricks it that ideas it interesting idea could emerge from the hacker shareware universe but I reassured about the use of potentially dangerous products or organisms outside official control it real surveillance of what we could call the garages meaning those places which are Beyond regulatory measures and which are invisible to National regulatory bodies so should we be afraid making a synthetic virus today is extremely difficult it whether you have the equipment or the required knowledge it and experience and there form of transparency which generally means that when someone sets off in the wrong direction they steered back on track the framework has to be respected you don pathogenic organisms you need licenses for that you need the right equipment for that and it that context that we first ethical code for biotechnologies lapas is probably one of the biggest biohacker spaces in the world today I think we by other communities like this around the world I wouldn a 100 or so within the next 5 years we up a network for example there are bayas in and Le and also in lazan and one is being created in Manila in the Philippines Tom clearly has a broader vision and it the popular success of the meetings and events organized around synthetic biology there [Music] ambitious the reference is no doubt IMM an event organized each year in Boston by some of the disciplines key figures all from the prestigious [Music] MIT tomarra himself has attended and on his advice I decide to take a look since 2004 this competition has seen students from around the world inventing cells with Innovative properties they work with a library of biobs genes from sequenced Nomes that each have a specific biological function the components they invent subsequently integrate the same open-source database with and we put the registry and also there most serious to the most bizarre project in an atmosphere of intense emulation I happen to meet a rather unexpected character among the young scientists an FBI agent so maybe my concerns about security are shared by others after [Music] all my name is Ed U I special agent from the FBI mass destruction directorate I work in the biological counter measures [Music] unit the mission of our unit is to provide a a prevention mission on looking at how do we protect the life sciences how do we prevent detect to deter the development acquisition of biological weapons the FBI has been a sponsor of IMM since 2009 we conduct Outreach to the students here and we actually host a biocurity workshop every year for the students and the theme is safeguarding science in the future so that cards these are biocurity Outreach and education trading cards it does a nice job of explaining the differences in the microbs Ed U background illustrates the evolution of governmental preoccupations concerning science and security issues before joining the FBI my background is in Biochemistry molecular biology so I was involved in human gene therapy research and I also worked for a biotech company doing cancer research post 911 the FBI Diversified their Workforce so they hired individuals like myself um computer science individuals people with foreign language skills uh we have the FBI represented by Ed we now it forced the FBI to change we can no longer be just reactive so if a crime occurs we go in now we have to be proactive we prevent another event like 911 from ever happening again not only in the US but anywhere else in the world that has now become our priority Mission and that and I so we that future scientists uh future CEOs and future policy makers and as we seen historically with any Innovation scientific advances policy is always playing catchup we actually host our own conferences too so my program we we actually have FBI sponsored conferences too we awareness and I guess the best way to characterize it is not on my watch meaning that during my time whether I a student or a full-time scientist or a business person that now that I understand what the security uh concerns might be what can I do about it now well how can I actively prevent this potential misuse or abuse or exploitation and notify the right authorities the experts who can identify what the new security challenges are going to be it students because they are actually doing the work they the best position to then teach the FBI that b based on what I my now security awareness and I do my assessment here vulnerability that you should be aware of we are going to be dependent on that partnership to determine if there was some incident we expertise to help us determine in our investigations was this purely an accident Ed you has no intention of minimizing the risks furthermore in view of the extent of potential applications for synthetic biology it increasingly complicated to evaluate them in any case rather than being called in merely to put out a fire the FBI is being proactive and yet I doubt that the dependence on the collective conscience the not on my watch premise involving Mutual surveillance among scientists regulated by a code of conduct will suffice in a the widespread doubts linked to synthetic [Music] biology such actions also reveal the inability of government agencies to keep an eye on everything at once fears concerning the abuse or misuse of science are not limited to questions of security a good many NOS are attempting to raise public and political awareness about other issues too to learn more I in Canada to meet one of their representatives Jim Thomas my name is Jim Thomas um I work for an organization called the etcetra group where I we track the impacts of new technologies on Society on the environment on economy Jim Thomas observes criticizes and sometimes denounces the failings of technoscience and scientists he has recently pointed his finger at nanotechnology and geoengineering but his favorite Target today is synthetic biology the natural world isn machine the idea that you able to improve nature is remarkably naive there has to be understood and that complexity is not just ecological complexity it social complexity and economic complexity what worries me is that the field of synthetic biology works on some very simplistic premises that may not even be right synthetic biologists in their Laboratories working on very specific applications are looking narrowly they a social situation of the ecosystems into which their organisms are going to be released and in fact often when you talk with synthetic biologists they of admit that they can think about that complexity [Music] Jim Thomas is particularly concerned about the pretentions of bioengineers and their blinker he travels around the world trying to mobilize the public at [Music] large he takes me to Tunisia where he taking part in the world where science is one of the issues to be discussed the country is undergoing upheaval and attracts militants from around the world [Music] after his first intervention at the University of Tunis Jim Thomas takes me to the city Medina he wants to show me some examples of traditional production that synthetic biology intends to replace in his view it would mean the end for small scale producers [Music] even the most useful product can be criticized in his opinion for example he lambasts the idea of manufacturing the yeast that produces arisin which would appear to be of great benefit to humanity the claim that this organism by producing this important antimalarial drug would be a major Boon for the fight against malaria but we very soon discovered that artam Missin who was already grown by hundreds of thousands of farmers worldwide and it instantly raised the question well what happens to those Farmers if there had been a lack of artamis and it hadn get it from Farmers then this might have been a good but that wasn reality the reality is there was enough a me soon far from high-tech labs and Industrial installations Jim Thomas is above all interested in human beings in the producers who are the most at risk that really pointed towards some of the sort of large economic changes that could happen once you can begin making commercially important compounds through synthetic Biology another issue has also drawn his attention the question of sugar sugar is the raw material for synthetic biology it projects and supply and demand constraints could lead to [Music] problems basically you have a system where you sugar to these engineered organisms and on a small scale that might be no problem but if you begin to talk about producing large amounts of products such as biofuels for example or Plastics you amount of sugar and the production of sugar particularly sugar cane in Brazil is associated with all sorts of environmental problems It with social problems with Land grabbing um it destroying one of the most fragile regions of Brazil so this is potentially a very damaging ecological Trend increasingly the synthetic biology industry is saying okay then we take any material from the land we to the Sea we we coast of China and off the coast of Chile but once again this is going to have ecological implications so it produce large quantities of something using biology as a basis without disrupting biology on quite a wide scale I sometimes get the impression that Jim Thomas is against everything against technology against big business but this is no doubt his role since a form of counterweight and opposition to the buzz and the general enthusiasm generated by synthetic biology is essential the techniques that are used in synthetic biology of creating new living systems are tremendously exciting and interesting and I think they useful for better understanding the way in which life processes work they have a lot of value within the laboratory for Science and for improving our knowledge of the world where I get concerned is when those techniques are taken to to the marketplace for producing industrial applications and without really understanding the implications and so until Society has a way to address those disruptions we need to be exceedingly cautious caution is good and words can be powerful but can they really change anything I asked Jim Thomas about the possible solutions that he and his group have envisaged I think what would be the best outcome where if the governments of the world said wait a second since this is going to be so powerful because this is going to have such wide impacts let slow down let put a bit of a pause on commercializing these Technologies and putting them out to the environment that would require strong International governance it would require a willingness to listen beyond the companies and the narrow group of scientists who are controlling this debate but I think it would be a very sane decision for the next 150 years whatever the field of research communication between scientists and ordinary citizens has to be developed these synthetic biologists in managing to evolve Evolution to make what nature never intended or imagined have initiated a technological Revolution that no doubt goes far beyond anything the world has seen before a revolution I believe it would be a shame to Scupper does it not have a great deal to offer us a great deal to teach us about life itself it can help our society to progress to consume less and more efficiently to preserve the environment to find new therapies to cope with diseases but unfortunately there will be errors there will be accidents that always have been it would be pretentious to claim the opposite will we be able to anticipate them will we be ready to face them such questions Merit further investigation there is still so much more to discover [Music] [Music]	Success
Saving the Sundarbans: A Fight for Survival | SLICE SCIENCE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwF7JWD2HaY	SLICE Science	[Music] [Laughter] [Music] the sunband forest is the largest Mangrove in the world covering over 10,000 square km between India and Bangladesh [Music] [Music] it water of two of the planet powerful Rivers the Ganges and the Brahma Putra and the saltwater of the Indian Ocean come together from this Junction is born an inextricable network of saltwater to canals that form an amazing ecosystem ruled by the mysterious Bengal tiger for bengalis sunbuns means beautiful Forest it provides them with the best protection against increasingly violent Cyclones but especially the forest is brimming with game fish crustations and wood used for heating and building the families who live here here are entirely dependent on the forest and have always been mindful of the balance between their needs and what the land can offer them but over the past few years this balance has been seriously Disturbed and the means to remedy it are lacking everything lies in the hands of local initiatives how can humans reestablish the of this Forest that is looked upon as a protective and nurturing Mother by an entire people for over a decade sirel Hussein has been taking pictures of the mangrove his photography documenting bird life in the sunband is known throughout the [Music] world his pictures reveal a Mysterious Universe here over 300 varieties of bird live in an array of habitats dry forest Wetlands mud flats and sandy beaches one of the suer band residents has captivated sel in particular if anybody comes to sunon the first think will catch their eyes are the king fisher they are so beautifully uh they have beautiful color and they are very agile they bold and strong birds and almost all day they stay on the branches and look at the canel uh catchfish this canal is the king fish territory and the solitary creatures are on a mission to defend it against other members of their species they dive into the river to hunt and spend so little time underwater that when they come back out their impermeable feathers are never even wet you can also hear very strong uh voice in the forest they are very beautiful to listen to and that actually uh give you the sense that you are in Sund because I don uh you can hear so strong and so loud and beautiful bird song but once we venture Inland the forest hob is an entirely different kind of wildlife the mangrove forest is 114 million years old and for ages was completely free of human presence because it has great dangers in store for intruders [Music] [Music] [Music] the shitel however also known as the spotted deer is harmless it animal species found in the Thunder bands there are some deer came to eat group of about 60 70 the this place is full of with K trees you can see around the all the trees the lowest leaf or are in the same line like a haircut this is because the deers actually they climb on their hind leg and eat all the leaves as far as they can here the deer sometimes they they have another compan companion which is the res meak the only primate in this Forest this Kat tree has a small fruit you know round fruit which is very tasty to monkeys but when they eat they drop many of the leaves and many fruits they drop in the ground and de normally they follow monkey and they they take the fallen leaves and fruits and this is somehow a natural connection between the deer and the monkey but the unusual symbiosis that is developed between the deer and the Mac ax is mainly useful for defending against the same predator those cries are the alarm signal for the entire forest for sirul this unparalleled Predator arouses as much fear as Fascination even after more than 10 years he photo once an extremely rare picture worth more than all the rest so we are hearing this dear call and this was advancing and then some monkey started to you know making noise and so we were just thinking that something is happening so we told our Boatman who was rowing with thean to go faster we were just going through the canal slowly I saw a a head came came out behind the bush and slowly going and swimming across the canal I took some shots some of my friends also took some sh and shot and that is that was fantastic that day syel took a picture of a Bengal tiger Panther tigis tigis the largest big cat on earth it was really a good feeling because getting a tiger photo in the wild uh is very rare and uh I feel good I feel [Music] good the Bengal tiger is more than just the symbol of Bangladesh it plays a major role in the equ equilibrium of the mangrove forest perched at the top of the sban food chain the tiger feeds mainly on herbivores regulating their populations and indirectly maintaining the characteristics of the entire ecosystem but the Bengal tiger also protects the sander bands from one of its greatest threats humans who for centuries steered well clear of the creature [Music] Mony ran is hot on the Tiger he creatures habits and movements to ensure its protection Bengal tigers are in grave danger of extinction there are only about a 100 left in the Thunder bands like all wild cats tigers hunt at dawn and dusk they Broad bro daylight studying one of the largest Predators alive comes with Mortal risks mon rhan never Ventures into the mangrove without an armed guard [Music] Professor here are some droppings I found some fur look yes those are tiger droppings we see de fur these droppings are quite old the fur tells us what the Tiger in the Sundar band we see very few Tigers I tiger took the different behavioral signs that show us what it did if it hunted ate rested or walked about every track and sign a tiger leaves gives Clues to its behavior I locate it later on the map these tigers have grown customed to the muddy swampy climate of the suar band and its Forest environment that trouble swimming across a river that or three kilm wide other tiger breeds can well the Bengal tiger made this region its home 12,000 years ago and has perfectly adapted to the unique Forest that grows here half on land and half in water the Raining Tree here is also amphibious The Mangrove there are a dozen or so varieties fazul O is a biologist he spent his entire career working to understand the incredible mechanism that allows the mangrove to adapt to what no other Forest can stand up to Tidal e and Flow [Music] this is a num metaphor you can tell from its shape which tree it from this is the pneuma for of the sundari mangrove tree it hard the upper part is pointed [Music] [Music] as it is flooded twice daily the soil in the sunderban mangrove is pouring [Music] oxygen mangroves have a unique and ingenious way of breathing pum metaphors a kind of breathing tube that grow upward from their roots [Music] a when the Tide low the trees breathe through the pores of their pneumatophores called lenticels at high tide the lenells close and trap the air inside the tree the tree uses the oxygen and releases carbon dioxide into the water mango forests trap five times more carbon dioxide than other forests in the world the mangroves other amazing feat is that it to cope with salinity The Mangrove filters out the salt then absorbs the water the tree then excretes the salt that [Music] leaves the ingenious Mangrove has also managed to put the tides to good use for reproduction rather than the risk of drowning or asphyxiating its seeds they germinate directly on the tree after getting swept by the currents at high tide the seedlings fall and take root in the sludge at low tide after that everything happens fast the trees root system emerges in one day and the first leaves in less than 10 in 2 years time the mangroves are already several meters tall this dense root system has an amazing attribute it anchors trees in a particularly solid way allowing them to act like a fence to slow down wind and water though they may not be able to stop a tsunami mangroves can reduce the damage caused by the fierce Cyclones in the Bay of Bengal mang Groves offer precious defense for the entire country but the mangrove forest is much more than a cluster of trees what we have here is a complex and diversified food chain each living creature plays an important role when the water recedes it reveals a whole realm of curious creatures like the mud skipper an amphibious fish perfectly capable of living on land during low tide it from one another which not only gives it a broad field of vision but allows it to see both under and above the water [Music]	Success
The Hidden Power of Microbes: We Are Superhuman! | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNwPyGKxQM	SLICE Science	[Music] hidden on you is a world you have never seen overrun with bizarre creatures that live on and in every part of your body it and we don they are affecting us in ways we never imagined but now for the first time we can explore this unknown world they component of what we are this is a struggle of life and death if we got rid of all the microbes on us and inside us we would die so doctors are even reintroducing bugs into our bodies the lby are alive they skin it oakworm you are more than human each and every one of us is a collection of different life forms that us home this is life on [Music] us life is an endless fight a battle for food and sex but often the winning strategy is a balance of power a truce between Rivals the same happens inside our bodies where trillions of organisms have evolved to share us there are worms in your bow colonies of bacteria on your teeth [Music] fungi thrive in your lungs and viruses embed themselves in your DNA collectively this manery of bugs is called your microbiome and it you as any of your organs we are essentially an assembly of a lot of different organisms ourselves included microbes have helped us to evolve they are they were there right from the evolution of human beings as hunter gatherers even right back to the evolution of mammals but in the blink of an eye we cut ourselves a drift from nature we which we were exposed to thousands and thousands of species of many different kinds where we ate food with dirt still on it um where we had worms and then all of the sudden we move into these environments where we ourselves that all of their species aside from our dogs and our lovers and our kids are bad believing it makes us healthier we do our best to scrub bugs off our bodies we and now we are paying the price modern medicine is about killing bad species we are really good at thinking about medicine in that context you know something bad makes us sick we kill it we get better but but the idea that something good is missing and that that makes us sick we don a framework for that the medicine that would be required to think about this in the right way would would need to think about the body as an ecosystem in this revolution in medicine it this is a journey into the human body your insides are a Battleground and it your health that stake our tour begins at the mouth all is not well with the main entrance dental decay in in this world now I uh plague portions tooth decay now affects around 90% of children worldwide and can lead to Serious diseases it age compared to us our ancestors had pearly whites and they didn teeth it detective Professor Alan Cooper He been studying teeth throughout the ages when you do look at the hunter gatherer populations you see very little signs of dental carries the holes and your teeth they look in really good Nick but the closer we come to Modern people the worse the teeth become as soon as you start uh moving from the hunter Gaba phase into the the farming phase the teeth look terrible you know there gun disease because of the bacteria around the base of the teeth um nasty pathologies and the consequences are far more profound than bad teeth if kooper could discover what gone wrong inside our mouths it might help explain the rise of some of our most serious diseases we think oh well we get bit of bleeding gums we we have to go to the dentist a bit no big deal we got holes in our teeth what we don that the bacteria are leaking down through those inflamed gums into our blood system from stimulating all sorts of immune responses and these immune responses are now being linked increasingly to a huge range of modern Western diseases cardiovascular disease diabetes hypertension premature birth cancer uh the list goes on and on in one way or another the key to it all is bacteria there are more than 100 million bacteria in every drop of saliva an ecosystem of 700 different species and there is no place they like better than the wet surfaces of our teeth here they form a layer or biofilm the dentists call plaque it happens every night when we plaque the layer of bacteria on our teeth gets calcified and slowly builds up over time this is what the dentist is removing we provide bacteria with a home which is just as well because without them we teeth the microbes in our mouth protect us from the food we eat we have evolved in the presence of acids most foods that we eat most of our diet is essentially acidic at the same time the enamel which makes up the the the outside surface of the tooth is inorganic and will dissolve in acid so here we condum trying to to work out what Happening Here how does a tooth stop s from disolving soling the answer is biofilm a dense layer of bacteria that teeth as acid eats away at the enamel bacteria fills in the holes the tooth starts to dissolve then the raw products of this process get caught into the biofilm and in the right environment get reused to heal the tooth in a healthy mouth everything works in balance and the good bacteria protects us from Decay these microscopic dentists have looked after our teeth for much of our Evolution so what judge that if we what it looked like beforehand but there was a problem there teeth of Museum skulls there there seem to be no way that we could actually get a look at what a bacterial microbiome would look like in in the past until um we thought about this calcified plaque on the on the teeth it was an ingenious solution locked in the plaque of our ancestors with a fossilized remains of vast numbers of bacteria and compared to us there was a striking difference everything does completely uh strange when the Industrial Revolution comes in 1850 and suddenly you processed sugar and flour become available and at that point the diversity of the bacteria in the mouth just drops away and huge amounts of these pathogenic bacteria become um very obvious in everybody we look at a bunch of disease causing bacteria has taken over our mouth they thrive on our modern diet of processed food and that tend to make be little acid factories producing acid onto the tooth surface which then starts to dissolve the enamel away and lower the pH of the environment and they are able to withstand that low PH that harsh condition the other microbes in the mouth aren bacteria that don conditions good bacteria that normally keep the bad bacteria under control just like in the gut then these die off our changing diet Unleashed a war inside our mouth and the bad guys are winning acidity in our mouth is a problem but there couldn it our stomach it pathogens we eat food full of microbes and one of the reasons those don colonize and take over our gut is that we have this stomach with adaptations for dealing with um the microbes in fact healthy humans can eat just about anything because 99% of the bacteria in your food are killed by the stomach acid it dissolve nails and you have these stories over the years of people who try to kill themselves by eating razor blades or Nails Etc and a few months later you look in their stomach and you can only find a few old rusty fragments it digested the only bacteria that survives the Acid Bath is the bug called the gastric demon helicobactor pylori helicobactor is very very interesting it between a harmful one and a harmless beneficial one no one knows this bug better than Australian Barry Marshall in 2005 he shared the Nobel Prize with Robin Warren for discovering its power over us the reason people didn bacteria in the stomach before the 1970s when Dr Warren first saw them uh was that they knew that bacteria could not live in acid it dangerous but we now know some bacteria have learned to survive in extreme environments and the gastric demon is one of them so the question is then how do bacteria survive in acid and the next Discovery was that the bacteria can make ammonia and ammonia neutralizes acid helicobactor has a nasty reputation it reason it causes stomach cancer and gastric ulcers Marshall and Warren were the first to show that ulcers weren triggered by stress or spicy food as it was commonly thought but by infection with helicobactor however we could never get over this issue that lots of people had the bacteria and never got an ulcer and so the Skeptics could always say you you must be wrong because I have lots of people with helicobacter and they never had a day life and even more puzzling is it in the developing world where the gastric demon is rampant hardly anyone gets ulcers somehow a dangerous bacteria for the rich is harmless for the poor and the difference between the two is another parasite worms iloba pylori causes ulcers if you don can you need the whole ecosystem it the proportion of wor terms in bacteria needs to be just right for a healthy body but just to show how subtle all of this is if you remove helac pylori which is what we antibiotics we get another problem the eviction of helicobactor in the western world has contributed to the rise of new diseases like asthma and allergies so it causes cancer ulcers possibly prevents asthma but the reason it prevents asthma is possibly more important than all the Terrible Things it does helicar bacter is an Invader that keeps our immune system busy and if it not present we can overreact against harmless stuff like pollen or pets if you could find the correct strain which you could control uh then I think it it would resurrect helicobactor as a useful uh bacteria if could tame the gastric demon it might become a live vaccine against allergies so I think there are all kinds of possibilities I it and uh we are already testing uh helicobactor products in human volunteers at the University of Western Australia bacteria fungi and worms are invading us all the time in fact they come as a side order with every bite you take but some people can these nasty parasites they want more e e our food contains more than we bargain for it sometimes the eggs of parasitic worms Richard folks loves his ham and eggs but this breakfast is being sacrificed in the name of science folks built the world artificial stomach and today he is out to discover if worm eggs survive the guts acid test this is my breakfast and I a pinch of intestinal parasite eggs and mix it before putting it into the stomach a head lies a hydrochloric acid bath that will kill just about anything everything normal the whole thing is uh operating at 37° Centigrade which is the same temperature as the body the first sample is now just being ejected th this is the material which actually ends up going down into the duodenum and into the intestine but do the parasites survive the journey well as we expected most of these parasite eggs seem to be viable worms are one of Nature survivors they thrive Drive in some of the planet environments including your insides the ones in our gut look like aliens from a sci-fi movie and Incredibly they originally came from the murky depths of the oceans they were able to come on land by colonizing the guts of animals including us thereafter a rich food supply your blood parasitic worms love us and in turn we are beginning to love them back if I had uh Crohn ulcerative colitis or multiple sclerosis I would infect myself without hesitation a colleague and I gave ourselves hook worms and my colleague had 20 hookworms and I only had six and being a competitive person I thought well I Dr John Crow and Alex Lucas are hooked on worms worms are both bad and good in developed countries where we are well-nourished worms are potentially good the medical use of worms is now being put to the test Hugh sheown is suffering from celiac disease a nasty reaction to gluten that causes severe diarrhea and pain he and Judy Nunan are part of a pioneering clinical trial we are experimentally infecting these people with hookworms to see if the infection has a therapeutic benefit on their Cron disease these are diseases where the immune system attacks aligning of the intestines causing chronic inflammation so how can worms fix the problem the last thing a worm wants to do is have our immune system ejected they modulate the immune system and send it in a direction that just generally dampens inflammation and that protects them stops them from from being attacked but the the benefit of that is that inflammation in general is suppressed as it turns out it worms spit that carries the magic ingredient as a hookworm attaches it releases all sorts of salivary proteins and some of those have immunosuppressive properties with worms on board H immune system is turned down and should stop overreacting to gluten in pasta the aim is to use hookworm to change the immune response to gluten for people with celiac disease any amount of pasta can be dangerous six weeks with worms and Hughes reached a milestone it previously even this would have made him sick when we reintroduced gluten to celiacs who have hookworm infection but their response will be muted and they start to tolerate low doses of gluten for Hugh sheown the experiment was a success at the end of the trial he could eat a full bowl of pasta live worm therapy is a good proof of concept but I don scalable widely used uh method of treating inflammation however if we can identify and harness the actual molecules that are responsible we can then turn those into a much more conventional type of drug but desperate patients aren willing to wait an approved drug will take many years to develop nice to see you come on come on pleas welcome so the seriously ill are signing up for treatments in the hookworm underground originally I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and because those medications weren to irritable bowel syndrome can I have your arm people should be allowed uh to pursue alternative therapies especially when the other possibil seems not so great on the other hand if it proven to work then you don works then you into a dream vesque manov is a science writer but his interest in alternative therapy is very personal my whole life I uh asthma I I autoimmune disoder called alopecia Arata which means my immune system turned on my hair follicles basically shutting them down after researching his health problems Moises made arrangements to be inoculated with the so-call American murderer nikor americanos it plagued Humanity for centuries Moises traveled to a private clinic in Mexico just across the border from the US where using worms for medical purposes remains illegal of course I was a little bit nervous because I most people tell you is stupid it probably is uh I wasn though because I knew that scientists around the world had self- infected because the reality is you can these things unless you keep a colony alive somewhere they only live in humans so you they just they just have them in their own guts and then they when they need them they cultivate them one of those who cultivated his own worms is the owner of the Mexican Clinic Garen aletti parasitology has a story tradition of self-experimentation and so what we trying to do is remove the barriers of to access for this um because I don want everyone to have to do you know what I did was basically when I became ill and was looking for Access you go to the professional scientists and they can institutional review boards and Professional Standards and appropriate treatment corridors Garen Al Yeti plagued by chronic immune disas dis orders conventional medicine offered no help so in desperation he turned to worms but first he had to find them he traveled to Peru where the American murderer was common collecting worms is not for the fainthearted the process requires doing something called a latrine survey a latrine survey basically means just taking samples of soil and feces and collecting it and cataloging it it just about as much fun as it sounds I think it was the Ortiz family was the one that turned out to be the hottest one and the thing that um I wasn prepared for is that I had to beat the chickens because the chickens were going down to eat it and if they got there first then there everything was going to be gone so I had to go me running around trying to get to the chickens after harvesting his medicine Al Yeti infested himself with seven microscopic L and The Offspring of those worms are now used by doctors to treat patients in his Clinic once inside us the hookworms face a perilous Journey yet they are well adapted to the challenges our body throws at them if you apply 50 live hookworm ly to the skin you can be assured that those 50 loby will get into the gut the LA hitchhike aboard blood vessels and flow through the bloodstream like Rafters on a river they will pass through the heart before reaching the lung they to irritate the lung a little bit lungs are going to produce a little bit more of flame the flame goes all the way to your throat and you swallow it okay so they got into the stomach which is full of acid but the flame is actually protecting the worms so they going to get burned by by the acid that nature once the worms reach the intestines they announce themselves to the immune system by taking their first bloody meal and that sucks the side effect phase was a bit of a an experience and had I not been so committed to never doing a latrine survey again I don have gotten through it those side effects include cramps nausea and diarrhea the body resp response to shake itself free of the parasites they are painful to have those symptoms sort of waned over time and I also saw some benefits like about a few let uh the parasites was hay fever season for the first half of hay fever season I completely lost my allergies it was amazing I never lost my food allergies I still had those the worms can manipulate our immune system in a way that modern medicine is yet to match so I think just because you can kill all the worms doesn idea to kill all the worms though it does work for some people it also doesn who got worse so I actually would not recommend it on the other hand it doesn argument that we is that our immune system comes to expect stimuli like these and we need to replace it somehow these therapies remain unproven but one way or another worms are forcing us to reconsider our approach to treating Western diseases but they are just one of our microscopic tenants there are 100 trillion more in the most unloved place of our body the colon gastroenterologist Thomas barodi discovered the power of Pooh and he saving lives with it e e amongst the last unexplored regions on Earth are caves they hold species that are unknown to science yet they are no match for the dark corridors of your bowel here there are more bacteria on just a single square cm than all the humans who times more living cells in the stool than there is no body so infect we are 10% human and 90% poo the microbes in the gut aren along for the ride they are essential for the development of the brain the immune system our overall health and even mood and body shape these bacteria depending on the composition can control weight gain weight loss and development of insulin resistance so there sort of vast mechanisms that are in inside our B Flora that are responsible which are just emerging yet we are damaging our gut Flora even before understanding it we know that when you take too many antibiotics that one of the things that happens is it puts you an extreme risk for pathogens it kills off all of the friendlies and so then the bad bacterium takes over and the patient dies so instead of prescribing antibiotics to kill the bacteria gastroenterologist Thomas barodi does the opposite he adds bacteria trillions of them Professor baroi is the p Pioneer of feal transplants to treat digestive diseases he replaces infected gut Flora with healthy poo it I the potential because it in its healthy form with full diversity lots of bacteria is able to enter another person cause disease despite all we Pooh being smelly waste for barodi it medicine alcolin is a factory producing bacteria that thrives on Foods we can digest the bacteria eat them when bacteria eat them they multiply so we have to let them out the other end and that defecate and defecate we do an average person will produce more than four tons of feces in their lifetime barodi has opened a new frontier in medicine every morning healthy donors arrive at his Clinic with a fresh Supply to cater for people with gastrointestinal diseases Katie Angelus suffers from debilitating bowel problems I was used to that Blank Stare you know when I ask them what was wrong with me how can you help me when you have got issues um you been to Hell back with your symptoms so you would do anything to you know get some kind of improvement Professor barodi will perform 7 to 10 treatments like this every day and many more would come if they could afford it the cost is prohibitive to get it done in a clinic for them so they home plenty of them a lot of parents doing it for kids you know with crohn disease and whatever and they desperate they you know they yeah it it but yeah it are still trying to work out the best way of doing it I mean do you put it in that way or that way or a radio control capsule you swallow and open up with some sort of radio control signal and then the capsule carries on you know the Technologies are being developed there are going to be some very clever ways of doing this tending our microbial Garden also helps with diseases that have nothing to do with digestive problems 20 years ago William costopoulos had his wisdom teeth removed it didn my body went into trauma they thought actually I had a stroke they sent me to a neurologist and they gave me an MRI scan and U after the MRI scan they told me that I had Ms multiple sclerosis it was devastating news the there was times you feel like just killing yourself your life is revolving around medication and doctors and M scans and treatments and Hospital realizing the disease couldn be beaten to he went to see Professor barod we spoke about some sort of transplant a poo transplant as he puts it and um I would was open to anything at that stage because I was suffering for 3 and a half years 4 years Willam had the transplant and Incredibly he has completely recovered things are fantastic things couldn better I mean I 50 so I 50 I still feel like I 20 that was a for such patients and we went not treating their Ms they did not come to us for that purpose we were treating the bow disturbance for now these are anecdotal results yet the treatment designed for Digestive diseases seems to be having even more intriguing side effects we have had at least two patients in whom profound Depression was able to be reversed and I didn patient said to me after he had a transplant done for a different C was he said my depression is gone I said to him what do you mean your depression how can it be he said all I depression for 25 years doc I know when the depression is gone so I wasn to argue with him gut microbes influence our body and mind in fundamental yet inexplicable ways there seen patients that are difficult to believe when we change patients Flora why is this so there are so many questions to be answered if we can explain the links between our microbial ecosystem and chronic disease it will revolutionize medicine as the first step microbiome explorers are signing up volunteers to donate a dollar of poop they of [\\xa0__\\xa0] in the US and I heard that it just been expanded worldwide now so when we do the survey a very wide survey that across the whole human population what the variety is and we can uh see how that relates to People of Health these initial surveys have already revealed thousands of bacteria we never knew before our inner continent is Terror incognit every person is colonized with the these species that have an enormous effect on how they live um their health and well-being for their entire life and in many cases we can names but we that make us fat or thin a group of bacteria called fues helps the absorption of fat by the body depending on which ones you have you may have absolutely complete digestion of your food and I suppose the theory is that then you people that has a small amount of food and puts on a kilo every day whereas other people might eat the same amount and not put not put on any weight having these fat bugs on board is the equivalent of eating a slice of cake every day historically if you had a group of microbes that gave you lots of energy from your food it will be enormously beneficial because you could go longer without food and survive you would need less food every day but now we fat luckily there is a bug that helps keep you thin aania May One Day lead to a treatment for obesity I think we might have yogurts in the future or something like this which will give you the sort of skinny yogurt together with bugs and I those ultimately our health will be determined by the diversity of bugs in our gut and the balance between the beneficial and the bad and that varies from one culture to the next if you look at the gut Flora of for instance people living in a little African village and compare that with the gut Flora of people living in Italy they are so different people in developing countries have a richer and more balanced gut floor than those in the west and that helps explain why the affluent are more prone to Modern diseases one reason is clearly Diet we eat crap when you eat you don yourself you microbes and in the west we are nourishing the bugs that make us sick these bad bugs release toxins that trigger a violent response from our immune system and that causes inflammation what happens when you eat junk food is that you become immediately inflamed your microbes actually inflame you in the presence of junk food and that inflammation runs through your body like wildfire and the higher that low level of background inflammation is the more susceptible you are to all sorts of disorders these are diseases of an out of balance immune system ranging from inflammatory bowel syndrome to Multiple Sclerosis Crohn allergies inflammation is at the sort of root of all of them just as our mouth microbiome has been disturbed by eating too much carbohydrate antibiotics and bad diet have turned the bacteria in our gut from friend into foe we incredibly few Generations from lives as hunter gatherers to lives as agriculturalists to lives in places like Hong Kong where people live in 60 story buildings and are totally disconnected from any of the light Wild life around them this whole web this whole ecosystem or biome it need moving forward is to figure out how do we Garden The Beneficial parts of this web this idea of reconnecting us to what we are missing from the environment is the life professor John Stanford he African mud puddle that some are calling the white underbug Cynthia Stanford had a rare condition called raina fingers turned numb and white when exposed to cold jobs in the kitchen were a problem washing up or peeling carrots peeling potatoes my fingers used to go into total white out and be unusable by coincidence her husband professor John Stanford was testing a new vaccine for leprosy it contained a bacteria he in Uganda it was called M vaki since we were the ones that were had developed it we wanted to try it on ourselves first before we gave it to anybody else John and I had a dose each and I realized that my Aron nose disease that I gone away and so after that we lined up all the rest of the family who also had Ros disease but they also had other things the vaccine appeared to be helpful in dealing with the other diseases that run in the family including even cancer my mother had cancer at the same time as her reo disappeared including spinal secondaries she had her mvi injection and then a month or so afterwards when she went for radiological assessment before having the radiation um they said well they disappeared these results were entirely anecdotal but the bacterial treatment began to have surprising results elsewhere too I asked an Indian Doctor Who was doing leprosy work if he would look out for any other indications that it seemed to be helpful with the first one that he noticed um which is was really quite important um was a patient with leprosy and psorasis remarkably the psorasis got better he was so pleased that when we were out there visiting India he brought us um a small goat to give us in exchange for the good that we done him Stanford tested in clinical trials and one of the most promising is for depression drugs that are commonly used to treat depression have anti-inflammatory effects and so one of the ways that they may be improving the health of depressed patients is by suppressing the inflammation which is exactly what micob bacterian vaki does inflammatory diseases are problems of the immune system but how could something so complex be controlled by a bacterium from Africa humans co-evolved with these bacteria throughout Evolution and so it the last 50 years or so we would have consumed milligram quantities of these bacteria so the immune system began to rely on the presence of these things to turn on the police force if you like of the immune system without microbes like M vaki the immune system becomes overactive and causes constant inflammation we spent all this time thinking about our immune system as a machine that repelled microbes that just Zapped them left and right like one of of those fly zappers and it turns out that the immune system that we thought had evolved to kill microbes is actually controlled by microbes our modern lives however are isolating us from the very thing we need to stay healthy now of course we don these bacteria because we have sterilized water and sterilized food and it bacteria is contributing to an increase in disease specifically diseases that are related to inflammation the evidence now strongly suggests that the rise in these diseases is a result of our isolation from the microbes we with soon we may be able to treat immune disorders by putting the bugs back into our bodies but the potential of bacterial treatments goes even further Australian scientists are now injecting bacteria into mosquitoes to prevent us from getting sick mozes are annoying at the best of times they weapons to get the food they need to survive our blood mosquitoes need blood for protein to make eggs only the female mosquito feeds on blood and without it she really won lie but these syringes don blood they often inject us with potentially lethal parasites causing serious infections like Deni fever Deni is actually caused by four quite different viruses and uh and each of them has quite a different uh effect in the host so you literally have to have four four vaccines rolled into one but scientists at Monash University have discovered An Elegant way to combat the disease instead of vaccinating humans they are vaccinating the mosquitoes these mosquito eggs are being injected with a powerful bacteria called wakia Professor Scott O much of his career studying this intriguing bacteria I got introduced to it at a very early age and it hooked me me and I life and so one of the most amazing things about wak here is just how common it is if you were to look in a in a Bushland environment like this and look at the insects within it around 70% of those insects would all carry wakia naturally and when you think on the planet that there are two to five million different species of insect that carry wakia just as gut bacteria can be good for us W bakia is beneficial to in insects protecting them against invading parasites by having waca within the body of the insect it probiotic for the insect if you like it it makes it able to fend off some of these other pathogens like dangi viruses but there spread diseases like Deni don wbia so the challenge was to find a way to infect them in fact you know we spent you know years and years trying to do that experimen uh had many poor students who failed in that uh Endeavor until finally we were able to succeed about four years ago these mosquitoes host wakia they are so precious that volunteers will gladly sacrifice their ankles to feed them we thousands of casionally tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of mosquitoes and releasing them killing them there have been outbreaks of Deni in Australia years so to test their Theory researchers have been releasing the vaccinated mosquitoes in cans once released wakia spreads quickly every week they monitor how many of the wild mosquitoes now have the bacteria and the results are paying off the releases that we did in 2011 are close to to 100% infected with wakia wherever the mosquitoes have been released Deni has been stopped in its tracks following the success in can new trials have begun all over the world but even super bacteria like wakia have enemies like all living things it for the ultimate parasite viruses they are all around us in the air in the soil in the oceans and right now 3 trillion are inside you most of them are probably doing us no harm at all but a few of them are deadly cause deadly diseases from flu to AIDS to small pox viruses have killed Untold millions of people but some viruses the Retro viruses have an even more extraordinary power they have found a way into the very core of us our DNA on occasion the virus will infect cells of what we call the germ line those are the cells that are destined to become eggs in females and sperm in males and if they infect those cells and get into the chromosomes then these retroviruses get a free ride to the Next Generation Robin Weiss was the first to prove that viruses not only cause disease they can become genes it was a Eureka moment to realize that something that we think of as an infectious agent as a virus going from one person to another can be part of the normal inheritance this was a mindblowing discovery by transforming into genes retroviruses can replicate for millions of years they are the ultimate survivors their reason for living is to replicate themselves so if you can embed yourself into another host that to replicate your genome for you you probably reached nirvana these viral invasions of DNA are rare events occurring perhaps once in a million years yet amazingly one is unfolding right now in front of our eyes veterinarian John hanger noticed that something unusual was killing the Australian icon the koala it seemed almost inevitable if they rang me up and said oh we out of 10 it was a koala that was sick with luk lymphoma it was so common when he investigated hanger discovered a retrovirus in the cancerous tissues every single koala that we looked at and every single tissue that we uh that we isolated some DNA from and tested they were all positive for the retrovirus it on the other hand it what we know has been happening during evolution in any case we are the survivors of viral invasions like the one that is Waging War on koalas human DNA is littered with the fossil remains of these ancient battles it 8% of our DNA sequences in our human DNA is derived from retroviruses we are chalk a block with fossil retroviruses until recently these genes were considered insignificant nothing more than junk but we Now understand that these genetic fossils have actually played a key role in evolution in fact without them we couldn born the same trick of virus uses to infect cells now allows a mother and fetus to fuse together through the Center this makes a very good efficient barrier between the mother and the fetus uh that is uh protective uh but allows nutrients and oxygen to get across thanks to A protein that was once millions of years ago uh a protein used by the virus uh to infect cells we shouldn scary part of our Machinery that they an absolutely essential component of what we are an ancient retrovirus now intimately bonds with every person on Earth and it of organisms that call us home microbes Define our life and even our Evolution would your personality be different without all your microbes I think probably would what you get from your food be different certainly would you differ in other ways we haven about almost assuredly um and and so our existence is part of this of this complexity of [Music] life we are not alone from the moment we are born until we die we live in a delicately balanced relationship with our private Wildlife we are more than

Lyme Disease: The Hidden Epidemic | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVRfotio4YM	SLICE Science	[Music] 15 years ago, we walked here and weren bit by them. Now, we get bit almost every time. They a year. That [Music] The bacteria is spreading in the tick population. Their bite transmits the infection. would want to wake up and just be like, the whole day and now it and I still want to go back to sleep. The headaches hurt so much. I think all my neighbors could hear me yelling after 16 years of doctors telling me that um it was all in my head. No, you see a shrinker or a psychologist. You crazy. That being told. It worldwide spreading vector board epidemic. The number one. This story has a guilty party and it that carries a dangerous disease. The tick, an acarai barely a/4 in in size that transmits a terrible and largely unknown disease, Lyme borelliosis or Lyme disease. The northeastern United States is one of the regions on the planet that hardest hit. In the state of New York, Dr. Ostfeld concentrates his research on the environmental causes for the current increase in the tick population. He doesn specimens. A nymph right there. There another nymph right here. These ticks are everywhere. Um they They They one of the reasons why Lyme disease is the threat that it is. And so these nymphful ticks, the stage that we just pulled off the cloth, are responsible for the vast majority of Lyme disease cases and other tickorn diseases as well. Invulnerable and camouflaged, perched at top blades of grass, patiently lying in wait, the tick is a solitary hunter. It can wait for weeks before attaching itself to its prey. It called chellissere and a harpoon-like hipposome. The chellisser pull themselves into the skin. Then the hipposome pushes itself between them, piercing a vein and allowing the tick to nourish itself with blood. This meal can last several days. As it becomes filled with blood, the tick can grow to the size of a peanut. But this minuscule vampire is only dangerous if it combination of these villains, the tick and the bacteria, results in the propagation of Lyme disease. The tick inoculates its host with Burellia bacteria. The full name is Borrellia burapery. The inoculation occurs in the skin. A circular rash may appear in two/3 of the cases. It doesn remain constant. Often it isn seriously by a doctor or pharmacist or a family member. It insect bite and it goes untreated. If untreated, the disease evolves for several weeks in a subaccute form. Then within months or years, the disease becomes chronic. The disease will evolve in this manner for 10 or 20 years or for a lifetime if the patient remains unaware and the Lyme disease goes untreated. Several weeks of antibiotics started just after the tickbite is sufficient for eliminating the infection. But if the victim isn disease becomes very complicated. This bacteria is a veritable time bomb. It can lie dormant in the body for years. suddenly awakening when the immune system becomes weakened. Judith Alberta doesn remember being bitten by a tick. She her career, she suffered from periods of severe fatigue. But this wasn a woman who flies at 20,000 ft. Then one day the disease manifested itself. It France and becoming a flight instructor that I began having problems. I had joint pains in my back at the top of the spine in my cervical vertebrae. I had vision problems. I began having trouble speaking which created a big problem in my work as an instructor. After a while, it got so bad that I had to stop my job and leave Air France. I could no longer work. [Music] It took years before she was able to identify the source of her problem. She saw specialist after specialist, but Lyme disease was never evoked as a possibility. 37 medical visits in 10 months between June 2008 and April 2009 and no results. Ma was examined with MRIs, scanners, centigraphies, cystoscopies, and biological tests with no diagnosis. We looked everywhere and found nothing. I was told, shrink. professional understood what I had. Terrible pain and no ideas. Burning in the muscles, in the stomach, the lungs, head and eye pains, permanent burning pains. There were winters when I thought, on like this. I can this. It For the victims of Lyme disease, the incapacity to diagnose it is a terrible ordeal, and patients physical suffering is augmented by the disease official recognition. This is Lyme disease surprising paradox. Statistically quite frequent to doctors, it and often badly diagnosed. This is partly due to the very low number of specialists. To meet with one of the world we State. Dr. Horowitz opened a specialized medical center where hundreds of new patients come each month. Let within normal limits. When I came up to the Hudson Valley approximately 26 years ago, I was moving into a very highly limeemic area. I didn infections were in this area. And when I moved to this area, I was seeing patients with Lyme disease. And many of them got better, but some of them didn good for me to investigate and find out why these people were getting sick. Inflammation in a diverticulum in the colon. Okay. Um what I may want to do is they drew the bloods for you. So what symptoms for the young Aliana contracting Lyme disease was a terrible experience. Usually when it thankful when I actually came here very very thankful because when I walked in I looked horrible. Absolutely. I look like I walked into a smoke filled room. My eyes were all red. I was It would be 80° outside. It would be the summer time, 80° and everything. And I would have like four jackets on and sweatpants. I was freezing no matter where I was. It was very It was definitely a rough road. I felt I was very, very tired. Very, very tired. I would sleep all the time and after I would get up, I would still be tired. And then her cognitive issues got so bad that she had memory loss. She didn over it. She didn week. She didn before her disease was identified, some doctors proposed a curious diagnosis. I went to a pediatrician at first and she was very okay. She stomach, seeing what was, in the end, she pretty much just said it was all in my head and that I a kid and I just want drama. Unfortunately, stories like Aliana medical errors occur all around the planet, even in the United States, where the threat of Lyme disease is well identified. William lives in Maine, where he found no medical support for years. I don And that was after 16 years of symptoms of of you know, pain and muscle pain, fatigue, um bad sleep, all you know, all the the usual symptoms. Um but I after 16 years of doctors telling me that um it was all in my head you know it was all mental and I I you know and I kept on saying it I stable all my life you know it there something wrong and it took me 16 years to find a doctor that actually said okay let out what oh you lime Dr. Horowitz is one of the rare doctors able to diagnose Lyme disease in its various forms. He created a special method for doing this. Lyme disease is a multi-ymic illness. So what I do is I usually get a history from a patient and I give them a questionnaire and this questionnaire has 38 points. And if I see that a patient fills out this questionnaire and they have many different symptoms, not just joint pain, not just fatigue, but they say that they have day sweats, night sweats, and chills suggestive of besia, a malarial infection. They have fatigue that comes and goes with good and bad days. They have joint pain and muscle pain that migrates around the body. One day it in one place, three days later it another place in their body. They have tingling, numbness, and burning that comes and goes and migrates around the body. They have memory and concentration problems and they shouldn type of symptoms and they say, sensitive to light. I have sound sensitivity. I can night or I keep waking up. I I\\ Those symptoms are the multi-ymic symptoms of Lyme disease and that would make one suspect. It combination of complex treatments that patients feel an improvement. Yet, even after 20 years of practice, the doctor and his assistants are still searching for new answers. When you see somebody walk in originally who can barely walk, is non-communicative because they have partial paralysis in their face and they can six months later they they You understand them and you can enjoy this, you know, which is nice. And then of course something triggers it. And then six months later they back in and they can barely walk and they can barely talk again. That sad part. In the United States, a great deal of attention is given to tickorn diseases because they as a health danger for a very long time. For centuries, native Indians avoided traveling through certain valleys during autumn and spring, the period when ticks are in abundance. They saw that those who were bitten could fall ill with an incurable disease. In 1972, in the little city of Lime in Connecticut, an epidemic of a strange arthritic condition struck the youth and the young children. No one at the time thought of a bacterial disease. At the time, it was thought that antibiotics could kill off all infectious diseases. The mysterious disease gets the name Lyme disease. It wasn scientist Willie Bergdorfer established the link between ticks and the transmission of the Borellia bacteria to humans. Brellia is not an ordinary bacteria. It change its appearance. It can move rapidly, infiltrate all of the body tissues and bones. This tiny spiral organism is a formidable enemy for researchers. At Connecticut University, Professor Ava Sappy directs a research laboratory dedicated to studying the Borrellia bacteria and its mysteries. SRNA gene of Burelia. It interesting because Dr. Border discovered Borelia practically 30 years ago and here we are we still having uh issues how to cure those lime disease patient how to eliminate boralia. So whether whether we we didn right question the last 30 years or just the borelia is way too smart and we really have to fully understand to completely eradicate this organism. So borelia can take uh multiple forms. The three venom forms are spyro heat, the cyst or round body form and the bofilm form. Bofilm for example is a very special form. Think about a shelter or even even even a city. So when when it is attacked by immune system or some antimicrobials, it can hide from from it. It problem is it knows how to change form and to hide in the body. It goes inside the cells where it hides. It creates blebs, pieces of DNA like decoys which go out and your immune system goes after the DNA. But the bug is hiding inside your cells and your cells become a target for the immune system with an autoimmune type reaction. And it even exists in places where antibiotics do not penetrate well. If it goes deep in the joints, deep into the eye, deep into the gleal tissues of the brain, antibiotics do not penetrate well in these areas to kill it off. So it bacteria is extremely clever. It has more DNA than any other bacteria on the face of the planet. [Music] a bacteria that with the complicity of the host tick, it propagates unhindered. In the US, 2013 health statistics recorded 10 times more cases of Lyme disease than the previous year. That translates into 300,000 new cases per year. This is a spreading epidemic. I visited Europe. I I England. I was in Belgium. We are seeing a worldwide epidemic. Um, including two, three years ago, I was invited by the Chinese government to come to China. They were having a problem with Lyme disease there. So, this is a worldwide problem that we really need to pay attention to. The epidemic developed out of two principal territories, the United States and a second zone in Eastern Europe stretching to Asia. Today, new propagation zones and new strains of this bacteria are being discovered in Africa. Some French researchers who came here to study malaria have shed new light on the importance of Lyme disease or Lyme borelliosis. They found it in about 10 countries in northern and western Africa. Here we Dhakar, in the village of Dmo. For over 20 years, we malaria in the region, but in addition, we pathologies present. The number two disease just behind malaria is borelliosis. Some years, we to one quarter of the village population infected with Lyme disease. And it malaria. Sometimes it type of malaria that medication. Yet the illness is actually something quite different. It burelliosis, a bacterial disease that has spread widely throughout Africa. Thanks to Dr. traps team. The entire village has a new awareness of the dangers of this disease. The chief is explaining what he thinks of Lyme disease. For him, lime borelliosis is similar to malaria, but he feels it dangerous because with lime, you get a strong fever and you feel like your bones are going to break on the inside. Reinforced surveillance combined with good prevention techniques help to control the effects of the infection once it appears. Every day we visit different villages to see who has fallen ill. We take the children each time that we find the symptoms. We ask that they fill out a questionnaire and we also take a biological test to better understand Lyme disease proliferation. The doctor has his special method. He places traps not for catching ticks but for catching rodents. Because though the tick is the arm that commits the crime, the true guilty one is the rodent. These mammals are the initial reservoirs for the borellia bacteria. And though rodents don disease, they transmit it. One of these mammals can carry 100 ticks and contaminate them with the burellia bacteria. Later, when the tick nourishes itself with the blood from a vertebrate, such as a human, it transmits the infection. Last night, we captured 11 specimens of four different species. One is a gerbiliscus and we have two species of masttomse. We will test their blood and then make some other more detailed tests to analyze in the laboratory and see if they And these rodents carrying their cargo of ticks can often infiltrate into homes. The little girl just examined by Dr. Trap was certainly infected in her bedroom. [Music] It seems the treatment is working. She antibiotics. Now, normally she should be cured. We in the home and in the bedrooms because the rodent population is very high in the fields and in the forest, but they are also very present in homes where they find plenty to eat. [Music] Here we have an active nest. It masttomies. They There are certainly ticks inside. The person sleeping in this bed was bitten last week and contracted borelliosis. Here explanation why. The metose nest is next to the bed. So the ticks certainly got into the bed attracted by the sleeping person and they transmitted Lyme disease to the person. About 30 to 40% of ticks in this region are infected with boreliosis. There we can clean it out now. The rodent was captured with its passengers but many ticks still remain in the burrow. The vacuum cleaner will be used to clean them out. Some of them are full of blood. The time has come for harvesting the ticks. They the rodents. After being collected, Dr. Trap will test their level of contamination. Around the world, the growing danger from the spread of Lyme disease is far from understood. The dangerous triangle bacteria rodent tick is progressing on a very open road. One reason for this is that the forests have become more and more split up eliminating many of the contaminated rodents natural predators. High numbers of rodents means more ticks and a higher risk of the spread of Lyme disease. Shake the mouse into a bag so that I count the ticks. collect data before letting it go. Doesn moved. She does have some ticks. Three laral ticks. This mouse will transmit Lyme disease to about 90% of the ticks that feed on it. Many people ask, well, if the mice are so bad, if they us so many diseases, why don get rid of them? Um, and it is that it of them. They are such a resilient animal. B4316. So, when we protect diversity, we have things like foxes, owls, um, even raccoons and skunks will prey on mice. And when that happens, we can actually see a reduced mouse population, which is also protective of human health. We same time. On the one hand, we risk worse by chopping up the forest into little bits. And then if we place our homes right next to those little bits of forest, that scenario for high Lyme disease. And that And Europe is not free of [Music] risk. Few European countries are fully conscious of the danger of Lyme disease. But in Germany, the menace is being taken very seriously. Here, information on the fight against ticks is displayed in every pharmacy. Yes, we know there get bitten by a tick. We know it must be removed as soon as it of epidemic. We ill. This region is near the Ryan River, the Black Forest, the Voge, and the tick population is high here, and they transmitting the disease, especially boreliosis or Lyme disease. No country in the world counts the number of people infected with boreliosis. But in Germany, we see statistics that indicate we have an epidemic. Each year, the number of infected people increases by 10 to 15%. Estimations are that 1 to two million people in Germany are infected. For 80 million inhabitants, that in 80. In neighboring France, there official discussion of the epidemic. On the contrary, Lyme disease is officially categorized as a rare disease, but the number of infected victims is higher than believed. For this family doctor in Alsace, this affair could be called a case of medical denial. It family practice like mine, we see hundreds of cases. Those types of numbers mean it not a rare disease. And if you look at the statistics in Germany, you have to wonder why there with France. A few kilometers away, they report 200 times more cases than here in France. Is the Ryan River stopping Lyme disease like they said it stopped Chernobyl [Music] Why would France not measure the full impact of the spread of Lyme disease? It may be hard to believe, but Professor Peron thinks that the state approved system for detecting Lyme disease produces lower numbers than the true count of infected people. The problem today in testing for Lyme disease is that 30 years ago it was officially classified as a rare disease. So now the testing protocol is such that we can never conduct tests on over 5% of people who come up positive in a given population. They have created a ceiling for testing. In my own experience with some patients, I have seen that the same individual who gets tested in different regions on the same day or same week can get different results. In other words, a patient considered non-infected in one region would get a positive result in another region because the test sensitivity varies from one region to another. In addition, there are the scientific uncertainties. Today, some are calling into question the accuracy of the test. The Eliza test is not very sensitive. It literature. It has a sensitivity of about 55 56%. This is John Hopkins University who says sensibility 55%. It United States, patients are being informed of the tests lack of accuracy. Despite the fact that the tests lack reliability, they are nonetheless the required protocol in most industrialized countries based on the norm established in the United States in 2006. Today, we isn What we authority which is objective and that creates a valid treatment protocol. What we have today is a political situation. We remain in our laboratory at our local level and we do what we feel is the best practice. But we don agreement. We don consensus nor an agreed upon practice that can put our minds to rest. We need a very clear scientific consensus, not a consensus of denial. Is it a deliberate strategy, a lack of political engagement, or simply a laxist attitude? What is certain is that health officials are maintaining an unclear system. And the scientific debate doesn not even in agreement on the form of Lyme disease. Can it become chronic? Does it evolve? Should treatment be punctual or long-term? Officially, France Reference Center recommends 3 weeks of antibiotics with the possibility of one 3-week extension. For those following official state doctrine, no chronic form of Lyme disease exists today. It disease to be considered as a chronic illness. It can result in some physical after effects, probably in the joints. That disease. After a certain period of time, the microbe is dead and the disease is done. Yet, the microbe can cause some lasting effects. That things. According to our expert in New York, the opposite is true. He believes that punctual treatment doesn deliver results. The fight against bacteria can be long-term. There are many diseases in medicine. Uh leprosy with tuberc treat for years. So it antibiotics long term. When I treat, I usually don like with tuberculosis, I combine antibiotics. If you understand the biology of the organism, you have to combine the treatments. And that is how I have some of my success. If the disease is so resistant, it because Burellia bacteria has many allies. Often the tick transmits an entire battalion of infectious agents. And some experts think the persistent symptoms are the result of this cocktail of pathogens. Ticks are like little crawling syringes capable of inoculating a person with a large variety of microbes. I read an article that said ticks are a menagerie of microbes because they carry so many microbes, parasites, and viruses. They are not all dangerous to humans nor to animals, but some of them are a threat to us. First of all, our co- infection rate were extremely high. It we had hard time publish the data. We also find novel organisms such as micropopplasma and farial limatos. But again, because it we still having very hard time to publish and convince people that it real. The ticks are containing multiple infections. With one bite, you can get erlia, anoplasma, besia, tickborn and sephilitis viruses, bartinella. You can get all these different organisms and it overwhelms the immune system. So your immune system can these organisms at once and it becomes overstimulated and what happens with an overstimulated immune system is you get autoimmunity. So your immunity in some cases goes down but in some cases it gets overstimulated. Actually it can happen at the same time. All of these inflammatory cytoines, these molecules that cause inflammation, it causes the joint pain and the swelling and the memory problems and the pain and the fatigue. Once you hit the infections and you lower the inflammation and you balance the immune system, people get better. So I call this the three eyes for chronic disease. You must treat infection, inflammation, and immune dysfunction. [Music] After years of suffering from a disease with no name, Judith finally received the benefits of a prescription that was both complex and exceptional. I began flying again in January 2011. After 3/4 of my treatment period, which was initially an alternative treatment, followed by an alopathic treatment with very strong doses of antibiotics. They helped me get back on my feet, get my spirit back, and my energy increased. I was in good health again. I could pilot again. [Music] Though Judith now feels better, the disease still weighs heavily on Joanna. Her life these past seven years has been punctuated by regular visits to Professor Peron, head of the infectious disease unit at Gar Hospital on the outskirts of Paris. I chest pains. No. No. Joanna active woman in great physical shape. She likes sports, has lots of projects, her family and children, work, etc. And after a walk in the forest, her life becomes completely different and difficult. It very hard. A tick bite doesn dangerous. And I looked again at her medical file with the photo of the rash mark on her thigh. At the time, her doctor said it was nothing to worry about. Then soon after she became very tired. She had bad headaches, pains in her joints, and she had difficulty walking. About two months later, she came in and saw one of our assistants because she had no idea what could be affecting her in this way. Joanna is a primary school teacher. Her passion is teaching children to read and write, but Lyme disease has changed her life, making even simple things a constant effort. She memory. To adapt, she [Music] I have to put my medicine out in front of me on the table every day. I have to place things in front of me. I have to use postits to remind myself of things to do. But it forget that I wrote something on a postit. and I don attention span. I have big problems with concentration. Over time, Joanna thanks once again to a long-term treatment. After 7 months of treatment, I felt better for about five minutes. It didn being bad, but I had the five minutes. 10 minutes the next day, then 10 hours the next day. After that, things began getting better. Science Lyme disease has only just begun. The world over, researchers are working on new paths for research. Diagnosis, tests, vaccines, stem cells, genetics, treatments with plants. The medical offensive against this protein disease has branched out. But in France, research is still in its infancy. It advance when there invested in it. For the moment, the pharmaceutical industry is showing little interest in Lyme research because we antibiotics like penicellin and tetracycline, which are very cheap and can be sold in generic form. From the industry disease surrounded by a complicated pmic. They don their eventual investment. We We scientifically, but we don budget. The priority is to find sufficient financing for research. And as research continues looking for a miracle cure, Judith is carrying on her own personal fight. She wrote a book about her personal struggle with Lyme disease. And two years ago with doctors and other victims, she founded Lyme without borders, an association whose goal is to defend all those who are being ignored by health professionals and push authorities to finally acknowledge the scale of the epidemic. And her efforts have definitely garnered results. In 18 months, I have answered 18,000 emails and 18,000 phone calls. People tell me of their terrible state of distress. We are able to direct people to qualified doctors who are trained in the latest methods for fighting Lyme disease. We can listen to their stories and put them in contact with other members in our association. If they need it, we can recommend legal professionals to help them with legal actions. For example, when their illness is being denied by professionals or if they lose their job because of Lyme disease. Once a year in Strawburg, Judith organizes a colloquium that allows patients and doctors to keep up to date on progress in research. Patient groups like this one are fighting to get French authorities to authorize long-term and alternative treatments for chronic cases. I had 3 weeks of antibiotics in the hospital. I got out and I continued them at home. I asked what sort of follow-up treatment I would get. I was told there was none. That surprised me. But after two years of struggling with this, nothing surprises me anymore. This situation is very disturbing. It means that if at the end of the treatment you disease, you Unfortunately, I feel the situation is so complicated that one must consider looking elsewhere, even going abroad to get treated correctly. To hear the opinions of top experts, the association calls upon doctors from the world over. Dr. Horowitz from New York has come to speak. He clear that Lyme disease with its many symptoms demands a new and revolutionary treatment protocol. Patients come to me saying that they they still don do. It have a pain in my foot. I have 16 nails in my foot. And the doctor takes out two nails. The patient comes back again and says, I still have pain. and 14 nails in my foot. The doctor responds, but I took out two. The patient says, still have 14 nails. positive message. They said, possible to live very well with Lyme disease. Even if one can it. factual way about elements that are divergent from France vision of the illness. They brought practical information that we conference has helped to filter the mass of relevant information so people no longer feel lost and unable to act in the face of all this information. The association also helps patients fight for recognition through legal channels. Lyme disease often keeps victims from being able to hold a steady job. So much needs to be done to keep victims physical suffering from being compounded by financial difficulties. I was getting workers compensation for 3 years. Then I had to see an insurance doctor. He told me that I was 100% capable of working. He didn take my symptoms into account despite the results I had from the German tests I statement from a French neurologist that said, have chronic fatigue. visit lasted only 5 minutes and there was nothing polite about it. I was told, work. compensation has been stopped, and I have no revenue to live on. Those who are ill often find themselves abandoned by their doctors and by the national health insurance which demands that a doctor provide a date when the patient can start their job again. But this is not always possible in reality as the disease is chronic and Lyme disease makes the victim an invalid to a certain degree. We recognition of the degree of invalidity and also recognition that the patient can recognition would allow the victim to get their workers compensation. Then they can continue to seek the best treatment because unfortunately gaining access to the right treatment is not easy for everyone and it free. If on the one hand the ill are often abandoned. On the other hand, doctors and biologists who come to their aid and who stray from official practices are victims of a worldwide witch hunt. There are doctors who are treating patients with protocols outside the officially approved methods. These new methods have been officially approved in the United States in Germany by experts who are just as competent and scientific as those who wrote the guidelines. The doctors here who practice these new methods are often pursued by the National Medical Council, which tries to keep doctors from treating Lyme disease in new ways they feel are best. [Music] Judith has made her life defense and aid of lime victims. But she isn be marching in the street. In France, in Europe, and around the globe, protests are being organized. [Music] In 2013, the very first Lyme disease awareness day saw tens of thousands of protesters gather from Vancouver to Warsaw, from Melbourne to Stockholm. If the illness is protein, then the combat must be the same. Together with other victims, Jeanv Pllo founded the Burelliosis Network. Her objective is to clarify the mass of information being published on Lyme disease, much of which is contradictory. Jev suffers from a neurological form of the disease, neurobelliosis, paralysis, speech problems. Jeanviev is combating as best she can with what little force she still has. Between them they call their disease neurob. In our boreliosis network we are all neurobbe meaning that we are not able to hold a long-term job and carry on an effort in the long term because we must fight. This is why we have said we will go forward in a soft way. We will struggle softly to win a fight that we can way. We can table. Sometimes we can So, it trying to move things forward. One priority is making sure residents living in the mountains around her home are finally informed of the danger from [Music] ticks. There is no information signaling even a minimum alert. Nothing posted inarmacies, nothing on trails, in the forest, in holiday campgrounds, nothing is posted on panels, for example, to alert people about tick infestations. This is because it upsets the hotels, the restaurants, all those involved in mountain tourism. It the town council that a panel must be put up to inform tourists of the danger of ticks. A panel that says, there are ticks in the area. the baker won here because there are no tourists. It because if nothing can be said about the ticks, where are we heading? It angry. Why is there no information in all of thearmacies? Why has the government not put an information campaign into place with big panels, with loudspeakers, in doctor regions? Why is there no information campaign for doctors? Because we know that the ticks are everywhere. They all around. [Music] It countries, in France practically no information is available about ticks. The map for hikers, forbidden behavior, and fire risks are written in black and white. But there no mention of ticks and Lyme disease. One of France panels is here. It Sar near Paris. It installed with the help from her local town council. If I became ill, I would not be ill like this today. I had no idea that the disease existed. Back when I was bitten by the tick, I had never heard of Lyme disease. And the information would have helped to shorten the time needed by doctors to diagnose my illness. I would have begun my treatment earlier. I would have been in better health because of that. So, this information is definitely needed and it visitors a year walk in this forest. Among the surrounding villages, only Yer considered it important enough to inform visitors of the danger of contamination from ticks. Yet, the precautions to take are very simple. The day I was bitten, it was May 1st and it was cold. I wore jeans and tall boots. Yet, the tick climbed up my leg to my [Music] waist. If I had had the information, I would have tucked my pants into my socks and I protected from the tick bite. Pull up socks. Avoid going into tall grass. Wear clothing that covers your skin. Use repellents. Search for ticks on your skin after your hike. If you have a tick, remove it with tweezers or a tick twister, but never with your fingers. [Music] These are such simple methods when you consider the tragedy of chronic Lyme disease. The methods are essential as long as the disease and its mechanisms remain a mystery. Is Lyme disease really a rare disease? Why are officials imposing a test for the disease which is considered non-effective? Why not authorize long-term treatments if, as some claim, the disease can become chronic? And finally, in the face of scientific uncertainty, why is research so under financed? [Music] This story is right out of a modern medical thriller. Who profits from lime being so neglected? Who profits from patients not being treated? Some suggest that it the pharmaceutical industry. If people remain ill, they can profit from selling long-term treatments. But that sounds simplistic to me. I don the reason or if what we just a form of general immobilism. Why the lack of progress? Is it because of a conflict of interests, of egos, or of power struggles? I don know. But the situation in France is so much more complicated than elsewhere. But I think what we need to do is we need to create chronic disease centers. And you train the doctors just like you neurology. You train them in chronic disease medicine. Research into Lyme disease is still at its early stages, but the threat of Lyme disease is growing. For health authorities and scientists, this is a veritable race for a solution. It but only if the urgent need for a solution is finally recognized. [Music] [Music]	Success
Acid Oceans: A Fight to Save Marine Life | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYBIJJnEcmw	SLICE Science	[Music] It covers more than 2/3 of our planet and is essential to life on Earth. But now the ocean is fundamentally changing in ways we never expected. What dioxide in the atmosphere is going into the ocean at least 100 times faster than any time in tens of millions of years. The problem is not just global warming. Instead, the water itself is being radically transformed and becoming more acidic. For many sea creatures, it lethal recipe. What majority of life in the ocean? They can move. They can adapt or unfortunately they die. On the front lines of the battle, coral reefs. These spectacular natural sites could be among the first victims. Unless the creatures that live here can somehow adapt. In a remote part of the world, one reef may hold the key to the future. We really hit a jackpot. This is such a scientific gold mine like nowhere else in the world. Can these scientists crack the code of a rapidly changing ocean before it late? We chemistry of our oceans, which we don know the answer [Music] to. America on the oyster trade for well over a century. It and the lifeblood for many small coastal towns. [Music] Every day, boats scour the bottom of this bay, harvesting oysters that are grown commercially from sea by farmers like Mark [Music] Wart. His hatchery depends on seaater pumped from the bay to produce baby oysters known as lavi. business was booming until a few years ago. We first noticed a real solid change in 2007. We actually could not produce any larve at all. Uh and that definitely gets your attention. All of the larve in the whole place were pink. They were not feeding. They looked terrible. We just knew they were all going to die. Mark and his wife Sue struggled for months to grow little oysters. We saw behavior in the larve that we never seen before. They would circle around and then just kind of lay on the bottom. We call them lazy larve. They actually dissolve in the water and we didn This is a magnified image of a healthy one-day old oyster. It its shell. And this is what Sue was seeing in her microscope. The shell is deformed and pitted. The problem was not with the oysters, but with the pumped seawater. It was too corrosive for the baby shellfish. I think the initial reaction from a lot of people was, of the water. That to be a problem. pH was dropping too low. PH is a standard measurement for levels of acidity in a liquid. The lower the pH, the higher the acidity. It turned out the water from the bay was a staggering six times more acidic than normal seawater. The baby oysters couldn handle it. What we chemistry of the water is it everything. If the chemistry is not right, the larve can die. Uh they can stop eating. they can stop growing. Basically, you larvi. With the mystery solved, the hatchery has found a temporary solution to the problem. Common baking soda raises the pH back to 8.1, the normal pH level for seawater, and keeps it constant. But this can entire ocean. We pump 75 to 100,000 gallons a day and that seawater. And there water the larvy like that I that I don even know about that, you know, mother nature provides. So, how do you duplicate what they like? It very tough question. [Music] Oceans everywhere are becoming more acidic due to increasing carbon dioxide emissions over the past 200 years. Oceanographers knew for years that carbon dioxide from the atmosphere was absorbing into the oceans and everyone thought, ocean is performing for us, storing the gas that we pollutant. It activities. And so everyone thought, But scientists soon realized that this service comes at a cost. The extra CO2 absorbed by the ocean is dramatically changing the water chemistry. We metric tons of carbon dioxide into the surface of the ocean each and every day. And that is what or increasing the acidity. When carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater, it forms a dilute acid that lowers the pH and drives up acidity. This chemical change is known as ocean acidification. You put carbon dioxide in the ocean, it produces carbonic acid. That carbonic acid takes away essentially the building blocks of what plants and animals use to make calcium carbonate, making it more difficult for these animals and plants to secrete a calcium carbonate [Music] shell. Scientists now face an urgent challenge to understand what this will mean for life in the sea. Much of their focus falls on coral [Music] reefs. They are the rainforests of the sea and also the most vulnerable to environmental [Music] change. Coral reefs occupy less than 1% of the ocean yet provide a home for at least a quarter of all marine species. They take many years to grow and these reefs made out of limestone or calcium carbonate are now thousands of years old. How will ocean acidity affect them? Coals are incredibly sensitive to high carbon dioxide conditions because they out of limestone and lime and stone and acid just don Dr. Katarina Ferrris from the Australian Institute of Marine Science has spent a lifetime diving on some of the world most pristine reefs. She threat. This is one of the most amazing ecosystems in the world and and seeing them degrading over time is just a real shame. It responsibility for us to to protect the reefs for our children and our grandchildren. Katarina is determined to establish the fate of coral reefs. She scientific mission to remote Papa New Guinea to study the impact of low pH or high acidity on coral reef ecosystems. with her. A team of experts have assembled from around the world. They have just 14 days and they the most remarkable field sites in international marine science. Its unique qualities have aroused much excitement amongst the scientific community. site is a straight stretch on the reef flat. Here you bubbles from the surface. Set amongst the volcanic islands of Mil Bay lies one reef that Katarina found by accident more than a decade [Music] ago. It was just so [Music] exciting. You see the bubbles touching the corals and the corals are not discolored. So, we know the bubbles are not toxic to the corals. These gases bubbling up through the sea floor are caused by volcanic activity in the Earth [Music] crust. Samples revealed it was pure carbon dioxide, which was lowering the water pH and making it more acidic. and realized maybe we can use that as a natural laboratory to investigate how emerging CO2 and high carbon dioxide levels are changing the conditions for the corals. So I thought bingo that it. We got to go back. [Music] We are going to the site Illy I bubble site we her team are now into their fourth year of study at the only naturally acidic coral reef site in the world. My hope is very high that these guys here are cracking it and producing the worldass science that is so needed to understand ocean acidification. [Music] So I probably first jump in and have a look around. Dr. Leticia Plants, a fellow at the Smithsonian, has surveyed coral reefs all over the world, but it her first time in Papua New Guinea. She might be affecting the biodiversity of the small reef dwelling creatures. Well, the plan is actually to have my first look at this amazing bubbly site. So, I know really what to expect. [Music] The bubbles emerging from the cracks in the shallow seafloor are known as [Music] seeps. They in a constant source of carbon dioxide for nearly a century. The water chemistry here is now identical to what of the ocean in 60 to 80 years [Music] time. Only a few coral species now grow in this almost lunar landscape. These super tolerant corals are called parietes. They have large thick skins and now dominate the reef. The colorful branching corals and soft corals that are abundant in most coral reefs are gone. In this area alone, coral diversity has been reduced by nearly 40%. And even the tough parietes are showing signs of wear and tear in the high acidity. It the very intense sea how the landscape totally changes and the reef loses its color, loses its fish and actually at some point there was only sand and nothing was living around it. For Katarina, the conditions here are a snapshot of what will happen to coral reefs around the world if carbon emissions continue to rise. At the most intense sees we are probably looking into the next century like 2,100 corre cannot grow any longer and we call it a death zone. It and sponges left and what we seeing is the structural corals are all missing in the high CO2 [Music] world. The condition of this coral is poor. But just 50 m away from the bubbling vents, the reef starts to [Music] improve. By 100 m away, the reefs are some of the richest on the [Music] planet. The coral gardens of Papa New Guinea are famous for their biodiversity. and are home to more than 500 species of [Music] coral and hundreds of thousands of tiny creatures. Much of this could be lost as the ocean acidifies. Everything is a balance in the ocean. The reef is made of calcifying organisms. So that means they need higher pH to be able to build their skeleton. And this skeleton then provides the structure of the reef where all the other associated species can find shelter and they can mate and they can feed and they can hide in that structure. When the pH is lower, this structure starts to dissolve. With just two weeks to get the work done, the team gets started. Each of us is focusing on two or three different projects. I conditions for corals is changing. That is stuff we cannot do in the laboratory. Here, hopefully some organisms have gotten used to the high carbon dioxide concentrations, which would be a good thing because it would tell us that maybe there is a future for coral reefs after all. There are two study sites 200 m apart. These will be cross referenced. This is the control site where the conditions and pH of the water are normal. And this is the center of the high acidity bubble site. Girls are actually animals, but they glued to the ground like a plant is. They move to another side if the conditions is no good for them. So, they need well lit clear waters, no competition with algae. And if all of those conditions are are okay, then you find coral reefs like you do here. [Music] The study sites are busy. The scientists have the latest high-tech instruments to measure water temperature, currents, and pH. The experiments will aim to discover how corals are coping in these more acidic waters. Which ones are doing well and which ones have disappeared? Do corals grow faster or slower in the high acidity. To test this out, the team collects corals far away from the high CO2 bubbles where the conditions are normal. So the idea first is to get colonies, split them in half. Half goes into high CO2 areas and half into the control sites. This is all one organism but like a plant having individual leaves. Um the corals have individual polyp that are feeding separately from each other. They can share the food but each polip can respond to the plankton touching its tentacles and grabbing it. Once they spreading the juices across the colony. While Katarina studies the impact of high acidity on living coral, Leticia looks at what happens after they die. I coral head, a nice dead coral head in a low pH location. Living coral heads provide homes for tiny fish and many other species. Once they die, their calcium carbonate structure remains. And just like a dead tree, new creatures move [Music] in. Laticia wants to compare what living in these dead coral heads from both the control and the high CO2 bubble [Music] sites. The first thing that I notice with this coral head is that it covered with this type of algae. And the problem really is that this type of algae does not hold much diversity, which I where the pH is is much higher. One predicted outcome for a more acidic ocean is a drop in species diversity and an increase in algae or seaweed living on the reef. Although this chunk of coral is now dead, inside it are many living things. I the mlllesk. And here is a little ofurid trying to escape. Another se cucumber I think here. All part of the food chain. And if you miss a link in the chain, the rest of the chain can on. So yes, all those little pretty insignificant species are extremely important. Laticia is taking DNA samples which will be analyzed later to see what differences exist amongst the myriad of small creatures at both sites. We use DNA because it traditional method that are based on studying all the morphology, the color pattern, all the features of the species. The team works around the clock in all kinds of weather. [Music] Some days nothing goes to plan. I think that some problem is one of the generators with one of the exhaust pipes had a bit of a breakdown. [Music] Underwater conditions are difficult. This site we have massive rocks, so it really hard to drill inside the structure. We managed to attach three out of six. And even the coral experiments have become dinner for some hungry snails. At least 50% of little coral branches we made had been eaten by these snails. Yeah. Not happy. We are very limited in time. Experiments by nature quite often fail. It But eventually we we same questions. Science is pretty much like a detective story. We want to know why are certain organisms quite happy and abundant at the high CO2 sites and why others are missing. This isn undergone major environmental change. When you look back in time, there are periods where there was a sudden change in environment and 90% of species went extinct. And these are referred to mass extinction events. And there four of them seem to be associated with a rise of CO2, possibly from volcanic activity. Fossil records show that when there were spikes in carbon dioxide, the Earth climate changed and coral reefs disappeared for millions of years. The most famous extinction was 65 million years ago when the dinosaurs disappeared. [Music] But 250 million years ago, 96% of all marine life died when the Peran era ended. And whilst it remains unclear what caused the increase in carbon dioxide, it is clear it led to global warming, a dramatic drop in oxygen, and ocean acidification. It took millions of years before coral reefs returned and new marine species evolved. Many people talk about us entering now the sixth mass extinction and I think in many ways they things actually faster than in the past. More atmospheric carbon dioxide is now going into the ocean than at any time in the last tens of millions of years. [Music] the rate of change is happening much much faster than these plants and these animals can adapt. You can coral reefs and you know have all the different resident species say okay well I instead unless it happens on a much much slower rate evolution will not have an opportunity to keep up with change. It jeopardy. Cold water absorbs more carbon dioxide, so the Arctic and Antarctic seas will become acidic more quickly. What that also rely on calcium carbonate to build their shells and skeletons. On a cold winter Swedish fjord, a million dollar experiment is underway. Giant test tubes the size of a twostory house are being lowered into the water, sealed, and then pumped with carbon dioxide to mimic future conditions. The big question we have here is, is our planet now changing so rapidly that organisms will not be able to adapt? Particularly in terms of ocean acidification, we have no records from the past how fast adaptation can go for this. After 5 months in the sea, results reveal that the main creatures thriving in the high CO2 are minuscule plants called picoplankton. Sadly, these hungry microbes gobble up critical nutrients that are normally available to larger plankton species that in turn provide food for fish. As a result, they alter the food chain. Aboard the Aurora Australas, the Australian Antarctic Division vessel, scientists are also studying tiny plankton, some the size of a pin head. So, we get to throw that back over the side. Dr. Donna Roberts has spent much of her working life in the Southern Ocean. If you took a drop of water from the Southern Ocean, there are millions of life forms in it. And you might think, well, so what? Why do I care about a Southern Ocean microbe? Well, actually, if you breathe or if you eat, you should care about a Southern Ocean microbe because there cockalith that shell that we second breath you take is produced from sea plants. [Music] Cockalithophores are vulnerable as they have a shell and as well as producing oxygen. These miniature plants have another important job. When they make their intricate calcium carbonate shells, they are contributing to the global carbon cycle. Without these tiny calcifiers, less CO2 would be transported to the deep ocean, leaving more of it in the atmosphere. Donna terrapods. These tiny, almost transparent sea snails swarm in vast numbers in the southern ocean, feeding whales, fish, and ultimately us. The terrapod shells are gorgeous. It like a garden snail, but instead of having one slimy foot, it live in the ocean with wings. Scientists call terrapods the potato chips of the sea because they and a lot of things eat them, but they [Music] [Music] crunch. Tucked away in this cold room at the University of Tasmania are terapod samples from Antarctica. They date back to 1997. Donna shell weight to see if rising acidity has affected them. It does matter if a little organism is losing weight because it measure of how healthy they are. So if their shells become thin, then they going to put more of their energy towards building what little shell they can than reproducing. Terrapod shells collected today are 35% smaller and more fragile than those caught a decade ago. Yet another sign of rising ocean acidity. This is a healthy set of shells that we collected in 2002. And I you for comparison what unhealthy shells look like. So you can see this one here has lost a segment of shell and this one here is incredibly thin, very paper thin. Shells like this often fall apart in my hand when I them. Like the baby oysters, scientists say there the levels of carbon dioxide will be too great for these beautiful little sea butterflies. Most people have not heard of what a terrapod is, but they are vastly important. They entire Southern Ocean food web in [Music] places. Thousands of plankton species like terrapods feed fish across the world from the poles to the tropics. If they disappear, not only will fish be in trouble, but so will every other species that depends on them for food. [Music] 500 million people rely on coral reefs for their survival. Few have any idea how rising acidity will affect the fish living [Music] here. Back in Papa New Guinea, fish eiccologist Dr. Danielle Dixon from the School of Biology at the Georgia Institute of Technology is on an urgent mission. In the final week left of the expedition, she team. Until now, she fish in the laboratory. It way because you can really control it. I know that I ocean acidification on the sensory system or their auditory system or just their general behavior. But the thing about this location that makes it really, really interesting is that these fish have been living in this CO2 situation for a very long time. You can see where the CO2 there. Yeah. So that and the controls up here. You can just see working with Danielle is Professor Philip Monday from James Cork University. They together for 5 years now. So if you want to run when they treated fish with high CO2 in the laboratory, the results were alarming. This time the impact was not on the fish skeleton, but on key survival instincts. What we do see that a changes in their behavior. So things like how they respond to chemical cues in the water changes. Their preference for turning left or right in the tank changes. Uh their response to sound changes. And what that we can come to these seeps. We can see fish that have probably been living for months, maybe even years under high CO2 environment and see if their behavior is still affected. [Applause] Danielle will compare the behavior of the fish living both near and far from the high CO2 [Music] bubbles. First, she of smell. Baby fish in particular have very good noses. It face, but they have nostrils and water comes in and there inside the nostril and then water goes back out very much the same as we do. Smell is critical for raw fish. They use it to catch food, find their way home, and even to sense danger. [Music] There that produce a lot of smell. The corals themselves indicate habitat for small fish, but they chemical cues. There water that are trying to feed. There prey in the water that things are trying to feed on. Pretty much everything has uses chemistry underwater. So, uh, yeah, reefs would be a pretty smelly place. Before they can start, the team must collect some fish. They little bit of clove oil and then you can use your hand to waft them out of the coral. Grab them in a net. Next, they must catch a predator fish. I that. Dr. Jodie Rama is a fish physiologist. She studies how fish have evolved and are adapting to be better athletes in their environment. So, I got a fish. Just as on land, where animals can identify the presence of predators by their smell, the same occurs underwater with fish. This fish is going to be used to make predator odor. I soak it in some water and then the cues from the fish will come out in the water and I see if they can identify the predator cues over other cues. Danielle sets up an unusual experiment. Water with the predator odor is being pumped into the top side of the flume. The bottom side has normal offshore seawater. [Music] So the fish that we have in the flume right now is taken from the control reef where no CO2 bubbles are happening. The fish identifies the predator through smell alone and stays in the offshore water side where no predator smell is. The next fish has grown up in the more acidic waters of the CO2 bubble site. Now the fish is sitting in the water that has the predator scent. We found that the CO2 is affecting the fish identify the smell of a predator. But if something it as a bad thing. It the smell. Danielle tests dozens of fish, and the results are worrying. The higher acidity seems to be scrambling the fish its behavior and chances of survival. As the fish team continue their tests, Katarina looks at why there are so few young corals at the high CO2 site. 14 months ago, she placed over 100 blank tiles at her study sites, just in time for the annual coral spawning. [Music] This is one of the greatest natural events on [Music] Earth. The corals synchronize with the lunar cycles and each other, releasing billions of eggs and sperm, often on the same night. [Music] Within a few days, the tiny coral lavi must find the right place to call home. Will these baby corals settle on Katarina tiles? Now she [Music] the first tiles are from the control site. They color is coral and algae, which are really important for the health of the reefs. This pink algae is the cement of the reef. Young corals are genetically programmed to zero in on it as it provides a strong foundation for their growth. But it and will dissolve even faster than the corals if the pH drops too low. Katarina now moves to the high acidity bubble site. It takes hours to see exactly what growing on the tiles. The ones from the control site, where acidity is low, have cultivated a healthy batch of young corals. The tiles from the control site already have got a fair number of large coral colonies established. Baby coral settled on the edge here is growing quite happily. So that coraline algae here. The pink stuff. There sitting here right at the edge. I found up to 19 coral settlers on this very small space. Not all of them will survive, but still it the coral reefs to establish. The tiles from the high CO2 bubble site tell a different story. We found hardly any coral recruits on them. There algae. We getting a lot of seaweed that are occupying the space for coral to settle. The fact that there are so few coral recruits is of real concern. I didn stark. While CO2 levels can adversely affect sensitive marine organisms like coral, it can also bring unexpected benefits. This rich supply of carbon dioxide at the Papua New Guinea bubble site is fertilizing these seaggrass beds, turning them into a thick lawn. Seagrasses can live in very high CO2 environments. They actually like it because seagrasses like the terrestrial plants that do take in the carbon dioxide and convert it into sugars. The lush seaggrass appears to be an important nursery for baby fish. Once they mature, some migrate to the corals for shelter. Cardinal fish are pretty cool because they will always come back to the same coral. And not only the same coral, they same spot in the coral. It have their own little parking garage. Beyond their coral homes lie many dangers. These fish are like candy on the reef. They in their best interest to be closer to the habitat so that they can retreat back to it and they much by predators. Danielle has already discovered that the CO2 fish have trouble smelling predators. Now she to see which fish will hide from them. This one is from the control site where the conditions are normal. You can see it retreats right into the coral. It might be exploring the habitat of the coral, but it tank. The fish will stay like this for the entire trial in general. The next fish comes from the high CO2 bubble site. You can see it out the water a lot. It far from the coral. It retreating back into the coral. So, being bolder could make you grow faster and get bigger, but it also makes you a lot more susceptible to predators. Danielle tries several fish. They all follow the same pattern. The fish seem to have no fear because the high acidity is disrupting their brain signals. Right, left, left. More and more little fish are tested under varying conditions, but there are glimmers of hope that some fish are adapting to the higher levels of CO2. Some even seem to thrive amidst the carbon dioxide bubbles. Well, we dams little fishes swimming into these high CO2 cracks. Uh I don they seem to be using them as a refuge and hanging out until the scientist or the predator goes away. It seems that these fish living around the bubbles have become stronger in order to cope with the high acidity. There are mechanisms that might allow them to adjust to a high CO2 world. Some individuals will have better genes for that particular environment. So, they pass their genes on and you get genetic adaptation. Signs of genetic adaptation to a rapidly acidifying ocean are the holy grail for the global science [Music] community. Clues can be found wherever there are variable levels of ocean acidity. [Music] On the west coast of America, from Washington State down to California, there dioxide from the deep [Music] ocean. Professor Gretchen Hoffman from the University of California in Santa Barbara has chosen this coastline as her study site. One thing that California coast here is that we have upwelling. And this is where wind blows across the surface of the oceans starting in the springtime. And this wind brings up deep colder rich water to the shores. And that water has a really low pH. And this low pH water has an impact on the biology on the shores. One creature that seems to have adapted to the ocean the spiky red sea urchin. They are the lawnmowers of the sea. They play a vital role in keeping ecosystems healthy by devouring algae and seaweed. Without them, these sea plants would multiply and damage the ecosystem. Unlike the oysters, which were struggling in the high acidity of the northwest coast, the sea urchin seems to be flourishing. Ah, it looks great. Looks really good. Gretchen believes the key to its success may lie in its genes. We found that populations, say, from the north in Oregon that are really tougher in the face of these pH changes. They were expressing genes in a different way than sort of the wimpy California urchins were. That they were turning on more genes that would help them make their skeleton. By turning on certain genes, the northern sea urchins became more efficient at building their calcium carbonate shells, even when the surrounding water had higher acidity. Gretchen wondered if this life-saving gene could be passed on to the more vulnerable urchins in the south. Five spots. That looks great. To find out, she sets up a crossbreeding experiment. [Music] The sperm from both northern and southern males is used to fertilize eggs from the weaker southern females. Once the lavi begins to mature, Gretchen compares the two samples. Now we skeleton. And the way I think about a sea urchin larve is that it freestanding backpacking tent. So the skeleton are actually like the tent poles. That calcium carbonate. And that their body that could be challenged to form under ocean acidification conditions. Amazingly, the experiment reveals that the northern urchin acidity is passed on genetically to the southern female learned is that larve that have fathers from the northern populations actually um retain their body size. They stay bigger even in the face of low pH. So it does matter who your daddy is in this kind of experiment. We know now that there are populations that have genetics that will allow them to adapt and we know how to look for them. While it adapting to changing conditions. Nice looking eggs. Yeah. Yeah. It species and one species will never save an entire ecosystem. Back at base at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, Leticia is analyzing the DNA samples collected in Papua New Guinea. She finds that the highest species diversity was at the control site where the pH is a normal 8.2. She then analyzes the samples collected halfway between the control and the high CO2 bubble site. As the acidity increases, the corals start to disintegrate because you have less uh coral heads, less structure habitat, then a lot of diversity tends to uh try find shelter in it. So, it then the low pH, which was 7.9 in my study, you have almost nothing. Similar to the corals, one or two species are tolerating the high acidity, but the rest have disappeared. And so you have the same kind of shrimp 100 times when in the regular pH conditions, you have 100 different species. Laticia disturbingly clear. The high CO2 site has 30% less diversity of small sea creatures than the control site. The reason why this group is very important, it of the food chain in coral reef. The fish feed on those tiny creatures. So if those tiny creatures disappear, the fish community is going to change and evolve as a result of this loss. In Papo New Guinea, the expedition nearly over. The locals are concerned about the future of their coral reef. How does this carbon nit concentration affect the corals on the sea? The coral reefs will still be there in 50 or 100 years time, but they will look very different is our prediction. There will be less of those branching corals and there will be possibly less fish as well, which is of real concern because it food. [Music] With coral reefs already vanishing at a rate of 1 to 2% every year, finding a solution is critical. There without stopping greenhouse gas emissions. I mean that there is absolutely no practical solution to protect coral reefs from warming and from ocean acidification if we don stop carbon dioxide emissions in the world. Some people all say, too big. We can\\ Well, that alternative technology. The problem is that we future. We of gas and coal as opposed to the long-term benefits of not destroying the planet. The question becomes, if it not working here, do you move your farm or do you move your hatchery? It that simple. Let somewhere else that doesn problem. Uh, I think it up with you and eventually have to face a problem anyway. [Music] [Music]	Success
Apollo-Soyuz: The Space Handshake | SLICE SCIENCE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsdQrOlvZ2U	SLICE Science	[Music] Despite the various cooperation agreements signed between the Soviet and American leaders, the invisible forces of the KGB and the CIA continued gathering information. The Cold War was still in the news, and these exchanges were particularly monitored. For Seymour Liberut, radio operator in the control room, this trip to the USSR was a chance to see behind the curtain. The Russians were very uh paranoid about security. And u as a matter of fact, I was warned uh by Bob Overmire, one of our astronauts that stayed over there during the mission. Bob said, hotel Rosia has 3,000 rooms. all of them are bugged. They all have eavesdropping. And if you need to if you need clean sheets or a towel, open the doors on the armwire and say, more towels. next morning. So, and we saw all that. We saw the uh we saw the uh the short men with the long coats and and fedora hats that followed us around when we were over there. It course. Right. Everyone wanted to know how sincere the other side was. Everyone wanted to know if by chance the other side wasn all this for espionage reasons rather than political repro. At the time the Russians were extremely handicapped in the field of information technology in particular as in the field of electronics. So one thing the Americans guarded jealously was that the Russians at the time the Soviets should not profit from any unwitting technology transfers. the technology. As you can imagine, the Russians were briefed by the KGB and the Americans by the CIA before the mission. Each had to know what should be talked about and what should not. I honored guest this evening. We read. Will you join? And we watch these young men, these representatives of us from two cultures as they learn to work together. Gray matter was not enough to ensure the success of such a mission. Each astronaut had to prepare like an athlete, even if they were only part of the backup crew. Like Vladimir Jean Beckov, age 32, he was at the beginning of a very long career as a cosminaut. The first time we arrived at NASA, there was a sign saying, the Russians are coming. Right next to me, the door was open. There was a blackboard on which someone had drawn a space shuttle, and from its hold, bombs were falling onto a map of Russia. We laughed, of course, but the memories stayed with me. with me. One year before the start of the mission, the two crews gathered in Houston where they trained on mock-ups and simulators. Together, they would have to draw up a precise mission schedule. [Music] Then the question arose of where the two crews should meet. How many dockings? Who goes first? We all fought to be first. Constantine Bushf who had diplomatic training convinced the Americans with his characteristic gentle insistence that the Soviet Union should leave first. Finally, after long negotiations, it was decided that on July 15th, 1975, the Soyuse rocket would take off first and ignite the media interest, one of the main objectives of this mission. And the teams on the ground certainly got the picture. For the first time, the American Apollo spacecraft would carry four state-of-the-art portable video cameras and a VCR recorder. You know, I pioneered color TV on Apollo 10. I won an Emmy and uh so it was it was TV had become a very you important just to share with the public because they for it. I pushed for all the TV we could get because we wanted to show the rest of the world what we were doing. In the case of the SEU it was the first publicly um televised live televised launch of a spacecraft. Everything had been kept and embargoed until they were certain that they were successful. So it was very important to the Soviet people as well as to the world. By 1974, NASA had lost its luster. Man space flights no longer fired the crowd of American public opinion held that these flights were no longer useful and cost too much. So the National Aeronautics and Space Administration were keen to make an impression with Apollo Soyos. The keynote image of this mission would be the handshake between Alexi Leonov and Thomas Stafford. However hearty the handshake, it would cost NASA the equivalent of 1 billion of today dollars. They practiced that handshake a thousand times. They rehearsed with models. They also worked on their speeches. to have at least a base to work from. But what do you want? It bit like theater. Okay. Luke 3. How are you, Alex? Glad to see you. There were lots of debates. In the end, it was agreed that the meeting should take place between the airlock and the Soyuse service [Music] compartment. The staging was rather artificial. It was cramped and difficult to film in that spot. Impossible to get interesting shots for television. we wouldn had to film at an angle so as not to distort the image. Well, the handshake was very important because that was the symbolic meeting in space. U it universal gesture of comradeship and open ship revealing that you unarmed. You out your hand in greeting. [Music] When the the Soviet crew would be in the United States, all different crew members would have them to their house for dinner and the engineers too. So that relationship. [Music] Arrive in the United States. I want to visit Hollywood. Alex Leono, Sou commander because I want to be a movie star, Colonel in the Soviet Air Force. No, I don want Tom Stafer want. Leonov and Stafford built a very tight relationship. It was actually because Leonov is a very personable person, a guy that has a real personality. He likes to laugh. He likes to do things that he never seen. He likes to test you. And Stafford was more an upright guy. But Leonov his tough spirit and made him more human. The two commanders would be flying two very different vessels. The Apollo craft was developed for lunar missions. So Apollo had extensive maneuverability and great flight autonomy. The astronauts could live in it for almost 30 days in total autonomy. So was less sophisticated than Apollo and its smaller fuel storage capacity prevented it from flying at altitudes higher than 1300 km. But Soyuse had already demonstrated that its automatic docking system worked when handling hookups in space. Today, the Russian module has become a taxi cab for the International Space Station. the Russian and American teams would therefore have to construct a junction between the modules. This simple thing masked a terrible wrangle. Who would be the male and who the female? And neither one side nor the other wanted to be the female. The earlier systems involved having a device that was a was a kind of a probe uh in in our language we would call that a male part that would then engage what is a female part. So our designers were interested in trying to come up with something that would work equally well. So we got to the point where we captured the two vehicles with a system that was identical on both sides that it had these interlocking fingers that brought the vehicle together. The docking system developed for the Apollo Soyuse mission comprised three petals used as a guide at top a docking collar. The collar absorbed any impacts between the two vessels after which it would retract and maintain an interlock between Soyos and Apollo. A competition was held between the two nations and the Russian tulip model was selected. However, each country would build it using its own methods. [Music] Okay, Houston, this is Suzone. Orient. Two years on, their efforts had borne fruit as the atmosphere between the two crews was looking good. Away from the pressures of their administrations, freed from the weight of hierarchy, far removed from the worries of the world outside, astronauts and cosminauts of the Apollo Soyos mission readily shared precise information between themselves, even drawing on each other [Music] I learned working with the Americans. They would establish their technical documentation about the stages of the flight in detail. We would set the broad strokes and then fill in the details during the flight. They would describe every unexpected contingency that they dreamt up on Earth. Books this thick and we learned that for serious flights, the more in-depth method was indeed better. That [Music] [Music] Were we tolerant, intolerant? We just had a professional relationship between people who could understand each other technically and intellectually. That it. If only that was the case with everyone on Earth. [Music] So by the time we flew and I developed this relationship with Alexi sometimes even NASA and the quote their academy of science that but would disagree would say hey we work it out together don [Music] Two months before blastoff, physical preparations were stepped up and flight chronology formalized. To my right, uh you can see uh command device signal, command device signal. Because in space, there is no room for improvisation. Crews revise their flight plan ceaselessly over and over, fine-tuning the various procedures down to the last second. Everything is validated and then recorded. The two crews were ready for takeoff. But one problem remained. In two years, the Americans were never able to work with the real Soyos. And finally I said, the real spacecraft. spacecraft is now down at Bakanor. Nobody has ever been there. No, right. Can\\ a minute. I have flown nearly a hundred different types of aircraft. I have flown three different types of spacecraft and I have yet to see a simulator or a mockup that is exactly like the real plane. So either I take my crew there and do it or we don And and the Soviet management says, of them said, crew. understand. If Stafford doesn don\\ union, how to strike. In the end, with the cosminaut support, Thomas Stafford and his team request was granted. On April 28th, 1975, they were the first Americans to visit the ultra secret launch site of Bonur in Kazakhstan. The crews could finally take off. [Music]	Success
Can Nanotech Save the Planet? | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIBjJbfcmcI	SLICE Science	[Music] A big change is coming in our lives. We that will harness the world of the infiniteesmally small, the nano universe. Working at the incredible scale of 1 millionth of a millimeter, scientists are now freely moving individual atoms and molecules. They the minuscule will open a new world of possibilities. The nanotechnology is a key for the future because it one thing. It impacts every single area of life. The ultimate goal of nanotechnology is the complete control of the physical structure of matter and it around the world. But most of us will never notice its arrival because this technology is invisible. Atoms that react to light are being used to coat walls and windows so they automatically clean themselves. A nano fiber that is stronger and lighter than steel is finding its way into all kinds of high-performance sports equipment. And nano electronics research is underway that could bring a fundamental change to the tracking of goods and people. Even a nanoized computer that mimics the workings of the human brain may one day become a reality. With new superefficient materials, nano promises a complete transformation in how we live our lives. now. So, open your minds to the science of the small and the future it could make [Music] possible. We have always counted on new technologies to help us shape our world. Now, researchers are crossing another technological frontier. In the nano dimension, they to manipulate the most intimate mechanics of life, and they promise us more control of our bodies and of our environment. This three-part series explores a mysterious and unknown universe and the revolution it promises. [Music] Around the world, cities are growing up and out, and nanotechnology is about to bring enormous and invisible change to the people living in them. Already, architects and engineers are working with a wave of nanomaterials synthesized in laboratories. They first products of research which began about 30 years ago. Is um SA coming down? Professor Jim Jim Jesi has spent his entire professional life in the realm of the very small. Based at UCLA, he expert on the physics and chemistry of single molecules and a central figure in the invention that opened the doors to this minuscule arena. and we are interested in biologically inspired uh types of circuits. So if you Dr. Jim Jesy was one of the first people to observe science at work on a nano scale in the 1980s at IBM Zurich. He was part of the team that developed a new instrument called the scanning tunneling microscope or STM. These microscopes don optical scopes. What they do is scan the surface of a sample like reading Braille. Welcome to the nano world. The scale is 1 millionth of a millimeter. This is a world of individual atoms. The STM has an ultra thin probe that can read a surface and convert the gathered information into an image. From that moment on, scientists could see and study the nano universe. The STM was the first time people could actually make pictures, images of atoms and molecules. Suddenly people were able to understand things in a in a different way on the basis of single atoms rather than you know millions and billions as they had done in the past. The use of the new technology would lead to another astonishing discovery. When the probe came within one nanometer of an atom, current flowed. And by harnessing the energy, scientists found they could move individual atoms. [Music] The scanning tunneling microscope enabled them also to actually touch molecules and atoms and for the first time manipulate them on surfaces and generate structures that were unimaginable for hundreds of years before. But if scientists can move atoms, they could potentially build and shape them into something new. A discovery that would profoundly change scientific thinking. STM technology was to evolve steadily and so launch nanocience into a range of different fields. As more and more scientists began to observe the nano world, they found they could also increase the performance of existing materials. Professor Jean Ling Wong of the Georgia Institute of Technology made a breakthrough while studying the widely used chemical zinc oxide. He saw that minute pressure applied to a zinc oxide crystal produced tiny amounts of electricity. [Music] Professor Wong find how he could use that discovery to generate power. Each wire is only 50 nanome thick. When the wire is bent, minute levels of current were generated. So the team took several million of these nano wires and fixed them between electrodes. Then stacked them in layers, giving them even more power. The output amounted to 3 volts twice the power of a double A battery. What is available to us most time is mechano energy vibration noises light wind flow air flows those are all mechanical energy. If we can convert those into electricity we can power devices. Professor Wong goal is to create power from something as simple as the vibrations of our bodies. Mobile phones and portable gadgets could be charged anytime, [Music] anywhere. And there are other goals. Some engineers speculate that one day there will be lightweight passenger aircraft which glide through the air. But for now, the nano products that are commercially available are distinctly more prosaic. Take [Music] glass. In this Japanese airport, the walls are made almost entirely of glass, almost 15,000 panes. But how to keep it clean? At Central Japan International Airport, the glass has been treated with a photoc catalytic coating which cleans the surface automatically. It nano [Music] way. There are titanium dioxide clusters only 10 nanometers in diameter on the surface. UV light changes the oxygen in the air into high energy molecules called reactive [Music] oxygen. These molecules break down the dirt particles just like in a detergent ad. If you smudge dirt onto the nano glass and then compare it with equally dirty regular glass under ultraviolet [Music] light, there [Music] difference. There is another feature that enhances self-cleing of the nanotreated glass. rain. On regular glass, water forms into droplets. But on nano glass, water reacts with the nano material and spreads, coating the surface evenly. In this state, the water can seep in between the glass surface and dirt, washing it away. The photoc catalysts, they particles and the efficiency of them and how they work is really dependent on their shape. And so once we can understand their shape and we can modify the shape and so on and the dimensions of those particles then we can obtain something that because just a big piece of you know titanium dioxide doesn functions. It first step and it process that nanomaterials. Photocatalytic coatings are already widely used in cities across Japan, on highway sound barriers, on the walls of houses, even in hospital washrooms. Ironically, you even find nano coatings on antiviral masks. Another example of the unseen spread of [Applause] nanotechnology. Other scientists have succeeded in building materials that could potentially revolutionize construction and engineering. What they have in common is a radically new component, tiny building blocks, carbon nanot tubes. It atoms have been joined into hexagon structures and then rolled into a single cylindrical form. The diameter is an unbelievable 1 nanometer or 100,000th of the width of a human hair. It could become the super material of the century. [Music] So carbon nanot tubes are actually an example of the first material to be you know engineered and created in a laboratory by man. It some ex you know existing material that unique um capability. [Music] Carbon nano tubes known as CNT are 20 times stronger than steel. They were created by accident in 1991 when a Japanese scientist was working on another nano project. Later they were found not only to be strong and lightweight, they were also semiconductors and metals. Scientists around the world, including NASA, quickly saw the potential. There were many applications for such promising lightweight material, but the challenge was how to massroduce the tubes in sufficient volume. As so often happens in nanotechnology, the jump from laboratory to production line can be problematic, especially when working at the microscopic level. I want to talk to you about at the University of Oklahoma, Professor Daniel Rasco came up with a solution to speed up the growth process. He developed a catalyst which can function in the nano dimension sequentially using hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon monoxide. Dr. Rasco then adds the catalyst which in turn enables the carbon atoms to assemble and organize into a pattern which will form the basis of the nano tube structure. You need a very special catalyst to produce single wall nano tube. So you have a cluster and around this cluster a cup is formed and then once the cup is formed the rest of the nano tube grows by self assembly of atoms around this first cup. So the nano tubes will grow from the original catalyst. For scientists to build atom by atom would take an astronomical amount of time. This remarkable self-organization at the nano level allows for easier production of the nano [Music] materials. Seeing the potential of this building process, Dr. Rasco set out to devise a system to mass-roduce semiconducting carbon nano tubes. With financial support from NASA, he built a bigger reactor and repeated his lab experiment, only this time on a larger scale. The output of carbon nano tubes has steadily increased, prompting corporations around the world to find new uses for the wonder material. [Music] sturdy lightweight bicycles, tennis rackets. While an array of CNT consumer products are already on the market, researchers anticipate that the tiny building blocks might have a far more important role in the future, such as strengthening cable wires for bridges and elevators where they the harshest of conditions. The carbon nano tubes have a absolutely huge potential if you start again to use your imagination and start to imagine you know the different forms that you can achieve on a very large scale where you know that govern how structures are formed. So there is no limitation except the human imagination and creativity and that is probably in science and engineering of the future that is the most important [Music] thing. Where might these leaps of the imagination take us? We the future to dramatize how the technology might unfold. to look at space travel through the eyes of a [Music] child. Johnny while, he wanted to fly a spaceship until I told him about riding into space on an elevator. That changed everything. It days. They haven of course, but it they say. Until about 50 years ago, when carbon nano tubes were discovered, the idea of a space elevator would have been dismissed as rubbish because materials were too heavy back then. There technology to captivate an 8-year-old. Johnny. Johnny. Miss Violet. How coming? Good, Miss Violet. It will be ready for assimilation soon. Really? Then I done yet, but I Rocket travel never really appealed to me. It dangerous. I had an elevator. Here we go. That start, and you away. Maybe I [Music] Soon it will be 10,000 km above Earth. I still need to add 26,000 km and join it with Geiochron satellite. Then it will be done. It will be done. [Music] Most of us use computers every day. In a short period of time, the personal computer has taken over our lives. We use them at work. We use them at home. They enable our cities to function more efficiently. But how do you increase their power and function? Nanotechnologists are trying to build an ever more powerful computer, one that far exceeds anything we have [Music] today. The computer has been around for nearly 70 years. Its size has steadily shrunk from filling up an entire room to fitting in our hands. It more efficient, working billions of times faster than it did in the early days. Current technology uses silicon to build the chips, but their capacity is limited by the scale of the distance between them. Silicon wires less than 20 nanome apart interfere with one another. They don sometimes cease to operate altogether. As things become faster and more dense, they become smaller and we start to hit some fundamental limits and those fundamental limits will stop the current technology advancing. The nanocientist vision of the future is one that defies traditional limits in size, scale, and design. Here at the TJ Watson Research Center in New York State, this computer manufacturer is developing a remarkable new nano material that could revolutionize computer technology. It it Sunsung IBM. Dr. Sun believes it will replace conventional silicon. Graphine is made out of carbon atoms that have been arranged into hexagons forming a two-dimensional sheet. It less than one nanometer thick. It extremely strong and flexible and can carry high currents approximately a thousand times more efficiently than copper. Griffin has a lot of advantage and the number one is one atomic layer very easy to scale as it for the very small devices and number two is a very high mobility and the devices made by graffine tends to have a very fast [Music] speed. This combination of properties means it range of electronic devices. Dr. Sun team has been studying graphine as a potential replacement for computer silicon switches. Most electronic devices are based on digital electronics. They require a set of switches to work together in an organized way. If the switches can be made to be more efficient and more effective, there similar gain in efficiency and [Music] performance. So far, Dr. Sun switches have performed at a faster rate than expected. [Music] Long-term goal is to come up the high performance computing devices. We using graffine as a new electronics material in the next 20 even 30 years and continue to improve the computer performance and in the transistor scale also in the system scale. Elsewhere, other scientists are working on ways to improve computer performance. In Japan, they are working on a concept that could further advance the technology. Dr. Masakazu Aono is one of the world scientists. A few years ago, Dr. Aono was studying electrical circuits. Then, by accident, he observed an interesting phenomenon. While trying to build a metallic nanoructure, Dr. Aono noticed that silver was attaching itself to the platinum probe. He had placed silver sulfide and platinum 1 nanometer apart. When he applied voltage, the silver atom started to grow. Under certain conditions, the silver atom just keeps growing. When you change polarities of the voltage from plus to minus, the silver begins to shrink. When we saw these results, I immediately thought this can be used as the first atomsized switch that would operate at room temperature. It was a discovery that became the basis of the design of the world [Music] The distance between the two electrodes is 1 nanometer. As electric current flows, individual atoms leap out acting as a switch. [Music] So we achieve the switching motion by moving and controlling just a few atoms. The computer is an amassing of countless onoff switches like that and it calculates and memorizes through individual switches going on off. So basically it makes it possible for us to make it very small. Dr. Aono found another interesting characteristic of the atom switch. As power is increased, the switch maintains its on position despite being shut off. It computers are able to reboot very quickly after being shut down. It was a discovery that ushered in another phase in computer evolution. [Music] When UCLA about the atom switch, he decided to visit Japan. His idea was to use the atom switch in a neuromorphic computer, one that could potentially mimic the human brain. [Music] The research is a collaboration between Dr. Aono Jim Jeski California and their long-term goal is to build artificial neural systems. The human brain is made up of a 100 billion nerve cells called neurons. Neurons transmit electrochemical signals to each other and to the rest of the body. The signals are conveyed at intersections where two neurons come close together in a junction called a syninnapse. Professor Jingeski believes that this interaction parallels what happens in the atom switch. [Music] And when I saw it, I started to think we can use this in a different way. We can use this in a way where these elements are like what you call synapses. These are things you know inside the neurons that trigger information and I started to see these devices are behaving like neurons. So how could we wire them together? And when I thought how do we wire them together? I looked at the structure of the brain and when you look at the neurons, you know, they interconnected kind of tangled messes. I thought, well, let way and and and sort of mimic the brain. Professor Jim Jesy was convinced that he could structure the silver and sulfur atoms in a computer, creating a structure that mimicked the brain complex systems. in his research lab in Los Angeles. Work was soon underway to build the brain circuit. The first step was to recreate the structure of the neurons in the brain. If Jim Jesi could achieve that, the system would theoretically function like the brain. If you watch the brain circuit assemble, you pattern are billions of atom switches. [Music] Professor Jim Jesi then applied a current to the circuit and witnessed the circuit changing its configuration. Okay, made contact. The circuit links where current flowed became stronger and thicker, allowing for more current to flow. But beyond that, the artificial circuit also showed signs of a phenomenon that mimicked memory. It doesn knowledge. And then as it experiences things, it starts to develop connections and then it has an experience. And from this past experience then it can predict let um a process of let developing. [Music] Okay. So when we look through this data professor Jim Jeffsky applying a constant current to the brain circuit when the current suddenly soared to an unexpected level. what was going on? What was the cause? And then after a while it jumps to another. The team began a collaboration with scientists at the university in Mayorca, Spain. [Music] Jim Jesi has been working with Argentinian brain scientist Professor Dante Kalvo. Kevo has been studying brain patterns and has been measuring the electrical currents transmitted through the brain when we experience emotions. In the human brain, when we think of something especially evocative or are overcome with emotions, there flood of signals. Professor Kelvo was amazed at the similarities between the artificial brain circuit and the human brain. that the basic mechanism of the human brain and the basic dynamics of these atomic switch is exactly the same and it physics that that rules this collective process is [Music] universal research into the brain computer circuit is still preliminary but professor Jim Jesy aims one day to develop an alternate int intelligence. The current goal is for this um system to be able to learn things and it could learn, you know, what you like. It could learn your habits. When you grow up, you would have coffee there. It could be your friend. Yeah. Because their experience would be your experience. So if you constantly, they would become understanding of you. It seems closer to science fiction than contemporary science. Welcome to the nano city of the [Music] future. I guess I the virtual world.

Johnny, what do you feel when you eat something sweet? Sweets make me feel happy because glucose is an important As cities expand and become more complex, so do some of the problems facing those who live and work in them. There are concerns about pollution and crime, even terrorism. Surveillance cameras gaze down on the streets, scanning, hunting for signs of anything unusual. There are other less obvious threats. Poisonous gases, radiation, and the fear of some unseen health hazard. Danger doesn see. So, some are looking to technology for the answer. Demand is growing for sensors that don but that can actively monitor and detect in real time. In Korea, scientists are working on a device that will revolutionize our ability to track both merchandise and people. The radio frequency identification or RFID is a tag containing product data combined with a radio frequency device. In theory, it could be used by consumers, but in practice, it likely to become an electronic label tracking everything in a store. RFIDs are relatively easy and cheap to massproduce. Professor Guu Jin Cho uses a special ink which has some unusual properties. The ink is infused with carbon nano tubes, a material which you strong and durable is also a semiconductor. This permits the duplication of all RFID tag components. Transistors and antenna don assembled in a production line. They simply printed. The potential savings would allow for the cost to drop below 1 cent per sticker, a price that Professor Cho predicts will mean that RFIDs will be found on every product and will become as ubiquitous as the barcode. It to suggest that when that happens, and it could be soon, theft and shoplifting rates will see a sudden and dramatic drop. The long arm of the law will also be enhanced by other sensor-driven technology that promises even more sophisticated surveillance systems. Dr. Genki Yoshiawa has developed a powerful sensor that can detect potentially dangerous substances by using a unique and down-to-earth inspiration. He wanted to make a sensor that was as sensitive as the nose of airport sniffer dogs. Every canine tiny nerve endings called receptors, each designed to bind with a specific chemical. The overall combination allows the dog to figure out the big picture and to distinguish between individual scents. Dr. Yoshikawa succeeded in recreating the mechanism [Music] artificially. He tested the sensor with meat, something the human knows has difficulty differentiating. But the sensor was able to pinpoint the subtle differences precisely. How does this perform in the nano [Music] world? The air is full of molecules that emit various odors. When the molecule touches a receptor, its surface bends. The shift in stress is only on a nano scale, but the combination of molecules allows the sensor to determine the smell. The research is still at an early stage with only eight sensors assembled. According to Dr. Yoshikawa, by building more sensors and pre-programming them with various molecular patterns, the system will be able to detect any dangerous substances from drugs to dynamite. Right now, if you wanted to check how polluted the air is, how polluted the river is, how much pollutant is in the drinking water, we couldn mean, it would be very difficult to do on an individual level. But if we can attach this sensor to our mobile phones or close, each person will have the freedom to check what is going on in the environment around him. The artificial nose could soon become as widely used as the surveillance camera, a smaller hidden sentinel, an electronic guard dog. Nano sensors can be distributed in a city and they can monitor not only where there but they can monitor how that danger is for instance moving or propagating through the the system and with that you then people can take action immediately. A society where unseen multifunctional sensors monitor our every move may seem comforting to some, but others are not so sure. Does the constant intrusion in our lives outweigh the advantages? When does surveillance become snoopy? One is the ability to monitor people obtrusive manner. So you can collect data about their genetics. You can you can observe them wherever they are with you know nano RFID tags and how that information will be used by corporations and governments or even you know terrorist groups that is a major concern of people. Higher levels of surveillance, both unseen and interactive, could dramatically alter dayto-day life in our biggest cities. So, what might life theoretically be like 30 years in the [Music] future? The strangest thing happened to me this morning. I was walking home when I saw one of my neighbors kids toys out on the street. I picked it up and took it to their place. But as I did, I noticed the sensor must have been tracking me. But how? [Music] Sometimes all this sensory data can be a little unnerving. I mean, I enjoy the sheer convenience of it. I can work from home most of the time and shop. Lately, I can even get an instant medical checkup. It from the National Health Directorate. We all have nano capsules embedded in our bodies. All you have to do is lie back and the data is transmitted to the directorate. They it what has to be done and when. Simple stuff like prescriptions is sent to you in seconds. Please renew your social data card. You have 10 days to comply. This is a mandatory renewal to provide the latest technological benefits to each and every one of you. Thank you for your cooperation. But then there It has all your personal data and is your official ID. You can regulations just get tighter and tighter. At first, ID segregation was only for people with criminal records. But once the idea caught on, the urge to classify just went wild. It used to be a bit of a game, like getting into clubs, but these days it not have an account with us. Please do not enter our building unless it is necessary. Everything is codified. You out. It of the elite. But if not, this restaurant is for members only. We do not have a table for you. Sometimes I wonder whether I know enough that they know something I don about those capsules and what they really doing. Your security clearance will be lowered. Be aware of the consequences. [Music] You look fantastic in this. Violet Humphrey, did you enjoy your last purchase with us? Miss Humphrey, our fall winter collections are 25% off. Especially for you, Miss Humphrey. Do not miss this great opportunity. They say it stuff, but my fear is there else going on. Someone out there wants to know everything about me. That I neighbor who I [Music] was. Could it be that they know everything about me? what I like and what I think, what I feel, that they have an imprint of everything that the day I was born. [Music] And there Walk slower. Your heart rate is increasing. Walk slower. Your heart rate is [Applause] increasing. The future suggested by the dark side of nanotechnology may never materialize. But how does society protect itself from such a malign occurrence? What path should we take? Governments around the world are both intrigued and unnerved by the potential impact of this new science. An attitude shared by Britain Society, which published a report with the Royal Academy of Engineering that expressed both confidence and caution. The society master of Trinity College, Cambridge, worldrenowned cosmologist and astrophysicist, Sir Martin Ree. As nanotechnology moves from the lab to big business, how do you keep control? Well, several years ago, the Royal Society initiated a study of nanotechnology. uh we thought it was very important that the scientists should consider whether there were any risks and that they should do this at an early stage before the commercial interest became engaged. Professor Ree thinks that it up to the nanotechnology scientists themselves to recognize the dark side of the new technology and to make sure it doesn consequences. I think one should not worry about any catastrophes from nanotechnology. But there are obviously risks from any new technology just as there are opportunities and the aim of scientists and of their governments uh should be to ensure that we can harness the great benefits which this technology will apply and avoid uh the [Applause] risks. If nanotechnology does take hold of the imagination of the public and of investors, it will become increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to direct. It promises to revolutionize medicine. It could even play a key role in saving the environment. But will it? The nanotechnology is a key for the future because it know, like electronics. It impacts every single area of life whether it be environment, energy, medicine, communications. I believe that you know scientists have a moral responsibility to explain what they do in the laboratory to to everyone and to engage in a debate between you know society on every level scientific and non-scientific about this technology since it will change them. And I have I I take pleasure in that. That is my duty as a scientist. Unlike previous revolutions, nano is distinguished by its apparent absence. An unseen world that is small in scale but potentially big in impact. A wondrous new world. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Where are we? [Music] [Music]	Success
French Guiana: From Green Hell to Green Gold | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgp7izI5LpU	SLICE Science	[Music] The forest in French Gana is a natural elorado. Its biodiversity includes hundreds of thousands of species. It one of the last Edens on [Music] Earth. Its surface area is equal to a sixth of the size of France. It represents 5% of the Amazon rainforest. But while the Amazon suffered from human presence on the other side of its borders, the rainforest in French Gana still looks the same as when Christopher Columbus landed [Music] here. But today, Giana a turning point in its age-old history, currently undergoing an unprecedented demographic explosion. [Music] Will it suffer the same tragic fate as the Amazon rainforest? Or will mankind come up with solutions in time to enjoy its treasures and preserve this precious Eden? For scientists, the priority is understanding how the rainforest functions before it [Music] The density of all these trees and the luxurious of this damp tropical rainforest with its rich biodiversity can be explained by the amount of energy the forest receives from the sun. Of course, along with all the rain that falls to the ground, these elements are very important for photosynthesis [Music] and we could think of the forest as a kind of building with different storage. The first level on the ground is characterized mainly by soil litter, trees, and new young trees. and the animal life, in particular, insects and mosquitoes. The second floor is the realm of tree trunks, a realm with relatively little light, so there are few branches on the [Music] trunks. The third floor of our building is the canopy. This is where we find the interface between the sun, atmosphere, and forest. The canopy greatly limits the amount of light that reaches the ground and only about 1% of the sun rays make it through to the ground. The canopy also ensures that heavy rains don quickly. So the canopy with its structure contributes to maintaining the ecosystem. Are [Music] you the canopy is the realm of at least 800 varieties of birds and mammals such as tucans, capuchin, and howler monkeys. Each plays a vital role in the equilibrium of the forest. By ingesting fruit from the trees and distributing seeds through their excrement, they ensure plant biodiversity, which is the foundation of the food chain. But far below on the ground, it a different world altogether. Very few human eyes have ever witnessed what happens there after dark. To learn more about the inhabitants of this mysterious realm and understand its biodiversity, Cecil Visha Hansen, engineer with the ONCFS, the National Office of Hunting and Wildlife, plays detective using a system that is as ingenious as it We set up an initial camera track that was mainly to get to know all the biodiversity on the site. We got over 80,000 photos of at least 30ome different species, some of which are for instance there are these one of the species we dwelling wildfire. Here species, the giant armadillo, which is rarely seen in Guana. Some animals are quite frequent on the site. The giant anteater, which has found her equipment and is smelling it. Another anter with a baby on her back. Our famous peckeries that we now begun studying and capturing to mark them. Jaguar is most likely a female with her adolescent cub approaching. a cougar that looks like it posing. There this zone. Amordilla something that because it species. The result of these photo campaigns helped us decide on this area as a study zone and to undertake real capture operations, tracking the animals and fitting them with GPS collars to understand their movements and improve wildlife management in French Vana. [Music] [Music] Researchers are fascinated by two species that are key to Gana ecosystem. First, the peckery, a prey enjoyed both by wild cats and humans, but its bio- rhythms are still greatly unknown. Cecil Risha Hansen built large pens to catch these creatures that move in herds. Awara fruit makes excellent bait. This species has suffered huge losses here without any explanation. There were numerous around 2002, but now there hardly any left. No one knows why. We see this trend at several areas of the Amazon. We need to learn about peckery biology and that The other species concerned lies at the other end of the food chain. One of the pecker jaguar. This rare creature is a good gauge of the health of the undergrowth. Using the cries of a female in heat and those of frightened prey, biologist Rashel Berz and veterinarian Chloe Rodri have laid a jaguar trap. The males are solitary and one must be clever to outmaneuver their suspicious nature. The goal of our operation is to try to capture big cats, notably jaguars. They placed through the trap. The jaguar places its paws right where we want. And the traps triggered when it puts it here. We make rounds every 4 hours. So the jaguar isn uncomfortable position for too long. Once the animal has been trapped, we come to see and carry out all the procedures to fit it with the collar and so on. Then once the anesthesia has worn off, we set it free about an hour later. Human activity is slowly encroaching on the jaguars territory because there more and more deforestation and more and more livestock farming. Jaguars are losing their habitat. So the long-term goal is to help them continue to coexist peacefully along with man. This small patch of jungle is only a tiny sample of the extraordinary wildlife that has burgeoned here since time immemorial, far from human eyes. And though hunting is becoming a problem elsewhere in the forest, the creatures here have nothing to fear. For good reason. The Gana Space Center in Kuru is the launch base for Arian rockets. The site is guarded by armed forces, which makes poaching impossible here. An unexpected blessing for wildlife. Home to Ammer Indians for thousands of years, the territory of modern-day French Gana has been the focus of conquest since Captain Datush first explored it back in the 17th century. But aided by epidemics that the region mosquitoes held in store for invaders, the forest has always managed to drive man away. It also earned the reputation as a green hell. So much so that in 1846, France built a penal colony there. But even the penal colony to populate the country and take advantage of its resources. In a 100 years, the hoped for results never materialized and the rainforest was [Music] abandoned. At the end of the 60s, French logging operations forced out of Africa by deolonization were lured by Gana treasures to make a fresh attempt. But they met with no greater success. They realized too late that the local market was too small and exporting the wood was too [Music] expensive. Those failures spelled good luck for French Gana. Elsewhere in the Amazon rainforest, human presence resulted in rampant deforestation at the pace of 2 million hectares per year. In other words, the disappearance of an area equivalent to the entire Guy rainforest every 3 years. But today, this pristine paradise can no longer hold the human element at bay as people settle in greater and greater numbers along its edges. [Music] The undergrowth is a genuine laboratory that science teams study tirelessly. The trunks of trees that have stood here for centuries contain the story of our planet nature of the role the tropical forest plays in climate change. That Daniel Brunell and his team insert probes into their resin canals. They studying an amazing phenomenon, tree transpiration. For large trees roughly 1 meter in diameter, we each day. They give off two to 300 L of water. High-tech instruments placed way up at the top of this tower measure water exchange between the forest and the atmosphere. A large part is absorbed by trees and transpired through their leaves in the form of water vapor. The transpiration is equivalent to about 60,000 L of water per hector of forest each day. That There and 6 L per square meter that are transpired. The difference is about four L. That rivers. First into the ground, then into the rivers and then into the oceans. This enormous amount of energy that is exchanged in the form of transpiration contributes to cloud formation over the rainfall. Other sensors on the towers take exact readings of the amount of carbon absorbed, then released by [Music] trees. The results are clear. The rainforest absorbs more CO2 than it emits, which means less greenhouse gases wind up in the atmosphere. [Music] The Amazon forest helps the planet heat up a little less fast. If we were to cut down this tropical rainforest, then the planet would heat up faster than it currently is. That controls the climate somewhat in South America and more so it helps the climate of a small part of the whole continent. If humans were to destroy the rainforest as they done in the rest of the continent, it animal life that would be endangered, but mankind itself. At a time when climate change and imbalance have hit a dangerous threshold, the preservation of French Gana today than it was before. But isn Haven print on the ecosystem. Though scientists can examine the entire immense rainforest, they can take a close look at the creatures that ensure its survival. Recycling insects. This unfl flagging army allows plant life to regenerate. By studying their relentless laboring, entomologists can take the pulse of the entire forest. [Music] We pile of vines because we want to intercept xylophagus or wood eating insects which play a role in recycling dead wood. About one tree out of a 100 falls each year. That wood and all that wood on the ground needs to be destroyed by different insects. First xyophagus insects, then termites and after that bacteria. This provides fertilization for the soil which is very poorly. Here stump. Let l This is a beetle that breaks down wood at a very advanced stage. So in unmaintained forests like this, there are several trunks in a state of decay. And at this stage there are quite a few species that are involved in completing decay and fertilizing the soil. Only 15% of the insects in French Guyana are known and cataloged. That are cataloged that of the 100,000 that supposedly live in French Guyana. It very important to leave the native forests intact to continue researching and studying these varieties. [Music] A light trap is the ideal tool for taking an inventory of the insects and evaluating the health of the forest. Has it already suffered the symptoms of human exploitation? [Music] [Music] I just got there on the side of my nose. It blood. We This one Nice collection. The prognosis is here. The forest ecosystem is still currently the picture of health. And as with every expedition, the entomologists have discovered new varieties of insects. French Gana is truly one of the last Edens on Earth, burgeoning with extraordinary and largely undiscovered nature. It living treasure chest for science. But for scientists, a feeling of urgency lies behind the marvel. For one only need venture toward the coast to discover the changes that lie on the horizon. The population of French Gana is increasing 3% each year, a growth rate seven times higher than metropolitan France. In the wake of this phenomenon, other trends are also on the rise. Hunting, land clearing for real estate development, the number of agricultural parcels, and the demand for wood for construction. In a biotope where everything is linked, every new path represents an expansion of the human footprint. The National Forest Office, guardian of 70% of Gana faced with an impossible choice. On one hand, the absolute necessity of preserving this priceless green heritage. on the other concerned for meeting the needs of an ever growing population that is dependent on its resources. The solution to this dilemma rethink every detail of forest management starting with the weak link roads and parks. An airplane with a sonar device creates a relief map. The route of forest machinery is optimized and the use of fuel cut in two. Above all, the impact from deforestation is reduced by 20%. 20% less deforestation is an important gain considering tropical soil is sterile beyond depths of 50 cm. Each tree removed churns up nutrient poor soil that will take a long time to rejuvenate. But beyond paths, it optimize forest exploitation. For Olivia Bruno, this optimization is played out tree by tree. Giana diverse because there are over 1,600 trees identified here. Only a small number are commercial. Close to 90 have been defined as commercial varieties. Harvesting in French Gana is really like selective picking. We choose a few trees so not more than a certain number get cut in order to not disturb the forest too greatly and maintain a dynamic that occurs. We framework of natural regeneration. So we 65 years. This is also one of the main varieties among the exploitable ones. It And you can also see its resin. The gum is very white gum as it is out. It tree that was tapped like the maritime pine for its gum which was used as an insulator. Gum from the Malai and French Gana was used to insulate the telecommunications cable between France and England. For each hectare, only five trees on average are felled. The ones slated for cutting are located by their GPS coordinates. [Music] [Music] [Music] The loggers work in a way that limits damage. They use a new ultra light synthetic cable that can tow trucks weighing several tons over 40 m. They no longer need to forge new paths or pack the soil, which would disturb the ecosystem. [Music] The impact of industrial logging is thus kept relatively under control. But today the forest is suffering from the impact of another practice, an ancestral one. Ammer Indians, a traditionally nomadic people, have always lived here in complete harmony with their environment. But over the last 60 years, they become sedentary. A change in lifestyle that forest. These communities grow corn and manio using a slash and burn technique. They clear fields by cutting trees. then burn them so their ashes fertilize the soil. When farmers are nomadic, this practice is harmless to the forest. But when it repeatedly, it continuously buried soil no longer has time to regenerate. Soon a new parcel needs to be cleared at an everinccreasing pace. Amarindians are attached to this ancestral custom which is key to their self-sufficiency and fosters solidarity between families by honoring mayori or the value of working together. When we cut the trees, it wasteful. There making lumber or building canoes, but we waste it with slash and burn. I speak prof. [Applause] [Music] [Music] We do it to grow our fortune. Our manio is our money. We plant bananas, cassava. We plant everything there. Everyone has to clear their field. Mine, my wife, my daughter, my son. Without the forest, we got nothing. It hard. The problem of slash and burn practices is nent in Amler Indian territories and it cities in order to reduce the frequency of cutting as much as possible. The Institute of Development has undertaken to increase soil yield because if the people are becoming sedentary, they may as well make the most of these new agricultural zones. But optimizing the plots obtained by slash and burn techniques means adopting innovative farming systems. Vasel solutions into practice around the city of Marip Pasula in the west of the country. Flash and burn is above all an itinerary farming technique. In other words, traditionally the people moved every 3, five or 10 years. They change. That long as the population. Today, the population is doubling roughly every 5 years. In 2010, it was 5,500. And today it people. Faced with this population, the only solution is to transform, slash, and burn into something permanent. There farming culture, but also other kinds of vegetables, or Indonesian vegetables, crops that diversify local food cultivation in Z, which therefore benefits the people and improves production. Mrs. Deal, a farmer in Marip Pasula, agreed to follow Vanson Did you come to clear the land? I to, but I She diversifies her crops. Mice. Corn. When did you plant it? The day I burned a week, it didn So, I replanted. It looks nice now, but when the rains come, it Among the burnt logs, we find banana trees, peppers, pineapples, manio, oberine, and watermelon. Over a dozen different vegetables in all. Here we see what really is the most traditional practice. And it making to do with what you able to grow something in a tropical zone. You cut, you burn, and you soil that you can plant in easily. All that without any fertilizer or farm. Mrs. D knows that in a few years the soil of her plantation will be too depleted, so she manure, which is more fertile in the long term, than a bed of ashes. But although the technique has proven effective, it obvious choice for farmers. If we use green manure, in other words, so plants intentionally to create vegetital biomass that will create fertility, it works very well. We know how to use it. On the other hand, it means you have to work your field to sew something that brings you absolutely nothing. You aren something to eat or something to sell. However, you fertilizer that will generate the land so you can grow good crops afterwards. But that accept to hear go toil away in your fields to grow something you won able to harvest. Instead, just leave it all in the ground. Then later on, you be able to plant. A lot of our work is setting an example, showing them how these practices work and why they should use it. Meanwhile, to improve short-term production, Vansor encourages farmers to keep small nurseries at their homes in the village. Soon, they put their already robust plants in the ground on their parcels of cleared field. That And back there, that And that you will, are going to allow farmers to take better care of their crops. They be tended to every day. Make sure no insects are attacked, keep track of water and disease. This means that when they taken to the field that by slash and burn, the plants are directly stronger and more robust. In the end, it significantly increases the yield of the slash and burn field. For farmers, it helps generate their revenue in a different way because it surface that monitored and creates revenues that are just as large as if the hector was cleared from man. Although Mrs. Deal has been won over by this method of farming, the greatest challenge Vanson faces is convincing other inhabitants of the notion of forest protection. They here and see the forest as omnipresent, pervasive, and above all, eternal. But this false perception is at odds with the rapid deforestation currently threatening the rainforest. Adopting practices that correspond to this new reality is a long-term endeavor. Although it may not be feasible to abandon an entire tradition, major results can be made by modifying just a few habits. Notably when it comes to felon trees, those cut for the slash and burn fields or else for lumber. Instructors from the Gana Amazonian Park teach a new felling technique that brings loggers a 30% gain in the volume of usable wood. After checking the natural lean of the tree, only five cuts with the chainsaw are needed. A hinge is sworded between one and two. A back cut heel at three. The tree is cut in a safe manner and falls with lower risk of [Music] splitting. If felling is done correctly, you get a lot more wood. If there are splits, you lose a lot of pieces of wood inside. Before they used to felt trees without sounding them, without sticking a probe into the base to see if it hollow. If the tree is hollow, we leave it standing because it that will provide seeds for the future. We don now. Before people would systematically cut trees without checking whether or not they were halted, they would fell five or six trees to get one good one. There were lots of cracked trees, lots of waste. Now they fell a lot fewer trees with this technique or they will do since they matter of breaking old habits that takes time professionals. These internships are intended for Ammer Indians, carpentry, woodworking, construction. There projects in the community. Though they don deforestation, the dialogue helps raise awareness among the local people about the need to protect their heritage. For centuries, forest communities have used wood to record their history. Craftsmen today use natural pigments to fashion the Amazonian creatures that people their legends. Amarindians have always lived along the Maroni River. They fish in it, swim in it, bathe in it. Their existence depends as much on the forest as the water that runs through it. But a few years ago, the river began to carry contaminated mud, as toxic for man as for the environment. The culprits, Garamperos, gold miners, whose numbers have doubled in the past 2 years. When I was a boy, the river didn like this. It wasn milk chocolate. It prospectors. They pollute the river. Lots of trees have died. It sad. The gold panners come across the Maron River from Serena. French Kiana is helpless. The muddy water is caused by suction dredging that sucks up aluvian in the riverbed and the toxicity of the mercury needed to fuse the gold flakes together. The rise in numbers of illegal gold panners has profoundly changed the habits of French Ganas and Indians. They the fish in the river and fear for their safety. Others have started to benefit from the gold trade. The entire Amarindian culture is being turned upside down for a few nuggets of gold. The French government is aware of the growing danger. It use of mercury in official mining operations and is seeking solutions to fight against this new illegal gold rush. Scientists with the BVF and BRGM, the French Geological and Mining Research Bureau, are trying to establish the chemical traceability of gold treated with or without mercury to improve the market. The forest needs sustainable solutions for the problems it faces today. But the government cannot act alone. It understanding of the rainforest and put that to work for the future. The forest is abundant and able to provide those who respect it with everything they need. But in order to find its other treasures, we must learn to look off the beaten paths. Olivier grew up alongside the Ara River. He set foot in over 150 [Music] years. We discovered these hidden cacko plantations. Gradually, our passion for them grew. All these big leaves are cacko trees growing on both sides of the canal. During the rainy season, the river overflows and deposits tons of aluminum. Like the flooding of the Nile, it enriches the soil. The white marks you see on the plants that touch the water are sediments. The alovvian that deposited on the leaves and the ground. This is fertile ground. The taste of the earth gives it that smell. See where the mud glistens like that? the fat of the earth. The aroma comes from the combination of soil and expertise. These cacao trees were part of a former plantation that was abandoned when slavery was abolished in 1848. They original wild state and today produce highquality chocolate. Trees grow in the underworld. They can grow in the shade of tall trees and continue to thrive today. [Music] This kako plantation here is a typical because the trees don rows. They seek the light and since the wood is supple and grows in arches. It doesn plantation at all. Yet it is. The food it gets is called rather exceptional because it grows right out of the trunk. In a couple of months, they turn yellow and that will mean it to turn them into chocolate. Here riper than the others. Inside there the seeds. The seeds are what we use to make chocolate. More and more people want chocolate around the world. Requires very rich soil, but there KCO is an economic potential for French Guana. You just have to have the time and energy to do it. Either we cut the forest down for logging and pocket the money right away, which means it years, or we keep the trees and develop quality products from the treasures underneath. It what we can get by leaving the forest alone. We can bring in money. Producing gecko could be an alternative to deforestation. Olivier Dume roasts his cacko using methods he learned from Ammerindians. He present to transform this patch of land into a nurturing forest garden. A successful adaptation in keeping with the times that echoes another redevelopment inspired by the initial inhabitants of the forest that of medicinal plants. Minimu is an obian manic medicine man. He to still know the secrets of French Gana plants. He lives along the Maroni River in a protected area. [Music] The people of his village still come to him to heal all sorts of ailments. Mimi Seu colds as well as [Music] nightmares. He forest has infinite therapeutic potential that could prove a treasure for our future. We use these remedies only very rarely because there are medicines today. We used to use a wide variety of plants for healing. Today, since we have medicine, we go to the clinic more often. But we can choose to use our traditional knowledge for healing if we want. When you cut it like this, the water is fresh. You drink it directly from a glass. It Lovely water. It [Music] Healing properties have been found in close to 500 forest plants. This vine, when crushed, gives off a strong smell of garlic. The perfect remedy for bat infestations in the village huts. The tree that repels bats is the kua. It also chases away feeders. Here it is. Is used to treat small wounds here and this here. You remove the thorns, rub the bark, and then you plunge it in water. Then you wash with it. I only one who knows these remedies. If we bring young people into the forest, maybe they something. I once brought the Office of Botanical Research to show them all the plants. Little by little, scientists are taking over from Amarindians to discover the incredible properties of the plants in French Gana [Music] Emil is hunting for a particular compound that eradicates instead of heals. She will kill mosquitoes. The mosquito claims a million victims a year and has become even more of a threat since the emergence of the Zika virus. But in a bitter twist of fate, it human actions that allow its lava to multiply. When the ecosystem is disturbed by deforestation, the food chain is thrown off kilter. Among its victims are entomopags, predators of mosquitoes. The forest then becomes a dangerous breeding ground for pathogens. We that are toxic to the larva of a mosquito called iodis egypt. the mosquito that spreads deng fever and chikuna. These two diseases cause countless public health issues in French Gana and therefore have heavy economic repercussions in the department. The idea is to observe what happens in nature and use that to find solutions to the problem. We collect plants because it without many resources. We imagine the plants here have to create a lot of chemical defenses to fight off pathogens and herbivores since they have few resources to grow or bounce back after an attack. We hope that by gathering plants from these areas, we to find new active compounds to help us in our fight against mosquitoes that spread disease to man. [Music] En doesn core samples. Even when it comes to making insecticides, the best solutions are sustainable ones. Here I take a core sample from a determin. These trees are widespread in French Gana construction. You can see three zones. Here we have the bark, the outer part of the tree. The latter part here is what we call sapwood. It where all the trees vital processes take place. This part isn saw. The top of the core is what we call hardwood or perfect wood, which is what we use for building furniture and woodwork. What we compounds in this part of the heart that contribute to the treere defense. So this is the part we to study in the lab to extract the compounds to test their applications and properties. Can waste products from logging operations be transformed into insecticides and save lives? An answer is beginning to take shape in the laboratory in Cayenne, French Gana capital, which is currently experiencing a population explosion. It in the more and more heavily populated zones, that the risks linked to mosquitoes are highest. The active substances are extracted from the wood samples. Then they types of mosquitoes. [Music] The researchers need thousands of mosquito lavi for their experiments and keep them under close supervision. If the adult mosquitoes managed to escape, cayenne would find itself dealing with a serious health crisis. Are you ready? Yes. What [Music] Various dosages of determa extracts are tested on the mosquito lavi. [Music] The good news is that we don laral movement in the test tube where we added the plant extract. When we compare it to the control tube, we see they active. So that the extract is very promising for us. The goal of this insecticide project is to provide elements that favor the development of plantbased insecticides. The appeal is that since this kind of product is made with natural ingredients, it well. So we avoid the problem of environmental toxicity that we could have with insecticides of synthetic origin. [Music] Beyond their individual missions, the pioneers of the forest have understood that French Gana not gold, wood, or compounds. It knowledge. No matter what problems arise from the cohabitation of man and nature, the forest in its infinite diversity holds solutions. From the burgeoning at its roots to the clouds adorning its [Music] crown. The forest of French Gana is an open book available to whoever takes the time to read it. And within its green lines, this patch of green land, so small compared to the entire Amazon rainforest, could very well point the way towards a sustainable future. [Music]	Success

From Teeth to Eyes: A Medical Time Travel | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J44KyPqYSxs	SLICE Science	[Music] [Music] White teeth and a perfect smile are essential elements. elements of today beauty standards. But beyond aesthetics, your teeth can tell an awful lot about you. Your dental imprint is unique to you. And taking a closer look at your teeth can reveal many stories. Scientists can assess your bone density, your digestion, your risk for diabetes, your stress levels, even the presence of autoimmune diseases. Who so much about your inner workings could be revealed simply by opening your mouth? There without oral health. That belongs on a fridge magnet. Over the centuries, medical treatments have evolved for our teeth. Some dubious, some painful, but always in pursuit of progress. Discoveries such as dentures, partials, fillings, extractions, crowns, implants, and teeth whitening are the result. Welcome to the fascinating world of dentistry. [Music] France Shaon has dreamed of having a beautiful smile all her life. Today, at age 67, her dream is coming true. Miss Shaon. Hi there. How are you? I prostidontist. She and today is the last step. She install it on my implants. I can Prosthodontics is a branch of dentistry which specializes in the restoration or replacement of damaged or missing teeth using fixed dentures on implants or removable dentures. Dentists who want to specialize must complete a university residence after completing a 4-year doctor of dental medicine degree. Hello. Hello. Are you well? Am I well? I will be. I hope. I up and put on my gloves and we started. Are you excited? I can Yes. So, today we have a prosthesis that we with the patient that we her mouth. And for sure it adjustment. She without wearing anything in her case. And now suddenly she teeth. So it phonetic level, at the functional level, at the aesthetic level, all that. She have to readapt to the new prosthesis. We you. Installing the prosthesis is the very last step. the one that will forever change Ms. Shaon a set of artificial teeth that will be placed on implants, which are metal rods that have been incorporated into her bone and gums. A prosthesis on implants is something that will make my life easier. I better. I will I smile, beautiful teeth, a better quality of life. But before we go any further, what exactly is dentistry? Well, it medicine that deals with the treatment of teeth and their tissues. There are nine specialties recognized by the Canadian Dental Association such as orthodontics, perodontics, and prostadontics. General dentists, on the other hand, look after overall oral health. They can restore, extract, and replace infected, broken, or missing teeth, dislodge tartar, and set fillings. All the things that make a trip to the dentist so much fun. They can also diagnose diseases and choose the appropriate treatment. But dental practitioners haven and popular. Their reputation has changed over time. In 1940, global populations were just emerging from the Great Depression, which had lasted from 1929 to 1939. Folks were gradually getting richer, but sweet success brought sweet foods. Cavities spread like the plague. [Music] Even though financial fortunes and food access were improving, oral hygiene and regular visits to the dentist weren the menu, patients would only see a dentist when they had cavities and needed their teeth pulled out. Cavities weren the very wealthy saw dental care as a useful expense. [Music] I come from a poor family. We didn have a toothbrush. We didn teeth. And when we had a cavity, it was do we pull it or fix it? Well, it cheaper to remove it. So, we did. So, that where I came from. Young lady, 16 years old, looking for a serious young man. Please note, I am toothless, but I already have my two dentures. Believe it or not, that was considered a gift from heaven. Those personal details probably wouldn it on most women today. But in the 1940s, a toothless mouth made a young maiden that much more marriageable. It represented a real financial perk for a potential husband. And if his betrothed came with her own dentures, well, that was a bonus too good to pass up. on a we mastered the techniques for prosthesis before we mastered the techniques for repairing teeth in a predictable way. But imagine if you will that the teeth you have in your mouth actually came from another person mouth. Uncle Roger died, but he had beautiful, healthy teeth. Come on, teeth. Time to change mouth. The Atruscans about seven centuries before Christ used riveted human teeth attached to appliances made out of bronze and gold to replace teeth. They used human teeth to replace human teeth, but not necessarily from the same person. Later, as an alternative to using human teeth, animals were sourced for their precious ivory. It turns out from an aesthetic point of view, it wasn were using a material that wasn that incredibly white and it was very porous. So, it would get stained and it wasn [Music] When George Washington opened his mouth to take his oath of office as America first president, he tried desperately to conceal his excruciating pain. His gums were swollen and burning. His dentures with metal fasteners, springs, and bolts snapped and squeaked. It tortured him to open and close his mouth. He was 57 years old and had only one natural tooth left in his head. The rest of his mouth was stuffed with a mixture of lead, brass, gold, hippopotamus ivory, and some other human teeth. His financial records indicate that he purchased nine slave teeth in 1784. This leads us to assume that they wound up in his dentures. As for the hippo ivory, it was often used for this purpose in the 18th century. Exotic as it sounds, the results were far from perfect. The soft ivory wore out very quickly and had to be adjusted and replaced constantly. It also stained easily, resulting in a brownish, foul smelling smile. It was long believed that Washington were made of wood because of their color. Hey, George, wood would have been better than what was actually in there. By 1805, the use of porcelain teeth had gradually taken hold. Unlike ivory, porcelain wouldn brown. But at that time, human teeth were still widely used. Unfortunately, poor old George never saw the pearly white denture revolution. He died in 1799. [Music] Back to our time. Prior to today meeting, Ms. Shaon placed and she had time to heal. During that period, her prosthesis was made. Now, it will be positioned on her implants for the very first time. So, here that serve to attach it to the head of the implant abutments. And from the other side, we see these holes which provide access for the screws that will put in the prosthesis to fasten it to the implants. It approach takes time. After the teeth are extracted, we let the bone heal. Once the implants are placed, the implants are allowed to heal. So all these healing phases make the duration long. That Shahon, the conventional approach. Then subsequently, we started with the steps to make the final prosthesis. Dental implants are anchors made of titanium which are inserted into the bone. They that will hold the teeth, also artificial, called the prosthesis. Today animal ivory, thank goodness, but with composite acrylic resin, which is a state-of-the-art material. For the oral fitting today, basically we laboratory steps have gone well, that the dental assembly fits well, that the occlusion is good, therefore that the teeth close properly in terms of comfort. We the parts, all the pieces work well together. We have little screws, parts that fit into each other. It work. So, we have to ensure this precision because it is this precision that will give us long-term success from a mechanical point of view. Thus, reducing the risk of mechanical and technical failure and decreasing the risk of any biological problems. Fixing implants in a patient coaxing the cooperation of the bones of the jaw is very new in [Music] dentistry. No one should die with their teeth in a glass of water. Wise words spoken by a Swedish doctor, a certain professor Branomark who is known today as the father of modern dental implantology. Branomar was only 23 when he began studying blood circulation in bone tissue. For his experiments, he used an optical lens attached to a rabbit femur. Uh, what with titanium. At the end of the experiment, to his surprise, he couldn remove the lens from the femur. The bone and titanium had fused. This result inspired Branomark to try replicating his discovery in the mouth of a patient. And in 1965, history implants were born. Well, since then, things have evolved. We started with complete prosthesis. Then slowly in the 1980s, we tried small unit prosthesis. So, only one missing tooth, an implant. And since then, more and more we change. We We have implant surfaces that are more efficient and we more predictable. So, it we the limits a little more and the protocols that were very very long before are much faster and more efficient nowadays. [Music] Now, implants are changing. There are new materials. There are other things that are being developed. And from there we moved on to smart surfaces. Okay. And smart surfaces are surfaces that are able to give instructions to surrounding tissues to bone tissue. This means that we can control the amount of bone and the speed at which bone forms around an implant and have faster better healing around an implant. We can control the healing of an implant. quite well when we place it in the bone of a patient who is healthy in good health. But you know with the aging population a patient affected by age. So here we have a challenge in that we have to be able to work uh to work in an environment where the body is not at its optimum in good shape for healing. [Music] France Shaon who shouldn complications. Don little bit toward me. Thank you. Dr. Gertang is removing the small abutment guards that maintain access to the heads of the implants located under the gums. So the advantage with implants is that they little pieces that fit together. So, here I caps from these parts which prevent the gum from closing on top because if we didn gum would close completely. Dr. Gertang began by molding a perfect replica of M. Shaon has enabled her team to move through all the stages with constant verification to ensure that in the end the mechanics and the aesthetics will be just right. Laboratory technicians have worked with this working model and at every step we Dr. Gertang is seeing more and more patients like Ms. Shahon. Prostheses on implants are very popular and are quickly becoming the norm. But a new looming discovery could completely revolutionize the world of oral health and dentistry. The regeneration of natural teeth. Imagine replacing missing or damaged teeth simply by growing new ones. There are some of us who are thinking of regenerating teeth. Something we couldn That looking into. The body does things well. When a tooth erupts into the oral cavity, when the tooth grows, the body saves a memory, okay, under the gum. And each of us, we have that memory for each of our teeth in its place. We have the memory of what was there. It the right moment to activate it and the precise signal so that this kind of memory can make a new tooth. [Music] The Americans are investing a lot of money in this and the Brits have made major developments. So I think it a matter of time. But we can avoid needing to regrow our teeth if we just take care of the ones we have. Cavities are the most common dental disease and they havoc on our pearly whites well for as long as we 5,000 years ago in Egypt, tooth decay was often associated with evil creatures, believe it or not, that destroyed teeth as divine punishment. Tooth decay was associated with demons, uh, with worms that would eat the inside of the teeth. There have been all kinds of concepts to explain this intense evil. This demonic wriggling worm theory as the root cause of dental suffering was a persistent belief that lingered until the late 1700s. And so early attempts at treatment sought to exterminate these ghastly critters. The recommended solution, fumigation. That them with smoke. [Music] Take a look at these friendly faces from years gone by. But don any smiles. Teeth were rarely seen in oldtime portraits, at least until the 19th century. This supports the idea that mouths were nasty, and breath was even worse. Brushing teeth just wasn thing back then. According to some accounts, Empress Cece and Queen Elizabeth I had unsightly terrible teeth. A breakthrough came in the mid-9th century when Willoughby D. Miller, one of the greatest dentists of his time, introduced the idea that bacteria fueled by sugar were responsible for cavities in the mouth. These bacteria consumed sugars and produced acids as waste. Miller theorized that these acids ate through the enamel and caused cavities. And once there was a hole, a cavity in the tooth, it had to be closed up to prevent the tooth from further deteriorating and causing pain and suffering. Today we understand that tooth decay affects a tooth because there are microbes, microorganisms that are organized into bofilms. And there That sugar, and soft drinks, you may be able to prevent cavities, but you can still have some fun in life if you remember to use good old-fashioned toothpaste along with brushing and water. Honey, come see our new toothpaste with red stripes. It beautiful. In 1947, the arrival of toothpaste with fluoride changed the dental health landscape. This humble paste in a tube would revolutionize oral hygiene because it significantly reduced the speed at which cavities progressed and the complications that [Music] ensue. But dentistry isn cavities, implants, oral hygiene, and disease prevention. It having beautiful teeth. Some patients say, I can patients mouths. No, but I favored by nature, but not everyone is so lucky. [Music] She notes that more and more patients are looking for perfect teeth and a smile that [Music] I have many patients who ask for treatment, but their teeth are perfectly healthy. Some patients want to have smiles with very visible teeth, so bigger, more noticeable smiles. And in these cases, we aren making corrections, doing things that will be irreversible to these teeth because a tooth doesn these things. We can glue things together and we can reglue porcelain, etc., and make very beautiful, nice restorations, but they have lifespans, these restorations, and their lifespans are never as long as natural teeth. Teeth whitening is nothing new. We wanted whiter smiles for millennia. In ancient Rome, urine was the go-to ingredient when citizens wanted whiter teeth. Human and animal urine was collected in jars and left to sit there and concentrate so bacteria could convert nitrogen waste into ammonia. When the smell was at its most pungent, the product was deemed ready for use and gargled liberally as mouthwash. Is this why Rome [Music] fell? Lurching forward in time to the 1980s, we see the first use of hydrogen peroxide as a bleaching agent. Thank goodness for chemistry. Hydrogen peroxide is made with the chemical formula H2O2 in the form of a gel. It penetrates the tooth enamel, reaches the stains and oxidizes them. It is this oxidizing power that whitens the teeth. [Music] At the time, it had been used as a treatment for gum infections, but it was soon discovered to be a very effective bleaching agent. You pee goggling. On your back, please. Back to the present. This patient appears to be having a serious medical examination. But this machine, which looks very much like a scanner, will actually be looking at his teeth. New technology makes dental diagnostics faster and more accurate. And importantly, patients are exposed to far less radiation than they were with oldtime X-ray machines. And that technologies interesting is to be able to do imaging in very high resolution with dose levels that are relatively low. So they represented a revolution in terms of diagnostics for many areas of dentistry obviously because we now have visibility of pathologies which we didn have access to before this approach. Here situation where we called an included canine. That is a tooth and a young patient which won erupt. And here, well, this is exactly why we modality because we see in 3D, we able to visualize the position of this canine and appreciate its relationships with neighboring teeth. So, that in itself is extraordinary. How come? Because the orthodontist who will want to train that tooth, put it on the arch, he the canine. Otherwise, it would be difficult without these images. Then, of course, there could be some collateral damage. And look here. You see here the included canine. And look what going on. It neighboring tooth, the lateral incizer. And what does that cause? Resorption. Quite severe resorption. And look here. Be careful. Don Otherwise, we incizer. So the orthodontist will know how to move the K9 away. But before he wouldn Mhm. Dr. Gerten knows just what she doing. She has finished fitting the prosthesis on M. Shahon That look. Look. That looks great. I you up. I happy. You must feel good. Look, I have tears in my eye. You I happy. I see the bone levels, right? I see the six implants that have been placed, the abutments on them, my little screws. Everything is looking the way it should. From an aesthetic point of view, it suddenly leaving with a prosthesis that great. and the look of others can have such an impact on how we feel and her eating. She couldn before. She couldn she to restaurants. It makes a huge, huge difference. Wait, we dentures made out of animal and human teeth and urine flavored mouthwash. With acrylic resin prosthesis and today techniques, the world of dentistry is [Music] booming. Even though dentists haven always been the most popular medical practitioners, they today than ever before. People trust dentists to ensure the health and beauty of their teeth. Let will soon be more accessible to all mouths and all budgets. I guess altogether to have my teeth pulled out in the whole kit, it cost me 30,000. But I don think it I 3,000 and put 30,000 in my teeth than buy a new car. My teeth are more important. Moving from the mouth, we go a little higher up the face to the eyes, which humans have tried to heal in all sorts of ways over the centuries. Our eyes, they come in brown, blue, green, almond shapes, round. But whatever their color or shape, losing one worst fear all over the planet, second only to death. Now that says something. From our caveman days to the present, we eyes at all cost. In fact, an early edict from the history of medicine went something like this. If you put out someone your hands. We know how important our eyes are based on the simple fact that 30% of the neurons in our brain are used just for eyesight. As long as there have been nurses and doctors, eye care has always been a focus of their work. Vision problems have plagued us from the very beginning. It turns out that more than half of us will be affected by eye trouble at some point in our lives. Ill-fitting glass eyes, barbaric barber surgeries, costic soap, sour vinegar, sweet honey, drops to delay myopia, stem cells to cure blindness before it begins. Welcome to the fascinating world of opthomemology. Although he nervous, Mr. Contto is looking forward to his eye surgery. How you doing? I to see if I won and to see if you remember. Mr. KTO. Yeah, that seat. It test before going under the knife. From the top if you can. The top line. Z A F. So today we a cataract in each eye. This gentleman has a particular history. He was recently treated for an infection inside the eye, a fungal infection. It large cataract in his left eye and a smaller one in his right eye. I going to have a look through the microscope. So whenever I want to know something, to read something that ask my wife, what does it say here? It gets tiresome. So, I own, I So, you surgery? No, not nervous. I can But before we go any further and start cutting out cataracts? Let the basics. What exactly is ofthmology? Is the branch of medicine that treats diseases of the eye? A doctor who specializes in this discipline is called an opthalmologist. These medical experts detect, diagnose, treat and prevent diseases of the eye and its atexa. Those are the eyelids, conjunctiva and the lacrimal glands. Ofthalmologists also deal with optical pathways and the whole visual system. [Music] What we has to do with a small lens which sits at the front of the eye. It small magnifying glass we look through which should be transparent but for different reasons mostly because of aging. Opacities form inside the lens and at that point vision is lost because we lens. The word cataract was chosen long ago to describe the blurred impression of looking through water. Of course, everyone knows the Latin word cataracta means waterfall. There are different symptoms that present. It starts with generalized foggess. So, being able to see fewer details. Often there sensitivity. For example, in the evening people start having trouble with lights of oncoming cars and can say, And then ultimately it deteriorates and more and more vision is lost. Ultimately, if you wait too long, vision will be completely lost. But there still time to operate and restore vision if the cataract [Music] When it comes to eyes, Dr. Francine Matier Miller knows a thing or two about the subject. As a little girl, she kept them in her fridge, a gift from her ofthomeologist dad. Well, he was freezing corneas, eyes. At first, it was pig would donate their eyes. He froze them so he could graft them. Way back in 1966, her father founded Quebec eye bank at the Mesanv Rosemont Hospital in Montreal, Canada. Dr. Michelle Mature was a pioneer of opthalmology who had initiated his research, you guessed it, in his kitchen at home. When we opened the fridge door, we didn eggs. We saw dozens of eyes. I remember the little bowls with cotton pads and formalin and the eyes staring at us. A fridge full of eyes helped Dr. Francine Matthew Miller see and pursue her destiny. She right. After completing post-doal studies, she became the only female neuroopthalmologist in Canada in 1979. The goal of neuroopthmology is to understand the links between the eye and the brain and the way they relate to health and disease. In this family of eye specialists, the history of opthalmology is well known. For example, for example, here we see a patient who had an eye problem and was given a treatment made with soap, honey, and vinegar. I don problem. Another treatment was to lance the neck in hopes that the eye problem would heal. It is. These stories, amusing as they may seem, unless you are only a tiny peak at the long history of human efforts to help people see. Let time. In ancient Egypt, about 5,000 years ago, the word ofthmology hadn been invented, but many treatments and tools had. A variety of instruments and remedies were used, such as copper based eye drops. Ouch. They also used tweezers and big needles which we would certainly prefer to leave in the past. In India, the land of the third eye, the Vedas, sacred books dating back centuries before Christ actually mentioned eye diseases, but not two or three. No, no. 74 eye diseases are listed along with their remedies. This fellow, good old Sushuta, is considered to be humankind surgeon. He countless patients around 600 BCE, but we don surgeries he performed. Let book on that one. [Music] Well, back to our time. Hello, Mr. Hi there. This is your cap for the O. Please put it on. Yes. And here are slippers that you can wear over your socks. Perfect. Please have a seat when you Everyone is calm and composed. It for final preparations before entering the operating room. Nowadays, cataract surgery is quite straightforward. It might not seem that way to everyone, but for ofthmologists, it and that innovative, daring doctors and their incredibly courageous super patients who submitted to unspeakable oldtime treatments. Let the 18th century. This shows how they used a knife and pressed on the cataract, then pressed on the back to dislodge it. It would just fall out. It was important that the surgeon or the barber who did this have steady hands and work quickly because it was painful. Someone had to hold the patient the result wasn they could maybe see the sun now shadows you know so that was the technique and there was no anesthesia I have a book from 1732 by an of themologist the king written in old French and when he talks about cataracts he says this is 1732 he says we must be careful not to operate on just any cataract back because there are complications. And this was done without anesthesia, without antibiotics. But people were so desperate they were blind. Cataracts were the most common cause of poor vision back then. More than 200 years later, techniques and technology had greatly improved. Thank heavens. A patient now be replaced, but there was still room to refine the way things were done. Not bad. My father started replacing lenses, but the techniques weren perfect. He told me that after attaching his first lens, the patient returned with it hanging off his eye. So, they stopped. Oh, yes, I forgot to say the patients were suffering. The surgery required anesthesia. So, what they did, nerve number seven here below the ear paralyzes the entire face. So, they started doing facial aesia. By injecting that nerve, the whole face was paralyzed. So the patient didn their eye during the operation. That was dangerous. Some of those injections wound up going into the brain. Patients had seizures. If it went in an artery, they could have a heart attack. So in those days, my god, they had to be really blind to suffer through all that. In today science and modern techniques have reduced the risks enormously. Dr. Forte administers anesthesia. Open both eyes. It It And I simple as that. A few drops in the eyes and the opthalmologist is ready to replace the patient a new lens that thanks to modern science will stay firmly in place on the eye. We do this under local anesthesia topically. We give relaxance if the person is tense. I would say that I give relaxance to about a third of the people in the operating room. Most patients go through it very well. Patients say they see a lot of psychedelic lights during the operation. In fact, it microscope that they perceive with shadows of the instruments passing in front. Everything operation is about to begin. This is the time for those with strong eyesight but weak stomachs to look away. Watching eye surgery is fascinating, but it can make some a little squeamish. Well, at least there won So, look straight ahead at the three lights you see. Yeah. Yeah. Historically, many techniques have been used to access the inside of the eye, but modern techniques involve going through the cornea. We make two small incisions, one that the other will be precisely 2.2 mm to gain access to what anterior chamber. So it the iris and behind the cornea. It transparent window in the front of the eye. Now we lens envelope. So normally the anterior chamber is filled with a clear liquid called the aquous humor which we have to replace at the beginning of surgery with a visco elastic substance. And then we get to work on the lens because that subsequently placing the artificial lens. It Dr. Forte and his opthalmologist colleagues aren highly trained specialists with very adept hands for surgery. As we lucky for Mr. KTO because if he had needed this operation prior to the middle of the 19th century, well, he wouldn he would have gone to a barber surgeon. That bits. Barbers were known to perform certain surgeries that doctors didn do. To summarize the division of labor at the time, better educated medical doctors treated internal pathologies. Those were thought to be nobler. Barber surgeons who were trained on the job handled so-called external diseases, including those of the eyes, as well as amputations, skin problems, cauterization of wounds, and good old-fashioned bloodletting. The doctors, the early eye doctors thought it was too uh it was barbaric to remove a cataract like that. They said it was too dangerous for infection. So, they said, barbers. and they did the surgery. Fortunately, along the way, someone realized this practice was absurd. In 1845, the Montreal Eye and Ear Institute was founded in Canada. It offered specialized eye care more than a century before became an official branch of medicine, which wouldn 1966. Today, throughout the world, more than 94 million cataract procedures are performed each year. There surgery. It my practice because people experience a radical change in terms of their visual function. There I the next day or the day after that. So, people are very grateful in general. You all right, Mr. Contto? Oh, yeah. Now I unfolding right now. I inserted the distal part directly into the envelope of the lens. And the proximal part I insert here in the capsular bag. It will center itself because it has small legs that extend which unfold gently. It We Artificial lenses like the one Mr. Contto just received have been used for more than 70 years now. This is but one of the many remarkable advances in ofthromology. Dr. Cynthia Syakan is assistant clinical professor in the department ofology at university de moral as well as researcher and surgeon at Montreal The lenses of the future, even what we have now, are becoming clearer and clearer and providing clearer vision at different distances. What we don that the natural human lens is extremely complex. And even if over time it becomes opaque and turns into a cataract, it can still adapt to different distances which artificial lenses are not necessarily able to do. So the idea is that the technology is moving in a direction where the lenses used to replace the cataract will assume more and more natural properties of a lens. One that is clear and will remain clear throughout its life after the surgery. [Music] That eye, Mr. Kaisa. Wonderful. Close both eyes. So, that wasn well. Good. As I said, you won eye. We just operated on for about 10 minutes. Okay. It that. Okay. You all right? Yes. Hello. Very good. The nurse will explain everything. Okay. Perfect. Have a great afternoon. Thank you very much. Welcome. Hello, Mr. Contto. Oh, hi. After an hour of surgery, a few drops, and a few instructions, Mr. KTO is ready to head home. He tomorrow for a post-operative follow-up, but to his surprise, he realizes that his eyesight has already improved. There you are. So, I can see you pretty well. I see the squares here. I didn them before. I can nearly see the dates. That January 24. Well, Pierre hasn months, and so he autonomy, and it too, because obviously I couldn him alone for too long. So, for his safety, one time, he broke a glass while I was napping. I had to get up quickly so he wouldn little things in everyday life like that that you don your sight. And the best part of this story is that Mr. Contto continue to improve over the coming days. He colors much better. You know ladies who have had perms and wind up with orange hair? Well, that It colors and they shouldn house when they have cataracts because the colors after they surgery, they say, yellow. That\\ People always say that when it clearer. Ah, the colors are so pretty. While some cases of cataracts have caused terrible hair don may have contributed to the signature style of renowned artists. Does Clode Monet ring a bell? His beautiful water scenes? His lunch on the grass? Many opthalmologists have had fun studying artists works to see if they had defects in their eyes. And Monae, now it cataracts. In 1912, when he was 72, Monae was diagnosed with cataracts in both eyes after complaining of not being able to see anything out of his right eye and very little out of his left. His paintings from that period are predominant in shades of red and yellow, while blues are nearly absent. So, there were the waterlies, which he painted a lot, and there was the Japanese bridge. And before the cataracts, everything clear, everything beautiful, and there When the cataracts come, the colors change. The water lilies are all deformed. The Japanese bridge is barely recognizable. We only see a structure. It That artists with eye problems, here another name, Leonardo da Vinci. One would have to have lived underground for more than six centuries not to have heard of him. This larger than-l life 15th century Italian artist didn suffer from cataracts, but from strabismas. Strabismas causes one eye to deviate relative to the other. This condition would have given Da Vinci a unique vision of the world and influenced the way he drew perspectives. That his [Music] genus. Strabismas and cataracts are just two of the thousands of pathologies in opthalmology. But those who suffer from these conditions don worldrenowned artists. Most are desperate for treatment. To give an overall idea at the offmology center here at the University of Montreal, we have subsp specialists in many fields. We have specialists in strabismas who deal with crossed eyes if you will, glaucoma specialists, coral disease specialists, neuroopthmology, oculoplasty and so on. There are a lot of them and within each of these specialties there are myriad of diseases that we treat. Of these, myopia is probably the best known and that not surprising because it affects almost 30% of Canadians. By 2050, it estimated that it myopia is the leading cause of blindness worldwide. Myopia has genetic origins. So in some families, we find that almost all the children are nearsighted because one or both of the parents are nearsighted themselves. But there are also environmental factors that can affect myopia. potentially the use of screens or the overuse of screens during childhood. But thanks to retinal implants and the work of Dr. Kan, some hereditary degenerative diseases of the eye can now be cured. A decline in proteins causes the retinal cell not to function at 100%. So one vision can decline over the years and can even result in total loss if the disease becomes advanced enough. In the first generation of solutions, what they invented were retinal implants or what commonly known as bionic eyes. So patients who come to see me often ask. Are we replacing the whole eye? The answer is no. What it is in fact is a retinal chip that is placed on the retina and attached to external glasses. So they can see. And these glasses are to be worn like this. And then they work with the retinal implant. So people who lost their vision will be able to say, I see two people in front of me. course it people who have lost all sight because of a genetic disease, it breakthrough. Another important breakthrough which is even outshining retinal implants is gene therapy. It involves introducing genetic material into cells to treat a pathology like laybear congenital amorosis, a rare genetic disease that causes visual impairment in childhood. There RP65. And now there is a treatment for this condition in human beings where through retinal surgery we can inject the missing gene which will produce the missing protein which will in turn allow the visual cycle to resume in those people who are affected. Often they losing or have lost their sight very very early in life often before the age of 10 if they to gene therapy, we can now stop the progression of the condition and allow them to retain their vision for school and later life. Back the next day at the Mezonev Rosemont Hospital, Mr. Contto is attending his post-operative follow-up. Here, I So, we had a pretty blurred picture of your fundus because of the cataract that was impairing your vision. That was before. And here we have a picture of the seamoi today. So it all the blood vessels. We see the center retina. And here sections. The central retina is really nice. It makes your visual acuity very good. Things have gone very well, Mr. Contto. It be happy with the result. Things should keep improving. It improves the quality of life because It know. But when you can else has to do everything for you. When you want to read, when you want to know something, you always have to ask someone. In my case, my wife helped me. So, if I can do things on my own, that I [Music] And the happiness is spreading around the world. More than a 100 million people will have eye surgery this year. From the very first eye treatments of ancient Egypt to the state-of-the-art surgeries performed today, health care professionals are continually improving their techniques and is only the tip of the iceberg. From artificial intelligence that helps detect disease and microchips that restore vision to corneas repaired by stem cells, the future of opthomemology brings hope for this generation and the next. Perhaps the day will soon come when no person will have to live without one of our most important senses, our sight. [Music] When I started in 1978, everything I learned in athalmology I don from the old days. Opthalmology is very stimulating. I cataracts, but there are lasers that have arrived. There ultrasound, too. There are all sorts of new techniques. It being done. Opthalmology has always been on the cutting edge and we and better for new things we can do. We Masonerv Hospital to have been the first in Quebec to perform retinal implant surgery. And for gene therapy in the next few months in collaboration with St. Justine and the children will be first to treat children with laybear congenital amorosis. I think the field of themology is expanding. So what we want at the end of the day is to keep innovating with interesting research so we can have more and more tools to treat our patients. We the right track. Have a great day. Thank you so much, Dr. Forte. My pleasure. Take care. Until next time, we Yes, sir. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye-bye. Now, they work real miracles.

Landes Forest: From Pine Empire to Green Future | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAzMMJ-PP9E	SLICE Science	[Music] The forest emerging 350 million years ago, it 80% of the planet forests and their treasures guarantee the survival of one in five human beings. But day after day, forests are shrinking as mankind grapples with an increasingly urgent dilemma. How can we reconcile our ever rising demands with the need to protect forests precious resources? In the four corners of the earth, forests are buzzing with innovative solutions that also respect the living world. Men and women are drawing on scientific research, ancestral traditions, and their imaginations to reinvent the forest practices of tomorrow. Here forces to rewrite the great history of man and the forest. [Music] [Laughter] [Music] In southwestern France along the Atlantic lies a stretch of green ocean, the jewel of Gaskini, the lawn forest. But just two centuries ago, this immense 1 million hectare pine forest did not exist. It was entirely man-made. The massive project covered this area of France with the largest artificial forest in Western Europe. Since its creation in the 19th century, this enormous plantation was meant to play a key role in French industry. But the forest is struggling to adapt to the 21st century with its countless upheavalss. Without human intervention, it won survive. And this dependence is weighing heavier and heavier on the tens of thousands of foresters who live off its timber. Today, more than ever, the forest needs to be reinvented to strike a balance in a changing world. But man is at the heart of the lawn forest. Will he manage to rise to the challenge? The lawn forest owes its existence to a scourge that humans have always fought. Sand to understand what about the lawn forest in Gaskani. The dune of pilot offers a good perspective because it Sand is omniresent here. We can see the contours and ripples of sand. The lawn territory stretching over a million hectars. You with its mild, damp climate that bathed the entire region. And you wind. [Music] There are three oceans here. The blue ocean, the Atlantic, the dune, an ocean of pale ochre sand, and the green ocean of the pine canopy. I love that time early in the morning or late at night when the dune has been swept clean of all traces. Everything marks sand. The tiniest bird, lizard, or fox that passed here on its way to the ocean in the morning. Each creature leaves traces on the dune. The dune is a book where we can read everything that happened during the night. [Music] A dune is a giant on the move. With the ocean blocking it on one side, it uses the wind to advance relentlessly inland. [Music] Two centuries ago, there was nothing here to stop it. The sand advanced up to 40 m in land per year, swallowing up swamps and pastures, houses and villages as it went. Tall beach grass was planted to stabilize the dunes, but it wasn enough to halt the unstoppable daily progression. In the wake of the French Revolution, an engineer came up with a crazy scheme to create a huge forest that would act as a barrier to the [Music] dune. The tree he had in mind was an indigenous variety that was perfectly adapted to the sandy soil and climate of Auten, the maritime pine. [Music] Maritime pines were artificially planted along the stretch of dune to keep it in place and prevent the dunes from advancing inland and engulfing the villages, which happened to several along the coast here, where churches and villages had to be moved as the sand progressed. [Music] Once we pass the handful of villages sprinkling the lawn coast, we find an immense heath, a wet land of which only a few vestigages [Music] remain. Imagine how at the time the heath stretched over a million hectars. A million hectares of wetlands with open expanses as far as the eye can see where shepherds and their animals roamed. It was really quite unique. This immense marshy plane had a bad reputation. It was the presumed source of countless illnesses, earning it the nickname of unhealthy desert. But what convinced Napoleon III to plant millions of pine trees in the land had nothing to do with hygiene. It may sound rather simplistic, but it was purely commercial. We all know the saying, if you want to kill your dog, blame rabies. The heartlands of the London were blamed for every evil. malaria, disease, a range of afflictions. It was said people lived poorly here, but actually there was an entire functioning culture and they took a rural pastoral economy with its culture and way of life and turned it into a forest culture. With the industrial revolution in full swing, the maritime pine was looked upon as the golden tree. Its timber was used to build railways and its resin turned into tarpentine which the budding chemical industry was particularly eager for. In 1857, a gigantic planting scheme began that would radically change the culture and economy of the entire region. The inhabitants of Bond went from being shepherds to resin collectors and lumberjacks. 150 years after its creation, the pine forest is still the driving economic force in Akiten. The extraction of resin, which became too costly in terms of manpower, has been replaced by timber operations for building and the paper industry. The timber sector currently employs over 30,000 people and provides France industry with nearly half the wood it [Music] needs. Passed on from generation to generation, the lawn forest is privately owned, currently divided up into nearly 50,000 properties. Rion is 72. He comes from one of the oldest families involved in exploiting the lawn forest. I have memories of coming here with my grandfather for the first time. He taught me how to tell the difference between the vegetation on good land and not so good land. He told me a lot. From the 60s to the 80s, the forest was a busy place. There were resin collectors, lumberjacks. They felled the trees by hand, so there were lots of them. The forest was a lively place. You heard shouts, singing. You everywhere in it. Everyone would call out. The ambiencece was very [Music] pleasant. Trees are life. We watch them grow from year to year. That proud. These trees are 65 years old and were planted by our ancestors, our fathers. My grandfather also helped plant these. I was young and I saw him plant here. The trees are Jeanju joy. A sense he has passed on to his son Jasma, who will soon take over the operation. The two of them are marking trees in a plot of land to prepare for thinning. The other one one. 140 140 160 160 lots of branches. Yes, there are. There are a few like that. There compared to the other. See, look at the difference. Thinning gives the trees vitality. You start with,50 pines per hectare and end up 60 years later with 250 or 300 per hectare. It gives them light and lets them grow big and tall. It indispensable because without light, the pines would stagnate like all plants. Working a plot my grandfather planted is a real pleasure. It 160. Okay. I learned how to mark pines with my father. I do it exactly the way my grandfather did, the way the resin collectors did. The techniques been had to down over the ages. Good circumference, but big knots. Yes, the knots are big. For a forester, this is one of the best moments. Being with your son, marking trees, talking together, asking, It us. The payoff is beautiful pines with nice trunks. In the lawn, every tree farmer concern is increasing the profitability of their land. In other words, producing the best pines, perfectly straight and without too many branches. To do so, they endeavor to improve the variety. Sylvia culturists have an ally in their quest for the ideal tree. scientific research. Ani Rafael, an engineer with the INRA, the National Institute for Agricultural Research, helms a program aimed at improving the maritime pine. Patient selection and controlled breeding have led to trees that are better adapted to forest exploitation. The INRA began improving the maritime pine in 1960. The first step was to select trees that stood out from their neighbors in terms of size, straightness, and perfect branches. Technicians scoured the lawn and located these trees, harvested branches from them, and grafted them many times. Grafting is a reproductive technique that allows several exact copies of the same tree to be obtained in order to pass on its complete genetic makeup to [Music] seedlings by grafting branches from the best adult pines. Their qualities can be widely distributed. Only pines with the same ideal genetic profile must be crossed. A lot of hard work goes into selective reproduction, which has nothing to do with nature. The flowers are isolated in airtight bags, then artificially fertilized by injecting pollen from the male pines inside. This is the only way to guarantee the correct genetic makeup is passed on. In our selection program, we have to monitor the pedigrees of individual trees to know exactly who their parents and grandparents were since it imperative not to cross two related individuals. Because like animals, trees suffer from consenuinity. And breeding two siblings together will result in a family that has trouble growing and thriving afterwards. But before the right crossbreedings can be performed, specimens with the perfect profile must be located. 40 years ago, the INRA selected 700 exceptionally upright and robust pines. Today, these trees have fathered much of the lawn forest. I recognize this tree. It parrot that I know some of these trees because I used them for interbreeding. Today we see their descendants. After me, someone will continue the selection process with the following generations. The selection program for a forest tree is on a very long time scale. Between the time we cross two good parents and the time the best descendants are ready in an improved variety, it can take 20 years for a complete selection cycle. That means that today we are already looking into trees that will be able to grow in the climate of 2050. The goal is to provide the tree farmer with improved varieties improved for growth, straightness, adaptation to environmental conditions in a way that supports lumber production in Akiten by joining forces. Scientists and siliculturists have met the challenge of productivity. Whereas at the start of the 20th century, it took 60 years before the pines were ready to be cut, today they reach maturity after 40 years. For Jean and his son, today is a big day. They cutting. To observe clear cutting is to understand the logic behind the perfect geometry of the lawn forest. The pines were planted in rows to facilitate the movement of equipment and the distance between each row was calculated to accommodate the movements of the tree felling equipment. It forest. We fell the trees and then replant 5 years later on average. [Music] Clearing a forest after you spend time marking the trees is satisfying, but later when you see the bare land, it gives you a little pang. It doesn time it takes to replant. Once you replant, you don anymore. The alternation of thinning, clear cutting, and replanting sets the tempo in this forest operation. Without constant human attention, the forest is vulnerable. Left to its own devices. Disaster ensues. 1949. The war had forced tree farmers off their land, and few had returned. The forest was cluttered with dead wood and undergrowth. That summer was particularly dry, and the people here today remember what ensued. The fire destroyed nearly half the forest and claimed 82 lives. But the lesson wasn 60 years later, the Lawn Forest is considered a model in firefighting tactics. [Music] Our mission is to cut the right flank of the fire and put up a tip. Okay. Firemen train every day in order to be prepared. Dozens of watchtowers have been built and 500 strategically placed wells provide firefighters with the water they need. The concerted action of public authorities and foresters has created 28,000 km of trails that firefighters use on practically a daily basis. Since the system has been in place, the number of fires has dropped considerably. The tree farmers themselves formed an association and helped us set up the forest trails which are strategic for us because they let us get right inside the forest to each plot. So they helped us set this up and also the forest wells which provide water for our fire trucks let us fight fires more effectively. The results obtained by the close cooperation between sylvviulturists and firefighters prove it problems a forest the size of the land presents. The special feature of our southwest technique is that it is based on the topography of the forest that allows us to penetrate right into it. The forest is relatively maintained and relatively flat. So the trucks can drive through the undergrowth. It can go where the fire is. Unlike other forest fighting techniques, notably in the southeast where the topography forces you to wait for the fire on trails and paths and try to stop it at those spots. These innovative measures have come just in time considering that today global warming has increased periods of drought. Since its creation, the forest has never been at such a high risk of fire. But although fire can be managed by human intervention, there foe no one can do anything about. Wind. In just two decades, the forest has suffered four catastrophic windstorms. The most violent Cyclone Claus blasted across the lawn on January the 24th, 2009. Some gusts were close to 200 [Applause] [Music] kmh. The consequences were tragic. 12 casualties and nearly 400,000 hectares of forest destroyed. The destructive power of the wind was multiplied by another factor, the dampness of the ground in winter. In soil softened by rain, the wind toppled the trees one on top of the other, and they fell like dominoes. [Music] For the Sylvia culturists of the land, January the 24th, 2009 was an electroshock that raised a crucial question. Was the storm a meteorological oddity or a sign of things to come? [Music] What about you? Each time Jean Vong returns to a plot of land which still hasn he recalls that terrible night where he nearly lost everything. One morning I was making the rounds of this plot and saw the results of Clouse. We lost nearly two hectares of pines that were on the ground. We were devastated when we saw the trees down, broken. It was a sight we A war scene. a peculiar site that accept. We didn whether we should continue our operation like before. At first, I had doubts. [Music] Since the storm of 2009, all the lawn foresters have had doubts. In a future where the devastation caused by storms will become more and more frequent, is the lawn forest sustainable? [Music] To determine why the damage was so extreme in the lawn, scientists wanted to take a closer look at the maritime pine and particularly its roots. The roots make up almost half the tree. They play an important role in terms of water and mineral absorption, but also for stability in the long and even in Europe. Stability is a major problem because it damage in forests more so than insects or fire. In Europe, it How much do you think that was going to be with that circumference and height? Two or three tons. Engineers with the INRA have set up tests to understand a fundamental feature, the maritime pine resist wind. These winches are able to tear out trees the way gale winds would. Our first goal with these measurements is to understand why they fall. We had huge amounts of damage in our forest with the trees that fell and we want to understand how they fall and what factors make a tree fall more easily or not. Is it genetic? Is it the way it something else such as plantation density? Uprooting the trees also gives insight into the soil structure of the lawn forest. The soil is loose and sandy and doesn provide much grip for the pine roots whose development is limited by the very shallow friatic zone in these former marshlands. But another phenomenon also explains the weak anchoring of the maritime pine, a rock hard layer that has accumulated over the centuries beneath the action of the rainwater washing the sand. Alios, a type of sandstone. Alios acts like a mineral shield between 40 cm and a meter deep that the pine roots can pierce through. [Music] Here 33 17 13. A computer model of the root system gives a better understanding of how maritime pines adapt to the constraints of the lawn soil. The treere routt is quickly blocked by alios while lateral roots develop horizontally just a few cm below the surface. The roots of the tree stop growing within its first few years. In the lawn forest, it uncommon that a tree standing 50 m tall is only anchored a few dozen cm deep in the soil. [Music] The weak rooting of the pine is one reason it it [Music] reason. Eve Bou is a researcher with the INRA who studies the impact of windstorms on the forest as a whole. his tools, animometers, and sensors placed at top an observation tower. Wind is a meteorological phenomenon first driven by differences in atmospheric pressure. Then when it arrives near the ground, it can be modified by the presence of trees, vegetation, buildings, and so on. When wind reaches a forest, for instance, it is slowed by the mechanical action of the trees. There is very little wind right along the ground while above the forest there is still a lot. So at the top of the forest there a huge variation in wind velocity. There what generates turbulence. The research at the INR has helped us to understand how wind picks up velocity and why it has such an impact in some places. With a few gusts, the wind starts to knock down one tree, then two, then three. We get a characteristic hole where the wind gets funneled in and accelerates and at that point starts attacking the forest more seriously. We notice holes in the direction of the wind, which some people call wind corridors. That happens rather frequently. The parceling up of the land and the difficulty of coordinating action for the forest as a whole are other weak points of the lawn forest. To anticipate the next windstorm, researchers are already imagining wind impact on a different scale, that of the entire forest. Foresters have thought a lot on the scale of the parcel. We a larger scale, that of the forest scape, the entire forest. We try to understand if the amount of fragmentation of the forest can have an impact on its wind resistance. When you go about in the lawn, you see the forest is not continuous. There are corn fields, homes, clearings. There variety. Depending on our results, we could begin recommending plots be grouped together, coordinated cutting, things like that. In an environment where the forest is extremely fragmented and divided with lots of small properties, it necessarily a very easy thing to get people to accept. While climate upheavalss concern all foresters, some of them are even starting to reconsider the very basis of the lawn forest itself. Jacazera, owner of 200 hectares of forest, is one of them. The night of the cyclone, I immediately realized that I was going to have to change something if I wanted to remain in the forestry business. Concerned by the losses caused by windstorms, Jacazera has considered every alternative strategy. One alone has retained his attention. Provi culture based on forest management that respects natural processes of forest growth and regeneration. But natural forest means several varieties of trees in the same plot of land. A principle that goes against the purpose of the lawn forest founded on the monoculture of maritime pines. Here I It a healthy mix of [Music] varieties. We have the oak here, but a little further on there are pines and a few ash. A relatively large blend of varieties. Broad leaves have a very important influence on how a forest functions. For instance, in a forest of maritime pines, even just a few broad leaves will help enrich the soil a bit. In other words, broad leaves develop when the soil is a little more fertile than next door. And then once they improves the quality of the soil. So having them improves the conditions for growing maritime pines. Let the maritime pine is the largest variety for almost every tree farmer. And that why a very powerful commercial and industrial sector exists. [Music] Poly culture opens up new perspectives, but it also represents a radical rupture with the forestry model that has been in operation for decades. To change the forest, you must first change the people. And in the lawn, habits die hard. But a parasite could possibly change everything. With the 21st century, a phenomenon already well known to lumberjacks has exploded to the point of decimating entire ecosystems. Biological invasions. Entomologist Elijel has been closely studying the destructive insects that have invaded the land. Most of the world currently experiencing a massive increase in public health risks and the lawn forest is no exception. This is linked to two major phenomena. First, climate change and second, biological invasions. Climate change means a rise in temperatures that favor insects because they make more generations per population, so greater proliferation, which means more damage to trees. Biological invasions are all the insects that are introduced during commercial exchanges, containers that arrive in ports and airports. The insects emerge from these introductory zones and head to the forest where they develop epidemics because they aren by their natural enemies. [Music] Heading up the list of the pine forest enemies is a parasite well known to tree farmers, the pine processionary caterpillar. The lawn forest is the ideal environment for this fearsome herbivore. The maritime pine is perfect as conifers are the habitat of choice for these voracious insects. They spin their cocoons in the branches and feed on its needles. Colonies of pine processionaries weaken the trees they infest by devouring their leaves each day. Even if the tree doesn weakened by the attack. It develops poorly and becomes an easy prey for other [Music] pests. The fight against processionary caterpillars is urgent and not an easy one, especially in a forest as vast as the land. [Music] But rather than reflect upon treatment with insecticides, scientists are looking at the defenses developed by the ecosystem itself. Research on pine forests throughout the world have led to a surprising observation. Damage caused by processionary caterpillars is much greater in forests planted exclusively of pines than in forests where several varieties of tree grow. Vakel decided to look into the predators of this destructive pest. I pine eggs that came from a lab here onto a branch of maritime pine. Comparing different ecosystems will help determine which ones the processionary enemies thrive best in. The goal is to understand why there is more predation among blends of maritime pines and broad leaves, notably birch, than in pure pine populations. The great tit is one of the rare birds that dare attack the nests of processionary caterpillars with their fearsome, irritating hairs. Only the hoopo is more effective. It digs up cocoons hidden in the soil, destroying nearly 70% of processionary lava. Unfortunately, these two types of birds have a hard time adapting to a forest comprised exclusively of maritime pines. What we aim to do is put up a preventative biological fight consisting of diversifying the varieties of forest trees to offer different habitats for the natural enemies that live in mixed forests and can thus naturally control any type of destructive insect that attacks the maritime pine. Be it the processionary pine, bark beetle, or other potentially invasive insect that could find its way into our forests. Although the processionary caterpillar makes foresters nervous, the threat of an even more voracious parasite looms over the lawn forest, the pinewilt neode. This microscopic worm has already decimated entire forests in Japan. It penetrates the tree itself and dries it up by blocking the circulation of water. Today, it has arrived at the threshold of Europe. It travels in the abdomen of certain longhorn beetles which are already here. One of them is the monocamus or soya beetle. Soyers are what we call insect vectors of the nematode. The nematode may be exotic from China but the vector the insect has always been present in Europe. It indigenous. The pine wilt neode is currently only in Portugal where it was introduced and discovered in 1999. It multiplies extremely fast, a generation every 5 days, and it can kill a tree within 3 weeks. It estimate the soya how quickly the nematode can spread, we determined the soya beetle has an extraordinary flight capacity up to 40 km per generation. That means the front can advance by 40 km a year, which explains that it will gradually reach Spain and arrive in France sooner or later. In Portugal, despite control measures, chemical treatments, and the establishment of safety zones, the neode has spread throughout the entire country in 5 years. For the land, there is only one potential defense. Boost the forest We now know that mixed forests with several varieties of tree have a lot more advantages than simply controlling pests. For example, they productive, more resistant to drought. They biodiversity. They inviting for people, too. So, there are many advantages to silver culture that isn associates different tree varieties. When the lawn forest was created, biodiversity wasn And perhaps that is the forest heel. The coastal forests that were planted in the 19th century are monospacific, mainly with maritime pines and a relatively modest understory with a bit of heather, some ferns, and a few strawberry trees, but it lacks compartments of the ecosystem. So these forests are relatively more sensitive. A more diverse forest has huge ecological advantages, but in the eyes of forest operators, the determinating factor of these more natural foresting practices remain the increase in profitability. I practice a form of tree farming that possible. What that means is I consider the ecosystem to be my real production tool. It isn forest that are going to harm and damage it. If I manage to have ecosystems that are in their most natural state possible, that most effective and productive. My concerns are economic. I aim to live off my forest. But to do so, I can the soil, the climate, the wildlife there, plant diversity. It In the end, if all that is working well, my earnings are improved. My production goals are what is the highest, the most noble, the most profitable type of wood. Knowing that a tree you that you used yourself. knowing that that tree has become timber and is now part of a house or a piece of furniture, a stairway or desk. Now, obviously that satisfying. There emotional aspect, but that There the wood for beams or rafters, the time it takes the tree to grow, say 80 years, well that of carbon gas trapped from the atmosphere and stored underfoot in the tree. Then if we make beams from it, that means another 100 or 200 or 300 years the carbon is stored and doesn make it into the ozone layer. [Music] So, it the climate, to the evolution of our societies. [Music] Jacazera has revived a type of forest that greatly resembles the original lawn forest. The one that covered a tiny part of the land long before man planted a million hectares of maritime [Music] pines. Only a few eyelets of this ancient forest ecosystem remain around the dune. One of its last vestigages lies in the north of the region near Kuso [Music] Pond. This original forest has always stood up well to storms, fires, and parasite infestations. With a rich multitude of animal and plant species, could this forest have something to teach us? Here we pass through a little clump of royal fern. We dune. To the right are eagle ferns, which are found everywhere in the land forest. Royal ferns are more rare and restricted to cool, damp areas. They lend a bit of a tropical aspect. Here we are in what we call a natural forest that appeared shortly after the formation of the old parabolic dunes around 1500 years ago. It species we see around us. Maritime pine which is native to the region. predunculate oak, birch, evergreen oak, strawberry trees. There varieties. The ecosystem had time to develop with all its components and diversity. It are living forests, forests in which we find several classes of vertebrates and invertebrates. So, an abundance of animal and plant life. And that is indeed a plus. [Music] In this original eyelet, the forest contains all the elements necessary for its balance. Thanks to them, it has better withstood storms and parasite infestations and has spontaneously regenerated after fires. It is man guarantee the future of the artificial pine forest he created. The diversification of tree varieties is not the only solution to these problems. But it is time to understand that to fully realize the potential of the lawn forest, be it ecological or economical, man has everything to learn from the complex and perfect equation created by nature itself.

Ordinary People, Extraordinary Heroes | SLICE SCIENCE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoQTER8Iz00	SLICE Science	[Music] My name is Abigail Marsh. I professor of psychology and neuroscience at Georgetown University. And I studied the roots of altruism and compassion in the human brain for about 20 years. Everybody has read about people who save other people that everybody stories or movies, but um it completely different as it turns out when it happens. The accident happened when I was 19. And as I was coming back into town, crossing up over a bridge, a little dog ran out in front of my car. And the combination of swerving and hitting the dog resulted in my car starting to fish tail across the freeway. I finally came to rest in the fast lane of the freeway. And I just sat there thinking I was gonna die at any minute until um out of nowhere a man appeared at the passenger side window of my car and he knocked on the window. He said, help. again, gunned us back across the freeway to park behind his own car, which was a BMW as I remember. I forgot to say thank you. And he said, And then he disappeared. Got back in his car and the night swallowed him up. And uh I am certain that he saved my life. I think it had a um really profound impact on me to know that a stranger by sheer luck was willing to save my life despite not knowing anything about me by not even having the good grace to say thank you. Uh, and knowing how dangerous what he did was, I think made it all the more impressive. [Music] care or compassion is itself motivated by just the apprehension or the inference that somebody else needs help, right? Somebody they so if we want to understand altruism, why it is that people help strangers, we have to understand the sequence of events that leads from just detecting that somebody is in some sort of distress uh to that leads to care and that ultimately leads to altruism. Hopefully you remember the key structures that are involved in generating care for offspring, which is really important because we think that it of mammals certainly to care for their offspring that is the sort of origin of all different kinds of care, all different kinds of care-based altruism in the world. [Music] [Music] In the beginning, it was me who insisted on going to see the fireworks. My wife and I quickly ate and then went outside to buy some ice cream. [Music] [Music] My wife becomes agitated behind me. She feels some wind getting stronger and stronger. She turns around and she sees a truck on the pavement running people over. By the time I understood what was happening, the truck was driving past me on the pavement and I decided to drive right after it. My wife starts panicking. She drags me back. She doesn time, I I break and I tell her to get away precisely. And then I resume the chase on my scooter. I tried to catch up with the truck. The noise, the screams. I mean, this is horrible. Horrible. [Applause] I managed to catch up with it and I throw my scooter in front of it. I try to throw my scooter in front of it. I fall. I get back on my feet and I try to run to the cabin. It some stronger inner strength and I managed to step on the truck footboard and the windows open and I hit with all my strength in the face. There are no words, only the blows. No screams, nothing. He gun in his hand. He shoots, but he misses me. And I keep on I hit I hit until it stops. [Music] [Music] I hear gunshots getting closer and closer, and I slide under the truck wheel. And that a bit shaken because I think the police don that They handcuff me. They shake me. [Music] I hear massive confusion in the police channels. That [Music] [Music] [Music] After that, I beat. I exhausted for months. I just keep crying. And then around mid August mute it starts to worsen and then I I kind of switch off for about a month and a half. I have a syndrome. It syndrome and I don [Music] This is really kind of an amazing phenomenon at a species level. And so that the even bigger question is how did we get to the place biologically speaking as a species that you know along the course of evolutionary development we developed the desire to engage in behaviors like these at all. There has to be something in addition to the ability to recognize others distress and experience care because all mammals can do that. So what addition to that? [Music] The amygdala means almond in Latin and it is sort of almond shaped if you look at it from the side. It that is uh underneath the surface of the brain. So it structure that we share with all other vertebrate species and um it about 2 cm or so in diameter. And it structure that a few different emotional and social processes, but it important for coordinating uh the experience of [Music] fear. Okay, Kurt, how you doing? All right. All right. We the first scan. This is just a structural scan uh that lasts about four and a half minutes. And you can just lie back and relax and hold nice and still while the scan is running. Okay. Okay. All perfect. But the group that we settled on uh for our first research was people who had decided to donate one of their own kidneys to a stranger, which is clearly an extraordinary form of altruism to undergo surgery to have a healthy organ removed to be given to somebody that you some cases may never meet. So I looked at how we respond to the sight of somebody else who is frightened. And what we found is that their amydala was uh more reactive in response to the sight of somebody else seem to be more responsive to others distress. So it seems that somehow um they just more sensitive to the sight of other people I keep seeing in my mind this lady lying on the ground that I managed to avoid. And this this will be forever etched in my memory. That for sure. Fear is there. Worry about what to happen is there constantly but compassion is more powerful. They say okay this could happen to you but continue continue. When you situation, u part of what the amydala is doing is signaling another region called the hypothalamus to send messages down to actually your kidneys uh and to the adrenal glands that sit on top of your kidneys and that release adrenaline and cortisol in stressful situations. Um and uh it is definitely true that when adrenaline is being released, your body is more capable than it would be when adrenaline is not being released. So that it kind of makes sense that very altruistic people would get an even bigger burst of adrenaline potentially when they help. Uh it was the day before my mother to have the family together. She said, And this region of Canada, specifically in the Rocky Mountains, the weather can change really quickly. And it did. And a storm blew in really, really fast. [Music] As we rode our bikes back down the road, we could hear through the trees somebody yelling. We could see that there was somebody in distress in the water way out in the water. So far that we couldn them. All I could hear was that they were yelling for help. First hundred meters, I would say, I wasn water. I was swimming arm over arm with my face up because it was just too freezing. And I could feel my heart palpitating and I could feel the adrenaline rushing through my system. But I knew that the best chance these people had was for somebody to let them know that it was going to be okay. I believe I swam approximately 15 minutes to the canoe. As I got closer to what I now could see was a couple in the water, but they were so cold. They were both blue in the face. The woman almost purple. In fact, they had been there for quite some time, it would appear because they weren speak with me at all. They weren to communicate. And they were clearly in shock. I noticed on the front of the canoe there was a rope. And so I take the rope, I wrap it around my left wrist, even though I can barely feel my hands, and I start to side stroke back to shore, thinking, to be here any minute. Just hold on. Just keep warm as you can. Keep exercising. [Music]	Success
Can Nature Save Paris? | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efaajIlU8_k	SLICE Science	[Music] Paris is a city of history and heritage, a delight to visit and steeped in legend. But the capital of France is no museum. With 2 million inhabitants, it one of the world populated cities and also one of the ones with the least green spaces. [Music] Just take central Paris. There square meters of green space per inhabitant. Now, what that should be is at least 30 to 35 square meters. The scientific community would like Paris to go green. But is there any room left for nature in this world of stone and steel? It this mineral environment. It we keep it at bay. We should just say okay, come on in. Some people have already said okay and are happily greening the city. I bike around the city on my little green horsey. It lotment garden with vegetables and flowers. And you can even hang them on the city fences. And it scientists, and scholars are all working on finding new ways to introduce [Music] biodiversity. Step by step, it becoming a green movement, and now is the time to push it further. If Parisians want to breathe better, eat better, and be able to connect with a better life. [Music] The center of Paris is imploding and the capital doesn left for its 2 million inhabitants. By comparison, Berlin has around 25 m of green space per inhabitant. In London, it central Paris has only 5 m. Do these extreme urban conditions mean the end of biodiversity, be it plant or animal? And just what has managed to survive of this ravaged nature? [Music] Natalie Mashon is an ecologist specialized in the plant life of Paris, which she tracks down in the most built up improbable corners of the city. Of the world necessarily the one with the most biodiversity because it wasn around large city parks or around forests. Even though we do have the buansen and the bologn which play an important environmental role but all in all there are a good number of species that managed to live in Paris. There are an estimated 1,000 species of wild plants plants not cultivated by the Parisians. And there are a lot of birds quite a lot of insects snails little creatures that we can but they And so for naturalists in search of biodiversity, the Parisian parks and squares are a happy hunting ground. That creeper. It That crow just took a bath and now he smoothing his feathers. He there to catch the sunlight and he grooming his plumage as birds always do after a bath. We have about 60 resident species that nest in Paris. But to that figure, you have to add all the transient birds. Birds that come through on their migrations that come and stay for winter. They don but they do make up part of the biodiversity. Paris wildlife boasts more than a thousand wild plants, buttercups, speed well, ferns, orchids, and thousands of animal species, mostly insects. But the inventories are still in progress. And for scientists, these figures still aren satisfactory. The ecologists at the Museum of Natural History are forever warning the capital about the fragility of its [Music] biodiversity. We plants. We have a good idea of the number of birds. We know pretty much what butterflies and beetles we have. Okay. But the figures are derisory compared to an overall biodiversity of thousands and thousands of species. We can biodiversity just because we cataloged two or three thousand of these species. We like Berlin or Vienna. And that brings us to why this is Paris is a city center. It neighborhoods and large urban landscaped parks. We don Overpopulated, dense, cramped. Paris is suffocating and its biodiversity is being stifled. The capital would like to be greener but doesn it. To bring about such a transformation, it would have to push back its walls. And the problem it always runs up against is that age-old handicap, a chronic lack of space. In the 4th century, back in Roman times, when Paris was called Lieutia, it was already a compact city crouched on the banks of the river Sen. The Roman city was on the south bank of the Sen. It went more or less from where the Pantheon is today to where you now have the Jaand de Plant. That was the Roman city. Subsequently, it developed outwards in concentric circles. Down through the centuries, Paris would keep this configuration, continually rebuilding on top of itself. And in addition to this concentric spread, there was another hindrance. The successive sets of outer walls, the ramparts the city had time after time erected for defense ended up by confining it. And in a way, the periphery, the ring road circling Paris, is the last of those ramp parts. Completed in 1973, this 35 km ribbon of asphalt surrounds the capital and isolates it from its suburbs. The population continues to grow, but its area hardly at all. Paris is now one of the world cities, over 21,000 inhabitants per square kilometer, twice the density of New York. You could describe Paris as a city that is large, compact, dense, and old with some widely scattered breathing spaces. For a long time, Paris considered nature inappropriate and forced it out beyond the city walls. The only green oases were quite artificial, completely man-made and reserved for the elite. This was the case of the Twittery gardens, entirely redesigned in the 17th century by Andre Lenotra at the request of Louis the 14th. [Music] At first the Twery gardens carried on the concept of the closed space of the symbolic cloistered gardens of the middle ages. Later they opened out onto the landscape. But initially the garden was a closed intimate space. An ideal world where nature had been tamed and groomed. Lawns trimmed down to the millimeter. All strictly laid out greenery, boxwood trees, oaks, etc. All pruned. trees planted in straight lines, which is not really how nature is. This nature, all parcled up and contained, was long off limits to the general public. It was not opened up to Parisians until the French Revolution. Eventually in the second half of the 19th century, Baron Osman renewal project under Napoleon III opened up more green spaces to the population. Osman Paris. In other words, a large network made up of the two major parks and other parks, gardens, treeline boulevards, and avenues. The idea was for Paris to have a garden in each neighborhood and so for the first time they created a network designed so that everyone would have a garden [Music] nearby. Today Paris has over 400 squares, parks and gardens along with its two vast parks the Bada Vansen in the east and the Buologna in the west. But for the scientists, this is insufficient and too fragmented to have any significant effect on biodiversity. And yet, Osman renewal project with its goal of creating a green network was truly visionary. For today, reconnecting the islands of nature to create a green urban network is at the heart of Paris environmental ambitions. To achieve this, the city is now searching out the least bit of space to regen. And suddenly, places that were previously never imagined as natural now seem obvious choices. Like the banks of the Sen, that long 13 km serpent gripped in the talons of the automobile traffic. Until now, Paris saw its river as a strictly functional navigation [Music] corridor. But today, a radically new process seems to be at work. In 2013, Paris in creating the first public garden on the water made the leap from virtual to real. This installation has to work on three different levels. First, we barges, so we have floating objects to deal with. On top of that, there whole garden aspect. And lastly, it open to the public with all the safety regulations that that implies. It fruit of two and a half years work. That feat with a system of islands mored to sturdy piles sunk into the riverbed down to a depth of 8 meters, which allows the islands on their huge piles to rise and fall with the water level and even withstand floods that can happen once a century like the one back in 1910. [Music] These five little islands, which cover 1,800 square meters, are a haven of greenery with 3,000 grasses, 60 trees, 280 bushes, a parcel of natural landscape resting on a steel structure. So, here we in the hold of the barge. These are huge 170 ton metal quesons that boy up the soil. Down here we have a whole system to regulate the flotation which means keeping the barge level at all times. Not perfectly level but as level as possible and also a pumping system in case of accident. And lastly another waterworks system dedicated to watering the whole garden. So here Paris is launching a program to reclaim the river as well as an innovative process of renewing the public urban space. The point of this project is to see how we can take a different approach to the public space. I think the city of tomorrow and even of today is a city that is constantly updating meaning that we what people want then work with them to make it happen. But these projects are quite costly. This one cost more than 8 million euros. It only floating garden. Yet, the send does have an important role to play in the urban space of tomorrow. And this floating garden is merely a part of the development project along the river. The mayor of Paris is declaring war on the almighty automobile and has made reclaiming the riverbanks the lynchpin of his ecology program. According to figures published by city hall, this pedestrian program has over 10 years led to a 25% decrease in motor vehicle traffic, which in turn has greatly improved air [Music] quality. And Parisians are forging ahead to bring nature back to the spaces that have so long been denied to them. [Music] A case in point is the Petite Sanuo, the abandoned railroad tracks that circle Paris. It hectares. At the request of the local inhabitants, city hall has turned over a few stretches to aotment gardens, a few plots of greenery along this vast expanse that was just going to seed. The Wiso Garden in the northern part of the railroad ring is one of the city oldest shared gardens. [Music] A festive place to celebrate nature while spreading the word on ecology. The goal is to reclaim space from steel and concrete. We started out as a group of neighbors back in 1998. We Ring Railroad for a few years and at the time people were using it as a dump. So our idea was to make the place pretty so that people would respect it. And we were wondering how we could do that. What if we started by planting flowers up there on the slopes near the street so people could enjoy the sight of holly hogs and poppies? That would make a change and it was just magical. Now this here is a tank with an aquatic ecosystem. We set it up with the help of naturalists. It to add a touch of beauty. There calm of the water, and also to favor biodiversity and create an aquatic ecosystem. So, now we dragonflies. Here we have our worm farm. It bring their organic kitchen waste here. That phases. On the second level, you can see the worms and a whole lot of little bugs. They transform it all and produce very good quality compost. The whiso gardens are the result of a grassroots movement to stake out green space in the city. And it Paris, for since the 2000s, the capital has seen 93 shared gardens sprout up, mainly in the east in workingclass Paris, which has long been deprived of nature. [Music] [Applause] [Music] This green movement has even spread to the streets, ready to push back the walls of Paris. And no nook or cranny is too small to plant. Sidewalks, balconies, alleys, courtyards, new kinds of flower pot. The least crack in the asphalt can play its part. even tree bases, which in some neighborhoods are tended with loving care. Paris has more than 100,000 street trees, trees that the inhabitants hope to keep from becoming eyes by cultivating them. [Music] There are a lot of trees in Paris. So, if all the tree bases were planted with flowers, we might see the city in a new light. Every little bit helps. We also hope it will stop people dumping stuff here and prevent vandalism. I just think a green space is more effective than a fence. [Music] There smallcale nature, this everyday local nature on the part of the scientific community, but also on the part of the local inhabitants as well because this small scale allows them to take an active part. they can mobilize on this scale not on the large landscapes. So this neighborhood nature if you like is very relevant. It education. It knowledge and it vehicle for social interaction. The task facing the cities is in fact to connect up the ecological corridors and that means using the infraspaces if we can call them that like tree bases. [Music] An improvement of the urban decor but also the revival of neglected social relationships. This pavement level action has multiple benefits. But beyond the green aspirations of the city dwellers, do these micro parcels help improve Paris biodiversity? Do they play a part in the city belts? We effect a policy aimed at reconnecting all the spaces. And we call that the green belt corridors meaning all the zones inhabitable by plant and animal life and the corridors that connect them taken as a whole. So in the city what can play a part in the green belt. We asked this question about the street trees and in effect we found that for a certain number of not very mobile species growing them at the foot of these trees allowed more isolated populations to connect with one another. The fragmentation of the city had led to certain populations becoming isolated from one another. And when the individuals, for example, the plants or animals of the same species have no choice but to reproduce among themselves, it leads to inbreeding. This gives rise to genetic problems that cause a species to die out locally since any individuals that appear are incapable of living and reproducing in a viable way. When species have no mobility, extinction is never far away. The green belts and landscape connectivity are goals that must figure into any green policy for the city. Even more so as cities make up 21% of France territory. So the urban environment has a definite role to play in the preservation of biodiversity and a responsibility that implies giving up an extremely harmful practice that of using chemical products in the management of green spaces. The city of Paris is now aware of this and has drastically cut its use of pesticides. This ecological policy has led to an unhoped paradox. Whereas bees are dying out in the country, they making a comeback in Paris. Europe right on the outskirts of Paris in Sanden, across from the imposing basilica that was once the tomb of the kings and queens of France. Here, 5 million bees produce a nectar that celebrates the marriage of city and nature. When we spoke with beekeepers out in the country, and they told us their problems, well, there was not so much a feeling of jealousy, just incomprehension as to how we in the city could manage to turn out honey whereas they in their traditional honey producing regions couldn That bee is a bee that makes honey. Nowadays, in certain regions, they die before they The city is a more favorable environment for the bees because it pesticides and predators. Paris has 350 hives and seems to have grasped the vital mechanisms of its busily pollinating guests. More than 60% of our food is pollinated by bees. So, we need bees. It wonderful thing how the bee needs to cross-pollinate flowers. And the plants and flowers need to find an insect to ensure their reproduction. That means that if bees were to die out, we a big problem producing fruit. No more fruit, no more flowers, no more flowers, no more grasses, no more grasses, no more man. It breaks down the entire food chain. That gives rise to a problem that is quite simply vital. The return of the bees is an ideal occasion for the scientific community to remind people of the benefits of nature. We call this ecosystem services. That is the benefits demand derive from ecological systems. So there is a supply service because nature supplies us with food and drink. There are regulatory services. It pollution and nature regulates itself. Then there is a third very important service that cultural services, the aesthetic, the well-being, education and recreation that are simply indispensable to man survival and which are generously provided by nature. An increasing number of studies show that the quality of life of city dwellers is closely linked to the quality of biodiversity and in particular plant biodiversity because that notice the most when walking around the city. The stark builtup districts where there aren don harder to live in. Not only from a psychological but also from a health point of view. We could save money on healthare if we took better care of biodiversity. So it to live with nature but also to use nature to prevent future climatic catastrophes. This is the concept of the resilient city. A city that will adapt to be ready for the worst. You could say the great heatwave of 2003 was a wakeup call because all of a sudden for 10 consecutive days in August, Paris was getting 350 deaths a day instead of 50. And the majority of those deaths occurred in the neighborhoods without any trees that could provide shade and cause evapo transpiration, which lowers the temperature. Those were the neighborhoods that were hit the hardest. Trees lining a boulevard the temperature by 3°. And that has an enormous impact on global warming. Urban planners and communities are well aware of this. It means creating green roofs, vegetital walls, getting more shade onto more streets. It alone, but nature as well that makes a city resilient. Since the city first understood that nature can help it meet the environmental challenges of tomorrow, it has gone wholeheartedly into a greening program. And now the sky limit. Between now and 2020, the city is planning to create 7 hectares of green vegetital roofs. Thanks to its roofs, Paris hopes to become a greener capital, better prepared to face global warming and to attract increased biodiversity. The first installment was the roof of the Boganella shopping mall, a concrete complex on the left bank of the Sen. It is now the city garden, 7,000 square meters of greenery in the heart of Paris. It looks very simple, but in fact, there was 40 cm of soil, tons and tons of soil that had to be integrated into the building. Then there thing. Nothing is protruding. Usually the roof of a shopping mall has all sorts of air conditioning equipment, pipes, air intakes, horrible stuff. But here, all that was integrated into the body of the building. Something that not visible, but is perhaps one of the most difficult things to accomplish. In fact, it gardens. I should also mention that we stock rainwater to water all the greenery. So, we don water. Also, the layer of soil acts as an insulator. It provides thermal insulation to limit heat loss. Then there told, it ecological. Paris has proudly announced that up to 80 hectares of the city roofs could potentially be greened. So in these new spaces, has the city found the green links for its future green belts? [Music] There all. For all the green roofs they been creating now, they out sedum mats. And that has a limited benefit for biodiversity. Extremely limited. So my team and I are working on that now to find out what kind of substrates are best, what thickness, how deep it has to go in order to have flowers and insects, and how to keep management costs to a minimum to make it more sustainable. job. Complex, costly, and according to some of limited ecological benefit, green roofs are a contentious issue. Nevertheless, the designers of the Borenell Garden did make a strong statement in favor of ecology by making this roof a sanctuary reserved for plant and animal life. On the roof of the Agro Paris Tech School, they way that might just plackate the critics. The roof hasn wildlife sanctuary or been greened. It has become productive farmland. In Paris, urban farming is still in its infancy. But scientists are studying the food question and aronomist Nicolola Bell is tackling it by creating urban vegetable gardens where he testing different substrates. Here you can see a striking difference between the planters with potting soil and the planters with a richer ecosystem. That grounds? Because there grows in the coffee grounds. So, it full of miccelium. Mycelium is the body of the fungus. It enriches the soil because it spreads throughout the wood chips. How do you account for this difference? Potting soil isn material, so it degrades. It structure, for example, eventually gets packed down. Also, the nutrients dissolve in water and then they leech out. So, the first year, the potting soil is fine. The second year it really doesn as well. And the third year even less. Here we can afford to pick the tomatoes when they are ripe. So we eat them right off the vine and they Then there raspberries which are very fragile. So it them on a rooftop. I think there are three or even four positive points to this type of urban farming on buildings. The first is food production even if it will never be a very large scale operation quantity-wise. The second benefit is social. We know that collective gardens on the rooftops foster social relationships. The third point is what I call environmental. The possibility of this type of farming playing a part in recycling urban waste. At least that to do at the test farm on the roof of Agroparite. But it can go even further with the recuperation of rainwater, thermal regulation, cultivated biodiversity, which is still biodiversity. When we embarked on this experiment, we didn form of new green space would attract bees, for example. And we found an entire population of insects settling on this roof. So that contributes to recreating cultivated and even spontaneous plant and animal biodiversity. It if we recycle urban waste, and if there in urban farming for these agriculture systems to be as autonomous as possible, we contribution to these ecosystem services. So that challenge. Now we have to make it work. Though the role of urban farming in the development and enrichment of biodiversity is still being studied, it seems to be having a positive impact. Green rooftops, cultivated tree bases, the ring railroad preserved, the greening of the river banks driven by popular opinion, builders and scientists. The green movement is blazing a trail now being followed by urban planners and political decision makers. But what will be the outcome? [Music] Philip Jacob is the head of the Parisian Observatory of Biodiversity, an institution founded by the city in 2012 to coordinate the observations of amateur nature lovers. Since the 1990s and 2000s, a certain number of species have made a comeback, and it animals. There are birds like the kingfisher or the peragrin falcon that have come back to Paris recently and are reproducing which goes to show that there in the field here. The fox has been making a comeback over the past 15 years too. It has slowly and quietly come back to the bulon and there are more and more of them in Paris in areas like the sanu and the banks of the sen. For us, these are all very positive, meaningful signs. For the time being, biodiversity is on the rise in Paris. There are more species simply because the city decided to do without pesticides. And that beneficial for the wild plants as well as for the insects and for all the animals that eat insects. The river Sen itself, which just a few years ago was considered at death door, seems to be coming back to life. I algai growing on the banks. This little moss is called Octoerus and it has a house guest, a little gamaros shrimp that lives in this moss and does quite well there. Yes, there are more fish than before. We species. Maximum. We estimate that there group of 20 to 25 relatively common species that turn up regularly with fairly healthy populations. We have juvenile fish, perch, pike, roach. In spite of it all, the species are capable of adapting somewhat and finding what they need in order to reproduce, to feed, and so to complete their life cycles successfully and thrive. In central Paris, the most fckened natural element is the sen. Some people call it Paris Arondismo. And it with the most nature in it. Will the blue ribbon of the Sen overtake the green belt? The return and diversification of living species are positive signs, but scientists claim that future, Paris has to plan even further. and overcome the historical constraints still imposed by the city center. As an ecologist, I interconnected landscape with a focus on the river banks. Paris can ring road and the suburbs have to be integrated into the city. It would be a mistake to confine our projects to the city center and not to reach out to the bordon, the Bansen and other parks and forests. etc. The whole concept of green belts loses its meaning unless it incorporated into a more global holistic vision like that of the regional project for ecological coherence which all the regions are working on now. Especially the departments that have the job of integrating the city and the metropolitan area into a larger scheme of protected areas and corridors. If the green movement is to gain momentum, it has to break the concentric mindset by creating ecological corridors running from the center to the outskirts and start thinking [Music] big. Of particular interest are the boundary spaces, intersection points that could favor this process. There are new spaces to be claimed like here at the Otoy Racetrack at the western edge of the city by the Buologna where Michel Pena has managed to create a public landscaped garden. We created a big open sway without too many tall trees because the track has to be visible. This project was designed as a link. We links in places that were split up. We to piece together parcels of the city that were separated, that have been fragmented by history, by land owners that wanted to fence themselves off from one another. And I think that in terms of work, not just on the landscape, but also on the territory, a big part of it is recreating these connections. The second goal we is to increase biodiversity, introducing nature into the very heart of the cities, which have been extremely artificialized. And yes, it in the cities. It since there anymore. All over the world, it one big city that is more or less dense wherever you go. So we thought about this concept of one city and about what we could do and how we could create a genuine asset and truly natural areas right there in the city [Music] to occupy the fringes of the city so biodiversity can crossbreed and grow. This is the goal of those who have realized just how much the future depends on this reconciliation with nature. [Music] But it often runs up against the pressures of the real estate business and immovable buildings. No matter, the stakes are too high, and even the most builtup areas must succumb. Laance, just west of Paris, Europe realm of concrete, glass, and steel, where it seems it would take a miracle for man and nature to coexist. [Music] And this is where renowned landscape architect Gil Clemon has created an island of greenery that seems to battle with the looming skyscrapers. In this mineral environment, it because we reject it that nature doesn come here because we our toxic pesticides. But just look, we this concrete. So what? There are still plenty of birds and insects. This regeneration just happened because we don here. It It The plant life didn own. We planted right from the start. But there are also a lot of plants that colonize the in between spaces where we didn ground. There are different grasses that we didn and that nature come or at least it will come if we accept it. All we have to do is say yes I accept it. For a long time cities drove nature out beyond their walls. Now those same cities feel the need to reconnect with nature and often in its most pastoral form. Here on the fringes of Paris, on these former farmlands eroded by urbanization, the ancestral rural memory has been revived, faithfully reenacting the herd migrations of long ago. [Music] I feel like I heart of a hike in the country with sheep. And so without any official green light, LaMel Duboner, the farm of happiness, an urban farming project was created just a stones throw from La Def France. [Music] Right now, there can of worms that allows us to carry on until someone says, long enough. We concrete, pour in money. Meanwhile, we it. And the icing on the cake here every Sunday is the little community that has grown up. All kinds of people from the most down to earth to the most cultivated come and put in some time working or not. It touching. We don much and everyone has the same instincts. They know how to work with the earth. Slipping into the cracks of the city, Ro de Pre has reclaimed the forgotten territory. His goal is to breathe new life into this plot of unused land. First to clean it up and put it in order and then why not to plant and produce a project with universal aspirations. I come from Italy. I Uh before there was also a girl from Sweden. The projects I find most interesting are the ones that stretch your limits that aim to draw man closer to nature towards a kind of simplicity. That like. It really moves me that now after two years we landscape. It blows me away. I thought, God, if we push this project far enough, maybe the big concrete money bags will have no choice but to acknowledge our work. Even more so now that everyone is talking about urban farming, which is a western technocratic term for ecological necessity, elementary independence, even elementary survival. And if we do win this battle, it would be a beautiful message of hope because it would prove that people can take political action in every sense of the term, whether it political, or moral. With the farm of happiness, Ro de Pre has taken an abandoned lot and made it into something with a cultivated heart. But all around, he wild. It animals in there and he are very precious places. Look at the future of humanity right now. It depends on the very diversity it The so-called abandoned, neglected, unknown plots where we don exactly what precious places, treasures. In fact, so the way he defied the authorities to take over that parcel of land should be acknowledged and even rewarded. Flower gardens, vegetable gardens, empty lots, tree bases, rooftops. All these initiatives are part of the back to nature movement in Paris. But with all the environmental challenges in store, they territory on a large scale is undoubtedly the solution to preserving and enriching the biodiversity of tomorrow. This is what the capital has undertaken in launching a project with the promising name of L Grand Perry. A project aimed at increasing the area of the city a 100fold to make it a worldclass [Music] metropolis. The Greater Paris project by linking the city up to the vast parks and forests that dot the region would open up very exciting possibilities for natural reserves. The high-rise buildings, an ecological complex. The suburbs, an ocean of greenery. The city, an unbroken ribbon flowing all the way to the sea. Lra Parei has quickly become a buzzing hive of new ideas and a fertile terrain for the wildest dreams of grandeur. Too good to be [Music] true. Clearly, development is the top priority. Now they planning and developing buildings and transportation so everyone can get to work and so we can construct housing near train stations. The means of transportation are all being developed at present but the planning groups working on the grare just don and I think that problem. We see how important they are for leisure activities just to have space. But the concept of real services rendered by nature by biodiversity is pretty much alien to the majority of decision makers and to the public. It doing, especially since we feel we have a clear grasp of these very serious problems that truly impact the quality of people being heard. It The fact that LRI has neglected the environmental questions is harmful to biodiversity. But there increasingly active movement aware that the essential thing is to keep creating green belts and taking the city beyond its historical [Music] limits. Perhaps the solution can be found right here in Makusi. 30 km south of Paris. For a long time, we thought of the city as limited to the builtup district. But the notion of the ecosystem of the city covers the entire spectrum of issues and habitats necessary for the reproduction of urban species. So you could say that the city has a responsibility for the quality of the water and the quality of the air. But it can also be involved in the question of food. This is not merely a theory. Jerry Lavan has already put it into action. Once he was elected to the town council, he convinced five communities to slow down urbanization and preserve farmlands. This united front has created a new type of territory midway between urban and rural. A more largecale organization, more porous and less compartmentalized. The tomatoes are there, right? tomatoes, orines, and peppers. We to the city. At night, you can see the top of the Eiffel Tower from here with the rotating spotlights. About 20 years ago, we thought the main threat to this place was that people thought it was an empty space where they could do whatever they wanted. Saving farming was certainly not a priority. I think it It conditions not for farming to defend itself, but for it to project itself into the future as an indispensable element of the urban project, so to speak. Now, with the Grarei and the de France projects being discussed, it important to realize that it outskirts and starting in the outskirts that we can reinvent the city of the future. [Music] Okay, let The proven benefits of ecosystem services, the need for food, a desire for social bonds, and a greener urban environment. Nature is a fountain of well-being and is gradually convincing the capital how much it needs it. So what will tomorrow like? Blue sen or green prairie, vertical or horizontal, technology or ecology? Whatever its new face, Paris will need those ecological corridors to reconcile the concrete with the plants. The exuberance of nature with urban reality and the center with the suburbs in a true alliance that will turn this green movement into a healthy reality.

TasmaniaÂs Ancient Forest Under Threat Â A Global Outcry | SLICE SCIENCE | FULL DOC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhKVWQH5sSI	SLICE Science	[Music] Emerging 350 million years ago, it crucial to life on Earth. Home to 80% of the planet their treasures guarantee the survival of one in five human beings. But day after day, forests are shrinking as mankind grapples with an increasingly urgent dilemma. How can we reconcile our ever rising demands with the need to protect forests precious resources? In the four corners of the earth, forests are buzzing with innovative solutions that also respect the living world. Men and women are drawing on scientific research, ancestral traditions, and their imaginations to reinvent the forestry practices of tomorrow. Here forces to rewrite the great history of man and the forest. [Music] [Music] There world where trees are giants that can tower up to 100 m tall. Tasmania. [Music] Two Towers is one of the largest, if not the largest eucalypse on the planet, which also makes it the largest flowering plant alive. It battles over its 500 year lifespan. And so, we Every time I see it, I still feel a little bit emotional to think that something so magnificent is still is still in [Music] our gigantic trees native to Tasmania are famous throughout the world. They called eucalyptus reigns. This forest is a remnant of the most ancient geological eras in the history of the earth. Once upon a time, the forest covered the entire island. Wedged between Australia and the Antarctic, Tasmania was uninhabited for ages. Its giant trees reign supreme over the land. But today, half a million people live here. To measure the impact humans are having on the forest, botonist Brett Miffs heads up into the eucalyptus reg. Well, it so much of the forests was logged in this area. So much of it is gone and there are so few trees like this left alive for us to experience and enjoy and climb and research. Like Brett Miffsud, researchers and nature lovers have given themselves the mission of recovering the natural heritage that currently suffers from too great a human impact. But they the country are lumberjacks, and the gigantic trunks of the old eucalyptus make good logging. In just 25 years, they can grow up to 50 meters tall. The 19th century colonists knew what they were doing. Tasmania was built on the treasures of its forest. But the lumberjack replaced by the machinery of the booming industry and the majestic eucalyptus reigns by even more productive varieties. As a result, after two centuries, onethird of Tasmania has disappeared. Destruction that has divided the entire country. On the one side, militant ecologists, guardians of the vulnerable forest. On the other, loggers and foresters, proud of their traditions and the driving force of the island economy. Their clashes are so violent that the press has dubbed them the forest war. The conflict has been raging for over 30 years. The stakes are huge, saving Tasmania remaining giants. Among these activists, Vika Bailey is the spokesman for the Wilderness Society, the most powerful tree protection movement in Tasmania. The eucalyptus regns has become the standard bearer of this battle which first began on political terrain. The forest war is behind the creation of the world For me personally, it was incredibly important to fight for these trees uh because of what they represent. And to see them torn down, uh burnt, turned into paper products, uh demonstrates an absolute disregard and disrespect for nature and the planet itself. [Music] [Music] Felling the giants also ruins the magic of a forest that harbors a plethora of secrets. Beneath their canopy lies a realm that resembles a fairy land. The scenery is so enchanting that the trees and paths here bear names borrowed from the fictional universe of the Lord of the [Music] Rings. This eucalyptus is called Gandalf venerable wizard. But the elders of the forest do more than just inspire ambulance. They play a major role in the ecosystem by creating shade for the understory and ensuring the regeneration of the forest. Tasmania is home to a temperate rainforest, a natural environment that seems surprising right next door to arid, droughtprone Australia. The eucalyptus developed a remarkable strategy in order to populate the lush island. It created close to 800 subspecies specifically adapted to damp clims. To understand this little known ecosystem, botonist Jesse Bhell searches for clues to how it works. 36.5. So half is 74.4. So the full diameter is 148.8 cm. I category 2 and there is presence of a fire scar. The direction is 134°. The eucalypse when they grow really tall, they have most cases a really big canopy. And because of this canopy, it tends to shade everything else underneath it. So you get a system that has to be shade tolerant because if it have sun so it can So most shade tolerant tree species or understory species tend to be the ones that you see around me and they generally live underneath these eucalyp trees because they cannot live anywhere else unless you get a canopy gap in which case you tend to get more eucalyptus trees growing in these gaps. So eucalypse are really really important for sort of constructing this type of ecosystem which is a rainforest. Beneath the canopy, huge fern trees thrive. Along with the eucalyptus, they sole of the forest. At these giants feet lies a hidden world of unsuspected treasures. It trees are so spectacular and the ferns all look so amazing. And actually the greatest source of biodiversity and the greatest number of species lies in these very small mosses. [Music] Tasmania relatively unknown. How many species grow in the shade of these giant trees? This miniature exploration is the project biologist Scott McAdam has taken on. So far, he varieties of moss and microscopic [Music] ferns. This species is hersia varia which is a lyopte. The ancestors of the Lyopites once grew into 30 m tall trees that dominated forests at the equator in the tropics 400 million years ago. These ferns on the trunk of this Tree fern are unique in that they are their leaves are only one cell thick and they are very sensitive to the amount of water in the environment. They can desiccate completely and dry out and then when it rains they can rehydrate and we don how the physiology behind how these plants are able to desecrate and rehydrate and survive on the trunks of these tree ferns. My passion in sciences is evolution. This is part of a study that we are conducting to investigate the evolution of how land plants use water and how this might have changed through evolutionary time. Because if we know those things, then we can better predict how these plants will respond into the future. [Music] These tiny ferns seem to have emerged from a time machine. They grew here even before there were dinosaurs. The knowledge they contain speaks of the very origins of the earth. [Music] The ferns that we find in these forests are like a portal to the past. Coming into these forests is like walking into prehistoric [Music] forests. Very similar to forests in South America or the fossil forests that we see in the fossil record from Antarctica when it was ice free 40 million years or more ago. 400 million years ago, these land masses, which today lie several thousand km apart, formed one single superc continent, Gonduana. This was when the mosses and ferns we find here first appeared. 180 million years ago, Gondana broke up and Tasmania was separated from the other continental blocks. Tasmania of the last remnants of this era. Scientific research has helped us understand how valuable this amazing heritage is and led to a turning point in the forest war. But despite the opportunity, the wilderness in 2011, after decades of conflict, ecologists and loggers came together to sign a peace treaty and UNESCO ratified their truce that helped bring together loggers and greenies. And in 2013, after decades of advocacy, protest, uh, scientific research, uh, and campaigning, the, um, UNESCO Heritage Committee accepted a nomination to have these areas added to the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. And without the community standing up and saying no, without people advocating and then ultimately without UNESCO and its world heritage committee saying this is an area of global significance, places like this would continue to be cut down in Tasmania. Since the peace deal, nearly half of the land has been safeguarded by UNESCO. Within these areas, the original forest and its giants have been [Music] preserved. Ecologists nevertheless keep a close watch to make sure boundaries are respected. Here we border of a protected area. On the other side, logging companies continue to do as they please. As proof that tensions still run high, some parcels are protected by police. I see a kind of destruction that only I see on TV in third world countries, not in Australia. You have to cry. It wrong. The methods used inflame emotions that are already highly strained. This helicopter is dropping thousands of incendiary devices containing a highly flammable jellied petroleum. When they hit the ground, they start ferocious fires that can burn for weeks on end. The idea is for the fires to destroy the debris left after logging, sterilize the ground, and form a bed of ashes that will foster the germination of seeds from a highly productive strain of eucalyptus. Here, the old growth forest is being replaced by fast growing trees at an alarming rate. Ecologists condemn the combustible material for its toxic pollutants. The substance is so loathed that it bombs used during the Vietnam War. Forestry Tasmania, the government organization responsible for part of the unprotected forest area, has an entirely different opinion of the controversial method. Biologist Tim Wardlaw offers scientific endorsement for it. napal. Um, it could it it there it have to after harvesting if we don burning um we don as that. So the question of how we burn the forest is secondary to the need of um you know that equation. No fire, no new forest. The eucalyptus can only release its seeds at extremely high temperatures. Fire is so essential to the regeneration of the Tasmanian forest that the eucalyptus has developed an astonishing strategy. It promotes its own burning. With its bark and the flammable oil in its leaves, it doesn the tree into an explosive ball of fire. As the temperature climbs, the oil is vaporized and dispersed above the canopy, igniting other trees. In [Music] turn, the burnt ground is temporarily rid of predators and other plants that compete with seedlings for light, water, and nutrients. The eucalyptus uses fire to ensure its chances of survival and to regenerate the forest. But unfortunately, this ingenious variety also produces the best [Music] timber. The forests are fabulous. Tasmania is a it it I guess it um interplay between beauty and utility. So we landscapes and some of the most beautiful forests in the world, but they forests in the world. So for producing wood, this is one of the best places to do it in a natural forest. [Applause] [Music] When it comes to the forest war dividing the nation, more than just the trees are at stake. It have allowed to develop. The temperate rainforest is home to 130 varieties of birds and 25 mammal species. Outside of the sanctuary protected by UNESCO, some of these animals could very well disappear. The threat strikes accord in Tasmania as it extinction of one of its endemic creatures, the thyloine, a marsupial also known as the Tasmanian tiger. This footage was filmed at the Hobart Zoo in Tasmania we see Benjamin, the last known thyloine to exist. It died on September the 7th, 1936. The largest carnivorous marsupial still alive in the world today has become emblematic of the island, the Tasmanian devil. Extinct from the Australian mainland 400 years ago, devils currently only exist in Tasmania. But they too are now in danger. An entire generation of young scientists have rallied to the devil side to prevent the unthinkable. David Hamilton, a researcher at the University of Hobart, is one of them. He the protection of devils, which got their nickname from their blood curdling cry. Like the thyloine, for years, devils were accused of wreaking havoc in farms and were systematically hunted. Since 1941, Tasmanian devils have been protected by law. But 20 years ago, their population began to plummet. It The reason for their decline, a mysterious disease that scientists are desperately trying to understand. We have a devil. Fantastic. Devils are nocturnal scavengers and contribute to Tasmania balance by feeding on carrying. They also help protect the island limiting the presence of feral cats and foxes, bird Devils aren them to be. They have this reputation from having a bad temper and being very aggressive, but when we like this, they and really nice to work with, which is uh which is lovely. It 21.0 Kenny. Look at the back feet. They got really good grip for running along. They got these nice little pads. So, she um a couple of years old. So, I she around her, around her face. DFTD, devil facial tumor disease, the terrible cancer ravaging the devil population. It attacks the jaw and makes it impossible for the animals to eat. But most perplexing to scientists is the fact that this cancer has a characteristic that is as rare as it is disturbing. It Tasmanian devils, but the unique thing about it is that it between individuals. So, one devil can pass a cancer that it animal, which is very unique. when they have their usual fighting interactions and bite one another around the oral cavity, then cancer cells transfer and then the new devil will start showing signs of this uh of DFTD, which is uh something that will um mean that the animal usually dies within about 3 to 6 months, which is uh pretty shattering. So, she is disease-free, so she looks fine. And she she can pick up the disease. 80% of the devil population has already been wiped out. This puts the entire Tasmanian ecosystem at risk. Where devils are in the ecosystem, they entire Tasmanian fauna because they at the top end of the food chain. It 34.2. So, they that devils from an ecosystem, it can have all sorts of other effects on everything down the chain. A vaccination is already being tested, but the infection is spreading throughout the land and a second transmissible cancer has been identified. And although no link has been found between deforestation and this terrible disease, it has become more urgent than ever to safeguard the devil island. and more particularly outside of protected areas. So while the forest war divides the Tasmanian population, the fight to save the devils has won unanimous support. The devil is just a very charismatic animal and it of an icon of Tasmania as well. So I think a lot of people in Tasmania and even wider than that feel a bit of an affinity with it and they would be extremely sad if it something if it were to become extinct or if it were to go down. And I think uh the fact of one of the last big extinction is the thyloine happened in Tasmania. That was the the big carnivore the big marupil carnivore and that got wiped out. I think a lot of um people in Tasmania feel they almost have a a kind of duty to the natural world and the environment to try and keep this one [Music] going. The forest peace deal marked a truce between green militants and loggers. Now it falls upon scientists to pick up the fight, using the weapon of knowledge to shed light on the treasures of Tasmania forest. Let have a listen for a second. See if we can hear any birds in this crusade. Ornithologist Deian Stoyanovic went out on a limb to push back the logging industry. And it paid off thanks to an unexpected ally, the swift parrot. There right now. Both parents are feeding, but the male fed quickly and and quite well, and the female seemed to kind of hesitate and didn long. Swift birds originating in Australia, but every spring they fly to Tasmania to breathe. So, I the nestlings. And then once I them in the bag, I down. And then Fernander is going to help me. And we measure their bodies to see how they how they or not they what we don happen. A rather large tree just fell down in the forest. Wow. [Music] Each year, the parrot population is declining. Today, there are estimated to be fewer than 2,500 adults, an alarming figure. So the swift parrot is endangered because across its breeding range in Tasmania, it the hollowbearing forest that it needs and safe places to put its babies in hollow trees. Without enough forest, the parrots are too constrained in their choice and might be forced to nest where sugar gliders are more likely to eat them. And sugar gliders are the main cause of nesting failure in swift parrot breeding populations. Dean seizes the moment when both parents have gone off to search for food. He collects the two baby birds from their nest in a hole in the tree. Swift parrots are an important indicator of the health of the forest. In Tasmania, Swift parrots only nest in really old mature forest. And the reason for that is because it forest that produces the kinds of holes in trees that swift parrots need to nest. So that because if something forest, we should be able to tell on the basis of how the swift parrot population is going. This nestling just under 3 weeks old now. You can still see some of the beautiful color even though he [Music] wet. Sorry, Fernando. This one is 34.2. He in his hollow and because of the rain over the last few days. But very important thing. We him 60.3 gram. Science has just been key for understanding how these systems work. I mean, it it through hard research, climbing trees, understanding exactly what swift parrots choose when they are in a forest, what kind of tree holes are important to them that help us understand what we need to do to protect them. Dean The swift parrot has been officially recognized as critically endangered. We felt really proud that the swift parrot was recently uplisted to critically endangered by the IUCN, which is which is a really important step for recognizing how threatened this animal is. So in in response to the uplifting of the species as critically endangered, a moratorum of logging on logging swift parrot habitat was declared. You can see this. Uh, look at them. They affectionate to one another. He kiss. Loggers must now respect the nesting zones of these little birds on their own land. The victory has brought new hope to the island. It to science, conservation is gaining ground even in the areas not protected by the peace [Music] deal. But in 2014, the forest war took a dramatic turn of events. The Australian prime minister came to the rescue of the timber industry to relaunch Tasmania moribund economy. We have quite enough national parks. We have quite enough locked up forests already. In fact, in an important respect, we have too much locked up forest. He announced his intention to open up 74,000 hectares on the World Heritage listing. The peace deal was immediately shattered into pieces because one of the timber industry among others a precious and rare variety, the Huon [Music] pine. One of the vulnerable areas lies on the banks of the Gordon River, an emblematic sanctuary of the Huon Pine. Logging has been forbidden here since the 1990s. It Ron Morrison is one of the last foresters to have cut the trunks of these prized trees. Like most Tasmanians, he comes from a long line of [Music] lumberjacks. Today, it granddaughter footsteps of her ancestors and discover the legendary green gold that made the fortune of her island. We here. Not so bright, is it? Up here out the sun. Another blue on there. Might be 5 years old. Here you, but as older than you. It old, maybe even 20. The oldest hu pine that they know of is 3,400 years old. Still growing. See there? It growing tree certainly in Tasmania. It It takes 5 years for it to be that high. The history of the Huan Pine began here 200 years ago. The tree was named after French explorer Huan Demedc and is extremely slow growing. Whereas the eucalyptus reigns is one of the tallest trees in the world, the Huan pine is no doubt one of the oldest. Have a smell the huan pine. So the tree has been dead for 90 years and uh you smell the oil in the wood. The wood does not decay in the water. [Music] You can stay close to my wooden arm which put the supplies on the trolley and two men would wind it up the winench up. But all the shafts gone rusty. My grandfather, he worked here up where we going with horses, the draft horses 76 years ago. Nearly. The timber industry in Tasmania was established by convicts sent over from England in the 19th century and European colonists made their fortune off the Huon pine prized for its fine grain, golden color, and rotresistant properties. Thousands of these trees were used to build warships and merchant vessels. When I was young, I worked in the bush with my father as well. He take take me to the bush when I was about 3 years old. Live in the bush in the camps in the bush. You catch walabes to eat. Dad used to make the bread in a camp oven. They rice and then uh then I had to go to school. But I didn either. Dad would quite often take me to work on school days. So I learned how to cut trees down at a very early age. Gradually the convicts and small-cale logging gave way to family sawmills which in turn were replaced by large industrial operations. But the Huan pine grows so slowly that it almost entirely disappeared. The big companies came in and brought they had all the the rights. that was supported by government and really it just wasn the state because the small families or the small timber operators really didn damage to the bush because it was selective. They just took one tree here, one there. But when the big companies came in, they it was all clear filled and then burnt and then trees planted. It was just a huge change to the the way the timber industry had operated in Tasmania. One X mark there and then another one up here. So the the old bushman, they hit the tree with the axe. Now you listen, Ella, you listen. Makes a hollow [Music] noise. Young Tasmanians can still discover this prized tree. It was saved from extinction by a law passed 20 years ago to protect [Music] it. Some families whose livelihood used to depend entirely on the Huon pine have managed to adapt to the legislation. They living museums. [Music] Welcome to Morrison. Come on in. We demonstration. [Music] Ecoourism is booming these days and the Huan Pine has become an attraction on a par with the Tasmanian Devil. People also come for a taste of history and to learn about the island pioneers. It stuff. All the wood turners love it, but the wood turners like the hard stuff. See that that that would polish better than a bit of soft wood. [Music] In this workshop near the Gordon River, sculptor Greg Duncan pays homage to the first adventurers who landed in this corner of the world where the only resource was wood. Greg Duncan has embarked upon an extraordinary and challenging endeavor, chronicling the history of Tasmania forest in a huge fresco sculpted out of the forest Tasmanians. This was all once a uh um founded on convicts and hard men, hard treatment, hard laws. I think um Q and Pine survived. It um yeah, it just the nature of the timber also very much similar to the nature of the people in Tasmania. whether they or working in forests like that or whether they and and things like that. Definitely um the trees are the there it. It Um we to use the trees in a sustainable nature and sustainable way. I know that seems to be a bit of a cliche these days, but it The trees have a value to them and not just in the sense of making paper and and things like that, but um just aesthetically they soul. This soul is honored over a stretch of 100 m. The fresco is called the wall, a homage to lumberjacks, the DNA of the island. I didn boys. I think in those times no one even questioned it was um open up make gung-ho make everything happen. Um just you know just uh strive to open up the the land and all that sort of thing. Um we didn having said that you know a lot of this was done manually so it probably didn do create the the the devastation to the degree that we can do today you know with the machinery and that sort of things. machinery which could once again do serious damage to the Huan pine and eucalyptus regns populations and the ecosystem they harbor if the UNESCO World Heritage listing is put back on the table. The request to delist the protected forests is even more astonishing in that ever since the peace deal, the timber industry in Tasmania has made great strides towards sustainable forestry. Ecoourism is not their only initiative. Another pushes the very frontiers of possibility, an aquatic [Music] frontier. Back in the 1960s, many dams were erected to meet the island electrical needs, and vast expanses of forest were flooded as a result. One of the reservoirs created in 1987 was Lake Pyman. The ghosts rising today from the water are the remains of these former forests. Darren Crook is in charge of a highly unusual logging operation. Just checking pulling out. So we celery top pine forest. So where we are is a is the riverbed. The river beds about 45 m below us. And these trees that you can see where the just the heads are sticking up, we still got 20 25 30 m of tree underneath us. So yeah, it how much is out here. a lot of trees that were for all intents and purposes lost, but uh we now able through technology to to recover those and and bring them up to the the surface for people to use in fine furniture making and boat building. The Hydrowwood project is based on an audacious idea, salvaging timber from flooded forests. An underwater sonar locates the most prized timbers. Eucalyptus, Huon Pine, Myrtle. Next, a telescopic arm on a barge plunges as deep as 26 m to retrieve the trees. Once they the trunks are hoisted up onto a barge. In December 2015, Hydrawwood experienced its first commercial success. Furniture makers and naval architects were enticed by these trees coaxed from their 30-year underwater slumber. When we started this project, most people thought that we we head. We couldn was underwater. But people are doing it around around the world um recovering logs around the world. Um so it bit of a step a step further to be able to cut a tree down underwater and bring it to the surface. [Music] The success story on Lake Pyman could very well be reproduced in other artificial lakes around the island and beyond. It rivers throughout the world contain several hundred million submerged trees. a small operation like we then it supplies an alternative source of of timber and in some senses could relieve pressure from terrestrial operations in supplying some of this timber. I also very proud of the company. The um you know, we big gamble. It like giving birth to a child. It when it all the first log came out of the water, it was much much relief and and joy. and uh we had quite a few um beverages in the bar on the first night. The success of this innovative project shows there is an alternative to unsustainable industrial logging. The international market is becoming more and more aware of this. The future economically speaking as well lies in sustainable forestry. Can initiatives such as hydrowwood show the way to a reconciliation between the lumberjack soul of Tasmania and its exceptional natural heritage. It and foresters find a middle ground as both sides increasingly find themselves at the mercy of something bigger than them both. Global warming. In January 2016, several forest fires raged across Tasmania. More than just the eucalyptus burned. The remnants of Gonduana and trees that were over 1,000 years old also went up in smoke. [Music] The island experienced its most devastating summer in centuries for botonist David Bowman. It Something really novel happened this summer that we had an incredible number of lightning storms right across western Tasmania setting off 70 fires that have burnt over a 100,000 hectares. 2% of the world heritage area had been burnt. This is absolutely unprecedented. As fire was consuming the forest, the news came in. UNESCO refused the government request. The borders of the area listed as World Heritage Wilderness would not be redrawn. Half of the island will remain a sanctuary. For David, the decision is decisive because over the course of this long forest war, the forest has changed. When we made the World Heritage Wilderness, the idea was it wilderness. It could look after itself. It was pure nature. The problem we now have is we have a sick patient. That this nature to survive needs humans. It needs humans obviously to stabilize the climate, but it needs humans to put the fires out. [Music] Another battle is shaping up, but this time both sides will have to join forces to face the consequences of climate change. Tasmania more than ever. Whether their intentions are to exploit it or to protect it. [Music] [Music]	Success
