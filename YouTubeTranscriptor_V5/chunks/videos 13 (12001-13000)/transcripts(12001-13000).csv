5 Unexpected Nail Hacks THAT WORK	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDmBM-O-9Rg	Dr Day	Do you ever feel like doing that to someone who They really offputting and you want to scratch their eyeball out, put them in their place. Yeah, I feel you. Well, um maybe you you clicked in this video, expecting the unexpected. Isn is titled? Five unexpected nail care hacks that really work. They really work with age, certain medical conditions, certain medications, or just our occupation and what we do with our hands. Brittle nails become a lot more common. You can eyeballs out if you nails. Not to mention, maybe deal with hang nails, you got rough, ragged cuticles, uh you got nail ridging, and you nails. What can you do to start turning a corner on your nails? You surprised. No, it doesn gelatin. Okay, it doesn gelatin. So, forget about that. If you want to eat gelatin, that But if you for a nail transformation, you might be waiting a while. Um, I can tell you this, nails become brittle as part of the aging process, but also due to disruption in the integrity of the uh nail fold skin and that allows for more moisture to get up under the nail and disrupt healthy nail growth leading to brittle nails. And of course, with age, our skin doesn well. And our nails are a lot more vulnerable to dehydration, brittleless. This catches people by surprise, but actually it Cutting your fingernails will help them to be stronger and to grow in a more healthy fashion, I should say, because the longer the nail, the more vulnerable it becomes to dehydration. There more surface area for it to lose water and become brittle. Not to mention more surface area to come in contact with things that dry out the nail, whether it be harsh cleaning products, hand sanitizers that can be drying, you name it. Uh the longer the nail, the greater the brittleleness. So, keep your nails trimmed really short. Trim them frequently. Keep them keep them trimmed short. It really can make a huge difference in allowing for healthier nail growth. Not to mention, if they get too long, it kind of slows down nail growth in general. And some people might be dealing with nail issues like a little bubble up under their nail, which is calledis. Check out my video onis. But if you to grow out and go away, well, I suggest trimming the nail short. It it a lot more efficiently. All right. The second gamechanging tip aside from keeping your nails trimmed short is to and you you eyeball out. All right, just just reach on through tap on the glass like a cat, right? Claw it out. You already know. You probably already know. I tell you what I tell you in 99% of my videos where I give some sort of skincare product recommendation. Trust me, you going to want to get some petroleum jelly. I don make the rules. I the facts. You nail slugging. Slugging is a popular approach to the facial skin care routine, the nighttime routine specifically, whereas the last step, you slug yourself. You look like a little greasy, wet, moist slug going to bed with a face full of petroleum jelly. It locks everything in, really reduces transepidermal water loss. But try doing this for your fingernails. Just do it like every night for 2 weeks and they really it corner because it helps reduce water loss from the nail plate and around the folds and it helps to protect the skin around the nails allowing for reduction and access if you will of water as well as other irritants. This is especially true if you come in contact with water frequently on your bare hands throughout the day. that really can just do a number on your fingernails. If you have recently removed some sort of nail cosmetic adornment, artificial nail, you know, glue on nails, whatever, it can leave your nails pretty dry, brittle, prone to breakage, papery thin. Get yourself some petroleum jelly and get on that slugging game. It really can make a difference. In addition to petroleum jelly, I do suggest moisturizing your hands frequently with a moisturizer that contains ura or glycolic acid or lactic acid. These really can help strengthen the nail plate significantly and get things back on track. Not to mention, they help soften and gently exfoliate dry, rough, builtup skin around the nail, the nail fold, allowing for the barrier there to perform better and protecting the nail. They help improve moisture retention in these areas. so that the natural turnover processes of the skin around the nail is more efficient. When it comes to healthy nail growth, this might come as a surprise to you, but the name of the game is good blood flow. Good blood flow to the nails is really going to help them to grow out. So, that can be something as simple as tapping your fingers frequently, using your hands a lot, provided the nail is trimmed short, this can actually help get you faster faster fingernail growth. As a matter of fact, I used to play the violin. not what I was meant to do in life. All right. It was very hard. It was very difficult. I really really struggled with playing the violin because it difficult. But uh it sucked. Pearlman would probably disagree. Uh anyway, I always noticed when I was playing the violin that my left hand fingernails would grow so fast from the fiddlin. And yeah, that you increase blood flow to the nails and it increases nail growth. But um you can you can biohack that. No ice baths involved. You can biohack that a bit further and get yourself minoxidil. Yeah. Rogain. Apply it around the nails and the cuticles daily. And within a week you can start appreciating that the nails grow faster. And it the fact that minoxidil increases vasoddilation allowing for better blood flow to the nails. This is proven by small studies. Okay. So, no huge randomized control trials, but it definitely can work. And and so minoxidil, if you topical medication used to treat hair loss. You put it on your scalp, but if you put it on your fingernails, it can make them grow faster. Now, an unwanted side effect of topical minoxidil is that if it gets on the sides of your face, it necessarily want it. Same holds true for putting it on your fingers. you might touch your face or touch somebody else and, you know, repeatedly and then they, you know, start having some unwanted hair in those areas. So, you might instead when you at night and cover your hands with gloves. Um, that can help it to stay localized to that area and not transfer elsewhere. A word of warning, minoxidil can be toxic to your pets. Okay? So, if you not be a good idea. Small pets have been known to be harmed. in the veterinary literature, you could find cases of this. So, I you know, I wouldn to happen to your pets. But not everyone has pets and they\\ on. That doesn you know. It definitely can help. But, you know, sort of a poor man with no uh side effects is to just tap your fingers a lot and that increase blood flow that way can certainly certainly help. And then the last tip I don miss it and then maybe it problem for you and you video exists to go back and watch and you have to remind you that there video already in in the tip jar of videos that I have. If you ever get a hangail, it water torture. Uh, drip drip drip. It the worst little physical discomfort to have a hangail cuz it seems to catch on everything. You seem to get them more in the winter time when you certain sweaters and it Hangails, however, you do not want to chew on, bite, try and pull off with your teeth. I know it they always seem to pop up when you somewhere far away from home where you have no resources available but the teeth in your own head. And let me tell you, you don it underneath. Not to mention the critters in your mouth can cause an infection around your nail. So, don But what you can do is either put some petroleum jelly on it to protect it, allow it to heal faster. But you can also get those little nail scissors that come in the manicure kits. Trim the hang nail so that it they get real long. They and thready. and those are like really annoying. Trim it so it And then get yourself a little super glue. Put a tiny little dot of super glue and just physically glue it down. That glue will just keep it in place, prevent it from snagging on everything, allow you to forget about it so you can go on with your life, sweaters and all. And then the skin underneath will start to come in. You know, the healthy skin will start to come in and it grow out and be a thing of the past. A thing of the past. But yeah, hang nails are a nuisance and they common. Like if you do a lot of wet work, damage to the cuticles, certain manicure practices um can lead to their formation for sure. So those are my unexpected nail care hacks that really can work, especially if you with brittle nails, slow nail growth. But as I say in all of my videos, it super important to really have some idea of why it is you have the problems that you have, okay? Because you know what they say, what works for one person doesn main reasons that is the case is because what what just have the same symptom, but they don So, for example, um you might have dry, brittle nails because you 60s. You while ago. just a feature of age for the nails to get more brittle, more prone to dryness with age. Maybe, however, you got slow nail growth and brittle nails because you do a lot with your hands as part of your occupation and they exposed to a lot of stuff. Maybe you like to kind of keep them long and then they get snagged on things. Or maybe you have a thyroid disease. Okay, maybe it your thyroid. Or maybe it you pursue different cosmetics for your nails. Um, gel nails and they the nails very papery thin. Or or humor me this cuz I am a doctor of nails and yeah, it dermatologist. There are diseases that affect the nails and can really do a number on nail growth and nail strength. For example, like in planus, an inflammatory skin condition can affect the nails. Psoriasis, having attopic dermatitis, a form of eczema, can affect the hands. You can get a hand eczema. And as that inflammation on the fingers, it water blisters that itch and leak clear fluid. As that inflammation, well, it starts to creep on in around the nail folds and can leave you with brittle nails. Maybe just a couple of fingers of the more affected hand or all all your fingers. or maybe you have a nail fungal infection. Although, as a reminder, nail fungus, common for the toenails, rare for the fingernails. So, if you go to a doctor, especially if they like a derm, and you say, nails. They not growing right. at them and they say, got on micosis. You need another opinion. disease is not something that most most physicians get much training on outside of dermatologist. So to say it fungus without yeah it needs to be evaluated properly. You know there are a lot of things that could be going on and nail fungus for the fingernail is just not not common. I happens. Okay. There are certain situations where it could happen but more often than not something else in the fingernail. So don that. see try and get in to see a dermatologist for a proper nail evaluation. It can tell you a lot of information with very few uh tests, but sometimes more involved tests are needed like a nail biopsy. It when people say they went to a dermatologist for their nails and they were just told to take, you know, whatever supplement that the derm happens to be selling at their office and no proper evaluation, no physical exam of the nail, no blood work or anything was ordered to rule out this that or the other. Yeah, I hear you. That is that because what is even the point of a dermatologist at that point? because we well informed, very adept at really complicated nail disorders. Anyway, y for your nails video was informative and that you enjoyed it. But on the end slate, it production value is so high quality um that it sort of award. It which if you oncolysis, I suggest diving into this video maybe when you don next day because your mind is just going to be racing. You high after you watch this video. I mean, you think you on that Excel spreadsheet that you being required to complete as part of your job. Okay? So, keep that in mind when you click into one of my videos. Um, I activating effects it may have on your mind. All right. Racing thoughts of, you know, saving the world one fingernail at a time. But click with caution cuz it a doozy. All right, y one on the end slate if you frisky. But if you like this one, give it a thumbs up, share with your friends, and as always, don and subscribe. I tomorrow. Bye. [Music] Yeah. Heat.

How To Fix Nail Splitting | Onycholysis	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oA7iA8X2lcw	Dr Day	no I of those of you who have clicked into this video I already know that a large chunk of you have a white blob on your fingernail that has been bothering you for some time you there at your desk procrastinating work staring at your fingernails going huh why do I keep getting that what is that is there something wrong with me am I dying on the inside well before you panic you we opaque white blob on your fingernail it separation of the nail plate from the underlying nail bed the white blob is not actually white coloration in your nail but rather it is air under the nail plate what you are seeing is basically the equivalent of if you have ever seen a car with that peel and stick window tint and it starts to Bubble Up those little bubbles here white where the peel and stick window tint is peeling up off the underlying window in this case your nail plate is the window tint and your nail bed is the underlying window glass and that white blob that you is an air bubble this is in contrast to True white spots in the nails AKA Luca nikkia as a side note I have a whole video All About Luca nikkia so after this rip roaring good time you to want to check that one out next uh because the Panic train of nail finding should not end with an ausus I this is actually a super super common nail disorder in fact if you go into Walmart you go into your grocery store you go shopping around and you get real weird and go up to people and ask if you can look at their nails I guarantee the majority of people in there you to find some an aisus it common it catastrophize although although it can occur in a variety of more pressing settings all of which we will detail today so now that you have some understanding of what this actually is it an air bubble it most commonly is going to affect the nail at the tip the distal end right where the nail bed kind of ends the free margin that where it that air bubble up close to the little Half Moon lunula aka the distal nail Matrix these white blobs are usually irregular in shape they kind of have an abnormal border they might be more to the lateral part of the nail tip the nail surface itself is usually smooth but if you have underlying conditions that are causing this you might have nail pitting you might have a rough nail you might have some chalkiness on the nail plate anlysis is not life-threatening however if left untreated it does open you up for infections of the nail because you have sort of this EXP exposed nail bed so to speak under that air bubble and you are at greater risk for fingernail infections with nail fungus and with that pesky little bacteria that thrives in moist conditions and water pomonis pomonis causes the nail to turn green as a side note I have a video all about green nails caused by pomonis complication that you might encounter if you long time so check that rager out if if you want to know more about green nail syndrome but green nail syndrome is a complication that might arise with long-standing untreated on ausis so why the heck do you have this why is the nail plate lifting up off the nail bed well let me tell you it it the buck does not stop here with a simple well this is why because there are many many possible reasons one of the most common reasons for this is simply nail trauma repeat trauma to the nail causing parts of the nail plate to lift up manicures are going to be a culprit this is one of the many reasons why I caution against aggressive cuticle manipulation pushing back the cuticles because that is definitely something that you might develop and use of nail Cosmetics or other chemicals around the nails that are irritating to The Nail such as acetone nail polish remover nail polish itself and all the various nail uh adhesives nail Cosmetics gel nail manicures Etc all can be really rough on the nail and cause parts of it to lift up from the underlying nail bed not just the nail Cosmetics but also things that you might encounter such as chemicals that you might have to work with in your occupation if you do a lot of what I describe as wet work where you have frequent water immersions of your fingers man that can really take a toll on your hands your fingernails and it can really Jack you up and it wonder that the nail plate might be lifting up because it irritating so that we do see a lot more on ausis say in somebody who does a lot of dishwashing and sometimes they slack on wearing gloves they wash dishes by hand so that would be another situation then moving away from traumatic things irritants manicures occupational hazards then you also have underlying skin conditions that can affect the nail and one finding you will often en counter would be oncolysis the quintessential anotic nail disorder is going to be psoriasis so much so that it has its own variation of anlysis called the oil spot they get a wide area of the nail plate lifting up from the underlying nail bed it an oil spot because in contrast to the opaque white oncolytic nail of other ideologies in this case it has more of a yellowish pink so it looks like you got grease stain on your fingernail then hand eczemas such as dis hydratic eczema or pomix got a video on that definitely can lead to anlysis um basically it can uh affect one or multiple nails of the affected hand and what you have here is a lot of inflammation around the nail folds allowing for moisture to get up under the nail and you know be a contributing factor here and then there is lyan planus a chronic inflammatory skin condition that definitely can really negatively impact one check out my video about ly and planus I do a deep dive there it is a longer video so get your popcorn if that rage bait sounds like a train you want to hop on then you have infections nail fungus can cause the nail plate to lift up AKA oncolysis uh you know I before but fingernail fungus is not really common it toenail fungus so if you colosus of the toenails you might be inclined to consider uh a a toenail fungus in that situation but another infection that freaks people out rightly so it freaks me out and makes me itch because it want to deal with is called scabies scabies is a Mite that burrows up under the skin and it itch for a reason cuz your immune system is like get this freaky decky thing out of me and even after it cleared up and goes the way the itch lasts for a long time but scabies mites they like to burrow in the web spaces between your fingers and they like to get up under your fingernails and you know go to town up under there and no wonder there um Don but just you know covering all the bases here then you have underlying medical conditions that can mess up your nail and might lead to lifting up of the nail plate from the nail bed a real uh doozy on the nails in general is going to be problems with your thyroid hyperthyroid or hypothyroid affects the nails in a variety of ways on ausis being one check out my video all about how uh thyroid disease impacts the nails I go over all sorts of nail findings with thyroid disease specifically um also diabetes can impact the nails and lead to anlysis and not a disease but rather just a state of being pregnancy definitely can cause on ausis then you medications and this is important because I feel as though a lot of people um don definitely freaks them out um a variety of medications can cause what a photoon olysis meaning you the drug and then you go out in the sun ultraviolet radiation from the Sun exposed to your nails causes a a basically like this the same thing that we talk about with a photo dermatitis but this time it nail nail causes them to lift up in contrast to maybe some of these other situations it affect all exposed Nails what drugs do this Tetra cycling antibiotics like doxy cycling fluoroquinolone antibiotics also um certain oral retinoids like acet tretin atine and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that you might take for pain relief most commonly diclofenac it um toenails if you wear closed toed shoes but if you go out with flip-flops sandals no no coverage of your toenails yeah you too also medications known as sorin which um are used as part of Pua therapy then there are chemotherapeutics uh specifically taxines check out my video all about skin care during chemotherapy I believe I mentioned that taxines can be well quite taxing to your nails and this is one one of many nail issues all right so those are some of the broad categories of things that can cause this but in the vast majority of you it to be just trauma wet work um if you have an underlying condition like psoriasis for example and you like I described that oil slick you might also have nail pitting that another common nail psoriasis finding on a clysis can affect just one fingernail it can affect multiple it can affect all fingernails it can just affect toenails a couple of toenails all toenails or it can affect all fingers all toes you know things going on internally like a thyroid disease or diabetes you might be dealing with more wide spread you know involving all 20 nails but not necessarily so just kind of keep that in the back of your lunchbox there for snack time um all right now like I said at the start of the video the main thing that it needs to be distinguished from is Luca nikkia Lucan nikkia is true whiteness in the nail in contrast to anacusis Lucan Nikia is not due to lifting up of the nail plate it air bubble it nail is still attached to the nail plate with Lucan nikkia so that that if you will which is Shand for differential diagnosis the white blob that you it and and stare it at thee stare it in the eye as long as you want it going to reattach to the nail bed okay so just get that through your head it not going to go away overnight there nothing that overnight it spontaneously readhere but but don don get that to go away with time provided okay provided that whatever underlying issue caused it in the first place has been addressed if you fungus infection and you just expect the anlysis to autoresolve well that that incorrectly if you you got to get your thyroid checked out treated and then the nail can get back to where it needs to be keep in mind that you you got to be patient here because Nails don once that trigger or inciting event or underlying issue is controlled treated the nail will grow out and the new Healthy Nail that grows in will stick to the nail bed like it you got to be patient fingernails grow roughly in 4 to 6 months it takes for finger fingernails to grow out toenails significantly slower anywhere from 8 months to a year to get your toenails to grow out but with appropriate treatment of the underlying cause they can recover new Healthy Nail will grow in and adhere down just got to be patient and stay consistent the reason it your nail to treat the underlying cause and Tackle this or avoid the trigger and I okay so don without without that um you gosh here she goes again just telling us to go to our doctor now I give you some practical at home stuff to do too okay you in the back rolling your eyes getting ready the reason treating the underlying cause is so important so that the new Healthy Nail can grow in adhere to the nail bed is that if anlysis goes unchecked and you continuing to have an oncolytic nail that bubble is going to open up the possibility wherein the underlying nail bed cornify and turns into for all intents and purposes the same kind of skin as what you have like on your finger and at that point then no new nail is going to adhere to that you see the nail bed is much different in the way that it is made structured compared to the skin on the rest of your finger it the nail plate will adhere to that but if that bubble is open for too long unchecked yeah that nail bed can cornify and you get what nail bed for example that that some patients who have like lyan plainis or psoriasis of the nails that something that they might experience because those conditions are really hard to control in the nails so they do deal with a lot of long-standing anlysis the first thing you want to do is trim that nail short and keep it trimmed short this is going to do a couple of things it going to kind of help to prevent that spread if you will of the anlysis the other thing that you want to do is be really proactive with minimizing unnecessary trauma to The Nail like don your fingernails long and and use your nails to do a lot of things like peeling off labels get someone else to do that okay push that off on someone else uh don struggle with nail biting you to want to check out my video on how to stop nail biting because I give a comprehensive overview of a complete Behavioral reorientation to stop biting your nails nail biting is you know something I didn to help with the anlysis that and you fingers in your mouth where you got all kinds of bacteria and stuff you to get a nail infection you get a a nail infection then um you want to also in addition to avoiding trauma you gloves uh especially if you lot of wet work wear gloves don down on the glove wearing thing because it really makes a difference not only for controlling and you know preventing it from recurring so the new Healthy Nail can grow out appropriately but also like I said you kind of have a little vulnerable territory there where if you do if you no gloves on um that simonis can creep up on in there and you can get green nail syndrome if you do have green nail Syndrome again check out my video on that but you doing those uh dilute vinegar soaks that I talked about in that video so if you to watch the video some patients um you know it kind of gets a little a little uncomfortable and they do well with not only trimming the nails short but actually taking some tape and taping the nail down that that provides some relief uh throughout the day and then you also want to take measures to avoid unnecessary exposure to irritance bail on manicures bail on nail polish nail polish remover I mean just leave your nails alone no clipping the cuticles no trimming none of that nails are more than just a cosmetic adornment they are really important for a lot of our manual activities dexterity Precision God forbid if you ever are in a situation where you lose your nails you will really come to appreciate how valuable they are they tapping on bottles good news though in the vast majority of cases you can recover from this and uh it addressing the underlying cause so that to anlysis but um take a little break get yourself a beverage get yourself some popcorn um call and sick to work because you want to miss my video All About Luca Nikia and then when you go back to work you can just throw around words like Luca nikkia on a colosus and people will be like oh my God this person is so smart that they burden you with unnecessary tasks at work because they like beholden to you and they to go above and beyond to make your life as easy as possible so watch that video next but if you guys like this one give it a

Why You Have White Spots On The Nails	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvYbDuzKY24	Dr Day	have you ever left your toenail polish on Just a Touch too long or maybe you been wearing artificial nails for a long time you go to take them off and all of a sudden you see these bizarre looking white marks on your toenails maybe your fingernails they could be spots they could be lines and you going oh my gosh have I developed some gnarly nail fungal infection do I have some sort of mineral or vitamin deficiency am I dying from the inside out listen before you continue on this Panic train take a deep breath because in today talking about these mysterious white marks on the nails white spots white lines the medical term for this is Lucan Nikia there are several different types of Lucan Nikia white spots and many underlying potential root causes we going to cover some of the most common in today understand the basics of what leads to white marks on the nails the white marks on the nails can appear that way due to reflection of all W lengths of visible light off the surface of the nail obscuring the underlying nail bed vasculature this is known as a true Luca Nikia when you press on the white Mark it actually going on in the nail itself Not underneath the nail and this implies that there is a problem going on at the level of the nail Matrix specifically the distal nail Matrix the nail Matrix houses the Machinery the cells that build your nail plate and some sort of trauma or injury to the distal nail Matrix which is that little white half moon that you see with your eyes some sort of problem going on there leads to abnormal keratinization and the cells are not quite turning over right almost like the cells in your pore when they don pore a blackhead a white head otherwise known as a comeone well here instead of that because there get this funky looking white spot true lucania is different from another type called apparent lucania apparent lucania in contrast to True will blanch when you press on it and the reason is because in contrast to True lucania which arises due to a problem in the distal nail Matrix apparent lucania has to do with some sort of compression of the underlying blood vessels that make up the nail bed so it not a nail Matrix problem and that might be related to something causing compression of the blood vessels swelling tissue edema and it gets a touch more complicated in that you can have something called a pseudo lucania pseudo lucania happens due to something causing direct trauma to The Nail plate in contrast to true and apparent lucania pseudo lucania are these white marks it can be spots or lines that if you scrape at them this white chalky material comes off the reason for this is that something external some sort of problem external caus disruption in the ability of those nail cells to lie down properly so it flaky scaly skin on the face except in this instance it scaly nail cells on the nail plate it called a pseudo lucania doesn do with a problem in the nail Matrix and it doesn the nail bed it is a Surface nail issue the most common lucania is a true lucania where you have little white spots and this is most often seen in young children related to trauma of the nail distal Matrix it won you press on it one nail may be affected or several Nails may be affected different Nails may be affected in different ways and the spots can change as the nail grows out the most common myth I hear about these nail spots is that they are a warning sign of low calcium or low iron that while underlying nutritional deficiencies definitely can different of lucania they do not cause this punctate true lucania that you see commonly in children or people who have maybe had manicures it trauma to the distal nail Matrix not an underlying nutritional deficiency some cases you might develop these little white spots secondary to an underlying chronic skin condition or hair loss disorder like alopecia Arata or psoriasis the other true lucania are the formation of transverse white lines that run parallel to the little Half Moon these were first observed and described as me nails they mm in diameter these were first observed in association with arsic poisoning they can be seen about 60 days usually after exposure to arsenic but this is not the only cause of these horizontal White Lines a true lucania you also can develop these transverse White Lines a true Lucan secondary to trauma and often we see this in people who maybe forget to trim their toenails or like to keep their toenails long or they wear tight fitting shoes you know real narrow pointy toe shoes that compress the toes together creates a lot of pressure on the free edge of that long toenail and that leads to trauma of the distal nail Matrix because this is a true looking Nika and the formation of those horizontal white bands you can also develop these as a result of other things that traumatize like the nail folds and lead to damage to the distal nail Matrix such as if you develop a wart in this area and you go to the dermatologist and they freeze it with that liquid nitrogen spray well unfortunately a bystandard injury of that treatment might be to damage the distal Matrix and lead to the formation of this true lucania it provided you are not continuing to have that liquid nitrogen spray for the rest of your life now you might need multiple liquid nitrogen spray treatments to get rid of the wart so it might take a long time for this to go away if that something that you develop other traumas to The Nail folds can lead to the formation of these transverse White Lines such as trimming the cuticles pushing the cuticles back aggressive manicures provided the underlying root cause is addressed it does take some time for this to grow out the fingernails grow roughly a millimeter every 6 to 10 days so it does take some time for this to grow out once the underlying root cause has been addressed alleviated and removed trauma would lead to the formation of these transverse White Lines only on the nails that are affected by the trauma but if you see someone or you yourself have developed white horizontal lines that affect all 10 fingernails all 10 Toes that is more worrisome that there on internally that might be affecting the nail Matrix we see this with patients who take chemotherapy medications to treat cancers chemotherapy can impact the nails in many different ways check out my video All About chemotherapy and Skin Care around chemotherapy I give a lot of tips and warnings about what might happen but it definitely can lead to the formation of these because it affects those cells in the nail Matrix now I know the word toxin gets thrown around a lot in the wellness space and is very vague so let toxic can lead to the formation of horizontal white lines on the nails a true Lucan Nikia because it is damaging the nail Matrix horizontal lucania might also be seen with underlying nutritional deficiencies or underlying autoimmune disease namely lupus athetosis check out my video all about the warning signs of systemic lupus athmos I do mention in that video that Nails can be affected and the development of a true lucania is one such way and who here likes to hike at Al altitude well that can put a lot of wear and tear on your body due to the altitude you can develop something known as Everest nail seen in people who will hike Mount Everest which is very taxing on the body due to well hypoxia the oxygen content up there is not that great and it affects the body in many different ways including of course your nails because the cells are vulnerable to that hypoxic injury also the medication used to treat and prevent altitude sickness acetazolamide might also contribute to a certain extent to the formation of true lucania let about apparent lucania not a problem with the nail Matrix but rather a problem with the nail bed apparent lucania can be seen if your albumen a protein in the blood gets way too low this might happen if you have underlying kidney disease or severe malnutrition when the albumin drops so low it leads to a problem with sweat swelling due to the inability of your blood to retain fluid it leaks out and so this can essentially result in tissue edema in the nail bed leading to an apparent lucania it see the formation of these pale bands that are parallel to the uh half moon to the lunula what about vertical white lines have you ever seen those on someone longitudinal lucania could be true or apparent true in that it affects the distal nail Matrix causes of this might include underlying hereditary diseases something known as deras disease can lead to vertical white lines alternating with vertical red lines known as candy cane Nails longitudinal true lucania may also be due to some sort of abnormality in one part of the nail Matrix such as the growth known as an Ono matricoma you also can have a longitudinal apparance lucania Amia will blanch of course with compression and it problem in the nail Matrix but rather you guessed it the nail b a parent lucania is in the bed a nail bed tumor known as an onop papiloma can lead to the formation of a vertical white line that goes away with compression all right now that we causes of true versus apparent lucania or white spots white lines what about pseudo lucania that to do was something coming and sort of causing problems from the outside into the nail itself making it crumbly and if you or to pick at it you get this powdery white stuff if this is happening on your fingernails or your toenails the most common reason for this is actually secondary to nail Cosmetics repeatedly exposing the nail plate to artificial nails nail glue or to nail polish remover can actually damage the nail plate in those areas mess up the uh nail itself make it kind of mushy white and crumbly also can dry out the nail and lead to a pseudo lucania so it nail matrix it nail bed it injury of the nail plate itself locally disrupting the ability of the nail cells to remain lying down in the nail plate these nail Cosmetics essentially lead to the dehydration of the nail keratin and so those nail cells lift up and you get flaking the other reason for a pseudo lucania remember not a problem with the Matrix not a problem with the bed is actually a fungal infection this is known as superficial white Ono mosis the nail fungus invades the nail plate and causes these crumbly white spots this is most commonly going to be something that happens on the toenails it rare very uncommon to have nail fungus of the fingernails if it finger nails and you artificial nails or doing nail Cosmetics manicures nail polish probably related to that but if it toenails one might need to consider it could be a toenail fungus all right guys so that categories of white spots on the nails remember there affects the nail Matrix there lucania which affects the nail bed and then there do with something coming exter internally and causing trauma to the uh nail cells of the nail plate leading to basically they lifting up and flaking around lucania can be punctate meaning little spots it can be horizontal it can be longitudinal now lucania can go away provided you know what the underlying root cause is and you treat and control that for example if you poisoning there there that spots for example if you have a white superficial onicomicosis causing a pseudo lucania those crumbly white spots well you with oral antifungal medications the topical antifungals are unlikely to cut it um at least most usually requires a medication given by mouth so that it can make its way into the nail itself and it does take time you want to be really careful with your nails practice gentle Nail Care no pushing the cuticles back I don clippers just be really gentle keep the nails trimmed short especially the toenails because that pressure on the distal tip of the of a long nail can lead to those horizontal white lines also limit the application of things to The Nail that can be very irritating can cause contact dermatitis such as nail glues nail polish removers or even nail polish itself which can contribute to drying out of the nail make sure your shoes fit well tight poorly fitted shoes can cause a lot of pressure on the toenail leading to lucania also you might need to have your gate analyzed abnormal gate maybe there say in your hip or whatever and you not putting even pressure on your feet and you kind of turn in your your foot maybe you have a neuropathy for example related to I don maybe you had a cancer treatment that left you with neuropathy well that can lead to abnormal gate unnecessary pressure on the nail and ultimately lead to the formation of lucania frequent use of moisturizers provided you allergic or irritated by them can also help I petroleum jelly around the nail folds to help prevent the access of ear tense that could cause a contact dermatitis and further slow nail growth also helps to protect the nail Matrix from unwanted moisture getting up under there moisturizers with Ura lactic acid salicylic acid glycolic acid all can really help with the health of the nail plate as well so those would be some interventions that you might consider but again you root cause and go after that otherwise you really hope this video was helpful to you guys on the insulate I put my recent video all about why you have those pesky vertical nail ridges and how to get rid of them so check that one out next but if you

How To Stop Green Nails After Press Ons	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYCVQserdEg	Dr Day	oh my God why do I have a green blob on my nail after taking off press on nails we video a green nail is a bacterial nail infection with the bacteria pomonis pomonis is ubiquitous white spread in our environments soils water it really thrives in moist conditions it is not part of our normal skin microbiome it is a pathogen it it produces the green pigments pyo veridin and pyocyanin and that is that green yellow discoloration on the nail plate that you were seeing you might also have inflammation around the proximal nail fold that the tip of your nail plate might be splitting you can develop this as a result of wearing press on nails that perhaps trap moisture under that artificial nail or as a result of manicure practices that create a lot of microt traumas around the nail itself the proximal nail fold for example if you aggressively trim your cuticles as I to all sorts of nail infections like I said it moist conditions so it for nail biters to develop this also if you do a lot of wet work washing dishes by hand maybe you a hairdresser you these are occupations that are at risk for green nail pomonis is considered an opportunistic infection meaning it takes advantage of the opportunity to infect you when you are down and in the case of the nail for otherwise healthy people that trauma around the nail and damage to the Skin Barrier from wet work nail biting or wearing artificial nails Etc but it becomes more of a problem in people who are imuno compromised it a lot of patients might encounter when they sorts of problematic and serious infections for patients it uncommon for people who have a green nail from a pseudomonal nail infection to have co-infection with other things such as candada or other fungi for the most part it in otherwise healthy people we can treat this and it can go away and usually there are no serious complications however there have been reports of patients who Auto inoculate the pomonis into say a cut or scrape meaning they scratch with the infected nail and they introduce that little problematic water-loving bacteria into say Cuts scrapes and get a skin infection this is significantly more common in women than men now we fingernails today but this also can happen to your toenails usually just one toenail and it people who stand in sort of moist conditions people who have to stand a lot wearing tight fitted shoes where their feet are sweaty in the shoe and they socks dry shoes that you can develop a green toenail now when you have this it evaluated by your health care provider because there are some other things that kind of look like this but are not it for example you might have a subungual hematoma basically a bruise a collection of blood under the nail maybe you whacked your nail a lot of people have experienced this at some point in their life maybe you have onicomicosis a fungal nail infection that yellow you might have dark brown bands on the nail that and in people who have deeper skin tones that finding on a couple of nails and the more worrisome thing on the differential diagnosis would be a subungual melanoma melanoma of the nail while it easy for a dermatologist to diagnose this by looking at it it would be prudent to go ahead and take a culture because like I said it co-infection with other things so when considering treatment options you might want to add uh treatments to cover those Co infections as well how do you go about getting rid of this well in otherwise healthy people one of the most straightforward approaches is to do white vinegar soaks um you want to make a solution of one part white vinegar to four parts tap water you say white vinegar it can actually be any vinegar but white vinegar is like the cheapest it doesn want the ratio to be roughly one part white vinegar to 4 to 10 parts plain tap water basically you to 1% white vinegar solution once you make that up you nail for 10 minutes twice a day after you soak the nail make sure you dry it really well with a towel because again that little B bacteria loves moisture after about a month and otherwise healthy people this usually does a trick to get rid of it it may take longer remember nails are slow to grow there also a variety of topical antibiotics that could be prescribed such as gamiz and solution to apply to the nail to treat this but if we can get away with treating it with white vinegar not only is that cheap but decreases the risk of uh bacterial resistance moving forward how do you prevent recurrences of this make sure you keep the nails dry I would suggest avoiding press on nails in the future because it do trap moisture around the nail that favors the development of sudin monal nail infections especially if you someone who does a lot of wet work try your best to keep the nails dry uh make sure that if you do a lot of wet work you are thoroughly drying your hands and the skin around the nails I also suggest wearing gloves to protect your hands and your nails as well it also is helpful for preventing recurrences if after you dry the hands very thoroughly you apply some good old plain petroleum jelly to act as a skin protectant especially around the nail folds to limit access of little microbes around the nail that not only can cause this type of infection but also infection around the skin folds around the nail it can be pretty painful all right guys so that nail pseudomonal nail infection I hope this video was informative and educational now on the es slate I going to link my recent video all about why you have vertical nail ridges so check check that one out next if that something that you deal with or are bothered by U but if you guys enjoyed this video

8 Biotin Deficiency Warning Signs NOT TO MISS | Hair, Skin, & Nails	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmQVNNZvnm8	Dr Day	warning signs you the skin is a window to what is going on internally in today to be covering the dermatologic findings the hair the skin the nail changes that suggest you might be biotin deficient biotin is an essential micronutrient it is a B vitamin commonly referred to as vitamin H human tissues don biotin however bacteria that live in a large intestine can produce Biotin and it found in fruits vegetables nuts seeds legumes whole grains Meats fish and dairy products biotin is an essential co-factor for enzymes known as carboxylases which are really important for things like fatty acid synthesis glucano Genesis the expression and control of different genes biotin deficiency doesn at once its onset in terms of symptomatology is gradual and onset but again the skin can be an early warning sign so what are some warning signs that you are biotin deficient when it com to the skin hyperesthesia heighten sensitivity to light touch maybe you notice that when your hair brushes against your face it feels uncomfortable conjunctivitis or red eyes kind of look like you have pink eye and glossitis which is the medical terminology for an inflamed red swollen painful tongue now if you on this channel with regards to the skin signs of various micronutrient deficiencies you is a common finding so it to biotin deficiency but it certainly can be found all right probably what biotin is most well known for is how important it is for healthy hair growth if you are biotin deficient you can expect to experience thinning of the hair and gradual hair loss not just from your scalp but from the rest of your body as well including sparse thinning lashes brows and eventual total body hair loss if allowed to progress untreated biotin is also important for healthy nail growth people who are biotin deficient develop very brittle nails with splitting of the nails bind and deficiency leads to a characteristic facial rash it is periorificial in location meaning it occurs around orifices like around the mouth the nose and the eyes this rash is scaly flaky and dry in appearance sometimes easily mistaken for sebc dermatitis it can become more widespread and involve the skin around the anogenital area sometimes it might also look like psoriasis or the dry skin condition iosis as with many other nutrient deficiency it is not uncommon to develop dry scaly flaky skin in general with biotin deficiency because the skin becomes dry flaky the barrier is impaired again you don function of those key enzymes you are more predisposed to skin infections with different fungi and yeast so you may develop candidal yeast infections in the skin folds readily as a result of your biotin deficiency check out my video on signs of yeast infection on the skin to go into more Det detail with what those might look like outside of the skin hair nail and mucous membrane warning signs of biotin deficiency you can also start to feel well generally quite unwell and have neurologic problems such as seizures brain fog depression many patients with biotin deficiency also have muscle aches and pain these are non-specific but definitely can go along with biotin deficiency while these findings can occur with biotin deficiency they specific and so you might be freaking out looking at your SE dermatitis on your face worry that you have Biotin deficiency so who exactly is at risk for biotin deficiency this may come as a surprise to you but a a group of people who are at risk for sure are individuals who rather enjoy regularly consuming raw egg whites uncooked egg whites when ingested on a regular basis I talking about once or twice here and there to be cool around your friends I talking as part of your regular diet consuming raw egg whites can easily lead to biotin deficiency the reason for this is that raw egg whites contain a glycoprotein known as avidin which binds to Biotin and affects its absorption fortunately when you cook egg whites this denatures the abidin so it issue patients who are in the hospital and have to be placed on a type of nutrition known as total parental nutrition these patients are at risk for a variety of nutrient deficiencies including biotin if not properly addressed anytime I do a video on the warning signs of any sort of of nutritional deficiency I always have to bring this up but a group of people who are at risk for all sorts of nutrient deficiencies are individuals who struggle with chronic alcoholism alcohol specifically inhibits the absorption of biotin it who chronically abuse alcohol to have low Biotin and put themselves at risk for biotin deficiency as well as a whole host of other B vitamin deficiencies in fact plasma biotin concentrations are low and about 15% of patients with chronic alcohol ISM pregnant and breastfeeding women are also at risk for well low biotin I should say as a matter of fact many pregnant women have low plasma levels of biotin plasma and breast milk concentrations of biotin also can commonly be low in lactating women so if you are pregnant or breastfeeding make sure you discuss with your obstetrician regarding optimal nutrition and if you need to be supplementing with biotin then there are certain medications that can interfere with biotin absorption or enhance its metabolism making your biotin levels low specifically medications used to treat seizure disorders such as carbom mipim phenin phenobarbitol primene anyone who has an underlying malabsorption problem whether that be related to some sort of surgical reection a part of their digestive tract or an underlying medical condition that makes it difficult for them to absorb nutrients from their Foods they there are three very rare genetic conditions that lead to biotin deficiency but if you had that you would know those are usually diagnosed when you serious consequences to being left untreated this is one of the most important takeaways from today is that biotin deficiency is actually super rare unless you amounts of raw egg whites unless you struggle with alcoholism unless you have a very rare genetic Condition it very uncommon to have Biotin deficiency it is readily obtained from our diet if you are eating provided you don some malabsorption syndrome you are unlikely to be biotin deficient it very very unlikely what that you have hair loss related to age or you have CC dermatitis which is common check out my videos on it or you have brittle nail syndrome which commonly affects middle-aged women all right that supplement with biotin will it actually help us out there research to support taking biotin supplements for Hair Skin or nails despite the fact that biotin supplements and Hair Skin and nail vitamins are widely available heavily promoted and heavily sought after for that matter there is a small bit of research that suggests that biotin supplementation might be helpful for the brittle nail syndrome however more research is needed whoop-de-do why not just take biotin regardless well biotin supplementation actually can be pretty harmful why it can interfere with certain blood tests that your doctor might order to check for certain things biotin supplementation has actually led to false positive results meaning the lab test says you have a disease you don have also false negative tests meaning the lab test says you don disease that you actually have why does this happen well when your doctor sends your blood to the lab to be tested for certain things there are different ways to test the blood and certain blood tests utilize a technology known as biotin strip avidin it but if you have very high levels of bio in the blood it can interfere with how this particular test Works resulting in either falsely high or falsely low lab values what are some examples of lab tests that can be affected by taking biotin test to check thyroid hormone test to check vitamin D a test known as the pro BNP this is a test that might be ordered in the hospital to check to see if you are in congestive heart failure for example taking 10 milligram of biotin within 24 hours of having your thyroid test taken can screw up the test and you may be thinking well I taking 10 Mig how big of a deal can it be keep in mind they sneak biotin into a lot of things these days I noticed it in a lot of beverages sport drinks energy drinks Etc there have actually been case reports of people diagnosed with Graves disease when they don Graves disease because biotin screwed up their thyroid tests and also super scary is the fact that biotin can interfere with the blood tests that are run to check to see if if you having a heart attack in fact there is one case where someone actually died of a heart attack and their lab tests were showing that they didn for a heart attack because the biotin interfered with a test known as a troponin so if you are taking biotin it within a week of having your blood drawn in order to avoid having it interfere with the accuracy of these blood tests and of course make sure you tell your doctor that you are taking biotin alert them that you have stop taking it in advance of your appointment so that they know that and know that it might influence the lab test here know about you guys but I don plan out when I attack I do but it generally don calendar so how are you going to know to stop your biotin supplementation in advance of having a heart attack you not so in my opinion biotin is one of those things that is way over hype the research supporting taking all this biotin is just not there there evidence that it really solves any common existing problems aside from of course patients who are the exception that do in fact have Biotin deficiency on the flip side rather than solving any problem it is well established to cause a problem meaning inaccurate false positive or false negative blood work which can be quite dangerous it might result in you getting falsely diagnosed with something it might result in a misdiagnosis or it might result in you well having to go through more lab testing more expensive testing and in today well frankly bankrupt because Medical Care ain all of that unnecessary stress can end up well impacting your hair growth and leading to a telogen of fluvium excessive hair shedding all right guys those are the warning signs of biotin deficiency biotin deficiency is very serious and can be life-threatening if left untreated however it so think about that before going after those biotin supplements cuz they might end up harming you rather than helping you I hope this video was informative to you guys now on the ins slate I to put one of my more recent videos on more warning signs of an underlying micronutrient deficiency so check that video out next but if you guys like this one give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don

Why You Have Vertical Nail Ridges And How To Get Rid Of Them	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOSuKhhsE2M	Dr Day	if you is the video for you because today we are going to be talking about what causes vertical nail ridges and I going to be giving you some practical tips and tricks for how to get rid of vertical nail ridges once and for all so you can have smooth shiny strong healthy nails the medical term for vertical nail ridges is ano rexus longitudinal ridges can be superficial or quite deep ridges longitudinal ridges can occur as an isolated finding or they can be accompanied by other nail changes such as nail hitting or horizontal splitting of the distal tip of your nail plate vertical nail ridges are a consequence of factors that disrupt nail plate production or are directly harmful to the nail plate itself now a normal Healthy Nail plate consists of approximately 25 layers of tightly packed keratin aite cells it anywhere from 0.5 to 1 mm in thickness with a smooth surface many things are required for healthy nail growth but one of the critical factors is good blood flow underneath the nail plate have all of these blood vessels that are important for the health and integrity of the nail that into the different causes you will be to understand how important good healthy blood flow is for nail growth so why might you have vertical nail ridges one of the most common reasons for vertical nail ridges is something called the brittle nail syndrome there are a variety of reasons why someone might develop brittle nail syndrome but it appears to be a most common and most likely in middle-aged women it to be related to the fact that the intercellular Bridges between the Keratin aites comprising the nail plate of women are much weaker in comparison to men after menopause the lipid content of the nails starts to drop and you may also have a drop in water content these factors together likely explain brittle nail syndrome which exclusively affects the fingernails not the toenails you can also have vertical nail ridges secondary to a primary skin condition such as atopic dermatitis eczemas psoriasis lyan plis lyen striatus derias disease the autoimmune hair loss disorder alopecia Arata commonly affects the nails as well and that might be a reason for vertical nail ridges you can also develop vertical nail ridges secondary to a fungal nail infection now I said this before and it all that fungal nail infections of the fingernails are not very common if you go to a doctor trying to get to the root cause of your vertical fingernail rides and they tell you just by looking at it that it opinion nail fungus of the fingernail is very rare more likely than not you have something else going on at the very least before coming to that conclusion they would need to do some sort of fungal evaluation like fungal culture a Koh prep so don diagnosis at face value it incorrect but if you have vertical nail ridges on your toenails it could be a sign of toenail fungus you can also develop vertical nail ridges secondary to an underlying a medical condition a health problem such as anemia if you have anemia your blood is not so great at delivering oxygen where it needs to go and that formation of vertical nail ridges and other signs and symptoms probably of brittle fragile nails if you have arterial sclerosis this also can lead to Vertical nail ridging as it impacts blood flow people with underlying thyroid disorders namely hyper or hypothyroidism commonly have vertical nail ridges turns out it takes a lot of energy to grow a strong healthy smooth shiny nail so guess what there a balanced healthy diet if you have any underlying vitamin micronutrient deficiencies you going on a lot of Crash diets it will show up not just in your hair but in your nails one way in which it may appear is in the formation of vertical nail ridges certain medications can impact the nail and lead to Vertical nail ridges namely chemotherapy as a side note if you chemotherapy check out my video on skin care during chemotherapy I give a lot of tips and tricks in that video another very common underrecognized reason for vertical nail ridges is something that is TR traumatic to The Nail plate this is most often seen and people who work with their hands a lot especially people who are doing a lot of what we call wet work and experiencing frequent rewetting of the hands maybe they lot of surfactants detergents in their workplace in their occupation or maybe as it relates to some sort of Hobby and this can be quite harmful in the long run to the nail plate itself and lead to to Vertical nail ridges along the lines of traumatic things to The Nail that lead to Vertical nail ridges is manicuring practices aggressive filing buffing pushing back and clipping the cuticles all can lead to Vertical nail ridges grooming your cuticles is not necessary and in most cases it is actually powerful to the Integrity of the nail plate in the long run many nail Cosmetics such as gel manicures can end up drying out the nail plate quite a bit and leading to Vertical nail ridges keeping the nails long can make them more vulnerable to trauma getting snagged on things and ultimately that can lead to the formation of nail ridges not to mention the longer your nails are the more prone to dehydration they become and with a drop in water content from the nail plate you can get vertical nail ridges all right so those are some of the many reasons why you might have vertical nail ridges so how do you go about correcting this issue what can you do to improve the health of your nails first and foremost treat and control any underlying health problem skin problem that is leading to the formation of vertical nail ridges and negatively impacting the health of your nails if you have a thyroid disorder that needs to be treated first and foremost before you can even begin to consider improving the health of your nails if you have some underlying micronutrient deficiency discuss with your healthc care provider how best to address that so I mentioned that eczema is a common reason for you to end up developing vertical nail ridges especially bouts of hand Eamon kind of ties into why people who uh do a lot of wet work are also more vulnerable not just through the trauma of their occupation to the nails but also they are at risk for an irritant hand eczema check out my video on why you have hand eczema because I give a lot of tips and tricks on how to control that which is very important if you are developing vertical nail ridges because those tips and tricks will help control the hand eczema and help allow for your nail to recover the second thing to do is to limit contact with water and detergents that dry out the nail plate and compromise the lipid content of your nail plate leading to Vertical nail ridges if you work in an occupation that requires you to uh do wet work to work with your hands using things like detergents make sure you always wear gloves to protect your hands likewise just doing basic housework chores use gloves whenever you are working with any kind of cleaning product whether it be a surface wipe keep your hands protected don because it can cause a hand eczema quite easily and impact the health of your nails the third thing I want to address is dietary supplements it there are so many dietary supplements out there claiming to give you great skin air and nails are they worth considering if you ridges so when it comes to dietary supplements for uh improving nail Health nail growth and of course vertical nail ridges there are scattered small studies with numerous limitations for a variety of different micronutrients vitamins Etc check out my video talking in detail about supplements for nails because I go over all of the research that amount of information is too extensive to cover again in this video it would go on too long so I want you to watch that video next number four is to get yourself some petroleum jelly plain Vaseline don waste your time with the cuticle oil cuticle oils they can soften dry rough skin a bit but they offer your nails with petroleum jelly can and what is that petroleum jelly is the best occlusive it helps to protect the skin around the nails so as to limit access of water and debris up under the nail folds that compromises nail growth and it also helps to improve water content in the nail plate itself even better get yourself some gloves apply petroleum jelly to the nails and cover with gloves this really can maximize efficacy do this in the evening time say after you get out of the shower leave the gloves on as long as you can tolerate and if you can sleep for them even better number five is to use a nail treatment with either Alpha hydroxy acid or Ura or a combination of both now Alpha hydroxy acids are a family of ingredients that include glycolic acid lactic acid and mandelic acid and then Ura is just something that is naturally found in your skin these ingredients are actually really good for the nail plate they help to improve the water content in the nail one product I often recommend that works quite well for the nails is uh carousel basically a lacquer that has Ura and Alpha hydroxy acids as well to improve water content in the nail plate painted on the nail underneath the nail and it really can rejuvenate the nail number six may not be desirable to you depending on how you like to Fashion your nails but keep them trimmed short especially if you are in the midst of trying to recover healthy nail growth just keep them Trimm short this does a couple of things first of all it cuts down on nail dehydration second of all it cuts down on nail trauma if you have long nails the tip is more likely to get caught up on something to ding something that can transfer that forward back to the nail Matrix and disrupt healthy nail growth so keep them trimmed short number seven lay off of the aggressive manicures don cuticles this is not good for your nails this is a common reason why women develop vertical nail ridges pushing the cuticles back trimming them there reason to remember that is delicate healthy skin that is there to to serve a function and if you cut it back you push it back not only can It impact the health of the nails negatively but it also opens up that area for moisture to get trapped up under there that can trigger a hand eczema irritation and allows for bacteria fungi to grow and cause nail infections so I don recommend doing that lay off of it especially if you are trying your best to improve the health of the nail plate and my final and probably most important tip when it comes to to considering all of these tips together and implementing them into your life is to be patient takes a while to grow out the nails you appearance of your nails overnight takes at least 6 months for the nail to grow out so patience is key all right guys that Vertical nail ridges I really hope this video was helpful to you guys on the Insight I nail supplements I really want you to watch that one next because it can be so tempting to try out all of these Hair Skin and nail gummies and a lot of them are just smoke and mirrors but if you want to know what the actual science is behind some of them I Do cover it in that video so watch it next but if you

How To Get Rid Of A Hangnail Fast	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIu6LHRH2OY	Dr Day	this video is going to change your life moving forward your life will be significantly better because because I going to tell you once and for all the right way to get rid of a hangnail so contrary to the name it actual nail that nail but rather the skin around the nail it gets torn now why people get these we really do not know they related to bouts of dry skin and an impaired Skin Barrier around the nails people who have to do a lot of wet work where they wash their hands a lot like healthcare workers people who work with food um people who clean offices homes etc for a living do a lot of wet work gardeners Etc um the frequent exposure to water is very irritating to the Skin Barrier including the skin around your nails it can become fragile and tear yes I but here is what you do not want to do and I have to admit I this from time to time you know you out and about you don around and all of a sudden you have a hang nail and the snagging the catching on everything the pain the agony you know you want to nibble you want to nibble you want to chew you want to tear it away don all sorts of junk in your mouth yeast bacteria saliva which is super irritating to the skin and because you have a little tear there you can introduce bacteria yeast all sorts of Little Critters around the nail and cause a nail infection it Paran Nikia plus you down the healing process even further by tearing that back that little tear back exposing more vulnerable parts of the skin around the nail and it be even more painful for you so here is what to do when you get a hangnail and like I said hang nails they have a way of appearing when you know at the airport waiting for a flight you know somewhere where you have no resources what whatsoever but if you happen to have all of these tools at your disposal this is what you to do and it all you and lukewarm water for a few minutes just to soften that little flap of skin then you are going to take your nail clippers you they alcohol prep pad cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol to really clean them then you that little flap of skin to shorten it you completely you shorter especially if it pretty long and sticky ouy yes that medical medical term sticky Aude alternatively you know those manicure kits they always come with those scissors like what are we supposed to do with these scissors well they can be very useful in this situation for trimming that little flap of skin blunt make sure they little alcohol prep pad rubbing alcohol so those can be used in this situation as well then what you going to blow your mind you actually get yourself some super glue Crazy Glue if you videos on cracked heels you Crazy Glue recommendation for sealing up cracks in your heels works like a charm and is a safe thing to do but here you tiny little drop of crazy glue right on that little nubbin of hang nail skin and what that and it relief from the discomfort of having that Jagged Edge this will enable you to go about your day-to-day life and not even think about the Hang nail it painful anymore and it allow it to heal and as it heals that little dead piece of skin flop there will just fall off that word of caution some people are allergic to the cyanoacrylate glues whether it be nail adhesives surgical glues they have ingredients in them that when the glue is wet um they are actually potential allergens and people develop allergy to them and they cause all sorts of problems so if you have an allergy to like nail adhesives or glues things of that sort you this instead of put putting the crazy glue on the little nubbin you going to put plain petroleum jelly plain petroleum jelly that it providing the symptomatic relief cuz it that little nubbin stays down but it will help with healing and it will to a certain extent help alleviate pain just by acting as a barrier so that that is the alternative to Crazy Glue how do you keep from getting these over and over again what we know about hang nails is that they tend to be more of a problem again and people who frequently wash their hands or rewedding a lot you know repeat water exposure maybe you handle a lot of detergents household Cleaning Solutions maybe you are a hairdresser you work with a lot of solutions you your hands get sweaty sweat gets trapped under the glove it is rubbed and there friction and it factors that leave your hands dry including the skin around your nails so number one tip is don that cuticles back and trying to trim them get and get rid of them because that can easily lead to hang nails all that little epinician around the nail can tear as a result of increased fragility from doing this not to mention when you do that allows for moisture microbes air to get up under that little skin flap and affect the cells that actually grow out your nail plate and that can lead to ridging fragility Etc so don person that cuticles back trying to trim them stay away from those Russian manicures I seen on social media Google Russian manicure if you it infection risk for sure um so yeah don do that as dumb as it sounds make sure you are moisturizing your hands all the time um it moisturize your hands maybe at night before you go to bed but if you somebody who is constantly having to wash your hands a lot for your job for example um the wait until night time to put on a little Jurgens lotion come on that need to be super consistent with moisturizing every time you wash your hands and you rinse the cleanser off to help keep your Skin Barrier happy and also moisturize around your nails now are any ingredients specifically that can help cut down on this dry skin buildup that puts you at risk for hang nails around the nail yes Ura love Ura I frequently recommend moisturizers with Ura they can help not only for the skin around your nails but they can also help with the health of your nail plate likewise moisturizers with Alpha hydroxy acids glycolic lactic mandelic can help with the nail plate as well as improve the moisture content of the skin around the nails helping to improve barrier function reduce the buildup of dry rough skin and ultimately help cut down on the those little tears a big tip that can make a difference not just for the formation of hang nails but for the health of your nails is at night ideally like before you go to bed is to put plain petroleum jelly on your nails and around your nails because plain petroleum jelly acts almost like second skin it acts as a barrier and really helps cut down on dry skin buildup around the nails it almost helps to act as a barrier to like moisture and air and things getting up under the nail and causing again nail ridging also splitting and then tearing of the skin around the nails and leading to hang nails if you really want to be more aggressive and take it up a notch what you want to do is get yourself some gloves and put the petroleum jelly all around your fingers fingernails and cover your hands with gloves really will help enhance penetration and really provide more bang for your box so to speak because it just basically helps to keep the petroleum jelly up close to the skin instead of rubbing off with like touching your sheets and things so that is another hack a lot of people don sleeping with gloves on their hands or socks on their feet um but try and hang out that way for an hour or so if you can tolerate it it bit more out of the Vaseline SL petroleum jelly approach all right y that today you deal with hang nails they are not fun but remember don they are not a snack you cause problems for yourself like pain discomfort slow down healing and you can introduce a whole host of Little Critters into the skin around the nail and lead to what which is a nail infection speaking of Critters in your mouth that can cause infections when they get in the wrong place at the wrong time recently I did a video All About signs of a yeast infection and yes you can actually get a yeast infection of the nails so check that video out next I insulate for your viewing pleasure if that sounds interest to you on this Friday uh but if you guys

Best Nail Growth Tips From A Dermatologist	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D-OBSvAllE	Dr Day	well hey guys in today to share with you once and for all how to finally get your nails to grow out long strong and healthy I give you my best tips as a dermatologist for getting your nails to grow out long and healthy and I some things that you are probably doing that are sabotaging your nail growth Journey now my number one tip is to have realistic expectations and behind that comes an understanding of what it is that influences why our nails grow and what exactly it is that leads to nail growth in the first place nail growth comes from a part of the nail unit called The germa Matrix I an image of where that is located and as you can see it is located in an area that you don it access it you would have to cut back that skin and reflect it back if you going to do that I recommend anesthesia because well otherwise it would be very painful those cells there are rapidly dividing and that is what is putting out your nail to a lesser extent you also have a contribution from the nail bed that housed underneath the nail plate the hard part of your nail that of course that you are interested in but the whole nail unit there are a lot of working parts the normal rate of fingernail growth is around 0.1 mm of growth a day that toenails on the other hand grow about 60% slower than your fingernails it going going to take anywhere from 4 to 6 months for a fingernail to grow out completely those germa of Matrix cells that are metabolically active and making the meat of your nail their growth rate can be influenced by many factors some of them you can control others you cannot for example nails grow a lot faster during the day than they do at night you cannot change the Earth rotation on its axis it is what it is so during the day your nails are gr a lot faster not all of your fingernails grow at exactly the same rate your thumbnail and your pinky nail grow a lot slower than the rest of the nails on the hand and your middle fingernail is the one that should grow the fastest and Nails on the dominant hand grow faster than the non-dominant hand there are also hormonal influences for example women during pregnancy their nails grow a lot faster however after delivery during the process of lactation breastfeeding Nails will grow much slower certain medications that you may be taking also can have an impact on your nail growth oral contraceptive pills for example as well as anti-fungal medicines make the nails grow faster certain underlying medical conditions also influence your nail growth and you can change those or you know maybe you can control them with medications and disease management um for example if you have hyperthyroid that your nails grow faster if you have hypothyroid that nails grow slower check out my video video on how thyroid hormone impacts your nails all sorts of nail findings related to issues with the thyroid if you smoke that circulation delivery of Healthy Growth factors to the nail unit slow down nail growth aside from having realistic expectations and an understanding of the things that influence nail growth my number two tip is to well keep your fingers active minor trauma stimulates nail growth probably because of increased in blood flow what I mean by not minor trauma is not like go whacking your nails against the wall that actually is not a good thing but rather use your fingers as I pointed out you might notice that the nails on your dominant hand grow a lot faster cuz it more active when you type that can stimulate nail growth I used to play the violin I would use my non-dominant hand and I noticed as I was playing the violin that man my nails grew on my left hand for the first time then when I stopped playing the violin they grew a lot slower I mean depending on how motivated you are you may try and do little finger tapping exercises uh because that can improve circulation to the nails and may have an impact overall on improving the rate of nail growth use petroleum jelly around your nails Um this can make a huge difference uh over time I will say cuz again nothing happens overnight one of the most common issues affecting women in terms of their nails is something called brittle nail syndrome and it can be related to a variety of things not only does the nail grow more slowly but the nail plate that we know that you paint that you see with your eyes the nail grows more slowly but it also becomes brittle it splits and the edges Fray peel a lot of you I sure have experienced this one thing that can make a difference is keeping the nails moisturized with petroleum jelly one of the advantages of petroleum jelly is that it does a really good job acting almost as Second Skin creating a barrier now remember back to that image of where the German of Matrix is located it can contribute to brittle nails and the slow nail growth is if your um proximal nail fold the cuticle as well uh becomes dry inflamed irritated impaired impaired barrier function at that location exposes The germinative Matrix cells to moisture microbes and can slow down the rate of nail growth also can lead to things like ridging lines on the nails uh peeling Nails by applying a little petroleum jelly around the cuticles it can make a huge difference it jelly there and go about your life during the day so I suggest at nighttime before you go to bed putting a little petroleum jelly around the fingernails that way you know as you sleep it a problem for you you needing to use your hands as much so you can tolerate it ideally even you would put some gloves on over to really lock everything in place uh but not everyone tolerates sleeping in gloves all right moving on to my other tip do not trim your cuticles or push them back because it really impairs that barrier that is protect protecting those germa of Matrix cells recently I saw this hype around this Russian manicure where they aggressively trim back the cuticle uh be aware of that Trend because it can slow down the rate of nail growth and also of course put you at risk for nail infections not only is that little barrier important for protecting the German Matrix cells so they can divide rapidly grow out your nail but also protects them from an infection um and infections around the nails are are an issue um all right so don your cuticles don because when you do that you basically saying uh let challenge The Matrix cells and and and annoy them remember the germa of Matrix cells are rapidly dividing cells they have a high metabolic demand they have high energy needs so the way that you can influence that is by having a well-balanced healthy diet uh nothing slows nail growth down like a crash diet a poor diet deficient in micronutrients minerals I advocate a holistic approach to eating where you have a balanced diet but protein is important for healthy nail growth so make sure you are getting a good uh intake of protein especially as you get into your older years it thought that older adults may need a little bit more protein uh especially as it relates to muscle uh which can dwindle with age become harder to maintain so good protein intake becomes even more important all right so make sure you next tip is for a subset of you who struggle with nail biting nail biting is not going to help with growing long strong healthy nails uh nail biting is not something that you can necessarily control I have a recent video all about how to stop biting your nails I give some practical tips that you can Implement to break the cycle of nail biting nail biting not only slows down the rate of nail growth but it puts your uh puts you at risk for infections around the nail and also can damage your teeth in the description box I to link one of my favorite nail lockers that take taste foul that can act as a deterrent but do check out that video because I give a more holistic comprehensive approach to quitting nail biting the next tip is going to blow your mind okay it mind you guys know on this channel I have several videos about hair loss and what I often recommend for people dealing with androgenetic alopecia pattern hair loss is an overthe FDA approved medication for that called minoxidil sold under the brand name Rogan 5% did you know that applying minoxidil to your nails twice a day can actually help with nail growth it the most robust research backed recommendation but there are trials demonstrating efficacy of topical minoxidil to the nails for healthy nail growth um for example is something that can be used alongside treatments to treat a a nail fungus and because it helps increase the rate of nail growth well it helps increase the clearance of fungus out of the nail in conjunction with antifungal treatments which also increase the rate of nail growth I don recommend taking an antifungal for the purposes of nail growth but applying minoxidil is safe and it that is accessible you can buy it over the counter without a prescription you don around the nail to The Nail plate maybe underneath the nail twice a day with a little cotton tip applicator a little bit goes along way and with time you can see an improvement in nail growth why would minoxidil grow the nail well it thought to improve blood flow to the nail bed that it by improving perhaps blood flow to the follicle um so yeah definitely a safe and potentially effective thing to do again if these other things I recommended are not also teed up it may not work out in total for you now I already talked about the importance of a balanced diet good nutrition but I will inevitably get questions what supplements do I recommend I don necessarily recommend taking any supplements unless you have some sort of confirmed deficiency in your diet however there are dietary supplements out there that have been examined for their efficacy see in nails and I have a whole video reviewing these supplements which is going to be on the end slate so check that video out next if you are interested in supplements for nail growth but that video on my best tips and tricks for growing out your nails long strong and healthy I really hope you enjoyed it if so give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow bye [Music]	Success
How To Stop Biting Your Nails For Good | Dermatologist Tips	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCEECxh76Fg	Dr Day	how to stop biting those Nails whether you a child who bites their nails this is the video for you I you practical tips to stop biting your nails the medical term for nail biting is Ono phasia nail biting is a chronic and repetitive habit can be compulsive in nature just like other repetitive compulsions like skin picking disorder or pulling one triggered by stress and it may be associated with an underlying anxiety disorder about 20 to 30% of the population is a nailbiter it more common in young children but they frequently outgrow it however it definitely does persist into young adulthood older adulthood for certain everyone experiences their nail biting differently some people are conscious of the fact that they bite their nails they know they people it compulsion they don connection that they not aware of it it also can be to some extent possibly related to genetics for example if your parents are nail biters it bite your nails if you are an identical twin it will bite your nails versus if you are nonidentical twins because nail biting can be experienced differently from everyone the approach to managing it is going to be quite different some people the tips I video may be the solution that you need they may be just enough just a few behavioral modifications and you on your way to never biting your nails again whereas for other people they going to require more intensive of an approach maybe a multi-disciplinary approach involving multiple different types of Health Care Providers like a psychologist it focused repetitive Behavior now another body focus repetitive behavior is skin picking disorder if you suffer from that you out my video on skin pcking disorder I give lots of tips and tricks in that video as to how to stop nail biting is very similar they cousins and in terms of a maladaptive Behavior often triggered by stress a lot of patients who have a nail biting disorder they do have other comorbid mental health problems about 25% will have anxiety and or obsessive compulsive disorder risk factors for nail biting I already talked about family history if your parent both parents bite their nails you be genetic or it could just be that you see your parents doing it you start doing it for young children there association with prolonged bottle feeding or letting the child use a pacifier for much too long if it goes on too long it kind of becomes this self soothing Behavior kind of can lead to thumb sucking and then nail biting is sort of like an extension of that why should you try to stop biting your nails first of all it really can cause a lot of distortion of your nails nails are not just an aesthetic thing they are functional they help us with touching things picking things up biting one Nails can really disrupt the nail growth can lead to distorted nails and it can shorten the nails so can damage your nails but probably the the most pressing issue what we see a lot in dermatology as it relates to nail biting is infections so you can get infections in the skin around the nail it perania can be a bacterial infection very painful you also can get a variety of different viral infections there uh for example not uncommon for nail biters to get a lot of warts around their nails but also you know you the fact that you are putting it in your mouth we often see warts around the mouth in nail biters get that wart virus gets transferred from the fingers to the mouth also if you weren simplex virus is everywhere we all have it in us and um for a lot of people they have it wake up randomly in their body they shed it maybe they don realize it shedding it in their saliva put their finger in their mouth bite introduce that virus around the nails you get this very painful herpes infection of your finger it mouth of nail biters is a lot more prone to infection they even have a different constitution of bacteria in the mouth they have a higher bacterial load specifically of a type of bacteria called inob bacteria ACA they often have poor dental hygiene as a result of nail biting and it can lead to inflamed gums gingivitis also more frequent uh Dental problem putting your hand in your mouth all the time you sick and that biting pressure can really damage your teeth it can lead to chip teeth notches in the teeth that biting pressure can also lead to small fractures of your incizors it can also just really mess up not only your teeth but your bite it can cause ma um Mal it tip when it comes to at least helping someone break the Habit is to not shame or punish if you have a child who bites their nails do not punish them for doing this we know that that does not not only does that not help but it tends to make it much worse go-to recommendation I often suggest depending on the severity is aversive therapy basically you can buy a nail laquer to paint on the nails that tastes really horrible so when the child puts their fingers in the mouth or you put your fingers in your mouth to bite your nails tastes terrible uh that kind of you know can clue you into the fact that you helps to break the cycle now some people who have um Ser serious more serious mental health issues around nail biting maybe have obsessive compulsive disorder um that may not necessarily be the most helpful thing aversive therapy can be kind of part of a three-part strategy um to increase awareness and stop the behavior and part of that strategy is first to kind of remove some of the triggering factors the main way to do that with the nails is to keep the nails cut short like I mean I think we can all empathize at least to some extent with nail biters because because if you ever broken a nail and it Jagged it okay I don if i nail and it it desperate and you just want to bite it for someone who is already biting their nails a lot though they have you know a lot of these kind of uneven parts to the nail already broken and that serves further to fuel the behavior of wanting to bite the nails so keeping them cut short is is key for some people having their nails a little bit long and keeping them manicured that actually is an incentive to not bite the nails if you are that person uh but you end up somewhere and you break a nail and it kind of triggers you to want to bite try making sure that you keep with you nail clippers so that in the event that that happens you could just go ahead and clip the nail smooth and short the other part of the behavioral intervention is to make it more difficult to bite your nails by covering them with a bandage um and another thing that can help a lot of kids is just get some gloves put socks on the hands like when they sleep because some kids might do this in their sleep or you might do that in in your sleep as a side note you can get these cotton gloves and um you know I recommend this anyway for like dry hands but it plain petroleum jelly on your hands and cover them with gloves but if you someone who deals with nail biting this is also a helpful thing to do because of a few reasons first of all um you have the gloves on there that kind of serve to remove the nails from access you know kind of like when we talk about with skin piging disorder I tell you guys about the pimple patches to act as a barrier from your fingers this is kind of the same exact principle but the other reason it plain petroleum jelly under occlusion of that glove it actually can help quite a bit with any roughness of the cuticles it can help cut down on hang nails which themselves are also a trigger for nail biting then of course the third aspect is to remove the positive reinforcement that people get um subconsciously with nail biting and that comes in the form of the aversion therapy by painting the nails with that foul tasting stuff there Target it also sell it on Amazon it polish company but they specifically make a nail lacquer that tastes foul it and that lines though for a lot of really young children like if you don they stuff and it for them to have that on there another thing that helpful for young kids is to just put olive oil on their nails something about the olive oil just makes the nails feel smoother um and it kind of cuts down on that urge to bite any roughness the other thing that really can make a huge difference no matter where you your nail biting journey is nail hygiene first of all it makes a huge difference if you are biting your nails to at least keep them clean because um you know if they well that just you know increases more risk so washing your hands regularly washing around your nails keeping your nails cut short it can definitely make a difference because less territory for you to bite and then from a hygiene perspective less territory for stuff to stick onto the nails and for you then to introduce close to your mouth cause infections problems and the like but that being said um there other side of the coin where for some people having their nails manicured regularly really can serve as a huge motivating factor to not bite their nails like a lot of parents of uh teens tween who are nail biters if you acques to letting your child get U professional manicures uh that actually can serve as a motivator for them to not buy their nails I mean we all know that getting your nails done it expensive looks great um last thing you want to do is get your nails done and then bite the nails and ruin your manicure so it can serve is a motivating factor but it is you know obviously an expensive thing to keep up with but some people are going to need therapy to stop biting their nails and there are different types of approaches to therapy now I psychiatrist but I do have a familiarity with just the basic tenants of how these different styles of therapy work cognitive behavioral therapy is based on both the behavior and a cognitive model essentially with cognitive behavioral therapy it really works to address the maladaptive behavior and this is something that I brought up in my video on skin picking disorder as you know a psychologic approach a therapeutic approach to Breaking the Habit some people really benefit from a type of therapeutic intervention called a functional analysis therapy because basically for some people they to be triggered to bite their nails in certain environments or under certain circumstances so this therapy involves being observed in different situations or different circumstances to kind of find out what scenarios are associated with increase and nail biting for you and then that way individualized recommendations can be made based on those observations of what situations are triggering you the aim of functional analysis therapy is to reduce the behavior to a point where it finally just goes away habit reversal therapy this is something I talked about in my video on skin picking disorder as a Soo maybe you do both maybe you bite your nails and you pick your skin not uncommon you pretty common out there um so habit reversal training is another approach to therapy that basically helps you to form an awareness around the habit and um identify alternatives to The Habit so instead of you know figure out what it is that triggers you to bite your nails circumstances situations feelings and once you have an awareness of that trigger but instead of biting you are taught to start training yourself to do something that is more helpful less harmful to you so for example instead of biting your nails keep some gum with you like for example if you know every Tuesday I have a meeting with my boss and I start biting my nails around that you know an hour before that meeting having gun with you and say okay I going to start chewing this gum right now it really can help serve to break that cycle and then another part of the Habit reversal training really is also enrolling a social support system so again this is where you know if you have a child with this your your reactions and your responses are key you want to be as supportive as possible you don want to make this punitive punishing the child or you know putting the child down scolding the child not helpful likewise if you are in a relationship with someone who does this you don make comments like oh that why do you do that some people are going to need um medications pharmacotherapy um you know especially people who have a lot of you know more of the obsessive compulsive type disorders or co-orbit anxiety um medications may be indicated um ssris flu oxine um anti-depressant can help quite a bit for some people cut down on that compulsive Behavior let me know if you have ever heard of the dietary supplement and acetal cysteine I was getting a lot of attention anical cysteine it is a um dietary supplement that um works by modulating something called glutamate for whatever reason anical cinee really seems to help patients a lot with these body focused repetitive disorders like nail biting hair pulling trilam Mania um pulling out your eyelashes or your eyebrows or skin picking 800 milligrams of of this taken a day for a month can reduce nail biting so it track record of being effective for for this again may not be necessary like I said some of the tweaks we already talked about the gum chewing thing the awareness that might you know get you where you need to be for kids a reward system can be really beneficial um if you this you know you could think about setting up um a sticker reward system where basically every day they go without biting their nails they get a little sticker and then you know maybe you say if you get a sticker every day for two weeks you know you can pick a prize that type of reward system tends to actually work really well for kids I disorders too of like trying to keep a little Journal doesn fancy diary or anything just a little notebook where you write down every time that you realize that you nails and you know the circumstances so you can identify triggers and then you can start replacing those triggers with you know less harmful things um like squeezing a little stress ball or doing a craft a hobby getting up going outside for a walk um to calm down try and have a plan in place that mindfulness around the behavior it patients to take back control a you learn what it is that sets you off so you have a better understanding of yourself and then B you take charge of the behavior and you redirect it as far as kids go you know they growing and developing and so that might be you know they may not have the ability to really think that way yet but there is a book it when bad habits take hold by um Dr Huer a psychologist it great for kids like in elementary school age and it gives very practical helpful tips on how to stop doing things like nail biting or hair pulling it really useful tool for children so I going to link that down below in the description box along with the Ella and Mia nail lacquer so those are the tips I really hope this video was helpful to you guys who struggle with this I know it can be socially isolating um and like I

TOP 5 SUPPLEMENTS FOR NAILS ?? Dermatologist @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dLCyXHTHKQ	Dr Day	well hey guys for today going to be covering the top five supplements for your nails what are the best supplements to help strengthen the nails to help them grow better if you are somebody who the appearance of your nails you find that they are not growing at the rate that they once did they lot you watching this video because I be giving you some high-yield information about dietary supplements that are heavily marketed to people just like yourself nail growth is influenced by a lot of different factors genetics of course we can always blame everything on our genetics hormones especially your thyroid pregnancy certain medications you might be taking if you have an underlying skin condition it actually can especially true for psoriasis can leave the nails prone to breakage and affect their rate of growth now it should go without saying that nutrition is vital for growing strong healthy nails what you put in your body is going to show up in how your skin your hair and your nails look and feel and function dietary factors that are important for growing your nails include high quality protein and a variety of vitamins and minerals about 20 of the population suffers from brittle nail syndrome this is characterized by peeling nails and cracks at the end of the nail and it more than just a cosmetic thing it leads to symptoms of sensitivity of the fingertips and and actually can get in the way of how well you were able to achieve your activities of daily living just picking things up can be challenging when you have brutal nail syndrome it faulty adhesion between the cells of the nail the corneocytes those are the ones that are making the Keratin and when they don can get peeling and brittleness under normal conditions your nail should grow roughly two to three millimeters a month it nine months for your nail to grow out in its entirety but for some people they experience a slowing of that growth rate so I suggest if you are dealing with brittle nails for the first time you not happy with the rate of nail growth something has changed something is different definitely see your health care provider rule out some other underlying medical issue before just jumping to a supplement because there may even be something like a thyroid problem that needs to be addressed as a side note I have a video All About the Nail signs of thyroid disease so check that one now what are the supplements worth paying attention to or considering what are the ones where there research we have to talk about biotin biotin is involved in the metabolism of fatty acids amino acids glucose biotin is naturally found in egg yolks milk grains and nuts and The Institute of medicine recommends that you get 30 micrograms per day of biotin biotin deficiency is very very rare so the rationale behind the discovery of Biotin for nails actually started in research on pigs and horses like human fingernails hooves are made of keratin It nails and a study showed that in pigs with biotin deficiency when their feed was supplemented with biotin they had much improvement in the strength of their Hooves other Studies have shown an improvement in hoof growth rate and strength in both pigs and horses fed foods supplemented with biotin biotin is important for the production of keratin in the nail and it also holds together the cells of the nail giving strength and tension to The Nail itself now the first human study of Biotin for nails was done in 1989 they took 75 humans with brittle nail syndrome and gave them two and a half milligrams of biotin a day now of those 75 only 45 actually returned for follow-up and of those 45 who returned 41 of them reported definitive Improvement in nail firmness and nail hardness they didn really Define what they meant by definitive Improvement a placebo-controlled trial looking at a multivitamin with 45 micrograms of biotin showed that the individuals getting the multivitamin at the end of the 90 days of the study they had a greater nail growth rate in comparison to the placebo group however the multivitamin didn just have the 45 micrograms of biotin it had copper zinc magnesium so it to say it was adjust the biotin or was a combination of these things things a third study of 35 subjects with brittle nail syndrome 22 of them showed an improvement in symptoms of brittle nails so all in all we have three studies looking at biotin only one of which was Placebo controlled uh and that one there were a lot of other things going on in the multivitamin so suffice it to say while biotin appears to be promising for brutal Nails we really need more research to actually say that it anything of course that does not stop the supplement industry from making biotin supplements for Hair Skin and Nails despite such weak evidence so what is it safe to take biotin by and large biotin is safe to consume side effects include some upset in the stomach for some people some people find that it aggravates acne importantly high-dose biotin supplements can interfere with the accuracy of certain blood tests that your doctor might order such as your thyroid test or your vitamin D levels so it Biotin supplement that a you tell your how healthcare provider and B you need to stop taking the Biotin supplement a week before any expected anticipated blood work number two is collagen peptides collagen is a protein in our body that is essential for the supportive framework of our skin with age we lose collagen it in a variety of other tissues now recently I did a video All About collagen peptides for your skin do they actually work they do actually have some evidence albeit weak to demonstrate their efficacy for improving skin moisture elasticity smoothing out wrinkles but there that taking collagen peptides might actually help with nail growth an open label single Center trial 25 women took porcine AKA Pig type 1 collagen peptides for 24 weeks they took two and a half grams daily at the time of evaluation only 24 of the 25 women were available now all growth rate per month was measured from Baseline the nail growth rate increased each month 16 of the 25 had nail peeling that was moderate to severe at the start of the study and then as the study went along and they were taking the collagen peptides well that improved quite a bit at 12 weeks only eight of the participants had nail peeling that was moderate or severe and by 24 weeks only six of the 24 women had nail peeling that was moderate or severe so they also just looked at uh Improvement in the appearance of the nail they had kind of a grading scale they looked at photos 64 percent Global clinical Improvement after 24 weeks of collagen peptides and then that Improvement was sustained four weeks after stopping the collagen peptides in 88 percent now you always have to question what sort of outside factors were going on here and to influence the results they there suffice it to say this small research study begs the question well can collagen peptides help with brutal nail syndrome more research is needed what are the side effects of taking collagen peptides overall they tolerated you can have some gastrointestinal upset of course if you are allergic to fish pork beef you need to be careful because collagen peptides are animal derived and then peptides may be derived from one of these some people have headaches heartburn bloating but overall they are pretty well tolerated and there safety and efficacy of collagen peptides in breastfeeding or pregnancy number three solubilized keratin what the heck keratin is a protein that makes up our hair our skin and our nails what gives the nails strength is there any research for keratin for your nails not a ton but there is a small randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial looking at taking 500 milligrams of solubilized keratin a day plus B3 B5 B6 B8 zinc and copper versus placebo which was just a capsule containing maltodextrin uh and they took the either of these for 90 days and the researchers showed that there was an improvement in the tendency of the nails to break at 90 days in the group getting the solubilized Keratin plus B3 B5 B6 B8 zinc and copper versus the placebo there was also an improvement in nail strength in the study versus placebo importantly there were no Adverse Events so persuasive but not enough I mean the group getting the Keratin was also getting some other other things supplemented to them so it Keratin doing anything number four is choline stabilized orthostic acid this most popularly is sold under the brand name biocil now silicon is important for cross-linking of collagen choline stabilized Ortho salicylicic acid is a bioavailable form of silicon and of course choline is an essential nutrient in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial where participants got 10 milligrams of choline stabilized Ortho salicylicic acid a day for 20 weeks or the other group got just a placebo pill at the end of the 20 weeks the group getting the choline stabilized orthos salicylicic acid had a statistically significant Improvement in hair brittleness and nail brittleness compared to Placebo no Adverse Events were reported with a supplement it seems to be very well tolerated but more research is needed to know if it to take if it it methyl sulfonyl methane otherwise known as MSM now I have an older video where I go into detail about MSM as a supplement for your skin so check that one out I go into the research on its efficacy for a variety of skin concerns in that video what the heck is MSM it is a naturally occurring sulfur compound it present in our environment it plants and it so it diet now MSM is anti-inflammatory and it that taking MSM results in an increase in antioxidants in the body and these are important for handling free radicals that damage the proteins and lipids in our body and contribute to premature aging and damage furthermore it and MSM helps to stabilize the these disulfide bonds between the keratins in the nail and the hair and contribute to nail strength and reduce nail brittleness so there is one study looking at MSM for nails I took 63 women and they gave them either one gram a day of MSM or three grams of debt a day of MSM it weeks at the end of the study there was a statistically significant Improvement in the appearance of the nails as well as the appearance of the hair the participants agreed that their nails and their hair looked better taking the supplement now both doses showed Improvement like these other supplements MSM by and large appears to be safe and doses Max 4 grams per day but again in the study they three it doesn adverse side effects but again we just don are the top five most research-backed supplements for strong healthy nails now do I recommend any of these no I think more research is needed before knowing what the best supplement is who is going to respond supplements unlike medications they FDA so they can make a lot more claims and importantly they don demonstrate proof of safety or efficacy whereas a medication does so it for supplements to make their way in front of consumers without going through as much rigorous safety testing importantly you may have an underlying medical condition that is contributing to the brutalness of your nails that can be corrected by addressing the medical problem rather than pursuing a supplement supplements may seem safe but again they regulated and supplements don necessarily have to demonstrate the level of safety and efficacy that a medication would and not all supplements are without harm as we have come to learn you know the example I gave you with biotin interfering with blood work these five that I and large though they do appear to be safe I really hope you guys found this video useful in navigating the supplement aisle to know what supplement ingredients actually do have some research to back their efficacy for nails again it is pretty limited now on the end slate I video All About collagen peptides since that came up in today that one out next if you missed it but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe I bye [Music] thank you	Success
What Your Nails Say About Your Thyroid	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_unnFrtBnfg	Dr Day	take a look at your nails because did you know that they can show signs of a problem with your thyroid gland that right and in this video we be going over the nail findings of thyroid disease but before we get into it make sure you give this video a thumbs up if you like getting your skincare content from a board-certified dermatologist be sure and subscribe turn the Bell notifications on that way you know as soon as my videos go live give me a follow over on Instagram and Tik Tok because I skincare content on those platforms as well nail bindings can be a really helpful early clue to an underlying problem with the thyroid gland what the heck is thyroid hormone anyway you have probably heard people talk about thyroid maybe you even know somebody who has a problem with their thyroid whether it be hyperthyroidism or hypothyroid they probably have to take medication maybe they have to see their doctor pretty regularly for checkups to make sure the thyroid hormone is on track but what exactly is thyroid hormone it is a hormone that helps control our metabolism it for a variety of other bodily functions and it in babies thyroid hormone is made in the thyroid gland a small gland that sits in the front of your neck thyroid hormone which is an umbrella term for thyroxin or T4 and triiodo thyronine T3 T3 is the active form of thyroid hormone T4 is inactive but T4 can be converted to T3 the active form of thyroid your thyroid gland also makes calcitonin another hormone that controlling the levels of calcium in your blood thyroid disease is actually really common you can have too much thyroid hormone or you can have too little thyroid hormone too much thyroid hormone is called hyperthyroidism the most common reason for that is something called Graves disease too little thyroid or hypothyroidism can be due to iodine deficiency or more commonly an autoimmune disease called Hashimoto thyroid hyper thyroidism typically presents with an increase in the heart rate you very sweaty feel jittery and maybe be losing weight and the skin feels warm and damp hypothyroidism on the other hand or low thyroid hormone kind of presents the opposite decrease in heart rate you feel sluggish lethargic maybe experience weight gain the skin actually feels cold and it cold because your metabolism is slowed down but before these signs appear you actually can have nail findings first as an early clue one of the most common nail findings associated with thyroid disease is something called coo nikkia or spoon Nails spoon Nails Nikia Coos is Greek for spoon the reason they actually look like a spoon this is a type of nail distrophy in which the nail plate is depressed centrally and elevated laterally so it literally looks like a little spoon and one way to assess for this is to look at the nail and take a little drop of water and place it on the nail plate if you have spoon nails that droplet of water will actually stay on the nail plate whereas if you don just like a little cup now kilon Nikia or spoon Nails is certainly not specific for a problem with your thyroid it can be seen in a variety of other issues like iron deficiency anemia psoriasis alopecia Arata diabetes it can be present as a result of trauma to the nails whether that be from aggressive manicuring or maybe something related to your occupation it finding actually in young babies so if you have this don you have a problem with your thyroid but definitely bring it to the attention of your medical provider for evaluation it certainly could be an early sign of low thyroid or high thyroid because it can be seen in both but more commonly it is seen in hyperthyroidism meaning elevated thyroid hormone another really common nail finding associated with thyroid disease is basically very brittle nails 22% of cases of brittle nails associated with thyroid disease were seen in people with autoimmune thyroid problems whereas 19.6% were seen in those with non-autoimmune thyroid disease of these cases roughly 14% were seen with hypothyroid or low thyroid that makes sense remember with low thyroid things are kind of dry slow probably have poor blood flow to the nails as a result of trying to keep the body warm Vaso constriction peripherally it have decreased blood flow to the fingertips that your hands and feet often feel cold along with the brittle nails the nail plate can be much thinner you can have little white spots that nikkia and the nail plate can actually lift off that of anlysis this is another really common finding across the board in people who have thyroid disease anlysis refers to a separation of the nail plate from the underlying structures and as it lifts up air gets underneath the nail plate looks like a big white smear a big white spot most often it the tip of the nail but it can expand to move down to close to close to the uh half Moons it looks white but it basically air as that nail plate is lifting off on a colesis like Kon nikkia certainly is not at all specific for thyroid disease it can be seen in a lot of other things uh traumatic manicuring practices it can be seen in pregnancy again with psoriasis people who have hyperhydrosis or excessive sweating can also deal with anlysis now I mentioned however that people who have hyperthyroidism they often deal with excessive sweating so perhaps the anlysis that they deal with as a nail finding may actually reflect to a certain extent the excessive sweating that they may be experiencing due to elevations in thyroid hormone but again it dealing with this definitely bring it to the attention of your healthc care provider they can assess you and your symptoms and determine if it to check blood work to see if you have a problem with the thyroid so I mentioned at the beginning of the video you have hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism low thyroid and high thyroid what nail findings are more common with each of these types with hypothyroidism or low thyroid again that kind of sluggish you may experience weight gain uh dry cold skin the most common nail finding in hypothyroidism is actually fragile nails and that makes sense again because the blood vessels are probably clamping down in an effort to preserve core body temperature you not getting good circulation to the nails so it healthy strong nails so uh fragility of the nail plate is probably the most common finding in hypothyroidism reported in 70% of cases along with that is slow growth now normally the nails grow roughly 3 and 1/2 mm a month which is the equivalent of about a tenth of a millimeter a day but in hypothyroidism it that your nails are really brittle growing very slowly that may be a clue that your thyroid hormone is low and along with that the nail plate itself is thin that is another very common finding in hypothyroidism so you slow growing thin nails and then the fourth most common finding in hypothyroidism for the nails is going to be that on aysus the nail plate actually physically lifting up off of the underlying structures air getting underneath and you get that big white spot less commonly in hypothyroidism you can have something called Luca Nikia which means white spots on the nails the white spots can either be little white dots or lines it lucania is certainly not specific ific for thyroid problems you can have lucania as a result of traumatic nail practices like uh pulling off your nail polish that actually can cause a lucania pushing your cuticles back aggressively can cause lucania less commonly in hypothyroidism you also can have striped nails or nail pitting nail pitting is exactly what it sounds like little tiny Pits on the nail plate this again not specific to thyroid disease you can see it in alopecia area which is an autoimmune disease where you have patches of hair loss but you also can have nail pitting and alopecia Arata you can have it in eczema and you can have it in psoriasis so again it specific but if you nail changes again bring it to the attention of your healthc care provider what are the most common nail findings of hyper thyroidism again that your thyroid hormone is High um maybe from graves disease and the most common nail finding with hyperthyroidism is actually konia the spoon Nails Now spoon nails again not specific for hyperthyroidism and it actually can also occur in hypothyroidism but more commonly it hyperthyroidism again that put a little droplet of water on the nail plate and it stays just in place it doesn got a depression in the middle of the nail plate and the edges are elevated laterally the second most common finding in hyperthyroidism is actually softening of the nail plate kind of crumbly Nails in hyperthyroidism nail growth is usually normal or increased anlysis is actually the third most common nail finding in hyperthyroidism while anlysis is more common in hypothyroidism it certainly can happen in hyper thyroidism possibly because you do have maybe in some cases an increase rate of nail growth and the nails are a lot softer so they off the underlying supportive structures and the nails can be very brittle now a uncommon finding in hyperthyroidism it actually OCC in about 1% of patients with Graves disease is something called clubbing in which the fingers actually look like they are clubbed out the reason this happens is that patients who have Graves disease which is an autoimmune disease they make antibody anti-thyroid antibodies and those antibodies actually combined to um keratinocytes endothelial cells fat cells cause them to make more hyaluronic acid and other glycosamino glycans and that leads to swelling of the tissues around the nail and what appears as clubbing this is not very common and certainly wouldn of hyperthyroidism but it does happen in about 1% of patients who have Graves disease patients with hyperthyroidism also can have thinning of the nails and very uncommonly they can also have lucania what is the mechanism behind some of these nail findings in the case of spoon nails with hyperthyroidism especially it some kind of pro prot or amino acid imbalance in hyperthyroidism you have an increase in metabolism so it that you levels of uh amino acids and proteins to support proper nail growth and that why in that situation you to spoon Nails a nail distrophy patients who have hyperthyroidism because of their increase in metabolism they some cases have a decrease in the protein albumin and that may also be a marker here an indicator of a problem with making healthy nail growth in hypothyroidism however you have uh basically a decrease in body temperature secondary to the decrease in basil metabolic rate that happens from having inadequate thyroid levels and with this your body body temperature and it does that by decreasing blood flow to the extremities that is why patients who have low thyro IID they often complain of cold clammy extremities their hands and feet are always feeling cold it body is trying to maintain core body temperature so it clamps down on the blood vessels that go out to the extremities in an effort to redirect blood centrally to keep you warm as it does that as you can imagine with decreased blood flow to the extremities you delivery of nutrients and oxygen necessary to support healthy nail growth that hypothyroid ISM have brittle nails and slow nail growth on the flip side with hyper thyroidism because the metabolic rate is increased you feel very warm and flushed you have peripheral vasod dilation the blood vessels open up peripherally in an effort to release some of that heat so in that case you actually perhaps get better blood flow and that is why in some cases patients with hyperthyroidism have faster nail growth and in the case of graves disease again that body makes antibodies antithyroid antibodies and those antibodies can lead to increased production from fiber Bloss and of hyaluronic acid and glycosaminoglycans this may impact the nail plate and it underlying supportive structures and it also in some cases can lead to clubbing or increase in what looks like tissue swelling around the around the fingernails of the distal of the of the fingertips thyroid disease is a serious condition whether it be hyper thyroid or hypothyroid those are the nail findings associated with Hyper and hypothyroidism I wanted to share this video with you all because untreated thyroid disease is deadly starts out with things like feeling lethargic or feeling jittery depending on what the nature of the underlying thyroid problem is but I want to emphasize that the nail findings I video they with the thyroid so if you have these don conclusion that you have a problem with your thyroid there are many other possible reasons to have these nail findings but they are a clue early on that you may have a thyroid problem and therefore it thyroid levels or for your doctor to check them so that is why I this video not to alarm you if you happen to have some white spots on the nail don attention to your nails because they certainly can be a window to what going on internally show these to your doctor and in some cases it may be necessary to check the thyroid hormone untreated thyroid disease can be deadly there are also a variety of skin and hair findings associated with thyroid disease whether it be hyperthyroid and or hypothyroid I recently did a video on the skin signs of low thyroid so definitely check that one out if you missed it I go over hair findings and different skin findings and a few of these nail findings appear in that video as well yeah who knew that little gland sitting in the front of our neck could have so much control over our bodily functions but it really does when it gets messed up it really can cause a lot of problems and lead to a lot of distress and getting it back on track it distressing thing to go through so whether you hypothyroidism or maybe you experiencing a lot of symptoms right now and you don can be very distressing to feel like uh your body is you know kind of out of control and you don things are going to get back on track it so always discuss your symptoms and any skin or nail or hair findings that you have with your doctor anyways guys I going to wrap it up here but on the end slate I skin signs of hypothyroidism so check that one out for sure but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen And subscribe I to you

10 ways to STRENGTHEN BRITTLE NAILS| Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFr7yWSQ9H8	Dr Day	hey guys in today with you 10 tips for brittle nails how to keep your nails looking healthy shiny and strong today athletic greens you guys know i fan of their ultimate daily it is my all-in-one nutritional drink i love it i have it every morning on an empty stomach check the link in my description box because right now i have a special offer for you guys you can get a free gift with your athletic greens purchased so definitely check it out now our hands and nails are constantly exposed to a lot of environmental stressors that suck moisture right out and that can lead to brittle nails as well as nail breakage and ridging my number one tip is to make sure that you moisturize your hands consistently throughout the day as well as your nails this will help keep them hydrated healthy and reduce nail breakage as we wash our hands a lot of moisture gets sucked right out of the nail plate and can lead to dryness and brittleness ideally the moisturizer that you use should have sunscreen in it for daytime use this will protect not only the skin of your hands but also your nails ultraviolet radiation generates free radicals that damage the skin and the skin around our nails leaving them vulnerable make sure you keep your nails cut short shorter nails are less prone to breakage there get caught up on things and tear and peel also the greater the surface area of your nail plate the more exposure it just chemicals that you come in contact throughout the day that can further dry out the nail plate and lead to breakage and brittleness so keep your nails cut short number three make sure that you eat a well-balanced diet and don any up and down crash diets this can really impact the health of your nail plate and set you up for brittle nails vitamin deficiencies mineral deficiencies or insufficiencies can lead to brittle nails also make sure that you your diet that is the building block of nails protein and make sure that you biotin rich foods biotin is another component that in our diet that important for nail health you can get this from things like vegetables eggs so make sure that you well-balanced diet you know unfortunately the perfect diet does not exist i cannot recommend the best diet out there and truthfully we all experience gaps from day to day and getting our daily nutritional needs um you know whether you busy professional on the go and sometimes you don maybe make the best food choices and you really struggle to meet your daily nutritional needs a lot of people fill these gaps in with a multivitamin for me i love athletic greens it is my multi multi-vitamin drink but it more than just that it is an all-in-one a total nutritional insurance i call it my nutritional insurance not only does it have high quality of vitamins and minerals it also has prebiotics probiotics adaptogens and a ton of other things that support really four pillars of health gut health immunity energy and recovery i started consuming athletic greens and oh my gosh january february of 2020. i can believe it and i look forward to it every morning for me i consistently swallowing a vitamin pill i forget they don when i finish the bottle i you know i forget to repurchase them what i love about athletic greens is that not only is it a

really quickly in water i over the years and a lot of them are really bitter and taste foul but they really nailed it with the formulation on this unfortunately not all vitamins are created equal and what i love about athletic greens is not only are they laser focused on ingredient quality they make sure that the ingredients are actually bioavailable their whole foods sourced and readily absorbable they really go the extra mile to ensure that athletic greens is nsf certified for sport so you know that it it quality by a an additional party and so that my faith and trust in athletic greens as far as my multivitamin needs but again it more than just that you and it tastes great it otherwise i wouldn that means it dairy if you gluten free it and i also love it because it has less than one gram of sugar per serving there are no added artificial sweeteners if that stomach there are no artificial sweeteners there are no dyes you know nothing nothing in this besides what you need but it they managed to make it taste great without subtle vanilla flavor athletic greens is perfect if you are like i said a busy professional on the go and you know you forget to eat sometimes you don the healthiest choices and you want to make sure that you don it athlete just kind of looking to square away your nutritional needs and it travels a lot although i know we really doing that right now maybe you can impact your gut health so athletic greens can really kind of step in and help you out in those situations and they make these really handy travel packets they throw in your bag your gym bag or whatever and take with you on the go so i love that it tastes great it right to my door i don and get it highly recommend it and again check the link in my description box you guys because i do have a special offer for you right now you can get a free gift with your athletic greens purchase so definitely take advantage of it i highly recommend the product tip number four has to do with filing your nails filing your nails can be your nails friend or foe depending on what you are doing and what you are using you want to choose a soft nail file that has a fine grain if you choose a really thick coarse grained nail file it actually can end up creating little micro i will say tears but yeah kind of micro tears in a sense in the nail plate that make you more likely to develop those pesky hangnails and what nails however is that it creates a smooth surface that makes the nail have just kind of fewer angles to get caught up on things and ultimately lead to nail breakage when you file your nails however make sure that you file in just one direction that you don this back and forth saw motion can actually make your nails more brittle and it can create nail ridging just by that mechanical trauma that gets translated back to back to the cuticle area and the nail matrix so just go in one direction and choose a soft nail file but that actually can help the health of your nail plates down the road just by smoothing out the surface of any of you know little kind of rough edges number five when you manicure your nails or have them manicured do not cut the cuticle the cuticle is that little flop of skin that seals the nail there right where the right where the nail meets meets the skin here and that little flop of skin actually it prevents water and bacteria and germs and things from getting into the part of the nail that actually grows the nail the nail matrix if you cut the cuticle it will no longer lie flat and comes dry and brittle and it just doesn lie down flat or properly and then water can get up into the nail and dehydrate the nail actually because even though it sounds counter-intuitive whenever you have water either on the skin or on the nail it actually can lead to more water loss that ultimately can dry out the nail plus you know your more your nail becomes more vulnerable to bacteria and the nail matrix because you know it exposed isn well and you get ridging and things like that so don it like an orange stick but don again you can accidentally tear the cuticle and that you know it properly and that ultimately will impact the health of your nails and lead to brittle nails number six is another manicure tip try and minimize or avoid acetone nail polish removers acetone is super drying on the nail plate and that will suck water out of the ski out of the nail and lead to brittle nails instead she polish remover acetone and nail polish removers it dries out the nail plate and also causes peeling and that peeling ultimately will impact the health of the nail plate so try and choose acetone free nail polish remover number seven be really mindful of your water how much water you are exposing the nail to of course we have to wash our hands you can your nails wet the water again can evaporate it of the nails and further dry them out so anytime you have to get the nails wet make sure that you apply a moisturizer on afterwards to kind of help reduce that water loss but be very mindful of unnecessary water exposure if you take baths make sure that you hand in the water and keeping it submerged in water that entire time that unnecessary water exposure for your nail so dangle your hand out of the out of the tub for somebody who likes to soak in like a hot tub for example don the pool water uh or you know the hot tub water it will dry out the nail plate so you know keep it out also if you wash dishes by hand make sure you wear gloves i cannot emphasize this enough if you wash dishes by hand or do any kind of wet work as it in the kitchen you know washing things cleaning things or you know anywhere in the home or maybe that outside of the home i don make sure you wear gloves because the prolonged contact with water plus detergent you know in dishwashing liquids and whatnot really is going to dry out your nail plates and lead to brittle nails and of course it wreaks havoc on your hands to wear gloves to minimize exposure to water and those detergents that will help your nail plate quite a bit number eight is to cut back on the acrylic or jail jail gel nail polishes these you know they sound a p appealing and you that in a moment uh they sound appealing because they they make it seem as though the nail you know they strengthen the nail but in reality they actually cause nail peeling so that and ultimately leads to more water loss out of the nail plate and brittle dry nails not to mention in order to remove them you have to often soak your nails in acetone for a long time that further going to dry out the nail plate so i are no never do them but make sure that you know you give yourself a break like take a month off of that off from them so cut back on the gel and acrylic and then um number nine is kind of along those lines if you just paint your nails you don gel or acrylics definitely take a break from the nail polish too that also can affect the hydration levels of your nail

Underrated Benefits Of L-Carnitine	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jR5KVeZukQ	Dr Day	Taking this one supplement every single day is changing people helping them to lose unwanted body fat, to reverse their insulin resistance. It Alzheimer it even can help you outperform in sports, fatigue less, beating your opponent. If that sounds like a lot of hyperbole, well, welcome to the language utilized in supplement advertising and supplement marketing. This one supplement we about in today attention and you guys are asking me, Can it do anything for our skin? Can it help our skin, our bodies, our hair, our nails? called Lcarnitine. It plays a key key key role in vital functions in our body namely at the site of the powerhouse of the cell the mitochondria. Lcarnitine is important for transporting longchain fatty acids into the mitochondria so that they can be properly broken down and utilized for energy for the production of ATP. Lcarnitine is also really important for export of things that could be damaging to the mitochondria. How do we get this wondrous ingredient into our bodies? Your body is equipped with machinery that makes all the Lcarnitine you really need? It takes the amino acids that we get from our diet, lysine and methionine, and it forms Lcarnitine. It muscles, and our liver. While people claim all sorts of things about LC carnitine and health, like I said, for the most part, otherwise healthy people and frankly even most unhealthy people make all of the LC carcine you could ever really need. And in fact, it considered a conditionally essential nutrient. meaning that only under certain circumstances, certain conditions would you ever actively need to be supplementing with it, such as people who have chronic kidney failure and are on dialysis, premature babies, and people who have certain genetic diseases. You also can eat food that contains lcarnitine. So, we get it largely from animal sources, eating meats and things of that sort. There is no recommended daily intake for healthy adults and children because there need to actively seek it out in your diet. Unless of course you are someone who conditionally needs it. Our body is pretty good at extracting it from food should we choose to eat foods that are rich in it. About 63% of the LC carnitine in our diet will be absorbed into the body. Now of course where there is a nutrient there is going to be a supplement. Again, for people who fall under the umbrella of situations where carnitine becomes a conditionally essential nutrient, they need to supplement. And then, of course, for people who are looking to tweak parameters around and think that supplementing with this nutrient might make a difference. True carnitine deficiency can be reversed by supplementation. Anywhere from 20 to 200 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day. Most people in this health and wellness space that are looking at information about carnitine supplementation, they dialysis. They don genetic diseases. But can supplementing with LC carnitine change the game for any health metric? Well, truthfully, there are some clinical studies looking at Lcarnitine supplementation for a variety of health issues such as, like I alluded to hyperbolically in the intro, dementia, Alzheimer osteoarthritis, weight loss, insulin resistance, infertility, peripheral artery disease, and cardiovascular disease. And while a lot of these studies are interesting, they show promise that supplementing with LCarnitine could be helpful in these situations. more research is needed because the studies have a lot of limitations and don the questions. Either they wellpowered, they don enough, it interesting. Maybe this can serve as fuel for a larger study where we ask questions in a more controlled fashion. I about this? What could it possibly ever have to do with the skin? We people interested in it for better sport performance. Well, probably the most compelling reason, although not solid proof that you need it, has to do with people who are prescribed isotininoan. Isotininoan commonly referred to as its branded name Accutane is an oral retinoid used to treat well cystic acne, but we use it off label to treat a variety of other skin diseases. And if you you experienced muscle aches in the beginning. This is a commonly encountered side effect, but sometimes people develop this side effect and it so uncomfortable for them. They need to have their isotininoone dosage modified and you know that can kind of be a pain because having to be on a lower dose may mean that you have to be on the drug for longer than you want. So is there a way to reduce the muscle weakness and not have to tweak around the drug dosage? Well, a study looking at if carnitine could make a difference in that really set out to to see what the effect was because a little bit of a backstory. Some of the working idea as to why isoteninoone does cause muscle aches for some, okay, it may lower temporarily lcarnitine in the muscles. And obviously people who do a lot of sport, they they tend to be the ones who really feel this the most. Although again anyone can have it. So what this study did it was non-randomized and it looked at 230 patients who had been prescribed isotrininoan for cystic acne. It enrolled them in the study on the basis of them having developed myalgia. So of the 230 patients they identified they found 40 who had myalgia. In general, their myalgia had an average onset of 11 to 19 days after starting isotren, which is pretty typical of people who do develop this side effect. Of the 40 participants, half of them were given Lcarnitine and the other half were given a placebo. The Lcarnitine was dosed at 100 mg per kilogram of body weight per day. Within about 5 to 6 days, the group getting the Lcarnitine had resolution of their myalgia and no tweaking of their isotrenone was necessary. As opposed to the placebo group, their symptoms of myalgia did persist. So this is really compelling because like I said, we are interested in ways around this side effect if we can reduce its risk. to the show show that patients who developed myalgia on isotininoan did have a drop in lcarnitine and that was corrected with the supplement. So it interesting study but it more research studies are needed. So depending on your dermatologist and you know you developing this, they might suggest it in order to alleviate it. But don we tend to like to see really good scientific evidence for interventions before just recommending them to people. But you know, wherever there is a nutrient, a supplement, a ingredient, a drug, and we the advantage of our skin, let forget, is that it accessible than say targeting your kidney. You can put a cream on with ingredients and they might work. And in the case of Lcarnitine, do we have any solid evidence that applying it to the skin could be a gamecher for any sort of outcome? We have preclinical studies, meaning cells in a dish that suggests that LC carnitine applied to the skin might help you guys out who deal with oily skin because it may help the oil gland cells, the sebocytes, take up the free fatty acids more efficiently, converting them to ATP. So ultimately that means less sebum production and more energized SIBOtes, if you will. We don applying it topically. It appears to be well tolerated however and you will encounter Lcarnitine in certain skincare products. You might even already be using it and blindly unaware because the skincare market is packed with all sorts of creams, serums, lotions, potions with various anosundry ingredients. Well, that harms to supplementing with LC carnitine? That you want to experiment around with. I do suggest asking your health care provider first and clarifying with them if it safe for you to do so. But what are the downsides of supplementing with Lcarnitine? A lot of people are under the impression that a dietary supplement is going to be safe, all natural, way better than that big pharma mumbo jumbo. Well, I have to tell you, if you supplement with Lcarnitine, especially at doses greater than 3 g per day, you might well start to feel pretty ill. It can make you very nauseous. that can cause you to vomit. Uh, you may have abdominal cramps. Does that sound like fun? It sounds like when you a pharma advertisement and they get to the end and it says side effects may include explosive diarrhea and you like, thing about supplements, remember, they don the big pharma stuff does, but they can have the same side effects. All right? So you might get diarrhea. But importantly, probably the side effect that is most off-putting and one that in my opinion would not be worth any theoretical benefit of just overall health is the fact that well it can make you smell like rotting fish. For me that you maybe you don little fishy. Not everyone develops this side effect. But what happens with the Lcarnitine is that unnecessary amounts of Lcarnitine in the digestive tract appear to be broken down by the bacteria in your gut and that results in the production of something known as TMAO as well as gamma butyricane. The TMAO may contribute to this odor. In fact, there are people who have this rare condition called trimethylaminura and they have a fishy odor. A lot of this has to do with the dose, but something to keep in mind. Now, you may find rumblings on the internet of people claiming, taking this supplement. I stink like rotting fish. I another supplement to address it. see how this is a sort of same song and dance criticism that people have against pharmaceuticals. You also run into with supplements. Okay? You take a supplement, you develop a side effect, so take another supplement to deal with it. In this case, it vitamin B2. There is some evidence that for people with trimethylaminura and who are having that fishy odor that B2 supplementation might help reduce that. The other issue I see um and something to think about is again not all supplements are safe and effective. They can have side effects which we discovered here but you also have to query the theoretical risk wherein you are potentially increasing TMAO. Ultimately, this could put you at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, which presumably if you the space of health and wellness and you optimize longevity, you supplement, you could be actually jeopardizing your health and wellness plans. Hence the supplement circle jerk, I call it. People go looking to have problems that they don reach for supplements as a solution to an issue that doesn they end up developing issues like smelling like rotting fish. So, if that sounds like a no biggie to you and you But be aware that side effects are going to be more likely if you exceed 3 g per day. All right, y with regards to LC carnitine. Let me know in the comments. Is this something you have entertained the idea of taking? Also, if you it, remember, comments are for the most part anonymous, unless you have a photo and your actual name, drop a comment below if you feel so comfortable telling us if you ended up smelling foul. Uh, no judgment. Speaking of smelling foul, check out my video, which I the ends slate on why you stink and what to do about it. I give a lot of practical tips and tricks and highlight certain things you may not be aware of that lead to, well, foul body odor. This being one of them, but there are several others. So, check that one out next if you are curious about body odor. But if you like this one, give it a thumbs up, share it with your friends, and as always, don subscribe. I tomorrow. Bye.

I going to I far as supplements because you can have too much of a good thing selenium is a trace mineral it is found in soil and it gets incorporated into plants that we eat or that other animals eat and they then incorporate it and we eat them and we get selenium what is the deal with this Trace mineral why is it so important it our body because it is part of what are called seleno proteins and many of these proteins are antioxidants have you heard of glutathione peroxidases if you watching a skin care Channel you probably have I glutathione it right and so you need selenium in order to fight off the free radicals the free radicals they to beat down the cell with all of their all of their nastiness um so saleno proteins are a game Cher for our body for helping to put the brakes on unnecessary oxidative stress the damages lipids DNA proteins in different cellular structures gets in the way of things and not only is it a vital antioxidant defense okay it really important for the

unfortunately in most cases it is a pipe dream there are some of these rare situations where if you cusp and you you you you related to something like low selenium that can be corrected right quick that population might bounce back and you can get repigmentation stranger things have been known to happen and it is possible there there skin infections are going to be more of an issue barrier function is not quite right I mean it who is at risk who is at risk that is the important question when you talk about a nutrient deficiency uh mineral deficiency vitamin deficiency you need to figure out who we should be focusing our attention on not everyone in the room in fact I would argue most people watching this video this is not likely an issue okay it probably not you people who are of concern are people who live in areas of the world where the soil is so deficient and they have poor access to food also people who are on what parental nutrition mean they all their food from a tube bypassing the mouth if that tpn as it properly formulated with selenium yeah they eating but when I say the skin is a window to what is going on internally what exactly can go arai when you don have adequate selenium levels the heart is wounded by this you can get a cardio myopathy heart failure it disease do you see this in areas of the world like certain parts of China where the selenium content in the soil is low this is a real problem also uh the selenop proteins game Cher for thyroid function you absolutely absolutely have to have selenium in order to make thyroid hormone things just go south quick okay check out my video on signs of low thyroid thyroid disease is no joke also when the selenium levels are too low your muscular skeletal system gets all messed up you get swollen bones swollen cartilage swollen joints joint deformity it can be debilitating debilitating immobilize you okay also when your selenium is low you can have some mood impacts you might feel depressed you might be increasingly hostile also you have poor memory number one way to terrify a jenzy male just say these two words low testosterone low testosterone when you have low selenium low testosterone okay infertility in men real issue there you definitely can get way too much selenium anything over 400 microgr a day can be quite dangerous and it level if you start taking supplements what happens when your selenium is too high you might wonder well you to be on the toilet okay lots of diarrhea gastrointestinal upset you going to be fatigued while selenium is vital for growing hair too much selenium guess what hair loss it is the Goldie Lock mineral too little hair loss too much hair loss just right the just right for the vast majority of us comes from just eating food okay um so you don want too much hair will fall out also joint pain too little you got deformed joints too much joint pain you going to be super irritable skin findings you skin brittle nails you can get this thick rough warty stuff building up under your nails they can become discolored and you can develop a blistering skin rash I show you a picture of that here because it is very um what YouTube would describe it shocking content to me it not but you know I so we skin rash and you get what I also also your fingernails get all discolored your teeth become modeled and another Telltale sign that your selenium is too high you have garlic breath like you breath is potent pobles this is nothing to take lightly it can progress to Frank neurologic damage the reason I your attention to this is because I noticed this trend where I think these supplement companies they go into Google they go into PubMed and they find out like different nutrients minerals Etc where when low are associated with different types of hair loss and they say oh okay if low causes hair loss then high must be the secret to Long strong healthy hair and they pump a bunch of that mineral nutrient into their supplement selenium like I said anything over 400 microgram a day is getting Into the Danger Zone and I have come across many dietary supplements with 200 microG in a single dose of the supplement and I know what you are team supplement you I take the supplement I up on the dose why should it matter well here just take one dietary supplement they take multiple other dietary supplements which also might contain high low medium amounts of supplemental selenium throw in a few Brazil nuts bam you are in the danger zone you can have acute toxicity but you can also get tox from just chronically overc consuming selenium on like a daily basis recently I did a video calling out the problems with the dietary supplement industry and that they possible side effects toxicities and caution against combining their supplement with other drugs so like I said you might take this you might try a new protein powder that if you don read the label too carefully you don realize they put a multivitamin blend in there that also contains selenium before you know it you day throw in a couple of nuts some a steak at the end of the day boom you are getting into a high level of selenium and it can be dangerous really really dangerous also also there have been cases of selenium toxicity acutely due to very high amounts of selenium and dietary supplements above and beyond what was disclosed on the label this happened in 2008 and it happened again in 2011 essentially outbreaks of hyper selenosis High selenium related to dietary supplements and this is another reason why you have to be careful with dietary supplements they to follow any sort of evidence-based dosing guideline there supplement 200 microgram of selenium there and in the absence of having low selenium there beneficial in any regard they required to adhere to any sort of evidence-based guideline and a lot of times these dietary supplements don have what they claim to have they have higher or lower doses or ingredients that aren nutrifol includes 200 microG of selenium and their hair supplement both their original one and the vegan one have 200 microG of selenium be really careful if you responsible for a case of serious liver failure likely due to a combination of things in the formula and so the 200 microG of selenium in there could also be dangerous for you um anyways guys that important vital but you can have way too much of a good thing and it can be dangerous and things can go south very quickly I hope this video was informative to you on the inside I going to put my video all about the dark side of the dietary supplement industry check that one out next and if you guys enjoyed this one give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don I [Music]	Success
The Dark Side Of The Supplement Industry	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkvwh3dxxUA	Dr Day	new year new you it but before you get too deep in those Wellness goals and those New Year resolutions we really need to talk about the dark side of the dietary supplement industry the dietary supplement industry worldwide is worth over 98 billion dollar within that you have Beauty supplements such as the ever popular hair skin and nail supplements and consumer demand for these has risen drastically nearly doubling in recent years in 2024 alone the beauty supplement industry was worth around $3.6 billion surprise why are people buying these up in droves well we can ignore the strength of a celebrity endorsement or social media as a whole on our purchasing habits but in today video I and reveal to you guys the true dark side of the supplement industry what dietary supplement makers do not want you knowing about people have their individual reasons for pursuing dietary supplements and honestly not all dietary supplements are bad in fact in medicine including in dermatology there are many dietary supplements that actually can be super helpful for specific skin conditions specific disorders specific health issues for example omega-3 fatty acid supplementation can be super helpful for reducing the mucocutaneous side effects of isotretinoin AKA Accutane helping patients tolerate their medicine better with fewer side effects the dietary supplement and acetal cysteine shows a lot of promise for helping patients who struggle with with skin picking disorder tricotilomania which is hair pulling and nail biting these are just a few examples there are many others out there a lot of people turn to dietary supplements because they have a strong mistrust in the medical community as a whole especially anything adjacent to the pharmaceutical industry and I understand people have their reasons for this our medical system here in the US especially is not executed always efficiently or effectively and people have had many bad experiences but by the end of this video hopefully you will come to realize that the dietary supplement industry isn better a safer or a more altruistic industry to turn to in an effort to take control of your health number one thing the dietary supplement industry doesn want you to understand or to accept is that dietary supplements are Pharmaceuticals in effect they act in many cases exactly like pharmaceutical drugs they have a mechanism of action behind them and a biologic consequence a physiologic outcome but the elephant in the room when it comes to the difference between dietary supplements and medications is essentially a huge lack of oversight and Regulation and a super super super low barrier to entry into the market it dietary supplements on the shelves of GNC Target Walmart wherever Amazon and start selling to Consumers without having to demonstrate efficacy safety dosing parameters ERS drug drug interactions there disclose doses there disclose or establish adverse effects importantly with dietary supplements there database look at these bad things that can happen when you take this medication for example when you see one of those annoying drug commercials and at the end of the commercial they go on and on and on about all these possible side effects they go on and on and on because they required to disclose those things to you and the advertisement they to provide that information to you in written form when you get your prescription and the doctor that prescribes it is required to talk to you about possible side effects but the ingredient or ingredients plural in many cases in dietary supplements they also act exactly like Pharmaceuticals in many cases meaning their mechanism of action is pretty much the same however there no requirement to establish effective dosing safety Etc when it comes to Hair Skin and nail vitamins let one of the most common ingredients amongst all of these and that is biotin biotin is a B vitamin it important for healthy hair growth for nail growth however biotin deficiency is very rare it than enough biotin just from eating food you don particularly good or balanced diet to get more than adequate amounts of biotin biotin deficiency is so rare it pretty much only occurs in patients who have rare underlying genetic disorders or in the off chance that you are consuming Mass amounts of raw egg whites because raw egg whites have a protein in them that binds up biotin if you cook the egg whites this isn these circumstances there be taking very high levels of biotin high levels of biotin can cause more harm than good there evidence for biotin supplementation for the treatment of any hair loss disorder especially especially in the absence of a biotin deficiency which again is very rare unfortunately biotin in supplements interferes with the accuracy of lab tests that your doctor might have to order for example it can mess up tests that are ordered to check your thyroid and very scarily it can mess up the accuracy of testing that is ordered to check your heart to make sure you having a heart attack and this is so significant that it patients dying while you can stop taking your Biotin supplement in advance of having planned blood work let no one plans to have a heart attack so you could have a heart attack go to the emergency room and then be unable to figure out if it chest pain related to any of the other possible reasons for chest pain because the blood work that they might check is not coming out properly because of the biotin not only biotin but a lot of these supplements have a very high dose of selenium selenium is very important for hair growth but the dose is important too much selenium can be very very detrimental to your health and ironically it actually leads to hair loss when you get too much selenium it leads to hair loss as well as riddle nails and even loss of the fingernails not to mention neurologic disease gastrointestinal disease and unfortunately when you get toxic levels of selenium from taking supplements taking too much in a supplement it very hard to undo the damage you just kind of have to write it out while it sort of leaves your system after stopping it there will remove it there you are essentially poisoning yourself and can potentially become quite sick from taking high amounts of selenium collagen supplements are really popular I have a lot of videos on my channel talking about the evidence for collagen supplements collagen peptid specifically for hair skin nails however as a reminder because the dietary supplement industry isn necessarily have to do do any rigorous testing to ensure Purity to ensure that the ingredients are not contaminated collagen supplements on the market have actually been found to have high levels of heavy metals such as arsenic cadmium along the lines of not having to demonstrate purity of your ingredients many dietary supplements have been found to be adulterated with actual medications that are not disclosed on the label as well as other ingredients that are not disclosed on the label between 20 7 in 2016 the FDA found many many dietary supplements to be adulterated with medications one thing people don vitamins minerals micronutrients Etc are very important to our overall health you definitely can get too much high doses of micronutrients vitamins minerals Etc can be harmful to your health you can have too much of a good thing an example of that that does pop up in a lot of the beauty supplements is high doe vitamin A vitamin A is a fat soluble vitamin but if you take in too much above what is established to be safe as is often found in these supplements it can have adverse effects on ironically your hair skin and Nails can become dry brittle prone to irritation but vitamin A is stored in the body it it contrast to water soluble vitamins that you vitamins can be stored in the body in the case of vitamin A can lead to liver damage neurologic problems not to mention the risk of adverse fetal outcomes to pregnant women who consume high doses of vitamin A it can interfere with fetal development and cause all sorts of fetal malformations but supplements aren of that sure most dietary supplements say something along the lines of consult with your health care provider if you planning to become pregnant or breastfeeding but they don against established adverse effects on the developing fetus of high doses of these supplements coming back to my point with regards to dietary supplements basically being Pharmaceuticals there is a popular ingredient in a lot of hair loss supplements called salt petto it botanic ingredient and there actually is some evidence that it can be helpful for androgenetic alpia pattern hair loss why might that be well it appears as though salt Palmetto acts as a 5 Alpha reductase inhibitor you guessed it the same exact way way in which finasteride and dutasteride prescription medications work now in contrast to those prescription medications a woman can go and buy sof Palmetto not realizing that if she gets pregnant and is taking a 5 Alpha reductase inhibitor it can impact male genitalia development negatively five Alpha reductase Inhibitors also can cause sexual dysfunction including celf paletto so it in contrast to pharmaceutical 5alpha reductase Inhibitors the drugs we prescribe we know a dose that minimizes the risk of these side effects and as we prescribe we can monitor we can counsel to the patients sayy look out for this and we can adjust Jing accordingly but you as a consumer consuming five Alpha reductase inhibitor AKA saw palmetto who are you going to be telling that who going to be checking for that who going to be monitoring for that is there a dose adjustment that can be made well the dose adjustment would mean switching to a different supplement and you probably not going to make that connection while water soluble vitamins like B vitamins are probably safer than and say a fat soluble vitamin cuz they contrast to stored in the body they are not without harm a lot of people develop acne like breakouts when taking high doses of B vitamins like b6 and b12 which ironically are often found in a lot of skin and Nails vitamins and a lot of dietary supplements can interact with medications that you might be taking or might need to take you may not not take any medications but say you get a urinary tract infection you go to the Urgent Care the emergency room your doctor they give you a prescription for antibiotics some of your dietary supplements might interact with those things some dietary supplements can interact with ssris which might be prescribed to you to treat depression when I say drug drug interaction I talking about the supplement interacts with medication in a way to make it possible that the medication doesn work um works on overdrive and causes serious side effects like drowsiness neurologic problems headaches Etc speaking of fat soluble vitamins a lot of people are motivated to take vitamin E however vitamin E supplementation can increase the risk of bleeding especially if you happen to take medications to thin the blood there have been cases unfortunately a patients taking vitamin E supplements who have bled way too much during surgical procedures while you might be counseled to stop vitamin E supplementation in advance of a planned surgical procedure we don to have surgery sometimes we need surgeries urgently emergently so I given you some examples in this video where problems can arise with taking dietary supplements and I want to re itate not all dietary supplements are necessarily bad or harmful there time and a place for dietary supplements they definitely can be helpful especially if you struggle with absorption from your diet of certain things you have an underlying problem in your gut inflammatory bowel disease probably are going to be advised by your doctor to take certain supplements so they arises when otherwise healthy people feel compelled to take all sorts of dietary supplements not realizing that they that can have real true risks to their overall health they take them thinking that they healthy lifestyle when in reality they can cause such serious effects that they render an otherwise healthy person basically well on the transplant list dietary supplements can cause such harm to the liver that they require you to have a liver transplant there estimated eight-fold increase in dietary supplement induced liver damage requiring patients to need a liver transplant coinciding with the rise in consumer demand purchasing buying using taking of dietary supplements speaking of which let very popular hair supplement a couple of years ago at this point already I did a deep dive on the ingredients behind neutri fall do they work do they hum check that video out if you want to know more about neutri fall but here we are at the start of 2025 and the gastro Urology physician Community is verbalizing concern for neutral there was actually a case report at the end of 20124 of a patient who developed extreme liver damage on neutral and her liver healed went back to normal if you will once she stopped and her doctor pointed out that neutral has multiple ingredients that could be damaging to the liver and maybe one or two of those ingredients and an otherwise healthy person at a small dose would be fine but when you have multiple ingredients multiple hits to the liver and a pretty much otherwise healthy person it tips things over the edge and can cause liver damage so the authors um who took care of this patient and wrote up her case suggested that patients who are taking this dietary supplement should actually undergo monitoring of liver function to make sure that they are not having some kind of adverse event but nutriol isn going to tell you that neutral isn going to say this supplement may cause liver injury they disclose that to you in contrast Tylenol which definitely can damage the liver if taken inappropriately too much Etc go buy Tylenol or generic acetaminophen it going to have a warning it medication nutrifol is going to appear all intents and purposes to be safe to be natural great for hair growth even though the evidence on that as you can check in my video reviewing it is super weak no real established efficacy data from neutri Fall that we could really hang our hat add on and now popping up patients having serious liver damage sometimes compounds in our skincare products and our beauty products that are active ingredients might also act a lot like Pharmaceuticals for example I pointed this out before and have dedicated videos on it while it dietary supplement it out again just to illustrate how this can happen you all have heard of latis it enhancement medication bat Prost a prostag gland and analog used to treat glaucoma and then boom one day they noticed hey these patients are getting long lashes let lash growth treatment for patients who have hypot trioses of the lashes well prostag gland and analoges great they do help with lash growth but they can have adverse effects they can change the color of your eye they can cause a lot of eyelid irritation they can cause excessive hair growth where you don want it around your eye they can cause hyperpigmentation to the skin of the eyelids and one worrisome side effect is they can cause periorbital fat loss leading to a sunken eye but dance on into Sephora even Costco carries lash growth serums that contain prostag gland and analoges not bat Prost not the medication but cosmetic ingredients cosmetic ingredients that are acting exactly like drugs and come with the same side effects but the Cosmetic product just like the dietary supplements not required to tell tell you about that not even required to say this has prostag gland and analog talk to your doctor if you notice X Y and Z happening possible side effects may occur not going to see that same thing with dietary supplements possible side effects of X Y and Z you see that this is what misleads consumers into having a false sense of confidence in dietary supplements that they are going to be a safe natural effective alternative to scary medications with those long lists of side effects it lie of omission again I I don demonize dietary supplements time in a place time in a place but the marketing of dietary supplements has led consumers to kind of believe that otherwise healthy people should be taking supplements all right guys I hope this video was helpful and clarifying we dietary supplements can really well mess you up um if you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow bye [Music]	Success
Colostrum Benefits For Skin	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yyLY2gciMs	Dr Day	why is everyone talking about colostrum and is it good for your skin let discuss what exactly is colostrum well milk is secreted by females of all Maman species with the primary function of providing the nutritional needs of their neonatal Offspring colostrum is actually the first secretion that is produced at the time the baby is born it is produced within the first few days and it in contrast to milk has a lower lactose concentration but a high concentration of a variety of beneficial compounds for the neonatal Offspring these include fat proteins growth factors vitamins minerals something called imunoglobulin which are really important for the baby kindes nucleotides and a variety of hormones colostrum is yellow to reddish in color depending on the animal and in contrast to milk it is slightly more acidic it has a pH of around 6.4 human colostrum produced at the time of birth and given to baby can be incredibly beneficial for baby however what about consuming colostrum from other species as adults is that beneficial or what about putting it on our skin you have to understand that what companies are not telling you about colostrum is that it is is highly variable in terms of the respective constituents it varies a lot um from breed for example not all Bine colostrum is identical and it varies a lot from animal to animal in that it depends a lot on how many times that animal has been pregnant before it also varies a lot on the nutritional status of the animal and there variation between different animals sheep colostrum is much different from goat colostrum from bovine colostrum these are things to keep in mind because it standardized it also depends significantly on when the colostrum was collected colostrum collected within the first 3 days of birth is more nutrient dense and compared comparison to it collected maybe 5 days and this is important because when it comes to colostrum as a dietary supplement or as an ingredient in skincare products it is not standardized in terms of when things are collected or how things are processed and there criteria for what constitutes good quality colostrum collection and dosage one of the reasons why colostrum is so beneficial for example in the case of a newborn baby capf is that it contains a high concentration of imunoglobulin G and immunoglobulins are something that our immune system makes and they little little darts that bind onto foreign substances and help Target them for elimination or attack by our immune system neonates are still developing their immune systems so if they consume colostrum at the time of birth some of these imunoglobulin which are quite enriched in colostrum actually can cross their gut and provide some passive immunity what else is there going on in colostrum that could be beneficial specifically with regards to the skin whether it be ingestion or applying it topically something called lacto Farin now lacto Farin is an ingredient in colostrum that probably has some of the more compelling research to support its interest in skin care um lactoferrin is a protein found not just in milk but in human bodily fluids nasal secretions it binds iron it has antibacterial properties it has antiviral properties it has anti-fungal properties and it an antioxidant if you recall back to my video on how pollution impacts our skin and contributes to the aging process of our skin you products that help to sequester away iron may help offset some of the damaging effects of pollution on our skin so that is a potential benefit of lacto Farin which yes is found in abundance in colostrum a topically applied lacto Farin gel has actually shown promise for having wound healing benefits for people with diabetic ulcers there suggesting that topically applied lacto Fen may be beneficial for people with acne in terms of reducing the number of acne lesions and also may be beneficial for people who have psoriasis in terms of making the uh skin lesions of psoriasis thinner less red and less flaky however these studies with regards to acne wound healing and psoriasis are small limited they have numerous issues in and of themselves some of them do not include controls others are using lacto faren in combination with other things that might explain the benefits observed in the studies as well in other words more research is needed colostrum is rich in vitamins now there are so many skincare products to choose from in this day and age and how many times do I get on here and talk about skincare products and start talking to you guys about the ingredients and no sooner does the video start and I niacinamide right ni camide is a B vitamin it it has a variety of benefits for the skin in terms of improving redness hyperpigmentation it moisture barrier it has anti-aging properties it beneficial for people with acne prone skin it may help uh reduce skin yellowing as it relates to age related changes guess what also has niacinamide colostrum in addition to that it also has ascorbic acid AKA vitamin C which is important for healthy collagen production and research suggests that when formulated correctly in skinc care products ascorbic acid can not only improve collagen production and have a wrinkle smoothing effect but it also can mitigate some of the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation while colostrum does contain ascorbic acid to what extent it remains stable uh enough to actually get into your skin and lead to the same outcomes is questionable it very challenging to formulate ascorbic acid skincare products such that it actually gets into the skin in an effective way so um you know to what extent it applied to the skin is questionable colostrum also contains fat soluble vitamins remember in contrast to milk colostrum is has more fat it denser it also has fat soluble vitamins this is really good for the baby uh vitamin A vitamin D vitamin E and vitamin K now vitamin E um applied to the skin can also help offset some of the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation on the skin I have a whole video on the benefit of vitamin E and skincare products so definitely check that video out can help slow down lipid peroxidation colostrum is also rich in minerals such as zinc and copper which likewise can help offset some of the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation of free radicals from environmental aggressors on the skin and it contains a variety of amino acids which can be hydrating for your skin with it being so rich in fat soluble vitamins other vitamins minerals micronutrients it sounds Probably sounds like consuming it is going to be the end all Beall for healthier radiant skin we just don that colostrum supplements you really have to take with a grain of salt it got a lot of nutrients and vitamins and minerals that are going to be beneficial for human health but um to what extent consuming a Col musroom supplement with these in the absence of a confirmed deficiency is truly beneficial for your skin I really question that there not adequate research but one might imagine that applying it to the skin in a well formulated product could potentially have skin benefits in terms of well moisturizing the skin as well as perhaps offering some vitamins that we know applied topically can be beneficial and some minerals that may have an anti-inflammatory effect probably one of the uh ingredients in colostrum that is most intriguing to people is the fact that it is enriched in growth factors growth factors in colostrum include epidermal growth factor insulinlike growth factor transforming growth factor beta or TGF beta and TGF Alpha growth factor growth factor growth factor sounds exciting sounds like it must be a Wonder to consume to bathe in but I do have to side eye this for a few reasons consuming growth factors uh if they actually remains stable and whatever it is that you are ingesting uh you do have to question the safety uh not all growth factors are necessarily going to be beneficial for you insulin like growth factor for example can have a procancer effect um also when it comes to the skin we know that insulin like growth factor may be responsible for skin t as well as driving skin hyperpigmentation skin thickening and also for uh condition known as acanthosis nigricans but they going to tell you that um on the on the supplement right like they claim growth factors but they going to say well insulin like growth factor reallya don consuming that willy-nilly also has a variety of hormones such as estrogens progesterones thyroid hormone now when you ingest this to what extent those hormones actually make it to your body to have impact on target tissues you do kind of have to question the safety of consuming such a hormone enriched fraction of nonhuman animal secretions defis it to say scientific data regarding the efficacy the safety the utility um of either topically applied colostrum or ingested colostrum really for any health outcome I should say is very sparse there is a patent pending on a horse colostrum for skin care according to the patent they are examining it and claiming it be an effective cosmetic for KP keratosis pyloris for sebc dermatitis for irritation of the skin for skin burns um they that it is moisturizing soothing anti-inflammatory when it comes to ingesting colostrum supplement I have more reservations there so colostrum supplements they they don components of colostrum in a colostrum supplement in terms of safety remember I pointed out my concerns with regards to insulin like growth factor could potentially be harmful in some situations if it it hasn important I think a lot of people assume that if they just take something that they benefits of it when in reality if there could be underdosed or you could be overdosed to a point where you actually having more harmful effects than beneficial like I said at the start of the video there is so much variability out there that even within a brand itself there be a lot of heterogeneity in terms of the quality and Constitution of their of their of their col Ostrum and again it varies a lot from animal to animal which one should you go with should you go with cow should you go with goat should you go with uh sheep who knows because there guide this all you what the supplement manufacturer claims there was even a study that demonstrated a lot of variation in terms of the outcomes of different colostrum supplements on at least cell behavior in vitro so not all colostrum supplements are going to perform the same and you as a consumer have no way of knowing really what you remember dietary supplements are not regulated and the reason this is so important is that the label does not have to undergo any kind of uh scrutiny so there labeling before going to Market one thing I always have found sort of ironic about a lot of the people who promote colostrum supplements is they you know anti-press Foods they anti you know you know trying to advocate for more of a natural or ancestral is kind of the buzzword lifestyle but then they recommend a colostrum supplement but here thing when it comes to the colostrum supplements it you could possibly get they collect it at the farm they freeze it and then they ship it off to these places where it is either defatted or some cases it times it necessary for stability I I don um and then they freeze dry it they remove some of the Lac they remove the lactose too also often times it will be exposed to high temperature for short duration to pasteurize it so it for human consumption so say the colostrum is collected within 3 days so when it the time it shipped you know all of those beneficial compounds starts to you know you really have to question are they still there are they have they been degraded um that seems very likely to me so to what extent those beneficial compounds are going to be relevant to you have the same bioavailability is questionable you going to likely lose some of those beneficial compounds I mean defatting alone has to impact at least the absorption of the fat soluble vitamins one popular colostrum supplement that I have seen I just find it interesting you know I interesting colostrum is like this super nutrient dense little little fatty milk nugget that is meant for newborn babies calves whatever um but look at any any colostrum supplement powdered supplement there label very little protein per iring most of them are zero calorie and so I have to ask like what exactly is the final product then by the time it is processed into a powder and what is in that colostrum like I said colostrum is variable it what I what exactly is the makeup at the time it is in the powder form you there of these with regards to how much vitamin A is in the product how much vitamin E how much um vitamin C how much of any of these compounds of interest in the colostrum sometimes they will report the IGG which may be a surrogate for overall quality but it terms of to what extent if any it going to offer benefit remains unknown so um to what extent that colostrum remains as nutrient dense by the time it gets into a powder form who knows all right guys so that about colostrum for your skin the data are lacking uh makes some sense that you might appreciate some skin benefit but to what extent it and beyond just using a niacinamide moisturizer who knows um more research is needed hope this video was helpful to you all if you enjoyed it give it

The Best Supplement For PCOS And Acne | Myo-Inositol	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxO9-MM_hyQ	Dr Day	well hey guys in today going to talk about polycystic ovary syndrome this is the most common hormone disorder in women of reproductive age I know a lot of you all struggle with it and of course it has various skin findings associated with it skin problems that can be stubborn and difficult to tackle in this video we going to be talking about the underlying root causes of polycystic ovary syndrome why you have skin problems and hair problems and I conventional medications used to treat polycystic ovary syndrome it symptoms but I want you to watch to the end because we deep dive on a dietary supplement that actually has a lot of research to support its efficacy for addressing various problems in PCOS including acne all right PCOS polycystic ovary syndrome it is a hormone problem and it characterized by a few things first of all hyper and androgenisation menstrual irregularity abnormal periods and as a result of that they often and later on will have difficulty conceiving and many women with PCOS if you look at their ovaries they have these cysts hence the name polycystic ovary lots of cyst you don have to have all of these features to be diagnosed with PCOS you have to have two out of the three the root cause of PCOS is not one single thing it are most health problems and part of its root cause is actually disregulation of hormone release from a part of your brain called the hypothalamus with PCOS there is a problem with types of hormones called gatot tropins gonadotropin specifically a luteinizing hormone LH and a follicle stimulating hormone FSH so if you look at the ratio between LH and FSH it is abnormally high so there there the reason this is important is because those hormones like I said they talk to your ovaries LH tells certain cells in your ovaries called Thea cells to make something called andr diione which is an androgen hormone follicle stimulating hormone on the other hand it talks to cells in your ovary called granulosis cells and it tells those cells to convert the andrena diione to estrone and estrogen using an enzyme called aromatase but with PCOS you have high levels of LH which overstimulate those Thea cells in the ovary making excess andrena diione so it enhances Androgen production leading to elevation in androgens and that lot of the skin and hair findings associated with PCOS like acne oily skin hertis we already talked about hair growth in a male pattern it can affect the hair follicles on your scalp causing them to miniaturize turn into a baby hair and you get hair loss specifically androgenetic alopecia the problem with the elevated LH relative to FSH is that it um you know your ovary is trying to pick the best follicle to ovulate okay like an egg but because you have a disruption there in those hormone levels basically the follicle kind of gets stuck so that gives rise to the appearance of those cysts again not everyone who has PCOS will have these cysts but many do and this is why the imbalance in LH to FSH arrests the follicle development so you don normal ovulation that irregular periods and problems with fertility the other pressing hormonal issue with PCOS is a problem with the hormone insulin specifically the body does not respond to it while the cells of your body don and as a result you have insulin resistance diabetes many women not all with PCOS also struggle with weight management possibly related to this hormone imbalance with insulin um or some other background genetic tendency and being overweight having obesity also tips the scale in favor of insulin resistance diabetes and further problems with irregular menes and infertility and all these things together also exacerbate the skin findings acne oiliness heroism androgenetic alopecia just like not everyone with PCOS will have polycystic ovaries not everyone with PCOS actually has insulin resistance so just remember that PCOS looks different for everyone everyone has kind of a different makeup different factors going on that play a role in the symptoms that they deal with and so not everything is going to work for everyone in the same fashion which brings me to the next Point how do we treat these issues there are a few standard medications one is combined oral contraceptive pills combined oral contraceptive pills commonly refer to as birth control pills because well if you take them they you know prevent their contraceptives they because they have an estrogen component and they have a progestin component combine oral contraceptive pills are beneficial for PCOS because basically what they do is in in PCOS because you have that abnormality and the hormones coming from the brain to talk to the ovaries the brain is trying to put out those hormones in an effort to get the the ovaries to respond properly but it disregulated so the birth control pills come in and it feedback loop the birth control pills the hormones in them they say sh they quiet this down and as a result they can help to normalize the gatot tropen profile and improve ovulation and get your period back on track and they can help lower the levels of those Androgen hormones that are causing acne CA hair growth in a male pattern heroism and androgenetic alopecia even women with acne who do not have PCOS like they have no problem with fertility they don have cystic ovaries and they don other signs of Androgen excess in those women using birth control pill combined oral contraceptive pills also can help their acne as well because as I before all acne has a hormonal component but in PCOS the cards are stacked against you because you are in this hyper Androgen State and those androgens are what are telling the oil gland to make more oil driving the acne driving the oily skin the cbera I have a video as a side note on the best birth control for acne for the hormonal component of acne so check that out because I go more into detail about the different types of hormonal contraceptive pills that can address acne but if you know anything about birth control pills they right for everyone okay they do have some side effects um depending on other things that are going on in your life they may not be right for you they can increase the risk of blood clots um and they you know have side effects some people don they may cause some weight gain which in the setting of PCOS is not ideal if you struggle with your weight to begin with they also can cause Melasma a skin condition with hyperpigmentation while women with PCOS struggle to conceive it and many want to try so you have to come off the birth control pills in order to try and get pregnant now up into this point the skin and hair stuff I pointed out has largely been related to the Androgen excess but uh when you have the insulin resistance piece in there that more acne but it also causes a skin condition called acanthosis nigricans thickened velvety dark brown to grayish areas of the skin often on the sides of the neck under the arms sides of the face that is a manifestation of insulin resistance if you want to know more skin signs of insulin resistance diabetes check out my video on skin signs of insulin resistance I below well a medication that I about on here before is called spironolactone spironolactone is an anti-androgen so it helps with the Androgen piece of things but it also can help improve insulin uh responsiveness and it complements birth control pills so they can be used together having insulin resistance is not simply a matter of oh I have high blood sugar it it has a Cascade effect to a variety of metabolic parameters that can have consequences for your overall health for example you can have abnormal blood lipids cholesterol as a result of insulin resistance spironolactone works as an as an anti-androgen it it can complement the birth control pills um and it will help to improve acne it helps to improve heroism and it also helps to improve androgenetic alopecia as well as reduce oiliness these are all things that have to do with the Androgen excess and to a certain extent spironolactone helps with the insulin resistance and cardiometabolic abnormalities in PCOS spironolactone is generally well tolerated but it does have some side effects it can cause breast tenderness and menstrual irregularities probably the most common and with PCOS you already have problems with the menstrual cycle so that might not be acceptable for everyone depending on you know if you spironolactone again is not a good option for you because you can if you it main players for addressing the insulin resistance is metformin metformin is a medication that works to decrease um glucose output from the liver and it also helps improve uptake of glucose into cells so not only does metformin help with the insulin resistance but it also can improve ovulation and encourage more normal periods in a you know regular menstrual cycle so that is going to be helpful especially for women who want to conceive there there are side effects with metformin specifically it can cause some gastrointestinal upset you know upset stomach so again not every medication is right for every person and PCOS again does not look the same for everyone not all women have um insulin resistance some women have more difficulty conceiving compared to others a lot of women are not interested in taking birth control pills because of side effects a lot of women don like spironolactone is something they want to be on they with the side effects they develop them everyone again has their reasons for what they want to pursue with their own health what if I told you there is a dietary supplement that has quite a bit of research to support its efficacy in improving many of the signs symptoms health problems with PCOS including acne including heroism so much so it investigated in PCOS dating back to the late 90s so over 20 years of research showing benefit the supplement what is it called myo andosol there are actually nine different forms of anasl so the myoinositol is what I dietary supplement but it naturally abundant in many foods that you can get in your diet um myoinositol as it turns out is really really important for what happens inside the cells after insulin binds to the insulin receptor okay and it turns out that women with PCOS it appears as though they have a problem at the level of a nosl and how it um you know regulates cell responsiveness to insulin so getting in myoinositol can improve a lot of what is abnormal in PCOS including acne including heroism where do you get myoan aetl it beans corn and nuts so quite high in those Foods specifically but they also have myo andosol supplements that have been studied for PCOS and randomized control trials if you go into the endocrin ologic gynecologic literature you studies on myo andosol and PCOS now there in terms of the studies the doses that are used the outcomes that they measuring the characteristics of the patients in these studies but all of the studies do support beneficial outcomes for women with PCOS taking myosl not only can It improve glucose uptake but it can improve that hormone Al imbalance I myoan aetl supplement this video is only for educational purposes I tell you oh go take myosl I giving you the information so that you discuss with your doctor myoinositol it actually can improve the abnormal balance between LH and FSH that is you know a problem in PCS like we talked about it also can improve your metabolic profile so again women who have PCOS they often have a metabolic metabolic abnormalities problems with things like um not only their blood glucose but also uh the lipids triglycerides cholesterol it can improve the levels of LH which are typically elevated in uh PC it can improve that LH to FSH ratio it can lower andrena diione the Androgen hormone that is playing a role in the acne the heroism the pattern hair loss and it does improve acne it improves acne quite well in women with PCOS it can also improve the elevation in insulin which ultimately can be beneficial for the signs of high insulin as it impacts the skin namely that condition acanthosis nigricans women with PCOS given myo andol they show Improvement in their total cholesterol lowers they also get an improvement in uh HDL that raised many women with PCOS who take myo and oocl they also show improvements in their BMI which yes I know is not a perfect metric it has its flaws it has its issues but um when it comes to treating PCOS weight management for women who are overweight or have obesity is really important because it exacerbates all of the problems like uh menstrual irregularity and you know the metabolic problems are further you know worsened by the um by by the excess body any way um and it and it improve fertility the improvements in acne and heroism are pretty significant I will say comparable to at least what you can see with a birth control pill a combined oral contraceptive pill so for women who are not interested or a candidate for oral contraceptive pills they for spironolactone and they feeling like what else is there available you know we have other acne medications right can treat acne um isotretinoin a retinoid uh not safe in pregnancy right you have topical retinoids those aren you also have antibiotics they of a short-term fix clear things up uh not a long-term solution though they kind of you know they suppress the inflammation but they used in order to kind of get a head start so that the medications that really work to control acne like isotretinoin or spironolactone have time to start working right myo andosol appears to be a safe and effective alternative what do I mean by safe okay I to reiterate it whether it be this or any other dietary supplement out there dietary supplements they are not without the potential risks they risks of harm to human health people have this misconception that supplements are safe much better than a drug but supplements if they work they like a drug and they can definitely side effects just like any prescription medication um so what are the side effects with myo andosol uh appear to have no side effects no side effects reported in any of these trials not only that but we know it actually been used in some of the um GYN and endocrinology literature um looking at women with PCOS trying to conceive going through fertility treatments and showing success um with myo and ocl now that area of expertise so I tell you take this it fertility but it has been examined in studies in in women with PCOS trying to conceive as with anything it poison it have been used and that appear to be safe and effective typically 2 gam of myosl Taken twice a day so 4 G total 2 G in the morning 2 G in the evening again this video is for educational purposes only to make you aware of this option it you feeling defeated something that you can now go to your doctor and talk about hey is this an option for me I you to take it I information that this exists out there can you use it alongside other medications yes there are studies looking at um myo and ocl combined with say combined oral contraceptive pills and showing that people get women get better results with both together than either alone so say you of these treatments you results in terms of clearing acne um and cbera but not 100% there support adding myo and ocl to the regimen as a safe and effective way to get better results um can improve acne significantly Herm significantly no research on it though for androgenetic Alopecia there directly looking at cbera but patients who take this often do report an improvement in oiliness but it does improve insulin responsiveness that myosl a supplement that actually um can work actually has a good track record of safety and efficacy specifically for women with PCOS now what if you don have PCOS but you and you know you birth control pills spon lactone which are not exclusive to treating acne and women with PCOS because again all acne has that hormonal component and these are medications that we use in women to treat um the hormonal aspect of acne and help control it but what if you those things or again you want to get pregnant is this something that will be effective for you what I can tell you is there are no actual studies really looking at this supplement outside of pcus um however women who just have acne do appreciate an improvement in their acne when they take this but we just don recommending it outside of PCOS um what about men is this effective for acne and Men we don effective for acne and Men safe for men to take and research does suggest that in men who have um problems with sperm counts you know they conceive their partner uh because of sperm sperm problems in you know inadequate sperm counts or maybe a motility issue um the the research actually does support uh that myosl can be beneficial for improving that now that uh in terms of fertility so the research exists out there talk to your doctor about it there are treatments with good track records but not every treatment is going to be the right track for every person out there okay so that making this video because I know a lot of you guys ask what else is there what else is there I don I can spironolactone I can pills I want to get pregnant surely there your doctor about this because there good research for this it effective and for PCOS specifically it definitely has a long-standing track record showing efficacy now that being said the research has its limitations again there was a lot of heterogeneity out there so there could be groups of people with either PCOS and or just acne for which this does not work okay for which this just does not work more research is needed but definitely worth having a discussion with your doctor especially if you frustrated with the available treatments out there for things like acne heroism androgenetic alopecia although again it hasn Alopecia anyway y was helpful to you um if so give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe I [Music] bye no	Success
The Truth About Collagen | 7 HUGE Myths About Taking Collagen	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7b25Z-6Vnw	Dr Day	well hey guys it topic of hydrolized collagen peptide dietary supplements I have many videos on my Channel about these supplements do they actually work to improve the skin do they actually work for the hair the nails I videos Down Below in the description box so you have more background information but in today to be busting a handful of myths that I see perpetuated regarding hydrolized collagen peptide dietary supplements first of all collagen it is a very abundant protein found in various connective tissues and animals and of course it it provides structural support to the skin along with hyaluronic acid as well as elastin but as we age there is a decline in collagen quality and quantity in our skin and this is what contributes to the appearance of aging skin in the form of wrinkles increased laxity sess fragility so wouldn we could just ingest collagen and have it go back into our skin fortunately you can into your skin because it protein and it comes the rule for collagen peptides these are actually small little tiny fragments of digested collagen these are produced actually from collagen naturally sourced from animals namely bone maybe ligaments there interest and research out there looking at taking hydrolized collagen peptides and a lot of the research out there really does show promise for these supplements improving moisture content in the skin reducing wrinkles improving skin elasticity giving an overall Improvement in brightness a decrease in Pore size these studies while compelling they do suffer many limitations including small size and heterogenea meaning each study does things a lot different from another study so what are some myths that I hear around hydroly collagen peptide supplements number one myth is just eat gelatin it thing it is not gelatin is collagen that has been denatured and partially hydrolized meaning it into those tiny little digestible peptides that is bad um or that it you are specifically seeking to achieve the outcomes demonstrated in the studies and again they have their limitations but if that well you out if you just go with gelatin because gelatin is not those small little peptide fragments um it much larger fragments you to be it not going to be pursuing the same outcome gelatin in contrast to hydrolized collagen peptides has some proper properties to it that make it desirable namely as a food additive in that it has the property of well jelling so yeah that gelatin over hydrolized peptides this the second myth is similar to the first and that is just eat bone broth it same thing as hydrolyzed collagen peptides it basically by simmering bones in water with a little bit of added vinegar to liberate um amino acids nutrients like calcium and phosphorus and the reason why bone broth is not going to yield the same outcomes or is unlikely to yield the same outcomes as hydrolized collagen peptides again boils down to the fact that it is not enriched actually in these collagen peptides the constitution of bone broth both commercially available bone broth preparations as well as um a basic recipe for bone broth and the mean concentration of key amino acids found in hydrolized collagen peptides the proline hydroxyproline glycine the ones that you want for the intended outcome very low actually in bone broth compared to hydrolyzed collagen peptides bone broth is something you enjoy eating by all means but I do think that a lot of Wellness accounts influencers overhype bone broth um when in reality the nutrient profile is not that great um you know to underscore what they are claiming I will say the amino acid composition as well as the micronutrient composition of bone broth varies tremendously it depending on the animal the age of the animal the preparation methods just keep that in mind because a lot of Wellness accounts that sell bone broth supplements you know they over oversell on the nutritional benefits of it number three myth just eat protein protein just eat more animal-based protein surely you getting enough of the amino acids that you find in these hydrolyzed collagen supplements just eat some tough cuts of meat like brisket or pot roast um again it all boils down to the fact no pun intended so we that this is not going to actually provide you with reliable levels of the hydrolyzed collagen peptides those small available digestable absorbable peptides that lead to the presumed benefits that you are seeking in terms of the skin you know eating more meat is not the same thing as pursuing hydrolyzed collagen peptid another myth that I hear is like well this is all Bs because surely you peptides and they broken down in your digestive tract digested just like any other protein and absorbed in the body they to have any it just making sure that you have enough protein in your diet and that either when you eat you know peptides proteins that they are broken down into amino acids which are absorbed into the circulation yes that is true but also your body can absorb peptides intact as they are across the small intestine into the circulation and that has actually been demonstrated with hydrolyzed collagen peptide supplements that they can in fact lead to an increase in hydroxyproline Proline peptide levels in the plasma so they definitely can be absorbed I think where people get lot of stray is they really laser focus in on hydrolyzed collagen peptide supplements as a protein as protein and they really I mean yes but at the same time they given the tone of this video up into this point you thinking that I some kind of collagen peptide especially if you am not a huge proponent of collagen peptides I them and I and hopefully that will explain that to you in a moment I have no Financial ties to the um collagen peptide industry um all right so this is the next myth is is for people who are more gung-ho about them um a lot of people um are under the impression that hydrolized collagen peptide supplements are good for you they are good for you they are a good supplement for your overall nutrition for your overall health and I would strongly encourage you to rethink that because hydrolyzed collagen peptide supplements are just that they are dietary supplements dietary supplements are not regulated like medications are they are not required to disclose to you potential risks adverse effects any potential interactions that it might have with medications and if you go through the dietary collagen supplements there are a lot of them that are not super transparent about where the peptides are coming from is it fish is it pork is it um cow derived this is really important because some people have severe allergies to say fish for example they supplements from fish um collagen peptide supplements while generally well tolerated they can and do have side effects I already alluded to the fact that that you know allergic reactions are a major concern there have been cases of severe allergic reactions to to collagen supplements also common adverse effects are headache digestive upset bloating gastrointestinal reflux and there regarding dietary supplements as a whole and contamination or inclusion of things not disclosed on the label um this is why I recommend if you dietary supplement choose one that has some sort of third-party testing associated with it NSF certified for sport for example but many dietary supplements have been found to be adulterated with contaminants and with regards to collagen peptides there heavy metal contamination but I want to draw your attention to this um in the fall of 2023 this tennis player I just recently came across this because I don failed um a drug test for w which is you know in professional sport athletes have to be tested to make sure that they not using baned substances performance-enhancing drugs she came up positive for roxadustat which is a ban substance because what it is is it makes your body essentially make more red blood cells so it gives you a competitive Advantage you have more carry oxygen carrying capacity you you know are faster but it can cause serious side um health effects like you know Strokes she had been taking a collagen supplement and they found out that the collagen supplement she was taking contained undisclosed um roxid distat you know this ban substance the fact that this was found in the collagen supplement that should give everyone pause with regards to dietary supplements because that can cause serious adverse health effects I pointed this out before too in some of my videos on supplements that cause acne um certain muscle building supplements you know marketed as like protein supplements they have been found to be adulterated with anabolic steroids giving people acne and of course failing these drug tests if you professional sport so you know be aware of that when it comes to dietary supplements the other myth that I hear is that this is a good source of protein hydrolyzed collagen peptides are you know primarily skewed to having Proline hydroxyproline gly they don and they amino acids um and specifically if you are looking to include more protein in your diet for athletic reasons for muscle building hydrolyzed collagen peptides are not the source that you want um because they branch chain amino acids no tryp toan which is an essential amino acid so they shouldn wants to get a little bit more protein in your diet you struggle to get protein in your diet and you want to turn to a protein powder a protein supplement I would steer you away from um collagen peptides because that mean you short there you amino acid profile the final collagen myth is that while collagen creams are completely useless you know you going to get collagen from a cream useless depends on how you things so collagen in creams moisturizers serums it works to improve moisture retention and Skin it you think collagen is useless in creams you also have to say glycerin is useless you also have to say hyaluronic acid is useless you have to say that I mean name your favorite humant and call it useless and that ingredients they help with moisture retention and honestly at the end of the day that important ways in which skincare products work to your advantage uh by improving moisture content and Skin uttermost layer so they def so collagen in products definitely can be helpful for moisturizing the skin now it too large to ever have a fighting chance of getting into your skin and aiding and replenishment of collagen so you know don definitely not completely useless in fact it prescription formulation of trano and Alano lotion for it moisturizing properties to help cut down on dryness and irritation that people often experience with tretinoin all right so those are some uh myths regarding collagen collagen supplements specifically um but I will end by giving you some of my thoughts regarding the landscape of literature regarding dietary collagen supplements and skin like I said at the beginning of the video there is there are research studies trials showing an improvement in hydration in wrinkles um in smoothness elasticity decrease in Pore size as far as the mechanism few things yes you getting some amino acids that are detected in the plasma after you ingest these supplements and make their way to the skin to serve for the building blocks of collagen that how they may work but the other part is that peptide that is absorbed in the small intestine makes its way in the circulation through the circulation to the dermis it peptide once it gets there what it does is it binds to receptors on those fiberblast cells and encourages them to make new healthy collagen now this hasn that is the current working Theory as to how these work and why it is so specific to the hydrolized collagen peptide because again if you go back to the other things that people might want to try like gelatin bone broth or Meats you significant lels of those peptides now I will point this out that there is a lot of heterogenity I said this at the beginning there heterogenity in these studies um yes there was recently a few years ago a big MAA analysis looking at all of the studies that concluded that these supplements can have some benefit for the skin but critiques of that meta analysis really really hone in on the fact that there in the different studies like they all using different types of collagen peptides from different sources um they they overall meta analysis is is actually really poor quality and even though the meta analysis says oh this is what these studies show The Meta analysis itself it has some problems with it the other thing we don everyone benefits from taking these um it may be the kind of thing that really only more mature skin types benefit from due to um you know lack of collagen or is there you know some Tipping Point does it is it does dose vary by age there are a lot of unknowns people often ask me what liquid capsule gummy who knows who knows these are questions for which research has not tested or provided answers again there so keep all that in mind so when I say I I you know I taking them they there that they have the potential to work work um but I guys to use them and again I decline any sponsorship opportunities for these because I don I going to promote something that I don 100% believe in let me know in the comments though do you take these I know a lot of you guys do and a lot of you guys have said that you appreciate benefit but some of you have also reported that you horrible side effects share your stories in the comments um if you guys enjoyed this video on the end I one of my last collagen supplement videos you can check that out if you want more on the research Behind These but if you guys like this video

5 Supplements You Should Avoid For Clear Skin	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxWv9LTISCA	Dr Day	these five supplements could be breaking you out well hey guys welcome back in today about dietary supplements that trigger acne dietary supplements are a huge industry it of people in the US take some type of dietary supplement and the perception amongst consumers is that supplements you know are safe but they do have side effects they do have risks just like medications but in contrast to medications supplements are not regulated and therefore it them to make their way to you as a consumer and the manufacturers are not necessarily required to provide any warning of potential side effects or caution against you know potential contraindications and there variability and quality uh of supplements as as well as the dosages that are are being um included in formulation you know a lot of times what is listed on the label is not actually what is in the formula you would be surprised it out there there are multiple case reports and case Series in the literature linking um the supplements that we specifically with acne um either acne for the first time or worsening of existing acne and I this out you know Association does not prove causation but amongst all of these supplements what really stands out is that in these case Series in these case reports and from Clinical experience en countering this myself what is observed is that when the patient stops these supplements the acne goes away so that is more you know along the lines of yeah I mean there playing a role here now why might supplements cause acne there are a lot of potential reasons some supplements May influence the hormones that lead to more oil production some supplements may act in similar ways ways that hormones namely the Androgen hormones signal to the oil gland to make more oil some supplements might actually disrupt the composition of the sebum that comes out of your oil gland into your pore and favor irritation within the pore as well as make maybe make for more inflammation and lead to flares of acne it seems like some supplements have a direct effect on the cells lining the pore making them more prone to clog and with certain dietary supplements not only is the patient getting more acne but when you look at their skin under the microscope their oil glands have gotten very large there gland what are some signs that the supplements you are taking are causing your acne a very stereotypical pattern for acne to erupt as it relates to supplements and what you know again favors that these are causitive or contributory is the way in which the acne erupts the the acne spots they tend to all appear the same it monomorphous that really speaks to that the supplement that you were taking is the trigger as opposed to if you somebody whose genetics make it so that you have acne and you know you acne you that are in different stages of healing uh you you maybe you but with acne that is triggered by supplements the acne tends to all spots tend to appear the same um they can happen on the face the chest the back the shoulders and the eruption happens kind of all at once like out of nowhere and it supplements and it will resolve usually in about 2 to 3 weeks of stopping the culprit supplements so what are the culprits number one has to be vitamin B12 there has been a longstanding association with taking high doses of vitamin B12 and acne a lot of people you know come to the dermatologist saying I just got this really you know intense acne they say are there any new supplements and often times they taking high amounts of B12 how high 5 to 10 milligram per week it supplement that you might be taking but they put B12 in a lot of things these days um like energy drinks uh nutritional beverages things that you might just view as food uh have B12 added so you can actually end up getting to a high amount likewise intra intramuscular injections of B12 getting a B12 shot also can trigger acne for people now it a lot of people myself included need to take a B12 supplement because they not getting it from their diet right in those cases you know make sure you taking an appropriate dose is what I can tell you so don supplements there are a lot of people who have to take them either e because their diet limits B12 or because they have an underlying malabsorption problem and you know these people myself included were not all getting rip Waring acne from B12 supplements you know it not the it dose so you want to make sure you taking the right dose and that might vary depending on what your underlying medical reason is for taking the B12 supplement so talk to your doctor about what the best dose is going to be for you something I have observed clinically when it comes to B12 as a culprit for acne is that I often notice that the acne it themselves are a lot smaller and it tends to be less inflammatory that observation and there are case theories that corroborate that observation but it tends to be less inflammatory in comparison to you know like nodulocystic acne but it often a lot of little tiny uh comedones or pules on the face or up upper chest that that seen clinically there case report of a 5-year-old boy who got acne um an acne breakout from taking a multivitamin that had a high amount of vitamin B12 why might B12 cause acne there are a couple of theories but honestly there reason one reason may be that it is uh something that cutie bacterium Acy which is the acne causing bacteria that lives in your pore it really depends on B12 so Tak in B12 above and beyond what your body needs could just be going right to support the needs of the acne causing bacteria now if you bacteria they strains of that bacteria and people who have acne they have a tendency to have a certain type of strain in comparison to people who don know maybe some people that bacteria is more sensitive to high doses of B12 and leading to acne it will increase something called porin synthesis which will lead to a lot more inflammation that then others postulate that vitamin B12 uh when you and it into your sebum into your pore that it might agitate the poe lining another potential mechanism is that things that are often added in B12 may be actually the culprit so maybe it Association like sorbital for example some people have thought might be playing a role in why some people get acne as it relates to B12 you likely to have acne with high does B12 supplements if they are combined with other B vitamins a lot of you guys have have shared with me over the years and patients as well that they they take biotin supplements they get acne now biotin is less well reported you know is not reported necessarily with acne but I it and I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that the biotin in these supplements is such a high amount you know the dose is is quite high again that they you know kind of up to their own discretion to use what they want so they might put a high amount in there thinking that it will you know make consumers think that they better product when in reality could be getting a more problematic uh Pro product I biotin at high doses can interfere with the accuracy of certain blood tests so high doses of biotin whether it be by themselves or maybe are often accompanied by that B12 definitely can put you down the path for uh for an acne flare again it will clear up once you stop these or you know go to a more reasonable level the next supplement is similar it oxine high doses of that as well can also trigger acne breakouts for people so it them or with other B vitamins including biotin so together B vitamins you want to be careful of and you know like I said I days this isn when I was growing up was necessarily as big of a a problem because now we have a lot more widespread availability of high doses of B vitamins and things these electrolyte beverage drinks that a lot of people myself included enjoy like I drink those for hydration I don view them as a food but like I read the ingredients it remember that this is additional B vitamins that you kidneys if you be removing that but again like taking in high amounts can be harmful and you know the acne flare is one clue Red Bull was one of the first energy drinks that ever came out but now it industry Just Energy Drinks Alone and they pump those things with a ton of B vitamins like a B vitamin cocktail and a lot of times the B vitamin doses are really high so you might have somebody who of these B vitamins plus caffeine maybe messing up with their sleep uh because they not sleeping well so they down and that too can aggravate acne so a lot of things could be playing a role there not just the B vitamin Alone number three is iodine high doses of iodine definitely can trigger an acne breakout it eruption if it happens you know in somebody who maybe doesn have acne um but people who do have acne if they take high doses of iodine it certainly can aggravate their acne now this is something that we observed that actually happens in patients who get um uh contrast for um you know certain Imaging studies radio contrast that has iodine in it they can get an acne breakout um but uh it definitely can happen from ingesting iodine supplements and you also have to be careful because uh kelp has a high amount of iodine in it it sea vegetable but uh they sell kelp supplements where it concentrated and it definitely can aggravate acne cause acne there are you know cases of people who take kelp supplements not just kelp but kelp supplements where they concentrating it into a little tablet getting a lot of iodine that can aggravate and cause acne and it tends to be these little pus pules more so than anything as a matter of fact coming back to iodine one of the reasons why you heard and I will often talk about milk and dairy causing acne that Association is you know not as well teased out as the internet might make it seem but yes there is an association with consumption of skim milk and acne and one working hypothesis as to why that Association may be is that dairy milk can potentially have a higher amount of iodine maybe it secondary to high iodine in the feed that they may also be present in milking sanitization Solutions um so that may also be making its way into the milk just a theory though but iodine definitely can trigger acne now iodine you know a lot of times you might find this in you know thyroid supplements supplements aimed at thyroid Health you have to be careful um iodine you know you can get from food and and so be careful with the iodine supplements then you have whey protein supplements whey protein it interested in muscle building whey protein whey comes from uh is a milk derive product it specifically comes from uh the making of cheese it know kind of a byproduct of that it is a protein and it is thought to be good for muscle building because it has a high amount of brand chain amino acids now when it comes to whey protein supplements a given scoop of whey protein powder the wayy protein in there the amount is roughly that of 6 to 11 lers of milk now if you enjoys whe protein supplements and you don I would say that per se but if you are getting acne for the first time take a look at what supplements you protein is commonly associated the the working Theory as to why that is is that that milk protein you know part of also why it may be beneficial for putting on muscle is that it increases igf-1 insulin like growth factor one which is something that um will lead to uh more hormonal signaling in the oil gland and lead to more acne so anytime you have an increase in igf-1 not only is acne a risk factor but also um for women heroism that pattern you know hair growth on the face the chest uh so that something you can run into igf-1 insulin like growth factor also increases uh the signaling through the Androgen receptor so it has some of the same effects as the Androgen hormones on oiliness and acne causing plugging of the pore comedones and then breakdown of sebum as it gets oxidized it that sebum is also feeding the bacteria that cause acne bacteria breaks that down and generates a of inflammation and igf-1 also enhances uh the the division of the cells lining the pore so they they stuck you get more comedones now one thing about the wayy protein acne Association that has always been called into question actually relates to supplement number five or supplement family I should say number five that causes acne and that is anabolic androgenic steroids and the reason the Whey Protein thing comes into question here is that a couple of things sometimes people who tend to take these whe protein supplements bodybuilders they also are more likely to be taking um anabolic androgenic steroids and maybe they not always disclosing that so is it the whey protein in these cases or is it you know something else that these people are taking also though a lot of muscle building supplements supplements specifically marketed for muscle building the FDA has gone in and tested these and found that they are adulterated with anabolic androgenic steroid compound steroid likee compounds that guess what can definitely definitely definitely feed acne and cause actually pretty severe acne all the way from an eruption of inflammatory nodulocystic acne to a rare acne subtype called acne fulminans acne fulminans is like the most severe type of acne because not only is it this intense nodulocystic scarring acne on the face the chest the back um but the patients develop fever um they can have damage to their liver joint pain it is an inflammatory um you know total body systems issue and patients often have to go on a course of uh prednizone which is a uh systemic steroid that suppresses the immune response they also may have to go on a medication called Huma tnf Alpha inhibitor to lower that inflammation all right y are five supplements pretty strongly associated with acne although a lot of people take these ingredients supplements and they have no issue with acne so again you know if you supplement especially if it recommended to you by your doctor um it know don things but it especially if you the very first time and you know I just want to emphasize to you guys that supplements they harmless as like the the more natural route to go with things but they really do have a lot of risks and in contrast to a medication they these risks don you and again the doses are not necessarily established um they don necessarily have to adhere to any particular dosing um range and you know it you do have to be careful with supplements now when it comes to choosing supplements I always always always encourage everyone to go with supplements that have been third-party tested um like NSF certified for sport um because at least that way you know you have a little bit of additional um insurance that what is on the label is what you are actually getting uh because these cases that I told you where the FDA went in and found that um certain muscle building supplements were adulterated with anabolic steroids you know not only is that going to potentially cause really severe debilitating acne for you but you know it can have a lot of other serious health impacts and if you are um doing bodybuilding or some type of competition a lot of those substances are actually banned and you will be tested for them so you know it could mess up your your competition anyways guys that wanted to say about supplements that may trigger acne I hope this was informative if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don I [Music] bye	Success
Magnesium Skin Benefits That Will Surprise You!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvPOo_sCZ2E	Dr Day	well hey guys today let skin benefits of magnesium over the years I please talk about magnesium and skin care I products creams lotions serums with magnesium the brands make all sorts of claims of skin benefit is there any truth to that will putting magnesium on your skin have any sort of potential benefit we that in today going to touch on magnesium supplements and do they have any potential for improving your skin so if that sounds of interest to you keep watching now magnesium is something we get from our diet and it of stuff in your body I mean it really important specifically it is essential for the proper functioning of hundreds of different enzymes enzymes are proteins that basically make reactions happen in your body enzymes don supporting players they need a team and magnesium is on that team for a lot of of different enzymes these enzymes carry out so many different reactions and we body you have to have a good magnesium to build strong healthy bones and for maintenance of bone health in fact over half of the magnesium in your body is actually stored in your bones magnesium also does a lot for electrical signals throughout your body your your body is like a house um you know it plumbing and it magnesium is really important for the wiring and therefore it muscle and for the signals that tell your heart to beat because magnesium is so important for a variety of reactions throughout the body those include biochemical reactions that are really important for controlling your blood sugar and for controlling your blood pressure as well the skin is this huge massive organ and it these cells and it to build to repair to renew to respond to heal to regenerate it has to keep water in it has to prevent irritating things from getting in it has to prevent uh infectious microorganisms from taking up shop and and getting into your body and your bloodstream when your skin fa barrier fails when your skin fails as an organ system it life-threatening it life-threatening uh you can your uh fluids your electrolytes uh you become dehydrated uh you can regulate I mean it is it is it is serious so magnesium is important for a lot of vital functions for example so when we talk about the Skin Barrier here here play when we talk about the skin you want to think about the outermost layer of the skin it have these little shells of dead cells dead keratinocytes specifically they called corio sites cuz they these little little helmets almost and they are IM mesed in Mortar like a brick wall so there the bricks they in a mortar that glues them together and that mortar is made up of lipids guess what magnesium is really really important for making the lipids in that mortar so as you can imagine magnesium is really important for that watertight seal for keeping water in the skin and keeping it hydrated smooth and supple as well as for preventing stuff from getting in and causing irritation and skin problems because magnesium is necessary for so many different enzymes really another place where it is highly featured if you will in the day-to-day choreography of your skin is in um building proteins I mean a lot of what your skin is doing is is protein building keratins especially you know the epidermis the top layer of the skin it this like coordinated um series of events of of maturation that get get you to that shell um it escalator and when you get to the top you when you you to make it all the way up to the top you have to mature you have to take on different characteristics all of that requires enzymes proteins signals the immune system coming in and surveying things that go arai and not to mention we have day-to-day environmental stressors assaulting our skin on a regular basis and that can all lead to to you know oxidative stress which damages the proteins the DNA the lipids in the skin and your skin has to respond to it I mean it it the skin just trying to coordinate everything so magnesium is really important in that regard for simply protein building that but then you down below you have all of this um collagen right that gives the skin a lot of its support you also have have elastin another protein these things are also responsible for giving the skin elasticity snap recoil and as you guys know the the goal is for preservation of good healthy collagen because when that starts to go down which is inevitable it that we can develop them more quickly due to excessive exposure to an environmental aggressor Sun the UVA rays come in and you know destroy destroy the collagen so good magnesium levels are really important not only for the proteins that are being made in the epidermis but also for everything that is being formed down in the dermis and so if you are pursuing skincare products ingredients for remedying collagen aiming to boost collagen or preserve collagen magnesium is right there right there at the round table trying to strategize that collagen preservation so it needs needs to be there magnesium also helps with water content in the epidermis and I about this before not you know not only is magnesium essential for the function of a variety of enzymes but then you got water content in the in the epidermis magnesium helps bring some of that in and when a water content is optimal these enzymes are able to do what they need to do magnesium also comes into play when we healing and Recovery especially wound healing like if you get a cut or scrape magnesium is really important for that part of the healing process involves building proteins and also involves you know restructuring things different cells coming in coordinating events enzymes are playing a role I mean there magnesium is is there playing a role in that as well and of course your skin sees all these environmental stressors throughout the day pollution of course already we talked about ultraviolet radiation infrared radiation heat visible light all that you know can lead to what and too many free radicals beyond what your skin can kind of handle leads to something called oxidative stress which also contributes to premature skin aging magnesium is really important for how different enzymes in the skin defend against free radicals so should we just be putting it on our skin there preliminary research to support the benefit of applying magnesium to your skin and say a moisturizing cream specifically if you have at topic dermatitis now it awareness month so if you eczema is an umbrella term for many different skin conditions seven to be exact but one of the ones that you probably think of the most is actually at topic dermatitis um and in atopic dermatitis patients have a problem with their Skin Barrier specifically remember we talked about the bricks and mortar the lipids between the bricks the corn the lipids between the cornea sites a really important lipid for the Skin Barrier is ceramides and patients who have atopic dermatitis often have deficiency in ceramides and that underlies part of Their Skin Barrier issues and why their skin is vulnerable to losing water and for the penetration of irritants and aeroallergens that trigger flares of red itchy flamed rashes that ooze and weep fluid that is you know the T tale sign of impaired skin Bearer is an atopic dermatitis flare up people have actually looked at patients who have atopic dermatitis and they gave them a cream with magnesium the cream also had camide in it and I other videos but ceramides when applied to the skin may help improve your Skin ability to make some of its own ceramides this particular study looking at people who have atopic dermatitis they gave them a cream that had camide and magnesium or they gave um other people other patients with atomic dermatitis in the study just a basic cream without either of these ingredients then another subset of people in the study got hydrocortisone cream and they appli their respective cream daily and at the end of the study people who used the camide Magnesium cream had better parameters of Skin Barrier Health uh objectively things like transepidermal water loss moisture content so it they had better in comparison to the basic cream their parameters were similar to the hydrocortisone cream now if you remember back to my videos on hydrocortisone or topical steroids um you know they Mainstay of of management for Exon but they they have side effects so we always seeking for Alternatives and it been it who have atopic dermatitis if they consistently moisturize it can help cut down on their need to use topical steroids uh cuz it helps cut down on recurrences of flares and so um you know it to results comparable to a topical steroid because you know there are side effects to be had with them but it small study there are a lot of limitations and again the cream that they were studying had camide in it so was it the Magnesium or was it the camide Magnesium applied topically may help because it is important for camide synthesis so maybe together they exhibit Synergy it see you know how does a cream with camide versus a cream with camide plus magnesium versus a cream with just magnesium per form the other thing to keep in mind though is that the Magnesium salts they also bind to water so that mechanism there you know they improving the water content which is going to support epidermal turnover or that maturation process of taking the cells from the bottom floor right in the elevator all the way up to the top floor to be at the top to be part of the brick wall there topical magnesium for diaper rash diaper rash basically the Skin Barrier gets broken down because of the trapping of moisture plus friction on the skin in in the diaper areas under under a diaper the main stay for helping to prevent that and control it is the use of something called a barrier cream now I have a video All About Barrier cream they helpful for other types of irritant dermatitis that happen in skin folds where you have friction and moisture being trapped that erode at the Skin Barrier but this particular study looked at a cream with magnesium in it showed that it was beneficial for diaper rash what might magnesium and Skin Care actually offer you the research suggests that it may help with barrier function but more research is needed to determine that now we can sit here all day and you know guess that it might help with healing recovery repair help defend against oxidative stress but we really don does any of those things ultimately it a safe ingredient appears to be helpful more research is needed but uh I wouldn go run out and start you know chasing after magnesium but if you product with magnesium in it and you see an improvement there there it likely is helping your skin in some way and there underlying reason why now let about magnesium supplements because a lot of people take magnesium supplements you know they like a lot of electrolyte drinks and it laxatives ant acids should you take a magnesium supplement be careful so here thing about magnesium come to find out our soil is lower in magnesium these days than maybe it once was so there some question that maybe we getting optimal levels from our food all the time but then again we don eat the best diet these days a lot of people unfortunately you know subsist off of Highly proc ultr processed foods that maybe don nutrient density profile to them who knows just to guess um so there thought that maybe people are not getting ideal levels of magnesium Frank magnesium deficiency is not common it can happen though signs of magnesium deficiency include nausea vomiting fatigue muscle weakness magnesium is still important for electrical signals that you can develop seizures problems with your heart who magnesium deficiency alcoholics alcoholics are an at risk group for pretty much any kind of nutrient deficiency because unfortunately um it part of their disease they end up you know not eating uh they just subsist off of alcohol which is not the most like nutrient-dense food if you will uh so they are definitely an atrisk group for uh magnesium deficiency among other things and then there people who have malabsorption problems uh if you have an inflammatory bowel disease like Crohn who have type 2 diabetes and older adults you know with age we lose appetite you know older adults unfortunately you know they becoming frail currently are existing in an epidemic of loneliness and older adults are really an atrisk group and poor it poor nutrition is you know just not a good thing in that group uh so that can run into poor magnesium levels you may have a suboptimal magnesium level and you any type of symptoms or really feel any type of way so it becomes this question of like well you know would supplementing be beneficial I would encourage you rather than supplementing uh to lean in more to magnesium rich Foods spinach pumpkin seeds legumes nuts bananas if you able to eat these Foods if you have to be on some sort of restrictive diet for health reasons make sure you following with your health care provider if you have to do that um and find out you know how best to meet your magnesium requirements so that you don deficiency problems or insufficiency problems we magnesium may be appropriate in certain situations a lot of people you know take a magnes iium drink electrolyte drink um and if you what will happen is that if you on magnesium your body will kind of up the ante if you will on absorbing magnesium when you are low you know on the low end so whether that be from Foods or supplements and then anything above and beyond that will often just get passed through your urine but you definitely can overdose on magnesium supplements so you want to be careful it magnesium from food but you certainly can overdose on magnesium from supplements it can cause nausea vomiting diarrhea poor mood depression low blood pressure it can definitely be harmful to your health it can cause kidney problems so you know be careful with magnesium uh you don people don they are interested in trying a magnesium supplement but pay attention to other things that you are taking in like I said electrolyte drinks sometimes people don of beverages nowadays energy drinks even will have magnesium added um you know they add all sorts of vitamins and things so you know you want to be careful that you now if you have insufficient or even deficient magnesium sure improving your magnesium levels definitely will likely translate to healthier appearing skin it just makes sense so important for so many things it makes sense but uh just to arbitrarily take a magnesium supplement in the absence of any kind of insufficiency in the hopes of getting better skin I would caution you against that I would strongly encourage you however to lean into more magnesium rich foods and incorporating them into your diet that is a much better way to get it safer healthier you know you get all the other beneficial compounds from these foods and you got to eat so I would encourage you to try these so that magnesium hopefully this video was helpful to you and talking about the science of magnesium in the skin and you know what it does it does a lot uh your skin does a lot so there on and sure every little bit counts as far as what if you have any insufficiencies or deficiencies it certainly can show up on your face speaking of whole food sources recently I did a video on the benefits of eating almonds for your skin you going to want to check that video out next I you guys like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe I [Music]

5 HAIR SUPPLEMENTS TO AVOID | Dermatologist @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UibL_icWIwE	Dr Day	five supplements you should avoid if you have hair loss hair supplements there is big money to be made in that industry there are a ton of different hair supplements on the market lozenges gummies drinks and I of these hair supplements over the years on my channel and I that a lot of hair supplements contain ingredients in them which really can be paused due to their potential for serious adverse effects on one number one is iron and I know what you like super important for hair growth you cells that grow your hair they are some of the most rapidly dividing cells in the body and they rely on iron to divide iron is also super important for controlling the expression of genes that are necessary for hair biology many patients who come to the dermatologist with a complaint of hair loss are actually found to be iron deficient and checking iron is part of evaluating hair loss iron deficiency is actually the most common nutrient deficiency worldwide and there are a lot of reasons to have iron deficiency so at this point you not take iron if you are having problems with with your hair multiple things can be true at the same time yes it iron is super important for hair growth yes it hair loss have iron deficiency and yes it most common nutrient deficiency worldwide but that doesn mean that if you have hair loss and hair shedding you should just go take an iron supplement if you actually do have iron deficiency the main thing you need to focus on is why you have iron deficiency in the first place you should undergo a proper evaluation there are situations where your body needs a lot more iron for example pregnancy delivery and breastfeeding in addition to hair loss other signs of iron deficiency include being very fatigued having extreme paleness spoon Nails painful swollen tongue angular cheilitis as a side note I have a whole video on skin signs of iron deficiencies so check that out so yes we do check for iron deficiency and people who have hair loss but that being said you shouldn because you see a supplement for hair and you think that solution there iron in the absence of iron deficiency is going to help your hair and in fact there are serious harms that come with taking iron when it is not necessary if you front you know it can come with

iron accumulates in your body and causes damage to your organs this can make you feel very fatigued it can cause joint pain it can damage your pancreas and cause diabetes it diabetes because it also causes your skin to kind of have this bronzish grayish appearance due to deposition of iron in the skin it can lead to enlargement of your liver your spleen it can impact your sex hormones and cause low libido because hair supplements are supplements and not medications they not required to warn you about these potential issues that can come about from taking excessive amounts of iron you don of iron to get to you aren taking low doses over time in the absence of iron deficiency can set you up for iron overload and toxicity now that being said if you do have hair loss and you been found to have iron deficiency definitely of course follow their instructions regarding iron supplementation they should be monitoring you to monitor for response of the hair or any other symptoms that you are having related to low iron number two is zinc zinc is an essential mineral it plays a vital role in the function of all different types of enzymes that your body relies on it also required for different factors that are necessary to dictate how certain genes are expressed so all that to say it ends up being really important of course for hair biology hair growth zinc deficiency is not very common it can be inherited or it can be acquired and zinc deficiency can result in hair loss people at risk for zinc deficiency are those with a genetic condition known as acrodermatitis enteropathic those who have inflammatory bowel disease if you have liver or kidney disease pregnant women alcoholism and certain medications that can interfere with the absorption of zinc like valproic acid and certain medications for blood pressure so I not saying zinc deficiency doesn happen it of these scenarios and otherwise healthy people taking zinc for hair not research backed that it your hair in addition to the possibility of hair loss some other signs of zinc deficiency include diarrhea rashes poor wound healing and poor immune function check out my video as a side note on signs of zinc deficiency I go over in detail with photos all of these different signs of zinc deficiency so while zinc deficiency does occur it not super common and in otherwise healthy people with no underlying health problems to just take zinc for your hair is not evidence-based there research showing that that helpful for your hair zinc supplementation can actually interfere with the absorption of iron so taking zinc supplements can actually make you iron deficient and zinc supplements in the absence of confirmed zinc deficiency can also lead to poor immune function taking zinc supplements in the absence of zinc deficiency also can lead to vomiting diarrhea and pain don take a zinc supplement because you heard it know exactly why you have issues with your hair and if you just want healthier hair taking zinc in the absence of deficiency is not where you need to be focusing your efforts number three is selenium I see selenium in a ton of hair supplements selenium is an antioxidant and yes oxidative stress is a major contributing factor to miniaturization of the hairs in androgenetic alopecia oxidative stress is also something associated with premature graying as a side note I have a whole video on reversing gray hair so check that one out if that interested in generally speaking selenium deficiency is pretty rare it can happen in areas of the world where the soil content is low in selenium parts of central China certain parts of North Korea and Siberia patients who have kidney failure and are on dialysis are also an at-risk group and of course anyone who has any malabsorption but the average otherwise healthy individual who is shopping the supplement aisle and Target or at their local health food store and is considering buying one of these hair supplements check the label if it has selenium in it why are you taking it because taking selenium you can easily get to toxicity not only from supplements but you can get toxic levels of selenium from food specifically Brazil nuts one Brazil nut has like all of your daily requirement for selenium and eating too many Brazil nuts can actually cause selenium toxicity as well like some of these other things that I pointed out here in the absence of deficiency there taking selenium is going to be beneficial for one kind of hair loss issue improve hair density nothing of that short and taking excessive amounts of selenium you easily can get to a toxic level and sadly one of the outcomes of selenium toxicity is actually hair loss so taking these supplements that have selenium in them actually could make your hair loss worse other signs of selenium toxicity include a blistering skin rash problems with memory it can even cause a heart attack respiratory distress and Frank kidney failure so don thinking oh this is a supplement it going to help my hair it actually could harm your hair as well as the rest of your body supplement number four vitamin A vitamin A is actually a group of compounds that includes retinol retinol retinoic acid Pro vitamin A and carotenoids vitamin A has some pretty characteristic skin findings which I go over in my video on signs of vitamin A deficiency but interestingly enough hair loss is not one of them on the flip side high levels of vitamin A have actually been linked to hair loss A lot of people who take supplements they may not realize that some of the supplements that they take there can be a overlap so not only is there vitamin A in One supplement but they may also be getting it in another supplement for example a lot of people take cod liver oil it actually has very high amounts of vitamin A so taking that in combination with one of these hair supplements that also might have vitamin A in it you can actually run into a scenario where it puts you at risk for hair loss as well as other toxic effects Vitamin A is a fat soluble vitamin so what that means is that when you take it in anything that you don going to get stored in your fat and your liver because of that you can run into toxicity in the United States at least vitamin A toxicity is a lot more common than vitamin A deficiency other signs of vitamin A toxicity include changes in your vision blurry vision problems with bright lights decreased night vision vitamin A can interfere with Vitamin D it can have negative consequences for your bone health it can cause almost like an osteoarthritis it can cause joint swelling joint pain vitamin A toxicity can easily lead to headaches nausea vomiting dizziness and it very dangerous in pregnancy high amounts of vitamin A and pregnancy can cause pretty serious birth defects on this channel I profile of isotretino and that is a medication that is a form of vitamin A and the negative side effects of that are the same as what you can get with high doses of vitamin A the difference is that with isotretinoin you are being monitored for these side effects you are being treated with a dose that is appropriate to minimize the risks of any of these side effects whereas a vitamin A supplement it like isotret no one is treating your acne it providing you any benefit in the absence of confirmed vitamin A deficiency but it one accumulate in your body by the time you do develop some of these side effects it can get it can be at a point where you have gotten to a very high level with Accutane we talk about some of the more common side effects being dry skin chapped lips that can happen with vitamin A supplements too and a lot of people don their skin is dry that chapped lips and you know they keep buying lip balms moisturizing and again supplementing with vitamin A is not known to improve hair the opposite last but not least is vitamin E vitamin E is a class of compounds that includes talkatrianols and tocopherols vitamin E is mostly of interest because it antioxidant and again when it comes to hair specifically androgenetic alopecia free radicals can push the hair follicle over the edge and those who are genetically predisposed to miniaturize basically go from a full course terminal hair to a little baby Bella peach fuzz hair inflammation in the scalp free radicals definitely influences that along with hormones vitamin E deficiency is very rare there taking vitamin E supplementation for hair aside from one small study of 21 volunteers who were taking 100 milligrams of a mixed chocolate supplement daily and they actually showed a statistically significant increase in the number of hairs in comparison to Placebo but more research is definitely needed to say for sure to what extent supplementing with vitamin E is going to be helpful for the hair and in what groups not to mention the risk of toxicity with vitamin E because like vitamin A vitamin E is also fat soluble so anything your body is not using it going to get stored vitamin E is naturally found in vegetable oils cereal grains nuts see it from your diet deficiency is very rare people who are at risk for deficiency or like people again with malabsorption certain underlying medical conditions like cystic fibrosis where they don absorb fat soluble vitamins properly people who but the average otherwise healthy person out there is not walking around vitamin E deficient but suppose implementing with vitamin E in the absence of a deficiency in the absence of a true confirmed need for Vitamin E supplementation it can lead you down a dangerous path because vitamin E supplementation can interfere with your body can cause excessive bleeding Hemorrhage if you happen to get a cut or a scrape you may bleed more or God forbid you need a surgery you supplement make sure make sure make sure you tell the surgeon but in the emergent situation or if you forget what can end up happening is that you can have excessive bleeding during surgery vitamin E impacts blood clotting because it inhibits the activity of enzymes needed for blood clotting while vitamin E is an antioxidant taking high levels of it actually can impair immune function make you more likely to get sick high amounts of vitamin E also will mess up thyroid hormone production and can make you at risk for low thyroid which in and of itself is a risk factor for hair loss speaking of which high amounts of vitamin E supplementation have actually been shown to be associated with hair loss so so as it stands now there to show that taking vitamin E supplementation is going to help with the hair everything that we have really suggests that it can be harmful to otherwise healthy people who don issues absorbing it and if anything it can put you at risk for hair loss probably due to the effects that it has on thyroid hormone production all right guys so those are five supplements to avoid in the absence of confirmed deficiency if you are someone dealing with hair loss you hair loss supplement aisle you wondering like should I be taking these things are they going to help my hair be aware they do have risks and their supplements so they disclose those risks to you and also always make sure you tell your treating healthcare provider about any supplements you are taking because they can interfere with certain medications they can have adverse effects put you at risk for things like bleeding as I mentioned unless you have an underlying health problem that limits your ability to absorb these the best way to get them is from your diet from foods make sure you be able to get all of these nutrients that we discussed in this video of these that we talked about iron deficiency is the most common there are a lot of reasons for iron deficiency you want to make sure you know why you have iron deficiency and so that should be worked up before you just assume you have it and go randomly taking iron supplements it can actually cause quite a bit of harm as can all of these supplements they do have the risk for harm but they required to tell you that another really common ingredient found in most hair supplements is going to be Biotin and I have a recent video all about why biotin is not where it the hair supplements so I that video on the insulate you need to watch that next before you contemplate buying another Hair Skin and Nails supplement make sure you watch that video a lot will be revealed to you about the potential adverse effects of Biotin supplements anyways guys if you like this video give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don I [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music]	Success
THE TRUTH ABOUT HAIR, SKIN, AND NAIL VITAMINS | Dermatologist	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5cn7HuLs4c	Dr Day	don nail supplement without watching this video to the end we are going to be talking about why hair skin and nail supplements can be pretty problematic well hey guys welcome back to the video on this channel I have a ton of videos reviewing various in a sundry Hair Skin and nail supplements it is no secret there is a lot of money to be made in the Hair Skin and nail supplement game the global Beauty supplement industry as a whole is growing and growing in 2016 it was worth about 3.6 billion dollars by 2024 it 6.8 billion dollars that is a lot of money people keep buying these supplements over and over again new supplement Brands launch every five minutes but the real question is why the heck do people keep buying these anyway when in reality there is very very limited research if any to suggest that they actually work a lot of people anecdotally report that they feel as though their hair looks better when they take certain supplements their nails are smoother shinier and their skin is glowier so they taking them because after all it like I because it doesn with the same if not many more issues that medications can come with what the heck constitutes a hair skin and nail supplement anyway the legal definition for a dietary supplement is as follows that of an ingestible product containing a dietary ingredient but one that is not marketed as a conventional food or sole item of a meal or diet supplement is a pretty broad category to say Hair Skin and nail supplement it could include at least 85 000 different various and Sundry ingredients supplements are not regulated as drugs they foods and I know what a lot of you are thinking great I don I don trying to avoid I hate the FDA I don want that I just want something all natural because supplements are not regulated as drugs there the manufacturer to demonstrate safety or efficacy of their product prior to selling it to you whereas a drug has to demonstrate these things with supplements there are no restrictions on the doses of a given vitamin or mineral that are used in the final formulation even for nutrients that have tolerable upper intake levels a tolerable upper intake level of a given nutrient is basically the maximum dosage that is thought to be safe and not have any adverse effects for the general population but a supplement is free to exceed these tolerable upper intake levels and could potentially be including doses so high of given vitamins and minerals that they do start posing risk but because they regulated as drugs they are free to do that in contrast to drugs supplement manufacturers can mix and match different ingredients and they don actually have to do any leg work to show that it different ingredients and it to either inactivate the ingredient or it for various harm you see with drugs with medications we know that certain drug combinations can lead to Adverse Events either drug alone is perfectly safe when dosed appropriately but when taken together they can have negative effects on the person drugs slow down the metabolism of other drugs making those other drugs now toxic at a otherwise safe dose or some combination may make it so that other things in the formula are not absorbed properly supplement manufacturers also don interactions with their supplement and medications while supplement manufacturers are expected by the FDA to comply with what manufacturing practices in reality they don are doing that but what constitutes a hair skin and nail supplement anyway if you go out into the vitamin stores Target Etc you heterogeneity out there in terms of what nail supplement a lot of them a lot of them have very high amounts of biotin in them many of them may have collagen peptides some of them have hyaluronic acid some of them have ceramide various in a sundry antioxidants in combination let with hair skin and nail supplements that you should factor in before deciding that you are willing to give any Hair Skin and nail supplement a go number one is drug dry interactions meaning the supplement might interfere with any medications or other supplements that you might be taking and that potentially could put You In Harm can interact with medications they can interact with other supplement ingredients supplements can interact with lab tests so when you go to the doctor and the doctor draws blood they send that blood to a lab to test it for things some supplements can mess up the ability of the lab to properly and correctly test the blood for certain things leading to potentially misdiagnoses we have come to learn that high amounts of biotin which are commonly found in many Hair Skin and nail supplements actually interfere with the accuracy of lab tests that your doctor might order to check your thyroid hormone or to check to see if you are having a heart attack anytime you are prescribed a medication you want to make sure you have disclosed all supplements you are taking say you end up in Urgent Care with a sore throat the doctor going to write a prescription for an antibiotic supplements you are taking could potentially interfere with that antibiotic a study published in 2000 in the landsat a highly respected medical journal they identified more than 1400 unique interactions involving over 200 supplements so the potential for interactions with medications and supplements is quite great problem number two with hair skin and nail supplements is teratogenicity what the heck is that teratogenicity refers to substances that cause fetal abnormalities when ingested during pregnancy in contrast to drugs supplements are not required to categorize their pregnancy safety and there there on the safety of Any Given supplement in pregnancy or breastfeeding as a side note if you pick up a supplement the majority of them do say something to the effect of if you are pregnant or nursing consult with a doctor before consuming but the majority of them don of consuming the supplement during pregnancy for example who here has heard of the drug finasteride I have a whole video on it finasteride is a medication given to men for pattern hair loss it belongs to a class of medications known as five Alpha reductase Inhibitors but if you gave finasteride to a pregnant woman it can cause fetal abnormalities namely abnormal genitalia in male babies well dance on into the Vitamin Shop then and pick you up a hair skin and nail supplement that has saw palmetto in it guess what saw palmetto does it is a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor so it carries the same risk of fetal abnormalities that finasteride does furthermore we don harms to the developing fetus that can come with taking very high doses of given vitamins or nutrients like I said certain vitamins and nutrients that have established upper limits of daily consumption that you know for the general public are considered safe but that about what consuming Mega doses of those could be in terms of harm to fetal development a lot of hair skin and nail supplements might have high levels of zinc there is an association with high zinc in the cord blood and neurodevelopmental problems now of course Association does not prove causation but that is merely to illustrate that there is always the potential that taking high amounts of things could be harmful the other vitamin that is often included at high levels that could be potentially dangerous for pregnant women is vitamin A you will often find high levels of vitamin A and Hair Skin and nail supplements I mean we have a lot of medications that are related to vitamin A and they are not safe to take during pregnancy like Accutane a study looking at women who took over 10 000 international units of vitamin A a day one in 57 had a fetal abnormality and this is most actually common in the first seven weeks of gestation which unfortunately is a time when a lot of women don pregnant problem number three is the risk for drowsiness a lot of hair skin and nail supplements will piggyback as a nighttime supplement and will add melatonin now melatonin is a hormone it to allow people to go to sleep you know it can be helpful for people who work swing shifts but taking very high amounts of it actually can be problematic to your sleep and cause drowsiness and so you have to read labels carefully there are definitely Hair Skin and nail supplements out there that that pair high amounts of melatonin with various in a sundry other ingredients alleging benefit for Hair Skin and nails and they be taken at night time I also have concerns with these high amounts of melatonin in these types of supplements in terms of drowsiness for older adults older adults they risk for Falls problem number four with hair skin and nail supplements is the potential to overdose toxicity people people want to shy away from medications they view them as you know potentially toxic but toxicity most certainly can occur with dietary supplements some supplements can put you at risk for something called milk Alkali syndrome which is basically a situation where you have very dangerously high calcium you have kidney problems the pH in your body is not is not where it needs to be it called a metabolic alkalosis excessive consumption of selenium can be actually quite toxic taking too much of it uh can lead to brittle nails and hair breakage it also can cause nausea vomiting diarrhea high amounts of selenium is associated with an increased risk of diabetes and all-cause mortality higher is not better we talk about this a lot when we talk about skin care products things that we put on our skin but the same applies for things that we take into our body you definitely can have too much of a good thing where it starts to not only have diminishing returns but can be toxic effect high amounts of certain antioxidants definitely have been actually associated with an increased risk of cancer despite how you know beneficial antioxidants are in our body for combating against stressors that put us at risk for cancers taking too much in can actually skew things in the wrong direction a randomized controlled trial actually of a dietary supplement that included vitamin C vitamin E beta-carotene selenium and zinc women taking this after seven and a half years the incidence of skin cancer was actually higher in the women taking the supplement as opposed to controls problem number five is allergenicity people can be allergic to certain compounds and supplements uh you know and presumably you know that going in but it issue to factor in uh is is that specifically as it relates to the collagen supplements because the collagen supplements are often derived from either fish pork or beef it you have existing allergies to those you really really need to be careful there actually have been reports of anaphylaxis which is a life-threatening allergic reaction to collagen peptides problem number six is quality there really really low barrier of entry into the supplement Market uh like I said no one is policing the supplement manufacturers at length to make sure they practices they don safety or efficacy they really don have to do much I mean shoot there are a lot of influencers who launch their own supplement brand uh okay like with no background in Pharmacology whatsoever and that have supplement brands are just in it for the cash although it is a lucrative business uh you know some of them may be partnering with people who are highly highly knowledgeable and adhering to good practices so I paint everyone in a bad light but just something to be mindful of there is a very low barrier to entry into having a supplement whereas a drug in order to get a drug to Market we has to be shown efficacy data I mean you name it that people don they come with a pamphlet that is terrifying to read but don because there supplement that the potential harms are not there it give you any pamphlet the FDA can only be inspecting a small fraction of all the supplement manufacturers out there I mean the FDA is very limited in their resources to be doing this in 2019 they investigated 560 factories they issued letters of non-compliance to over 50 percent of these some of these who were issued warnings were Hair Skin and nail supplements so there is a good chance that the Hair Skin and nail supplement you may be interested in is not the best quality um there as far as quality issues there can be dosing inconsistencies recently I did a whole video shedding light on dosing inconsistencies with the Melatonin gummies Melody in gummies being found at a very very high amount if you I highly suggest choosing one that has undergone third-party quality testing some of these parties include office of dietary supplements uh USP United States pharmacopia NSF uh or consumer Labs so you know I don industry as just problematic tainted whatever there are really good brands out there of supplements that do right by their ingredients they have them third-party tested and the third party testing basically ensures that what the label is what you getting a recent study looking at Hair Skin and nail supplements only about 3.4 percent of them actually undergo third-party testing so always look out for that on there claims get nebulous when we they can can they can or correct or prevent or diagnose any given health problem so for example a hair skin and nail supplement cannot be like this is going to to treat alopecia this is going to prevent pattern hair loss they can but they can make Health claims they can make structure function claims and then they can also make claims around the nutrient content in in their product in the absence of biotin deficiency there no data to show that taking biotin is helpful for hair high amounts of biotin can interfere with blood work and a lot of people actually report that they get these acne-like breakouts with with biotin it can cause digestive upset zinc can interfere with the absorption of copper you can become copper deficient from taking too much zinc so you need to be careful and conscientious of these potential risks always disclose with your health care provider that you taking and you there a supplement to treat a deficiency or insufficiency so you know biotin deficiency is super super rare but in the cases that it does occur yeah the treatment is going to be biotin but for people who don uh you know to say that it to take there a huge difference many people will say I prefer to try a supplement before a medication because it more natural but is it you know these supplements they are synthetic ingredients in most cases and not to say that there but as a friendly reminder many medications are also natural substances Pacific yew tree who wants to take that that sounds all natural yeah that taxol paclotaxal a chemotherapeutic no thank you and if I am going to take that it and the only person I want giving it to me is an oncologist who knows how to dose it properly because that bad boy can have a lot of adverse effects but you know it natural box glove a plant that get digitalis from I because I don I took that it health but other people need it benefit from it with supplements we there this gray territory we don would actually benefit from it who going to be harmed by it a lot of people don know quote unquote big Pharma they don you know want to give money to the pharmaceutical industry and I totally understand that I mean we left and right with advertisements for various in a sundry drugs I mean it definitely like I totally understand where people are coming from but on the flip side like so why are you willing to give your money to to to Big supplement because they well something to think about all right guys so those are the problems that you can run into with hair skin and Nails supplements by and large I don that hair skin and nail supplements are necessarily beneficial you know I don push people to to go after them I think uh you know it area with very little research and regulation behind it do I think all supplements though are bad heck no I mean if you know me you know I actually take several supplements myself I definitely not the most conservative when it comes to supplements you know and I do see a role for them especially in certain situations and for certain individual visuals but I video because I want you guys to be aware of the limitations and the problems with supplements and maybe that can help you make more of an informed decision moving forward as to whether or not you them out your willingness and hopefully this makes you more keenly aware of and willing to talk to your doctor about supplements which I think you know goes a long way uh talking to your doctor about the supplements that you make sure they know you don using a supplement with a medication that could have a deadly consequence for you all right guys let me know in the comments have you ever tried a hair skin and nail supplement which one did you think it worked do you still take it if you guys enjoyed this video make sure you check out my video reviewing biosil and comparing it to biotin so check that one out next it but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe I bye thank you [Music] foreign [Music]	Success
BEST HAIR GROWTH SUPPLEMENT? ?? *BIOTIN VS BIOSIL*	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o00xuoT_8Oo	Dr Day	well hey guys in today going to be doing a deep dive on a hair skin and nail supplement biocil what the heck is it does it work should you be taking it is it safe is it effective the Hair Skin and nail supplement industry is booming I mean they are money makers out there tons of Hair Skin and nail growth supplements on the market the majority of which have actually high levels of biotin now I have a lot of videos on this channel about biotin supplements while there is a small amount of research to suggest that Biotin supplement may be helpful for those of you who deal with brittle nails there support taking Biotin for hair growth or for the skin in the absence of a confirmed biotin deficiency which by the way is super super rare not only that taking high levels of biotin actually can interfere with the accuracy of certain blood tests like blood tests that your doctor might order to check your thyroid or to check to make sure you cell is a different type of hair skin and nail supplement it contains the ingredient radiant choline stabilized Ortho salicylicic acid which is a form of silicon silicon is a very abundant element found throughout the body and various tissues including your hair your skin and your nails the main source of silicon in the western diet is actually cereal grains followed by fruits and then vegetables truthfully the role of silicon and the hair at the skin and the nails is not completely understood but it in producing and maintaining healthy collagen it the enzymes involved in making collagen it of glycosaminoglycans which are part of the deeper layers of the skin and all of these things together are what give the skin elasticity hydration suppleness keep the skin firm bouncy and elastic now you all know from my videos that as we get into our wiser years the amount of collagen that we make starts to decline and of course various in Sundry environmental exposures namely ultraviolet radiation destroy our collagen and ultimately this contributes to the signs of skin aging including the formation of wrinkles and Fine Lines silicon can be found in the hair strands and hair strands that have a higher silicon content tend to appear brighter more lustrous silicon is also a predominant mineral found in the nails and one might posit that inadequate levels of silicon perhaps in the diet could lead to soft brittle nails while you can get silicon from your Foods there is some question about the amount that is absorbed properly the bioavailability to be absorbed in the body the silicone in our Foods had has to be solubilized by the acids in our stomach and we know that as we get into our wiser years we have problems with stomach acidity so perhaps with age we are not as able to absorb silicon from our Foods in order for silicone to be absorbed from our Foods it has to be solubilized by stomach acids to Ortho salicylicic acid so silicon supplement menu manufacturers they have a few hurdles to overcome very high concentrations of Ortho salicylicic acid they be challenging for the body to absorb so in order to slow this down or prevent this from happening they have to stabilize the orthosolic acid with something called choline choline stabilized orthosolic acid actually has been investigated in several studies and has been demonstrated to show very good absorption into the body studies show that choline stabilized orthosolic acid not only does it have good availability meaning it gets into your body when you ingest it but it also can be taken safely across the studies that have been done on this ingredient on the supplement there are no reports of any Adverse Events no interactions with any blood tests no safety concerns now bear in mind we don on this but the research that we have definitely suggested it the choline aspect of choline stabilize orthosilicic acid may actually exhibit some degree of synergy meaning making the orthosolic acid work better because choline is actually a phospholipid that is important in a variety of processes it signaling okay that to be absorbed doesn associated with any adverse effects does it actually do anything though for our hair skin and Nails I mean there theoretical benefit from taking it but is there any actual research on biocell unfortunately the research that we have with biosil is going to be sponsored by biocell right so you kind of have to take it with a bit of a grain of salt and there but let there was a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial done in 2005 that looked at 50 healthy volunteers that they didn problem they didn or nail disorder these volunteers range from age 40 to 65 and the one thing about them was that they all showed well visible signs of skin aging as we all do between the ages of 40 and 65 and Beyond it life in the study they took two capsules daily 10 milligrams choline stabilized orthosolic acid or Placebo for 20 weeks again importantly throughout the study there were no Adverse Events reported no side effects the study looked at skin surface characteristics and mechanical strength they used non-invasive tests things like corneoma tree which measures skin hydration and they show that the group getting the choline stabilized orthosolic acid biosil at the end of the 20 weeks they had an improvement compared to Placebo in the skin surface Improvement in skin hydration this was statistically significant however if you actually look at their graphs it of underwhelming in my opinion at 20 weeks like it huge change it different just because something statistically significant doesn that it also have to bear that in mind this the study also showed a significant Improvement in hair and nail fragility I like that the study monitored blood work at Baseline and then again at the 20 weeks and didn in blood work you know that kind of suggests further that this is a safe supplement at least in the 20 weeks that they were taking it but it would be better if they had taken some skin biopsies some actual histology to actually show is there really any meaningful change in the deeper layers of the skin to suggest perhaps this Improvement that they kind of a biologic basis likewise I would have liked to see a nail clipping or a hair clipping to really look at the Integrity of the hair before and after supplementation in the group versus the placebo to really see if there again true structural difference biologic difference between the groups moving on though in 2007 there was another randomized study this time with 48 volunteers ranging in age from 18 to 65. again these were otherwise eyes healthy women they all had fine hair they also excluded women who had had any hair color treatment had their hair bleached or permed they were randomized to get 10 milligrams daily of the choline stabilized orthosolic acid for nine months or Placebo interestingly they showed a decrease in the elastic gradient in both groups at nine months so a kind of a decline in hair elasticity however the group getting biosil that decline was much much less uh but it otherwise healthy women showing a decline in hair elasticity they don have any hair disease uh and if we weren have been bothered by a you know supposed decline in hair elasticity furthermore there was a large decrease in the brake load the load required to break the hair of those getting Placebo whereas that uh decline in brake load was much loss in the group getting biocell there was also an improvement in the cross-sectional area of the hair of those getting biocell compared to those not getting biosil but again it of strange to me like why are why is the placebo group why is there a hair like getting worse they lives they didn to begin with and if they weren through this study and having their hair measured like is this just normal day-to-day hair change the other major issue with this study is that they don really take into account if the people in the study are spending a lot of time out doors because UV exposure can weather the hair make it more prone to breakage and make it more brittle and so for that reason you know it that we there related to how the participants you know are spending their time in the Sun and in reality you know there really no difference fast forward to 2020 there is a smaller study not a randomized control trial this one is an open label single arm observational study looking at four different groups one group was labeled as having poor hair quality this was based on a photo finder tricho scale the second group had alopecia I alopecia although they don that the third group had a photo damaged skin the fourth group had brittle nails and these four groups they each were given by assault they took it twice a day for five months and then they were followed for an additional three months throughout this time hair thickness was increased in the groups with poor hair quality and alopecia and they do show some photographs that aren notable starting at Baseline and going all the way through the the eight months there was also a decrease in nail roughness and nail yellowing in the nail group The Nail Group also showed an increase in nail whiteness and nail smoothness so basically the nails are starting to look better since these people are taking biosil allegedly and there is an improvement in skin hydration now that you know but it controlled trial there group so you know but they are showing some some differences that match up with things that are shown in some of the other studies the major limitations in these studies is that basically there some differences in what there study to study again as I mentioned these studies are sponsored by the supplement maker it they with a grain of salt and you know they of the 2020 observational study they otherwise healthy people who don any medical issues they don hair problems they don problems and you know the study suggest they skin surface some improvement in nail brittleness and some improvement in hair hair strength tensile strength of the hair there quality or content there of the hair structure there analysis of the nail no nail clippings were done so it you know I would like those more biologic endpoints but you know importantly there is no reported adverse effect from taking biosil otherwise known as choline stabilized Ortho salicylicic acid so should you go taking this for Hair Skin or nail here opinion if you are having a problem with your skin with your hair with your nails if you having brittle nails nail breakage poor nail growth if you growth losing hair don supplement like this go see your doctor make sure you don health problems there on this channel about you know the hair signs of different nutrient deficiencies things like low thyroid can definitely impact your hair and your nails check out my video on nail changes with thyroid disease as a side note but as it stands now I would say this supplement you may notice some improvement just cosmetically in the way that your skin looks the way that your hair looks and the way that your nails look maybe your nails look brighter shinier smoother your hair is shinier maybe your skin is a little smoother more hydrated as it stands now that scenario that you might expect with this but if you have have an underlying health problem causing skin issues hair issues nail issues again I would not turn to this supplement to address that without first going to your health care provider as with any supplement you definitely want to talk to your treating health care provider before just diving in but as it stands now there don appear to be any drug drug interactions meaning it doesn interacts with any medication or causes any you know known side effects of course if you were allergic to any component in it you would want to avoid it but you know in contrast to the highly touted biotin there to my knowledge that this interferes with the accuracy of any blood work that you may be having in contrast to the collagen peptide supplements which we covered on this channel for skin for hair and for nails check out those videos in contrast to those choline stabilized Ortho salicic acid it non-animal derived so if you have allergies to fish pork beef or you just want trying to avoid animal products uh you know this is completely you know free of that there the formula another issue with biotin is that a lot of people find that the high biotin in dietary supplements that it actually triggers an acne-like breakout and that hasn not saying it know maybe it consider if you the appearance of your hair and you want to give it a try it for two months the off chance that it may just improve cosmetically the appearance of your hair your skin and your nails but again I would not look to this to correct any problems with the hair skin or nails and just because we don it know they rigorously studied as like medications uh you know there data with this so what I know today 2023 this is the knowledge that we have about this but you know we could fast forward years from now and all of a sudden you know someone starts finding lab problems with this or or something similar to the issues that you can encounter with biotin or you know people start developing digestive upset that wasn to you know what you can get with a collagen peptide that there so just things to keep in mind you know supplements they are they are a bit of a a wild west but this one you know it is fairly well studied in Trials albeit they I wanted to make this video for you guys because I do get a lot of questions about various and a sundry skin hair and nail supplements I cover biocil let me know in the comments though if you take this if you heard of it uh what your experience has been with it but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow bye [Music] thank you [Music]	Success
Beware of biotin for skin, hair, & nails #dermatologist @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71pm-3T72P4	Dr Day	biotin keratin vitamin C and vitamin E there solubilized keratin for nails and there for brittle nails in the absence of biotin deficiency there for taking biotin supplements for for skin or for hair and remember biotin can interfere with the accuracy of certain blood tests namely like those that are used to check your thyroid or if you want to stop a week before you to have blood work	Success
TOP 5 SUPPLEMENTS FOR NAILS ?? Dermatologist @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dLCyXHTHKQ	Dr Day	well hey guys for today going to be covering the top five supplements for your nails what are the best supplements to help strengthen the nails to help them grow better if you are somebody who the appearance of your nails you find that they are not growing at the rate that they once did they lot you watching this video because I be giving you some high-yield information about dietary supplements that are heavily marketed to people just like yourself nail growth is influenced by a lot of different factors genetics of course we can always blame everything on our genetics hormones especially your thyroid pregnancy certain medications you might be taking if you have an underlying skin condition it actually can especially true for psoriasis can leave the nails prone to breakage and affect their rate of growth now it should go without saying that nutrition is vital for growing strong healthy nails what you put in your body is going to show up in how your skin your hair and your nails look and feel and function dietary factors that are important for growing your nails include high quality protein and a variety of vitamins and minerals about 20 of the population suffers from brittle nail syndrome this is characterized by peeling nails and cracks at the end of the nail and it more than just a cosmetic thing it leads to symptoms of sensitivity of the fingertips and and actually can get in the way of how well you were able to achieve your activities of daily living just picking things up can be challenging when you have brutal nail syndrome it faulty adhesion between the cells of the nail the corneocytes those are the ones that are making the Keratin and when they don can get peeling and brittleness under normal conditions your nail should grow roughly two to three millimeters a month it nine months for your nail to grow out in its entirety but for some people they experience a slowing of that growth rate so I suggest if you are dealing with brittle nails for the first time you not happy with the rate of nail growth something has changed something is different definitely see your health care provider rule out some other underlying medical issue before just jumping to a supplement because there may even be something like a thyroid problem that needs to be addressed as a side note I have a video All About the Nail signs of thyroid disease so check that one now what are the supplements worth paying attention to or considering what are the ones where there research we have to talk about biotin biotin is involved in the metabolism of fatty acids amino acids glucose biotin is naturally found in egg yolks milk grains and nuts and The Institute of medicine recommends that you get 30 micrograms per day of biotin biotin deficiency is very very rare so the rationale behind the discovery of Biotin for nails actually started in research on pigs and horses like human fingernails hooves are made of keratin It nails and a study showed that in pigs with biotin deficiency when their feed was supplemented with biotin they had much improvement in the strength of their Hooves other Studies have shown an improvement in hoof growth rate and strength in both pigs and horses fed foods supplemented with biotin biotin is important for the production of keratin in the nail and it also holds together the cells of the nail giving strength and tension to The Nail itself now the first human study of Biotin for nails was done in 1989 they took 75 humans with brittle nail syndrome and gave them two and a half milligrams of biotin a day now of those 75 only 45 actually returned for follow-up and of those 45 who returned 41 of them reported definitive Improvement in nail firmness and nail hardness they didn really Define what they meant by definitive Improvement a placebo-controlled trial looking at a multivitamin with 45 micrograms of biotin showed that the individuals getting the multivitamin at the end of the 90 days of the study they had a greater nail growth rate in comparison to the placebo group however the multivitamin didn just have the 45 micrograms of biotin it had copper zinc magnesium so it to say it was adjust the biotin or was a combination of these things things a third study of 35 subjects with brittle nail syndrome 22 of them showed an improvement in symptoms of brittle nails so all in all we have three studies looking at biotin only one of which was Placebo controlled uh and that one there were a lot of other things going on in the multivitamin so suffice it to say while biotin appears to be promising for brutal Nails we really need more research to actually say that it anything of course that does not stop the supplement industry from making biotin supplements for Hair Skin and Nails despite such weak evidence so what is it safe to take biotin by and large biotin is safe to consume side effects include some upset in the stomach for some people some people find that it aggravates acne importantly high-dose biotin supplements can interfere with the accuracy of certain blood tests that your doctor might order such as your thyroid test or your vitamin D levels so it Biotin supplement that a you tell your how healthcare provider and B you need to stop taking the Biotin supplement a week before any expected anticipated blood work number two is collagen peptides collagen is a protein in our body that is essential for the supportive framework of our skin with age we lose collagen it in a variety of other tissues now recently I did a video All About collagen peptides for your skin do they actually work they do actually have some evidence albeit weak to demonstrate their efficacy for improving skin moisture elasticity smoothing out wrinkles but there that taking collagen peptides might actually help with nail growth an open label single Center trial 25 women took porcine AKA Pig type 1 collagen peptides for 24 weeks they took two and a half grams daily at the time of evaluation only 24 of the 25 women were available now all growth rate per month was measured from Baseline the nail growth rate increased each month 16 of the 25 had nail peeling that was moderate to severe at the start of the study and then as the study went along and they were taking the collagen peptides well that improved quite a bit at 12 weeks only eight of the participants had nail peeling that was moderate or severe and by 24 weeks only six of the 24 women had nail peeling that was moderate or severe so they also just looked at uh Improvement in the appearance of the nail they had kind of a grading scale they looked at photos 64 percent Global clinical Improvement after 24 weeks of collagen peptides and then that Improvement was sustained four weeks after stopping the collagen peptides in 88 percent now you always have to question what sort of outside factors were going on here and to influence the results they there suffice it to say this small research study begs the question well can collagen peptides help with brutal nail syndrome more research is needed what are the side effects of taking collagen peptides overall they tolerated you can have some gastrointestinal upset of course if you are allergic to fish pork beef you need to be careful because collagen peptides are animal derived and then peptides may be derived from one of these some people have headaches heartburn bloating but overall they are pretty well tolerated and there safety and efficacy of collagen peptides in breastfeeding or pregnancy number three solubilized keratin what the heck keratin is a protein that makes up our hair our skin and our nails what gives the nails strength is there any research for keratin for your nails not a ton but there is a small randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial looking at taking 500 milligrams of solubilized keratin a day plus B3 B5 B6 B8 zinc and copper versus placebo which was just a capsule containing maltodextrin uh and they took the either of these for 90 days and the researchers showed that there was an improvement in the tendency of the nails to break at 90 days in the group getting the solubilized Keratin plus B3 B5 B6 B8 zinc and copper versus the placebo there was also an improvement in nail strength in the study versus placebo importantly there were no Adverse Events so persuasive but not enough I mean the group getting the Keratin was also getting some other other things supplemented to them so it Keratin doing anything number four is choline stabilized orthostic acid this most popularly is sold under the brand name biocil now silicon is important for cross-linking of collagen choline stabilized Ortho salicylicic acid is a bioavailable form of silicon and of course choline is an essential nutrient in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial where participants got 10 milligrams of choline stabilized Ortho salicylicic acid a day for 20 weeks or the other group got just a placebo pill at the end of the 20 weeks the group getting the choline stabilized orthos salicylicic acid had a statistically significant Improvement in hair brittleness and nail brittleness compared to Placebo no Adverse Events were reported with a supplement it seems to be very well tolerated but more research is needed to know if it to take if it it methyl sulfonyl methane otherwise known as MSM now I have an older video where I go into detail about MSM as a supplement for your skin so check that one out I go into the research on its efficacy for a variety of skin concerns in that video what the heck is MSM it is a naturally occurring sulfur compound it present in our environment it plants and it so it diet now MSM is anti-inflammatory and it that taking MSM results in an increase in antioxidants in the body and these are important for handling free radicals that damage the proteins and lipids in our body and contribute to premature aging and damage furthermore it and MSM helps to stabilize the these disulfide bonds between the keratins in the nail and the hair and contribute to nail strength and reduce nail brittleness so there is one study looking at MSM for nails I took 63 women and they gave them either one gram a day of MSM or three grams of debt a day of MSM it weeks at the end of the study there was a statistically significant Improvement in the appearance of the nails as well as the appearance of the hair the participants agreed that their nails and their hair looked better taking the supplement now both doses showed Improvement like these other supplements MSM by and large appears to be safe and doses Max 4 grams per day but again in the study they three it doesn adverse side effects but again we just don are the top five most research-backed supplements for strong healthy nails now do I recommend any of these no I think more research is needed before knowing what the best supplement is who is going to respond supplements unlike medications they FDA so they can make a lot more claims and importantly they don demonstrate proof of safety or efficacy whereas a medication does so it for supplements to make their way in front of consumers without going through as much rigorous safety testing importantly you may have an underlying medical condition that is contributing to the brutalness of your nails that can be corrected by addressing the medical problem rather than pursuing a supplement supplements may seem safe but again they regulated and supplements don necessarily have to demonstrate the level of safety and efficacy that a medication would and not all supplements are without harm as we have come to learn you know the example I gave you with biotin interfering with blood work these five that I and large though they do appear to be safe I really hope you guys found this video useful in navigating the supplement aisle to know what supplement ingredients actually do have some research to back their efficacy for nails again it is pretty limited now on the end slate I video All About collagen peptides since that came up in today that one out next if you missed it but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe I bye [Music] thank you	Success
Do collagen supplements really work? ?? Dermatologist @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9CCMQKIASk	Dr Day	well hey guys the time has come for us to revisit the world of collagen supplements for skin hair and nails it been a long time and the other day I was doing a Whole Foods shop With Me video there were a ton of collagen supplements there of course and it got me thinking I kind of need to revisit the literature on collagen supplementation for skin hair and nails it last video was in January of 2019 and since that time there have been quite a few new papers published including a meta-analysis of the literature so we going to get into it in this video collagen is a protein if you take your body you pull out all the protein about 25 to 30 percent of that is going to be collagen collagen is really important for our connective tissues like bone ligament cartilage and of course your skin collagen consists of these three chains Twisted together in a rope referred to as the triple helix collagen is a building block it provides structural support and of course with age we lose collagen throughout our body so there collagen as a a supplement collagen supplements are not actually collagen but rather hydrolyzed collagen basically digested and broken down into something that truly can be absorbed in the digestive tract and believe it or not localized to the skin yes this does happen there are research papers showing that this happens hydrolyzed collagen and supplements is basically a collagen that is obtained from animal sources like chicken fish pork and it is hydrolyzed into peptides that can be absorbed in the digestive tract go through the bloodstream and localize to the skin there is a ton of Interest amongst consumers for taking collagen supplements for improving the visible signs of skin aging wrinkles Fine Lines if you were to wear collagen loss happens as a natural process of aging and then of course as a result of all of the things that we are exposed to on a day-to-day basis and our lifestyle habits influence our healthy collagen levels when you go out in the sun for example certain enzymes in the skin get activated that chew up collagen this also can happen as you a result of exposure to environmental stressors and with age enzymes that chew up collagen also start to increase our ability to make new healthy collagen declines you get a buildup of degraded collagen in the skin and all of these things culminate together in some of the visible signs of skin aging like loss of elasticity loss of elastic recoil loss of volume a decrease in epidermal thickness and a decrease in the ability of the skin to retain water and moisture content now as I mentioned several studies actually show that when you digest hydrolyzed collagen the collagen peptides they can go through the digestive tract get absorbed in the blood localize to the skin and studies suggest that there they can stimulate fibroblasts which are the cells that make collagen to do so to make new healthy collagen this also results in improved skin hydration and improves skin elasticity the end result of all of this of course the goal is to have a smoothing out of wrinkles and fine lines now it cosmetic effects people tend to focus on that as it relates to aging but with loss of the supportive framework our skin which is our largest organ the barrier to the outside world it becomes more vulnerable to tearing to infection and is a lot slower to heal so with our aging population we have more people who are going to be elderly in the ensuing years to come this actually has potential as an intervention for people who for example may be hospitalized and are older and more vulnerable to skin damage skin infections and poor wound healing as it relates to medically necessary procedures now in my last video which was in January of 2019 so four years ago I do believe I mentioned that if new research came about I would definitely update you so here I am updating you since that time we now have a systematic review and meta-analysis looking at the effects of hydrolyzed collagen supplements on the signs of skin aging this paper and identified 19 double-blind randomized controlled Trials of 1119 individuals after the all these studies and took a close look at them Unfortunately they are very heterogeneous meaning they differ a lot in the approach that they took to evaluate hydrolyzed collagen makes it challenging to draw conclusions but not completely irrelevant they vary a lot in terms of the dosage of hydrolyzed collagen that they use studies range anywhere from using 372 milligrams a day upwards to 12 grams a day of hydrolyzed collagen they use different concentrations different formulations meaning the formulas have other ingredients that all vary the studies differ in the sources of collagen too some use chicken some use pork some use fish collagen and they differ in collagen Administration some of them look at liquid and some of them look at solid taking a step back though the participants in most of the trials receive anywhere from Two and a half to five grams of hydrolyzed collagen over the course of 8 to 12 weeks despite the heterogeneity and how these different trials were done the vast majority of them actually do show Improvement in skin elasticity as well as a reduction in facial wrinkles as far as expectations in terms of the timeline beneficial effects of hydrolyzed collagen supplementation were seen at 60 days and 90 days into supplementation and importantly The Beneficial effects were maintained 30 days after stopping like I said though while improving skin elasticity and wrinkles may sound like a nice cosmetic benefit there are other advantages of this specifically in elderly frail populations of hospitalized adults and interestingly enough this meta-analysis identified a study in which elderly frail individuals in the hospital who are given hydrolyzed collagen supplements they did show an a decrease in skin fragility and Improvement in healing surrounding certain procedures like as I said at the beginning of the video the Aging population is increasing and increasing and increasing and skin fragility becomes even more of a focus as we get into our wiser years it system it our organs there that accumulates with age the older we get the more that wear and tear is going to impact our overall health and you can definitely see that firsthand and hospitalized older adults especially and when they have skin fragility not only do they not heal well but they prone to skin infections have significantly more adverse Health outcomes in the hospital and I have to emphasize this is an organ system we talking about this is an organ system keep it functional as long as possible so it could be something that could help older frail individuals in the hospital later on down the road but more research definitely is needed but from a cosmetic perspective this is also looking promising you know we have more studies than we did back in 2019 when I originally talked about this showing Improvement in skin elasticity and overall decrease in facial wrinkles well don some limitations still to this day to the studies that we have that make them not necessarily General sizable and they leave some things that remain to be determined importantly in these studies there overall collagen supplements are pretty well tolerated meaning if you choose to go down this this path seems as though the adverse effects side effects are pretty low in the studies none were reported but we do see people developing some adverse effects namely around digestion diarrhea upset stomach heartburn and in some cases people develop headaches now if you have allergies say to fish you need to be very careful going down the path of collagen supplements because a lot of them are derived maybe from fish or pork something you might be allergic to so you have to really be careful in that case that you supplement that is derived from an animal that you are allergic to it also important to point out that we don collagen supplements in pregnancy or in breastfeeding so we don collagen supplements are safe for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding now from this meta-analysis something that was interesting one study showed no improvement in skin hydration with collagen supplements but this particular study actually looked at the underside of the arm whereas most of the other studies are looking at areas like say for example the crow typically get wrinkles and this is interesting because the underside of the arm is relatively protected from external factors that lead to extrinsic aging like radiation and pollution the underside of our arm gets a lot more protection it doesn and maybe the effects of collagen supplementation are going to be more dramatic more noticeable have a bigger effect in areas where you have a lot of sun damage or a lot of exposure as a whole to environmental stressors that contribute to extrinsic skin aging there are still a lot of limitations though to the studies that we have most of them are using commercial preparations that unfortunately are not Jaws hydrolyzed collagen they have other things like vitamins minerals antioxidants for example coenzyme Q10 and or hyaluronic acid all of these other in ingredients in these supplements could be influencing the outcomes or maybe exhibiting Synergy with the hydrolyzed collagen the other thing that difficult to tease out or say for sure from the studies that we have is does the impact that we skin elasticity and Improvement in wrinkles is that really does that really have anything to do with a true change in the collagen in the skin yes we know that these peptides can make their way to the skin but do we really have good proof that in human beings the localization of these peptides to that part of the skin is actually meaningfully impacting the collagen yes you these people show Improvement in wrinkles and Improvement in elasticity but is that merely due to Improvement in skin hydration you see a lot of these studies a majority of them don actually take skin biopsies and for that reason there this point really to robustly say that it leading to meaningful change in the dermal architecture it could merely be Improvement in skin hydration we see similar outcomes with some other dietary supplements which I have a video on and maybe I hyaluronic acid supplements have been shown to improve skin hydration and smooth out wrinkles likewise ceramide supplements have been shown to improve skin moisture content so are all these supplements really just really just improving skin hydration because maybe the subjects are just taking in more water as a result of taking supplements on a daily basis since the publication of the meta-analysis looking at all these different studies there is a newer randomized control trial of hydrolyzed collagen supplements that actually looks at echogenicity of the deeper layers of the skin using Imaging techniques and shows an improvement in dermal thickness so that actually doing something but again more research is needed and this was observed again 90 days into hydrolyzed collagen supplementation so that Lines skin elasticity skin fragility do you hydrolyze collagen supplements do anything for our nails so many collagen supplements will claim that they are helpful for your nails is there any truth to that there actually has been one small study that looked at people women specifically who have objective signs of brittle nails and who report having brittle nails the women range anywhere from 26 to 50 years of age so they took two and a half grams a day of porcelain collagen peptides from a pig after 12 weeks they had a statistically significant increase in the nail growth rate compared to Baseline and importantly that increased nail growth rate continued as it continued to take the collagen supplement they also had a self-reported Improvement in brittle nails and they had a decrease in nail breakage not the most rigorously done study but promising more research is needed to say to what extent if any taking collagen supplements are going to be beneficial for your nails I see a lot of people sing the Praises of collagen peptides and collagen supplements for hair growth how does that make any sense though your hair is not made out of collagen it made out of keratin protein now maybe taking collagen peptides provides more amino acids in your diet for building healthy strong keratin but really where the action of hair growth is happening is not from the strands per se but down in the scalp uh where you have the hair follicle and the hair follicle cells and all sorts of growth factors that come in and surrounding the follicle is collagen and that collagen supportive framework May influence and have an important role in the hair growth cycle so it it interesting it thought that taking collagen supplements if they providing a more supportive framework around the follicle allowing for better delivery of growth factors and things needed for healthy hair growth it merely theoretical at this point however we don all we don looking at collagen supplementation for any particular hair loss disorder or for hair growth there is one study looking at collagen Supple a collagen supplement for people who deal with chronic telogen effluvium telogen of fluvium is hair shedding it usually resolves once the stressful event that triggered it is addressed and goes away but in some people it goes on and on and on and it becomes chronic for them they chronically shed a lot of hair and this study it suggests that it might be worth looking into for people with chronic telogen effluvium but it doesn actually prove that it so all that to say more research is needed we really don looking at collagen supplements collagen peptides for hair growth now one question I get you know collagen supplements the supplement industry it important to know it like medications meaning you don necessarily know if you meaningful doses of things they subject to the same level of scrutiny and regulation as like a medication I always suggest if you with any kind of dietary supplement to always look for like third-party certification they basically help to verify that what the product is claiming on the label is actually what is in the product collagen supplements there huge market for them they can be pretty expensive so I get a lot of questions what about just taking gelatin uh like if we just took gelatin isn same thing unfortunately it gelatin is collagen collagen that has been degraded so you will get some absorption of of peptides and amino acids from degraded collagen but uh it not as bioavailable as the as the hydrolyzed collagen peptides the other thing that I see a lot is people like oh just drink bone broth for collagen there was a recent study that actually looked at the amount of collagen in in bone broth and it not what people are hyping it up to be you of collagen peptide from bone broth and by meaningful I mean comparable to what has been used in these studies suggesting Improvement in wrinkled wrinkles on the face face and skin elasticity you the the dosages that they they got you and as a reminder the doses range anywhere from 372 milligrams a day to 12 grams a day so the the amount of collagen peptide in bone broth pales in comparison to that not to say you can that it these supplements appear to that that is needed but I did need to update you guys as promised there are more studies out there let me know in the comments do you take collagen peptides if so is something that you have appreciated any skin hair or nail benefit I don said I saw a bunch of collagen supplements and Whole Foods the other day and I thought it would be timely to update my collagen video information so I hope this was of use to you guys if you enjoyed it on the end slate I going to put my video reviewing nmn a supplement that touts itself for longevity so definitely check that one out next if you missed it but if you like this video

??NMN Anti-Aging Supplement ?? WHY I DON'T TAKE IT @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Nq0OYLcNE0	Dr Day	if you have any interest in anti-aging and Longevity there is a good chance you have heard of the popular dietary supplement nicotinamide mononucleotide or nmn people selling nmn supplements allege all sorts of health benefits for anti-aging longevity even benefits for exercise performance but does it actually work in this video we to do a deep dive all about nmn as a dietary supplement and hopefully by the end of the video you this actually worth it or is it just another overhyped supplement what the heck is nmn nicotinamide mononucleotide it is a precursor for something that is super duper important for the cells of your body known as NAD NAD or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide it is essential for cell function it plays a vital role in energy metabolism and how cells respond to stressful events an expression of different genes and importantly it is key for repairing damage to your DNA nnnnn is a precursor for NAD but it A.D is synthesized from a variety of precursors L-tryptophan nicotinic acid nicotinamide nicotinamide riboside and nmn how these different precursors are made into NAD occurs through a variety of different Pathways we do too much of a deep dive into those NAD levels decline with age research suggests that nmn levels also decline with age although lifestyle factors may impact levels of nmn some studies suggest that in active older adults there are better levels of nmn in comparison to those who are sedentary we also know that aging can compromise one people who have different age-related conditions like diabetes liver disease they appear to have lower levels of nmn and NAD you see aging as a natural process is characterized by a decline in energy production from the mitochondria in various organ systems like the pancreas adipose tissue liver skeletal muscles as it relates to decline in NAD level now I know the term anti-aging can be off-putting like you know anti-wrinkle creams and that sort but anti-aging medicine is a really important area of research because the proportion of people on this planet over the age of 65 is growing and with a growing aging population comes more age-related disease as a whole things like diabetes and heart disease liver disease these things become even more common as we get older and with more people getting older we need to make sure that we are advancing medicine in a direction that addresses those needs that are going to be even greater in the future and current day so why the interest in nmn nmn is of interest because in theory it can improve levels of NAD and by improving NAD levels you may improve overall longevity NAD is known to activate certain proteins that help in repairing damaged DNA improvements in NAD levels may also have a protective effect on the brain you see the cells that make up your brain they have a high energy demand NAD is really important for how these cells handle stress and that could have implications for neurodegenerative diseases things like Alzheimer in the realm of investigating heart disease specifically in research looking at Mouse models NAD can help improve arterial dysfunction that is associated with heart disease with age comes an increased risk of cancer the longer you live the greater the chances of developing a cancer a lot of cancers develop as a result of cumulative changes to proteins and DNA and that sort of thing so the longer you live the more of that has accumulated the greater the chances that you to develop some form of cancer and increasing NAD levels may have a protective effect by reducing oxidative stress and helping with repairing damaged DNA there for protecting with muscle function decline in muscle function as it relates to age it can have some negative impact specifically in increasing risk of fall falls in the elderly they with a significant morbidity lots of health care costs if we could prevent that by helping to improve muscle function maybe through improving NAD levels that would be a great great thing but does this actually work like should we all be taking this dietary supplement everything that I into this point has largely been done in cells in a dish and in animal models overall there research in actual humans there is some and we by and large as it stands now nmn to improve NAD levels in humans it very sparse in terms of the literature online you will see a lot of people take pre-clinical studies such as those done in animal models or cells in a dish and try and use those studies and the findings in those studies to extrapolate them onto humans in an effort to sell a supplement or some sort of cream you name it human metabolism is very different from that of a rodent and our lives are much different from a lab animal that lives in a cage and there are countless situations in medicine where animal studies look really promising and nothing came of them when we translated them to human use history is replete with examples of interventions and medications that looked really promising in Mouse models but then when we tried to translate them to humans and actual clinical trials they flopped they didn they had negative health effects multiple drugs have shown to be effective in Mouse models of Alzheimer disease but then when you actually give them to humans they don difference furthermore a lot of things that show promise in the pre-clinical stages end up being harmful in humans take for example beta-carotene supplementation sounded really promising but in actual human trials turns out that beta-carotene supplementation ended up being associated with an increased risk of cancers when it comes to nmn is a supplement so far or the research is pretty sparse in terms of being done in actual humans one study of post-menopausal women with pre-diabetes and overweight or obesity took 250 milligrams of nmn a day for 10 weeks and at the end of the study they showed an improvement in insulin sensitivity in their muscles one study looked at amateur Runners taking nmn supplement either 300 milligrams a day 600 milligrams a day or 1200 milligrams a day or Placebo for six weeks and at the end of the study the runner is taking nmn on top of their regular exercise routine showed an increase in aerobic capacity compared to Placebo importantly the higher doses of nmn seem to have a greater effect in comparison to the lower doses the Improvement was actually at the level of the muscle rather than the heart itself and the researchers speculated that the Improvement that they saw may have been related to an improvement in oxygen intake one issue in older adult adults is poor quality sleep and that in and of itself can end up leading to a variety of adverse health effects one study looked at nmn supplementation on older adults in terms of Sleep Quality they looked at Japanese adults over the age of 65 taking 250 milligrams of nmn a day for 12 weeks at the end of the study there was no improvement in Sleep Quality however those who took nmn in the afternoon did actually show an improvement in overall drowsiness and muscle responsiveness in comparison to Placebo or to those who took nmn in the morning suggesting perhaps there might be some benefit in terms of the timing with afternoon doses being better in terms of well at least drowsiness and muscle responsiveness so of these human studies that I you they Max look at 12 weeks and as it stands now there don adverse effects from taking nmn but I caution you that doesn mean we have ruled out that it has any adverse effects these are really short windows to be looking at something there here to say for sure what the law long-term safety of taking this on a daily basis is the other thing we don know about this drug is doesn drug drug interactions another NAD precursor nicotinamide I have talked about in other videos I below nicotinamide we know can interact with the medication carbamazepine so it that which is used for headaches and to treat epilepsy seizures that you avoid nicotinamide can have a negative effect on the metabolism of that drug and get too high and be be harmful to you we don supplement interacts with other medication these studies don any information on what the best Joe says we don curve in any of these I think these clinical studies raise a lot of important questions that really need to be answered before we can go about saying if this supplement is really doing anything a benefit sure there appears to be some short-term term improvement in select measurements in these select groups drowsiness in Japanese adults over the age of 65 muscle insulin sensitivity and pre-diabetic overweight or obese women and an improvement in aerobic capacity in novice Runners but what does this mean as a whole even though you have an improvement in muscle insulin sensitivity that telling us the whole picture here to what extent is that sustained does this end up having any long-term clinical benefit does it Plateau what optimal dose what types of patients will respond to this how does it compare to standard of care treatments and again what are the long-term side effects in the case of exercise and Runners you may conclude like oh this could be something beneficial in enhancing muscle performance and exercise performance but this paper doesn either they didn speed or intensity or recovery or anything of that sort do the effects Plateau at some point there lot of unanswered questions so don me wrong I think nmn shows a lot of promise it looks like an interesting supplement but suffice it to say it being hyped up on social media and it has been for a while as like at the fountain of youth everybody who talking it up has financial interest in nmn supplements it is in their best interest to make you believe that it is doing all of these things that we have no research to support that it actually does in actual human people as our population ages I boomers you are a population that is uh vulnerable to intense marketing for anti-aging because with age there do come a lot of different health effects and here in the states specifically that can be super expensive no one wants to spend their retirement or older adult years with all these health problems it is so smart to be thinking about your health in this way but don to anti-aging supplement marketing nmn while it shows promise the research simply does not support the claims that are being made about this dietary supplement but wait there exciting twist in the nmn story as of October 2022 here in the U.S the FDA has revoked nmn FDA had accepted nmn as a new dietary ingredient or an ndi as of October 2022 the FDA has revoked and amends ndi status meaning it cannot be sold as a dietary supplement any longer at least in the U.S why well because nmn has now been authorized for investigation as a new drug so it cannot be sold any longer and marketed as a food or supplement so of course the supplement manufacturers are all up in arms they hate this they feel as though it hand it commercial interests of big Pharma unfortunately but it also prevents unscrupulous individuals from bypassing FDA approvals to just sell something that has no proven benefit as it stands now it looks like their active ongoing trials looking at and a man for Alzheimer friedrich coca-19 and kidney disease the hope is that we can actually get some answers you know uh see does this actually work what are the health consequences is it actually beneficial and dose responses contrary to what the supplement sellers will tell you it your best interest that it not be sold as a dietary supplement because what if they find out that there are some adverse long-term effects is it actually banned though um here the FDA goes out and actually does something to enforce this there much that they people from selling nmn I think last year something similar happened with the dietary supplement and acetyl cysteine and was like oh no buy up all the anesthetical cysteine people who take that as a supplement but I mean you can still buy it so it know policies and things like that they enforced I think one company got served a letter from the FDA but other companies did not so they continued to sell it so only time will tell what the fate of nmn is going to be as a dietary supplement or as a treatment you know if the research ends up showing that nmn is indeed effective for things like improving muscle function having true effects beneficial effects on longevity I would imagine you know we get some really expensive drugs out of it you know drugs and pharmaceuticals here in the USA they are expensive maybe worry about that bridge if we ever have to cross it on the other hand you know you can look at something like fish oil which is uh something you can now get as a prescription but you can also still buy it as a supplement so there just because it goes through all of these hoops and hurdles and gets approval as a drug and goes through all the research and rigor a lot of times it it nmn is a dietary supplement really does anything so as far as I a waste of money I would not waste my time or money on nmn why I and as it stands now most of the research has been done in Mouse models cells on a dish and I just take that kind of risk based on human studies that are only you know Max 12 weeks and not relevant to me is there any way to increase nmn and NAD naturally focus on a healthy diet you can get this naturally from things like broccoli edamame of course it amounts but eat a well-balanced diet exercise can improve NAD levels it been demonstrated in older adults who are active and get good quality sleep to protect your brain your muscles your immune system all of that is key for fighting off Cancer and a variety of other diseases of older adults the problem with supplements is that they bypass all of of the the answering of those important questions and they just stick with what a mouse but like I said you selling a dish you all those questions are really important they really need answers before you could say to what extent this is going to be beneficial for you it hold off and stick to things that we know actually benefit you in terms of longevity like eating a healthy balanced diet getting good quality sleep and importantly moving your body and exercising regularly that important especially when you are I mean it something that older adults really need to make sure that they are not slacking on because there is a lot of morbidity that comes with loss and muscle mass and Mobility including an increased risk of Falls that can land you in the hospital for a long time going to the hospital it unfortunately you don in there there are lots of infections that you can be exposed to so you want to stay out of there in your older years stay active stay healthy you just have to do those things you just have to do them there magic pill there all right y talk about in today nmn I hope it now as a reminder I do have another video kind of related to this topic on another NAD precursor uh nicotinamide otherwise known as niacinamide the oral pill and its role in skin cancer prevention so definitely watch that video next I on the end slate you don it but if you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow bye foreign [Music]	Success
DERMATOLOGIST REVIEWS NUTRAFOL FOR HAIR GROWTH @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=radUJ8W2QuM	Dr Day	does the hair loss supplement neutrophone actually work and is it worth close to 88 a month of your money we hair loss is a very common issue and can be a source of significant distress and emotional turmoil now before deciding if a given hair loss supplement or intervention is right for you you need to understand that there are a lot of different types of hair loss each with its own specific approach to treatment some types of hair loss Will spontaneously get better on their own whereas others require specific interventions so the most important thing you can do in your hair loss journey is to see a board-certified dermatologist and get an accurate diagnosis as to what exactly is going on what type of hair loss you have in order to know if any given intervention is actually going to work for you one of the most common types of hair loss is androgenetic alopecia 85 percent of men will have some degree of androgenetic alopecia by the age of 50 and 50 of women will have some degree of androgenetic alopecia by the age of 60. this type of hair loss involves a sensitivity of the hair follicle to the Androgen hormone specifically dihydrotestosterone you why that deep into the ingredients in neutral fall neutral fall was launched in 2016 and has become one of the fastest growing hair growth supplements on the market nutrifall contains at least 21 different ingredients including their patented synergen complex which is a complex of different phytoactive compounds that have antioxidant anti-inflammatory stress adaptogenic and dihydrotestosterone inhibiting properties these phytocompounds include curcumin piperin tocotrienols ashwagandha and salt Palmetto let start with curcumin it anti-inflammatory found in turmeric curcumin has been shown to lower inflammatory cytokine levels that are thought to play a role in hair follicle regression curcumin also inhibits expression of the Androgen receptor on the hair follicle now when we about pattern hair loss androgenetic alopecia that they are very sensitive to the Androgen hormones namely dihydrotestosterone so by reducing the receptor levels on the hair follicles you might imagine that that could offer some benefit there in that condition where the follicle is sensitive to these hormones I mentioned piperine piperine co-administration with curcumin can increase the bioavailability of the curcumin significantly pippering comes from like black pepper while there are a variety of different types of hair loss it Crystal Clear that stress responses do play a key role in a variety of different types of hair loss the stress hormone cortisol coupled with micro inflammation at the hair follicle seems to play a key role in androgenetic alopecia I suppose this is why they have included ashwagandha what is ashwagandha it is a Botanical that contains steroid lactones that can modulate and decrease levels of the stress hormone cortisol specifically a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 10 ashwagandha did in fact show a decrease in cortisol as well as the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein along with blood pressure and subjective feelings of stress saw palmetto now saw palmetto is specifically of interest for androgenetic Alopecia because it is an inhibitor of the enzyme five Alpha reductase five Alpha reductase is responsible for converting the hormone testosterone to dihydrotestosterone it dihydrotestosterone that plays a key role in driving hair follicle miniaturization and pattern hair loss in both men and women this is very similar to the mechanism for the hair loss medication that is given to men with pattern hair loss called finasteride and in a clinical study of a hundred men with androgenetic alopecia they were given 320 milligrams of saw palmetto a day or one milligram a day of finasteride they took either medication daily for two years significant improvements in hair were noted in both groups at the end of the two years 38 percent of saw palmetto takers had an improvement whereas 68 of those taking the FDA approved medication finasteride showed improve men so finasteride clearly is better in comparison to saw palmetto as far as response however there are concerns with finasteride it side effect profile can include erectile dysfunction presumably saw palmetto does not do that or has not been shown to do that and so it is a more attractive option to many people and one they are more interested in pursuing because of a possibly more favorable side effect profile but research on saw palmetto for hair loss it intents and purposes saw palmetto is considered functionally related to finasteride for this reason it is advised that women not take saw palmetto during pregnancy because of the theoretical risk of birth defects I have to give credit to nutrifall for pointing this out on the website although you do have to go looking for it and they frequently asked questions but they don their supplement what the heck are tocotrienols tocotrienols are isoforms of vitamin E we know that vitamin E is a potent free radical scaven under it antioxidant so it may inhibit lipid peroxidation and help with hair follicle Health it also may help decrease the overall levels of oxidative stress in the scalp supporting overall scalp Health that we actually have any clinical evidence that talk of Trials do anything for hair it placebo-controlled trial of 38 patients with self-reported hair loss not specified type should a statistically significant increase in hair counts of 38 percent from Baseline in comparison to Placebo this was after eight months of taking a 50 milligram supplement that contained tocotrienols intocopherol another isoform of vitamin E A major limitation though of the study is they loss again like I said at the start of the video there are a lot of different types of hair loss out there some of them just give better on their own for example maybe some of these women had had a high fever at one point and developed a telogen effluvium they longer sick they went through the telogen effluvium a hair shedding and now things are slow and going going back how would you know this from the study there so that makes it difficult there a wide range of Ages presented in the study which is significant because as I to hair loss in women especially around menopause and subsequently thereafter hair growth slows down and you do have age-related loss and hair density some of the people in the study had patchy hair loss whereas others had diffuse so there it issues here this study only looked out to eight months as well so the long-term safety of taking something like this hard to say for sure and I will point out that there are studies to suggest that taking vitamin E supplements may actually promote the formation of some types of cancer namely lung cancer in people who smoke so just because it supplement does not mean it is completely safe and without any risk of side effects or harm nutrifall also has a variety of different types of amino acids amino acids can be found in protein there the building blocks for strong healthy hair but you should presumably be getting those from your diet it also has Marine collagen now Marine collagen has been examined a lot for skin hydration there is some evidence albeit weak that it can improve the moisture content of the skin reduce trans epidermal water loss to what extent it largely remains anecdotal at this point organic kelp which presumably is a source of iodine now of course iodine is important for healthy hair growth it should be something you readily obtain from your diet and unless you are iodine deficient you do need to look at iodine supplements with some caution high doses of iodine actually can trigger acne so that also has zinc now of course zinc is super important for healthy hair and skin I that zinc plays there critical for wound healing but in the absence of zinc deficiency or a confirmed zinc deficiency should you just be taking supplemental zinc there is some potential risk there namely of copper deficiency like most hair supplements neutrifall has high-dose biotin now biotin there actually improves hair growth thickness density in the absence of a confirmed biotin deficiency which outside of certain rare genetic diseases or in an individual who raw egg whites biotin deficiency is really rare and taking high-dose biotin it come to learn that high-dose biotin supplements actually can interfere with the accuracy of certain lab tests that you might get blood work specifically those taken to rule out if you a heart attack also those taken to evaluate your thyroid so always tell your doctor any type of supplement you may be taking nutrifall also has vitamin D now vitamin D deficiency has been associated with hair loss but to just take vitamin D supplementation in the absence of any kind of confirmed deficiency uh and to what extent that going to be helpful for growing your hair doesn research to support just taking vitamin D supplement for hair growth all right so those are some of the things that are actually found in neutral fall but does it actually work I mean that clicked into this video for um does the supplement as a whole does it actually work uh the research to support its efficacy is pretty limited but there are some studies albeit they are funded by the company so you have to take them with a grain of salt but what do they show a six month randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 40 otherwise healthy women ranging in ages from 21 to 65 pretty wide age range by the way with self-perceived hair thinning so we don hair loss they are actually dealing with androgenetic alopecia telogen effluvium alopecia areata the list goes on and on traction alopecia I digress four capsules a day of either neutrophil or Placebo those who got neutral all at 90 days should a 6.8 percent increase in the number of terminal hairs and a 10.4 percent increase at 180 days in the number of terminal hairs versus placebo only saw an increase of 0.07 percent at 90 days and 3.5 percent at 180 days days so their studies that it seems to be associated with an increased number of terminal hairs as early as 90 days there was also an increase in the number of velus hairs which are the little baby hairs little peach fuzz hairs versus placebo there was a decrease in those no difference in hair shaft diameter but the people who ended up getting neutrophone they were pretty happy 80 percent of the subjects getting neutral noted Improvement in hair growth versus only 46.2 percent of the placebo group the neutrophone group also noted some other things they felt like their hair volume had improved they noted new hair growth hair was growing faster improved Stress and Anxiety levels may be related to the ashwagandha improved Sleep Quality improved skin smoothness perhaps that collagen and improved quote unquote skin Health the majority of people in this study meaning 73.1 percent said they would recommend the supplement to a friend so they were overall pretty happy and felt like it was doing stuff some recent case series shows some more promising evidence in favor of neutral form a 52 year old woman who had failed topical minoxidil AKA Rogaine took neutrophil and noted an improvement in hair and density after seven months a 45 year old woman with diffuse pattern hair loss showed an improvement in hair density at four months a 37 year old male with the early stages of pattern hair loss and a very strong family history of pattern hair loss who had previously failed topical minoxidil he actually got a pretty good Improvement in hair growth from taking neutrophone as well as a decrease in hair shedding and then a 38 year old man with diffuse early thinning of the temples he showed an increase in hair density after three months of taking neutrophone another case series of four African-American females with either androgenetic alopecia or thinning hair or traction alopecia they showed an improvement in hair regrowth so those are individual cases that noted some improvement above and beyond what they had been doing previously but again with a lot of different types of hair sauce thinning traction alopecia I that but that can improve if you stop putting traction on the hair in those areas a lot of limitations here we also don their nutritional status where some of these people maybe not eating so well not getting in their nutrients and they experience a little perk from some of the vitamins and minerals but to what extent they needed to supplement could they just you know change up their diet these studies are pretty Limited in their generalizability the problem is the subjective inclusion criteria you just relying on people who have noticed that their hair is thinning but you don wide array of age ranges so a lot of different potential factors there and also that we don on their Baseline nutritional status maybe some of these people had an underlying vitamin mineral deficiency and you know correcting it with the supplement is really why they showed Improvement it are the side effects overall it appears to be safe most common Adverse Events are nausea bloating and diarrhea now if you want to avoid this because the collagen is Marine derived from fish and of course with the individual ingredients I already pointed out some of the potential risks iodine acne eruption biotin interfering with blood work high-dose zinc supplementation copper deficiency saw palmetto not safe in pregnancy although they do point that out on their website and to what extent all of these different compounds might interact or interfere with any medication that you something to talk to your doctor about because that the other thing to point out here is that the longest that these Studies have looked out is six months so to what extent these remain safe to take indefinitely on a long-term basis it hard to say for sure and it takes about three to six months to see results with Nutri fall you take four capsules a day with food and on the website they do say that you do need to continue taking them in order to maintain the results that you achieve with them so that can get not only cost per inhibitive so all that to say should you take neutrifall uh I can shouldn treating health care provider if this is right for you but I want to make it crystal clear that hair loss pretty big category of different potential causes each with their own treatments so getting an accurate diagnosis of what type of hair loss you key maybe you don loss and you just want to see if you can get thicker hair you that for you I but it possible but at what risk the long-term safety studies are just not there and supplements as I pointed out here they the end of the day it your choice on their website it ranges anywhere from 79 to 88 dollars a month my opinion of pursuing neutralfall especially without an accurate diagnosis of what you like just throwing the kitchen sink of nutraceuticals at your scalp and hoping that something sticks but not really knowing what are if anything in the formula is actually necessary or beneficial for you and bear in mind there are several different types of hair loss that spontaneously albeit slowly and do resolve on their own so don to the supplement it could just be the natural course of of the type of hair loss that you are dealing with and again that can keep you from shelling out close to 88 bucks a month on something that maybe you just don comments though if you have taken neutralfall did you see results were you happy with it I hope this video was informative to you guys and that you enjoyed it on the end slate I link my recent video All About oils for hair growth so check that out if you are interested but

TAKING ZINC FOR SKIN & HAIR ?? DERMATOLOGIST @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsqdDGkaMs8	Dr Day	should you be taking a zinc supplement for your skin for your hair and is zinc supplementation helpful for acne we are going to get into all of that in this video but before we do make sure you hit the subscribe button if you like skincare content from a dermatologist you notification too because that let you know when my videos go live zinc is an essential metal ion it does a ton of stuff for our body it function of a variety of enzymes that we need in order to live it plays a key role in our immune system it wound healing it has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that we need for good immune responses there are few situations in which zinc deficiency might arise i have a video all about the skin signs of zinc deficiency so definitely make sure you check that video out i to link it down below in the description box but there is a genetic condition called acrodermatitis eneropathica in which babies are born with the inability to properly absorb zinc and they develop a very painful uncomfortable dermatitis around the mouth in the diaper area they have diffuse hair loss adults can develop this as well in situations where they have low zinc in their diet poor intake or if you have an underlying medical condition that leads to poor zinc absorption or maybe you have an underlying medical disease in which you have an increased demand for zinc when people struggling with the skin and hair signs of zinc deficiency when they receive supplemental zinc these things just melt away zinc supplements can be delivered by zinc sulfate or zinc gluconate zinc sulfate has about 23 elemental zinc whereas zinc gluconate has about 14 elemental zinc zinc gluconate while it has less elemental zinc it on the digestive tract zinc sulfate also can leave a metallic kind of bitter taste in the mouth should people be taking zinc supplements for healthy hair growth just arbitrarily or if they dealing with hair loss is it a good idea to take zinc the studies that we do have for hair loss are restricted to alopecia areata which is a type of hair loss related to an autoimmune attack of the hair follicle which you get sudden patches of baldness the natural history of the disease course however for the most part is one in which those bald patches the hair regrows and goes back to normal those individuals can go on to develop bald patches in other locations it can affect the eyebrows the eyelashes but in the majority of cases the hair does regrow that being said there is there are some studies looking at zinc supplementation for this condition a double-blind randomized control trial of zinc sulfate 220 milligrams twice a day for alopecia areata showed that while the zinc sulfate group did in fact have an increase in their blood levels of zinc there alopecia areata there observational uncontrolled trial meaning no placebo looking at zinc gluconate 50 milligrams per day 67 percent had improvement while on zinc gluconate and of those who improved they had an increase in their blood levels of zinc however as i mentioned you know alopecia areata the natural history of the disease it can just spontaneously resolve and that case so it was the zinc or not suffice it to say these studies are small and insufficient to go recommending zinc supplementation for alopecia areata which is just one type of hair loss there are many types of hair loss the general public because of marketing tactics largely tends to lump hair loss into like one common issue when in reality it different types of diseases and conditions i several different types of hair loss on this channel you have androgenetic alopecia which is pattern hair loss related to our hormones you also have telogen effluvium or hair shedding and then you have a type of telogen of flu vam that we related to having covid you also have autoimmune hair loss alopecia areata which we hair loss hair loss related to underlying autoimmune diseases a condition called lichen plano polaris i mean the list goes on and on and on so when somebody says is this helpful for hair loss the follow-up question always needs to be what otherwise we huge umbrella term for which there are a variety of different possible treatments causes etc but all that to say that about it in terms of data from zinc supplementation for hair you really can firm conclusions based on these studies as to whether or not zinc supplementation is helpful for hair regrowth and any type of hair loss what about zinc supplementation for our acne since the beginning of my channel i always get questions about this is zinc supplementation a good treatment for acne the research is really conflicting there are about 12 studies all in all each using different doses and different forms of zinc of the studies six of them are actual randomized control trials and of those randomized control trials three randomized controlled trials actually do suggest that zinc supplementation does help with acne whereas the other three randomized control trials showed no difference the fact that there inconsistent dosing small sample size it just makes it very challenging to draw any meaningful conclusions to the value of taking zinc supplementation and it not without harm so we the end of the video but that is why a doctor a dermatologist we gonna say oh yeah take zinc because the studies are conflicting as to if it worked or not can you imagine if this was a pharmaceutical drug that your insurance had to cover they would never cover it you know it would never get approved with this kind of research now a condition that we this channel i called hidradenitis superitiva i know a lot of you guys deal with it it miserable to live with it these bumps that come up oftentimes under the arms or in the skin folds i mean really anywhere it what you have a lot of them in the underarm area and basically you get these painful lumps that then form sinus tracts that drain i mean it studies on 90 milligrams daily of zinc gluconate for hydroadenitis sapurativa one of the studies is uncontrolled and the other one is retrospective and in addition to oral zinc gluconate they also were using topical triclosan two percent which is an anti-microbial now both of these studies actually did show some symptomatic improvement in patients with hidradenitis sapurativa who were treated with zinc however there were side effects which we later on but uh again very small not a whole lot of research there but i have gotten questions from time to time what about zinc for hydroadinitis sapurativa sure there are these tiny studies suggesting that it may be helpful but it for taking zinc for hydrating sapirativa what about wound healing you know zinc is so important for good wound healing if you a surgery if you c-section and you want optimal healing if you for example or cosmetic procedure should you be taking zinc to optimize wound healing good question all right so there 20 men who underwent surgical removal of something called a pilonidal sinus and these men were treated with zinc sulfate 220 milligrams three times a day and showed they healed faster so promising but tiny study hard to say for sure if that are some other studies actually looking at the healing of pressure ulcers this is something that people who are not necessarily very mobile maybe because of illness a lot of times people living in nursing homes get afflicted with these and they to treat and to heal and there have been some studies looking at like nutritional supplements for healing these like dietary drinks that have a variety of minerals protein and zinc and these studies do suggest that this nutritional drink these nutritional drinks do help with faster with better healing of pressure ulcers they don difference though in the nutritional drink with or without zinc suffice it to say we actually need randomized control trials looking at zinc supplementation alone for wound healing before you could go making a recommendation to just take zinc so why do we not just like go taking zinc supplementation i mean surely it harmful right not exactly you definitely can have adverse effects to zinc supplementation for sure it can cause a lot of digestive upset it can affect the levels of certain immune cells cause what referred to as a neutropenia a leukopenia you can get iron deficiency copper deficiency taking supplemental zinc can actually interfere with copper absorption so you can get copper deficiency and anemia these are not good things so this is why in the absence of good data to support a rule for zinc supplementation for treating any of the conditions we talked about no germs just gonna say oh yeah take zinc supplements even normal doses of zinc can cause some upset stomach that people complain about and in the studies looking at zinc supplementation that we participants do report nausea you can go get vomiting diarrhea in young children you can actually have slowing down of growth as a result of too high levels of zinc even though it mean you can have too much of a good thing it you supplements can interfere with your blood lipids and cause lipid abnormalities obviously we use zinc supplementation to treat true zinc deficiency so for acrodermatitis enteropathica that genetic disease we don have to give very high doses to those patients they lack the transporter to uptake it properly but you can kind of overcome that with very very high doses so they are given three milligrams of zinc per kilogram of body weight per day for others with zinc deficiency who would otherwise absorb it properly otherwise known as acquired zinc deficiency anywhere from half to one milligram per kilogram of body weight per day is given but it zinc and go on your merry way and wait for things to get better there is monitoring that is required the blood zinc levels are checked every three to six months and then the dose of the zinc supplement is lowered accordingly so that you high amounts then the copper levels may be it may be necessary to check the copper levels iron levels and blood you know a full blood plant panel to make sure the adverse effects of neutropenia neutropenia aren of zinc replacement and people who have true zinc deficiency is to treat with the lowest effective dose so as to avoid these you know potentially harmful side effects so in summary sure there promising data looking at zinc supplementation for a variety of conditions but all of the studies are so small some of them show no difference and taking zinc supplementation it without harm you can again develop these adverse effects so that is why it recommended to take a zinc supplement for healthy hair and healthy skin and otherwise healthy people who have no problem absorbing it you should be able to get zinc from your diet now people who are at risk for a diet that is maybe lower in zinc are people who follow a vegetarian or vegan diet because plant-based sources of zinc often contain something called phytates which can actually lower the absorption of zinc so if you follow one of those diets you do have to be on top of your you know making sure that you plenty of good sources of zinc a very inexpensive clue to low levels of zinc is actually just the alkaline phosphatase it checked on like a liver function panel uh that is a zinc-dependent enzyme so if you have zinc deficiency that will start to drop all right y everything that i have to tell you about zinc supplementation for skin and hair now on the end slate i video on the skin signs of zinc deficiency so make sure you check that one out if you find this topic interesting but if you guys enjoyed this

THE SKIN SUPPLEMENT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ?? Dermatologist @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0QDCgSWCx0	Dr Day	well hey guys as you know there are a ton of supplements out there that make all sorts of claims about benefits for the skin things like collagen gummies hyaluronic acid tablets now i a lot of these supplements in other videos so definitely check those out but in this video we about a dietary supplement with actual good evidence to support its use for skin benefit if you are new here welcome my name is andrea i dermatologist if you like skincare skincare product reviews anti-aging tips consider subscribing or follow me over on tik tok or instagram i post on those platforms pretty consistently as well so what is this mystery supplement you speak of it is nicotinamide otherwise known as niacinamide yes that the b vitamin vitamin b3 which is in pretty much every skin care product these days i know you guys commiserate with me in the comments a fair amount on how niacinamide while a good ingredient in care products it seems to be something brands are just pumping in left and right and some people do find it irritating anyways i digress and if i use nicotinamide and niacinamide interchangeably throughout this video my apologies just know they mean the same thing vitamin b3 this is a water-soluble form of vitamin b3 and it important as a precursor for something called nad and nad is important in the process of repairing damaged dna so we biggest stressors that your skin has to deal with on a day-to-day basis is environmental stressors ultraviolet radiation pollution infrared radiation specifically ultraviolet radiation damages the dna in your skin cells and it also suppresses the immune system that circulates throughout your skin to kind of clear out damage and that is one of many reasons why sun exposure contributes to skin cancer formation later on later on in life it the immunosuppressive properties as well as the damage to dna nicotinamide is helpful for repairing damaged dna it anti-inflammatory and it inhibits that sun-induced suppression of the immune system in the skin where the heck do we get nicotinamide is it something that is in the water do we make it ourselves largely we get it from our diet you can find it in fish poultry legumes certain grains it foods and in nuts unless you follow an incredibly restrictive diet there is a good chance you are getting vitamin b3 in your diet so why would you need to supplement and is it even beneficial well turns out because nicotinamide is anti-inflammatory it has been studied in dermatology as a dietary supplement for a few skin conditions namely a condition which we won for time is a blistering disease that often affects older adults it can be triggered by medications in combination with another anti-inflammatory together can help treat that condition which is a blistering disease because niacinamide can help in repairing damaged dna as well as putting the brakes on that uv mediated immunosuppression in the skin it has been examined in clinical trials as a supplement to perhaps mitigate skin cancer formation older adults who have a lot of sun damage they make this skin lesion called an actinic keratosis and actinic keratosis is a precursor to a skin cancer the more actinic keratosis that you have the greater the risk that you will have skin cancer and it kind of a reflection that you lot of sun damage going on and those patients often have to come in more frequently for skin checks and have these actinic keratosis frozen off and removed anyways so a clinical clinical trials have been done looking at nicotinamide 500 milligrams twice a day for four months and people who have a lot of actinic keratosis at the end of the four months people getting nicotinamide in these studies had statistically significant fewer actinic keratosis in comparison to people getting the placebo in addition to having a lot of sun damage another group of people who are at a greater risk for forming skin cancers are people who have had organ transplants because they are taking medications that suppress their immune system so they not able to clear out those damaged cells in the skin as well because of that they are at a greater risk for forming skin cancers and they often make a lot of these actinic keratoses so one study looking at this population of people getting 500 milligrams of nicotinamide again twice a day for six months at the end of the study those individuals had statistically significant fewer actinic keratosis now i keep saying 500 milligrams twice a day and one of the studies they actually looked at taking it once a day and while the once a day dosage did decrease the number of actinic keratoses relative to placebo is not as much as taking it twice a day now once you make a skin cancer like a squamous cell carcinoma or a basal cell carcinoma your risk of making another one is quite high and that is why once you make one and have it removed you have to keep going back to the dermatologist to have skin checks to monitor for new ones coming up so in one study people who had already had one non-melanoma skin cancer they were enrolled in this trial given 500 milligrams of nicotinamide twice a day for a year at the end of the study there was a statistically significant decrease in the number of new actinic keratosis that these people were making in comparison to placebo but importantly that effect went away after they stopped taking it so bottom line taking 500 milligrams of nicotinamide twice a day may help in reducing the number of pre-skin cancers that people make who are at risk for making them however you have to keep taking it in order to maintain that benefit so once you stop you lose the benefit you to making the same number of actinic keratosis all right so that who make a lot of skin cancers you know they damage we of these studies were done in australia where the uv is quite potent what if you 20s your 30s you have never had a skin cancer before you sunscreen or whatever is this beneficial to you there that you need to be taking this um because you know it looked at in these populations who are at risk and again as i said it doesn doesn like sunscreen will so whether or not people who don skin cancers yet or have significant sun damage are are a transplant patient making a lot of skin cancers or pre-skin cancers it doesn necessary we don the research to support everybody taking it it supplement you got to buy it and like i said in those people for which this has been studied for they have to keep taking it in order to maintain those results so for just everybody to take it it may not be like the most cost-effective logical thing to do how safe is it to take nicotinamide is it dangerous is it harmful are there adverse effects that can occur yeah i mean you can run into problems with it for sure if you take very high levels um 500 milligrams twice a day appears to be very well tolerated with no side effects and so that is what is recommended to these patient groups however you definitely can run into dangerous side effects when taking very high doses you can get into toxic ranges if you take too much three and a half grams per day will definitely get you to toxic levels that can damage your liver so starting out you have elevation and the liver enzymes you can develop nausea vomiting headache it and it also can interfere with the platelets platelets are the component of your blood important for clotting and so if you have low platelets this may not be the best thing for you it could potentially interfere with that especially at high levels you know nicotinamide this is a dietary supplement but it drinks energy drinks and stuff like that so you can imagine how depending on your lifestyle and you know if you a lot of supplements you might actually end up running into the territory where you are getting to too high of an amount of this that is one problem with dietary supplements they lot of times you can get high levels of things and on you know unknowingly so same thing happens with b12 supplements you know i i have to take b12 because i am a vegan but uh some people take b12 and then they drink energy drinks with b12 added and then maybe they take some other kind of supplement that has b12 in it and too much b12 is associated with triggering acne for a lot of people and they just don realize how much b12 they are consuming so remember it dose if you don carefully you can easily get too much so that is one word of caution if you are like reading about nicotinamide or you know thinking about it first of all hasn benefit for just generally healthy people and second of all you can get to toxic levels uh and that can seriously damage your liver the other thing about nicotinamide supplements is that there is potential for medication interaction so if you take medications um definitely discuss with your health care provider before considering the supplement especially if you take the drug carbamazepine uh it is a medication some people with migraines take and some and it anti-epileptic medication so nicotinamide can interfere with the metabolism of that drug and make it get to too high of a level in your body so that is a potential adverse effect all right so you right like i i you that this is the end-all be-all there people who make a lot of skin cancers but young otherwise healthy people your focus should be on protecting your skin from the sun with sunscreen and sun protective clothing not sunbathing you there than in chasing after taking this as a supplement now i mentioned this at the beginning of the video kind of joking around about topical niacinamide or nicotinamide same same thing and you will find that in a ton of skin care products and it beneficial for a variety of skin issues when applied topically because it antioxidant so it kind of helps reduce the burden of oxidative stress in the skin upon exposure to environmental stressors and there is research in clinical trials looking at topical application of this ingredient for acne there percent niacinamide is as effective for moderate acne as one percent clindamycin a prescription treatment for acne there two percent niacinamide gel and showing that that decreases sebum production reducing oiliness and shine so the combination of reducing inflammation and reducing sebum output light likely explains why this is a beneficial ingredient for acne topical niacinamide also can help alleviate and improve some of the visible signs of skin aging it demonstrated when applied anywhere from two to four percent uh to help improve the look of fine lines red blotchiness likely because it also can improve the appearance of sunspots help them fade hyperpigmentation it can help fade and it can help in improving sallow yellow skin which is one of the visible signs of skin aging that you know people don don of the visible signs of skin aging they may ask things like complexion improving uh you know how to improve dull skin but part of some of the visible signs of skin aging is this actual yellowing of the skin due to damage of the underlying dermal components from chronic uv exposure kind of gives the skin a yellow appearance combined with a loss of elasticity topical niacinamide can kind of improve some of those some of those visible signs of skin aging so niacinamide may also be helpful for those of you who deal with rosacea because not only does it help calm down redness but it has been shown to improve skin barrier function so for people with rosacea a key issue that they deal with is this this problem with barrier barrier this barrier issue it makes them more sensitive to things that come in contact with the skin irritants that why a lot of skin care products are irritating to people with rosacea cleansers moisturizers burn and sting niacinamide if tolerated can improve barrier function and make the symptoms of rosacea likely better plus it anti-inflammatory which also benefits rosacea in terms of the bumps that people with rosacea get so it things however you know like i mentioned at the beginning of the video it in skincare products left and right at high percentages much greater than what has been examined in these studies and it can be irritating a lot of you guys comment in my videos gosh i cannot do niacinamide uh it burns it stings it causes irritation i do not get along with it and it is in everything these days i hear you there i mean you know it not right for everyone and not everyone gets along well with it and finding products nowadays that are free of it seems increasingly more of a challenge it a lot of cleansers um and it moisturizers all that to say uh oral nicotinamide is has been shown to be beneficial for people who make a lot of skin cancers at 500 milligrams twice a day it is safe well tolerated however people who have problems with their platelets or people taking carbamazepine should definitely exercise caution with this and you certainly can oral nicotinamide get yourself into liver damage that could be quite deadly for you applying it topically to the skin has several benefits provided you tolerate it all right y nicotinamide a lot of you guys have been asking me to talk about it for a while now there is another dietary supplement with quite a bit of research to support its use for skin benefit for hyperpigmentation improving sun damage from you know spending time outdoors and it is called polypodium so in the description box as well as on the end slate i i talk all about polypodium if you missed that definitely check it out if you were interested in dietary supplements with evidence behind them for their use and skin and skin benefit jeff definitely check that one out but if you guys like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen and subscribe i to you guys tomorrow

ALPHA LIPOIC ACID SKIN BENEFITS ?? DOES IT FIGHT AGING? @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LBaqYNIxnI	Dr Day	well hey guys get excited because in this video we about the skin benefits of alpha lipoic acid over the years i requests please talk about alpha lipoic acid what is the best dosage to take for anti-aging benefits how does it work for maybe reducing wrinkles and fine lines we video but before getting into it comment below have you actually heard of alpha lipoic acid there actually lurking in your skin care products and you are maybe not even aware that it possibly even doing anything but we going to talk about alpha lipoic acid not only in skin care products but in dietary supplements does this have any kind of skin benefit doesn off the signs of skin aging does it have a skin protective effect always looking out for those things to keep us looking younger and our skin healthy as long as possible what the heck is alpha lipoic acid it acid so you may see it labeled as that this is something that is naturally present in our body we make it it present in our cells in the powerhouse of the cell the mitochondria other animals make it and is found in plants what the heck does it do well it is a key cofactor in a variety of metabolic processes necessary for the breakdown of like glucose as well as lipids but it antioxidants are important for warding off oxidative stress upon exposure to things that generate free radicals not only in our skin but throughout our body cause a lot of inflammation damage protein dna lipids in our cells that then make them have to be removed by our immune system it leads to not only the skin signs of aging but a variety of chronic health problems i mentioned that alpha lipoic acid is naturally present in our body it actually make enough of it to help us out we rely on alpha lipoic acid from our diet and it as a variety of vegetables and fruits you can get it in one of my favorite vegetables comment below and if you know what that is [Music] broccoli if you guessed broccoli you are correct but you can also find it in spinach another favorite of mine tomato potatoes brussels sprouts peas rice bran in preparation for this video i was thinking man i must be hitting my alpha lipoic acid goals because i eat all of those things if you head on over to pubmed you will find actually quite a few studies looking at alpha lipoic acid dietary supplements in the treatment and management of a variety of health problems diabetes alzheimer pregnancy outcomes obesity multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia unfortunately a real sticking point when it comes to supplements with alpha lipoic acid is that as an ingredient it meaning when you take it in as a supplement it body to absorb it while it we extent we from a supplement it really boils down to a lot of nitty-gritty little details and how the supplement is formulated and they their formulation is bioavailable or is absorbed to any appreciable extent if you are interested in taking a supplement of course talk to your doctor first to make sure it but when it comes down to choosing a brand for your supplements i always suggest looking for supplements that are third party tested i always look out for like nsf certified for sport what are the limitations of dietary supplements when it comes to alpha lipoic acid it has a very short half-life meaning it doesn when we oxidative stress it is estimated that upon exposure to like an environmental stressor whether that be ultraviolet radiation from the sun which you guys know is responsible for the majority of extrinsic skin aging by destroying collagen through the generation of free radicals it creates a lot of other damage in the skin it of those free radicals it kind of is at its maximum at 24 hours so the timing of dosage is important it stable ingredient and it that roughly only about 30 percent of a supplement of alpha lipoic acid is actually absorbed it doesn well in the stomach and it is very rapidly cleared from the body by the liver uh your liver gets rid of it pretty quickly now manufacturers have tinkered around with different formulations they of lipoic acid and it maybe different combinations of them allow for the best absorption interestingly enough adults over the age of 75 seem to absorb it better than younger adults it you take the supplement on an empty stomach you can get better absorption but suffice it to say the research on the optimal formulation is still in its infancy and because it it get a lot of variation from brand to brand and you consumer nor can i tell you which ones are the best formulation you manufacturer about skin benefit why would this be helpful well as you guys know a majority of extrinsic skin aging comes from environmental exposures that generate free radicals in our skin that damage the dna in our skin cells as well as lipid membranes and proteins once the cells in our skin are damaged from those free radicals they have to be removed now your skin has its own system of antioxidants that are there to help control that unfortunately they aren good enough when you are exposed to mega insults like uv rays from the sun tobacco smoke if you are a smoker pollution and visible light from the sun also causes generates a lot of free radical oxidative stress in the skin antioxidants help neutralize those free radicals they do so by donating out of the kindness of their hearts one of their electrons and that helps neutralize that free radical and so there applying antioxidants to the skin for a photo protective effect you see sunscreens they help block or absorb uv rays but they can a hundred percent of uv rays some free radicals are still going to be generated the idea behind topical or oral antioxidants is that they help to minimize some of that oxidative damage from exposure to environmental stressors and of course sunscreens don don and some may protect from visible light namely those that are tinted and have iron oxides i is a lot of obvious interest in both topical and oral antioxidants for photo protection i have a video which i link down below on one of the more evidence-based dietary supplements that acts as an antioxidant to help reduce the stress related to uv exposure it called polypodium sold in the brand name of heliocare definitely check that out because it has been shown to be helpful for people who deal with photosensitive skin diseases people who have melasma may benefit from the supplement so definitely check that out you know another dietary antioxidant that has demonstrated benefit for reducing the burden of damage upon exposure to uv is actually uh nicotinamide supplements so that is another one but what about alpha lipoic acid truthfully there aren dietary supplementation with alpha lipoic acid and its effects on sun damage the generation of free radicals upon exposure to uv damage mitigating uv mediated redness nor are there any studies looking at supplementation with this antioxidant and improving the visible signs of skin aging long term where alpha lipoic acid rears its head as a dietary supplement in dermatology is actually not it doesn aging per se or fighting off free radicals from sun exposure but rather in the treatment of an autoimmune skin disease vitiligo vitiligo is an autoimmune skin disease where your immune system decides to attack the pigment producing cells in the skin and you get these white patches with no pigment and it can involve large swaths of your skin while it is growing research to suggest that a key driving force in the unfolding of vitiligo is actually oxidative stress and there is good research showing that dietary supplementation with antioxidant supplements for patients who have vitiligo can get them better responses to some of the therapeutics that we employ to treat vitiligo one treatment for vitiligo is narrow band uvb patients who are treated with an oral uh lip alpha lipoic acid supplement or other antioxidant supplements have also been looked at likewise in this fashion anyways they actually get better results from their narrow band uvb treatment than those who do not take the antioxidant supplements so it there role for dietary antioxidant supplements in the treatment of vitiligo what about actually applying it to the skin unbeknownst to me i to my skin off and on for many years because it my favorite sunscreens the elta md uv physical tinted mineral sunscreen i love that bad boy and honestly that is a sunscreen i many many years anyways what is the deal then with applying it to the skin animal models have been intriguing and shown promise one study showed an improvement in wound healing after seven days with topical lipoic acid in an animal model another animal model study actually showed that topical lipoic acid helped to improve some of the smoking induced damage to the skin of animal models yeah i skin from uv rays but smoking really damages your skin an equally if not more intense way and when combined with uv exposure it like a double hitter anyways so in animal models topical application of alpha lipoic acid seemed to actually improve some of the smoking induced changes one study initially showed promise putting five percent topical lipoic acid on the skin of adults showed an improvement in fine lines around the eyes and the upper lip but when researchers then and other studies went on to say well is this actually affecting meaningful change on a histologic meaning skin biopsy level to show true improvement or reduction in sun damage the answer is it really doesn make a difference one study very nicely showed that applying lipoic acid to the skin while well tolerated did not result in any meaningful difference in uv mediated damage to the skin it didn they actually very nicely looked at uh using five percent alpha lipoic acid to the skin they also looked at a commercially available lipoic acid product by perricone md the pericone high potency classics face firming serum i didn realize this it so they also looked at that show that there was no difference in photo protection you know we know that the skinceuticals ce ferulic can help mitigate some of the damage upon exposure to uv that is again one of the more research-backed vitamin c serums out there so this group actually took the ce for rolex showed that it of course you know when but used by itself reduced the burden of damage from uv exposure we they added lipoic acid to the ce ferulic the addition of lipoic acid did nothing you know didn outcome it was the same so it doesn to the skin it really has much benefit they postulate perhaps this is because either it uv exposure or it cleared from the skin it doesn around long enough to affect meaningful change in terms of oxidative stress as it stands now the ce for rolex from skinceuticals is well established to help reduce some of that oxidative stress upon exposure to uv i know it very expensive and there are a lot of dupes out there which you know aren research back but you certainly could try those instead because they are less expensive i reviewed many of them on here however getting away from vitamin c i would not view lipoic acid as an alternative for a topical antioxidant the research is just not there suffice it to say applying it to the skin and shrinks upwards of five percent appears to be very safe and well tolerated with minimal to no side effects maybe some irritation but really overall very well tolerated in contrast to the more evidence-based topical antioxidant the ce pharolic a lot of people do develop irritation with that uh it to apply it to the skin i it unbeknownst to me in sunscreens for years whether or not it research would suggest it tolerate it well overall the studies where we skin research trials it appears to be well tolerated is it safe to ingest yes it appears to be safe to take a dietary supplement that has alpha lipoic acid in it with the caveat that supplements are not regulated we don long-term safety data on alpha lipoic acid the research that we have though does suggest that it is safe and dosage is ranging from 300 to 600 milligrams is what is utilized in these studies that i mentioned at the beginning overall it appears to be a well tolerated side effects are rare and include nausea uh gastrointestinal discomfort and one person in one of the studies of the schizophrenia study actually did report skin irritation with alpha lipoic acid supplements now we don dosages or the long-term ramifications of daily supplementation with this so that to consider there is such a thing as too much of a good thing especially when it comes to dietary antioxidants and supplement form there is research to suggest at least in the case of other dietary antioxidant supplements namely vitamin e that taking high doses actually increases the risk for certain cancers like lung cancer as well as basal carcinoma of the skin the safe for all-natural thing is to just make sure that you are eating a varied diet including foods that have this compound in it to make sure that you are getting the dietary benefits of it whether or not you need to be taking a supplement the research just really isn for the general population to say whether it long-term ramifications of taking it it could actually end up being harmful unless you have vitiligo and you undergoing phototherapy taking this supplement really isn research-backed for having a skin anti-aging benefit as far as applying it to the skin seems to be harmless unless it causes you irritation in which case stay away from it uh but whether or not it appreciable effect on helping to mediate oxidative stress in the skin like you would hope seems unlikely seems unlikely so that being said uh it about negative results a lot of times you know both in the medical literature as well as you know of course in marketing you about positive effects but it important to know about negative results too because you know a lot of brands will just put this in there say oh our antioxidant enhanced formula and you may bucket antioxidants into one kind of thing and think oh i extra in this product they can charge you a lot more for it but whether or not it providing you any additional benefit beyond the product alone without that which would be a lot less expensive you know seems like it to keep in mind when you are going out there in the ocean of skin care products that you have to choose from likewise when it comes to dietary supplements don dietary supplement is being hyped up because we don safety ramifications of taking this every single day a lot of dietary supplements add other things into the mix and so we also don mention this but we also don have a good sense as to if there is any interaction with other medications so definitely talk to your doctor before hopping on uh alpha lipoic acid i say that in air quotes because that just seems to be the trendy thing to say now all the time hop on this hop on that anyways uh ranting about hop on aside yeah definitely talk to your doctor because there interaction with medications for example vitamin e supplements can interfere with uh blood thinners and whatnot so definitely always run by your supplement ideas with your doctor anyways y about alpha lipoic acid a very underwhelming tale i hope this has been informative make sure you let me know in the comments if you is this something that you have considered taking on the end slate i going to link my recent video on the skin benefits of melatonin so definitely check that one out if you are you know intrigued about antioxidants and their skin benefits i dive more into the research on that one in that video so check that one out but if you like this give it a thumbs up

ARE PROBIOTICS WORTH IT FOR YOUR SKIN? / DERMATOLOGIST @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVh0ZKHNXEY	Dr Day	well hey guys i dermatologist and in this video we going to be talking about the skin benefits of taking a probiotic probiotics are really popular they supplements gummies drinks they naturally present in fermented foods like yogurt sauerkraut and i get questions all the time here on youtube over on instagram and on tick tock hey can you please talk about probiotics should we be taking one are there any skin benefits first of all what the heck are probiotics probiotics are live microorganisms that when given in adequate amounts may have some health benefits while probiotics are present in fermented foods yogurts sauerkraut kefir you also will of course find them in supplements and the microorganisms most commonly used are lactobacilli bifidobacterium and enterococcus a lot of enthusiasm for taking probiotics for a variety of digestive health concerns which exceed the scope of today and i am a no gi expert do you know that your gut and your skin they are intimately connected and disruptions in the natural microflora that the live organisms in your gut disruptions in that can disrupt the permeability barrier there and lead to more inflammatory responses when it comes to probiotics probably the area of most active research in terms of skin benefit comes from the literature on eczema otherwise known as atopic dermatitis people with atopic dermatitis they have evidence of disruption of their gut microbiome that may underscore part of how the disease process begins to unfold people with eczema have less diverse intestinal microflora or bacteria there maybe that leads to a more leaky permeability barrier and that may also reflect the skin barrier defect that goes along with having eczema eczema if you inflammatory skin condition that comes and goes very very itchy and it is tightly associated with a variety of other healthy health issues people with eczema have decreased intestinal barrier function and they also have less diverse microflora in their intestine infants with allergies or atopic dermatitis their stool has fewer amounts of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium in comparison to infants that don to modulate certain inflammatory responses starting at the gut they may help to control and modulate how your immune system reacts to things that it encounters and for people with inflammatory skin conditions like eczema that is a part of what is skewed and leads to skin issues is kind of a distortion of immune responses probiotics may also help in reducing the adherence of staphylococcus bacteria to the skin you may have heard of impetigo or staph mrsa bacteria well people with eczema are prone to getting colonized with those bad bacteria and it perhaps probiotics may help in reducing adherence of that bacteria helping overall reduce flares of eczema probiotics may also help modulate intestinal barrier function as well as skin barrier function so this is an area where there research interests interest there are studies that demonstrate a benefit preventatively for taking probiotics to prevent eczema some dermatologists are keen on recommending probiotics perhaps for preventing eczema and it started in the last two weeks of pregnancy and continued for the first three months of life and there are research uh you know there are studies actually showing that that may have a the ability to reduce the incidence of eczema and at risk risk groups unfortunately these studies are pretty small they have limitations and they don long-term ramifications as far as treating eczema however we don have good data showing benefit to treating eczema with a probiotic now more research is needed because the studies that we have they have many limitations they underpowered and maybe not having enough diversity and when you say probiotics that category there are a lot of different bacteria that could be included in that dosage dosage frequency and different strains there suggest that it species of bacteria it the type of immune response and because these studies you know they different strains it draw meaningful conclusions that are generalizable to either treating a specific condition like eczema or to the population as a whole in terms of skin benefit there research on probiotics it they readily available either from fermented foods or from supplements so because of that you know there are meta analyses which kind of look at all the studies unfortunately the meta analyses are met with so many small unpowered studies that it really to to make meaningful conclusions so it really difficult to say for sure that probiotics are going to be helpful for a skin condition like eczema you know it about probiotics for people with acne because acne is an inflammatory condition like eczema people with acne they do have actually evidence of a gut dysbiosis meaning the bacteria that colonize the gut and people with acne may be different and that may relate to flares of the acne probably because of inflammation and there these probiotics that can help modulate inflammatory responses so it compelling to think that it might be beneficial for acne and let the role of stress in our gut microbiome and our skin and with acne stress is a well-known trigger for an acne flare and with stress can impact the gut microbiome making for more of an inflammatory outcome encouraging bacterial overgrowth and stagnating intestinal transit time we already know that people with acne do have a higher association with constipation like they have they constipation and so there is you know it compelling to think that probiotics may help currently the research that we have on probiotics for acne small small studies again with many limitations but they do demonstrate uh up to 84 improvement in acne with probiotic supplementation specifically with lactobacillus yeah that as far as probiotics for specific skin conditions there studies looking at you know other skin issues things like uh wound healing that you know suggest perhaps a benefit but by and large we really don of good rigorous research on probiotics for treating or preventing any skin condition eczema being the skin condition where we have the most research and even there we left without answers as to whether or not this is going to be a good recommendation for people with eczema or unnecessary but where does that leave you maybe you don you take a probiotic for your skin as it stands now it just don support doing that is it harmful unlikely i mean uh probiotics they are thought to be safe for otherwise healthy people now if you go through the literature on probiotics some of the trials looking at other diseases outside of the skin there are some risks that pop up and some adverse outcomes that pop up that do beg the question are probiotics safe for people who may have severe underlying medical conditions for example one study looking at probiotics for people who had what called acute pancreatitis basically sudden onset of inflammation in the pancreas can be triggered by things like alcohol anyways in that study there was an increase in overall death in people getting probiotics for acute pancreatitis in comparison to those not getting probiotics yeah the more the the death in the probiotic group was 16 versus like six percent in the uh control group and so for that reason that study was actually halted prematurely infants in the pediatric intensive care unit and there was a 1.1 rate of bloodstream infections with the probiotic meaning the probiotic that the infants were given in this trial actually got you know through the gut into the bloodstream and caused severe infection these things are pretty rare but they do occur in these trial and in the setting of these trials and it does give everyone pause to just go recommending them for people who may be like immunocompromised for example somebody who doesn immune system maybe because they have cancer or a chronic medical illness by and large though probiotics for otherwise healthy people they are safe although these studies on you know certain groups with underlying medical issues do highlight some potential risks that maybe give us pause for just recommending them to people who may be immunocompromised or chronically ill but for otherwise healthy people they do have a pretty long trip long-standing track record of safety that being said when it comes to probiotics they are supplements they not regulated so supplement companies don demonstrate purity of the ingredients that is why when you select a supplement i always recommend selecting one that is nsf certified that kind of means that at least what they say on the label is what is actually in the product especially when we talking about probiotics make sure that it actually has the bacteria in there that you think you so it can be really hard to know for sure what supplement is the best my recommendation if you are going to try a probiotic talk to your health care provider first to make sure that it going to be right for you ask them to suggest some and again when you those that are nsf certified because this does kind of help you at least have some level of confidence that what is on the label is what you are actually consuming but pretty much anything i could tell you about potential benefits to your skin from taking a probiotic would really just be speculation at this point more research definitely is needed hopefully we will get that in the future because it is a really exciting avenue of research anyways guys let me know in the comments do you take a probiotic have you seen any benefit was it recommended to you by your health care provider or did you just decide to take it yourself i would love to hear from you guys what your experience has been if you like this video give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don sunscreen and subscribe i guys tomorrow bye [Music] you	Success
DIM SUPPLEMENT FOR ACNE & HAIR LOSS | DERMATOLOGIST REVIEW @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rO9v3vC2cEc	Dr Day	well hey guys comment below have you heard of die indoor methane or dim supplements i get a lot of comments here on youtube please do a video on dim supplements as a treatment for cystic acne hormonal acne hair loss so in this video i dim is how it might work and is it a viable treatment option for acne hair loss and various you know skin issues if you a board certified dermatologist i make videos here on youtube related to issues of skin and hair health so if that sounds of interest to you consider subscribing anyways getting into the video die indoor methane or dim these supplements you can find you know in various health food stores a lot of them make claims that they support physical fitness overall wellness what the heck is dim it is a derivative of a compound found in cruciferous vegetables and taking a step back epidemiologic studies suggest an inverse relationship with consumption of cruciferous vegetables these are things like brussels sprouts broccoli cabbage cauliflower all of my favorites and the incidence of certain types of cancer so researchers have you know been very interested in various compounds from these cruciferous vegetables as you know having potential anti-cancer effects dim die diendoyly methane is a derivative of one of these beneficial compounds and laboratory studies suggest it may have anti-cancer effects and then there are some actual clinical studies on real people suggesting it may have an anti-cancer effect for cancers like breast cancer and prostate cancer but these clinical studies on actual people they research that is in its infancy and it is too premature to suggest this compound as a preventative or a treatment for any type of cancer so why the heck are people taking it for acne one of the ways in which it works is it antagonizes the androgen receptor whoa why does that matter well if you recall from my videos on acne acne is not only a disease where you have cells that proliferate a little bit too quickly get sticky and plug up the pore but you also have excess sebum production that fills the pore and that creates an inflammatory meal you that leads to acne breakouts now that sebum production is governed by your hormones nitrogen hormones they bind to receptors in the oil gland leading to more sebum production and that is what underscores hormonal acne and cystic acne and targeting that part of the acne pathway is what underscores treatments like spironolactone this newer treatment we have topical wind levy and oral birth control pills they address that hormonal issue that leads to excess oiliness i mean technically all acne is hormonal you know the hormones that we have they do govern that but for people for example who have a polycystic ovary syndrome this tends to be a predominant issue for them so this compound that comes from cruciferous vegetables it antagonizes that receptor and may you know reduce oil production likewise when we loss and hair thinning there hair loss called androgenetic alopecia i basically pattern balding it can happen in men and women and it seems as though the hair follicle is very sensitive to these androgen hormones and that causes the hair to kind of miniaturize and that is what leads to balding and so treatments that would antagonize that signaling may you know help with hair restoration however we have zero studies in people looking at dim supplements for the treatment of acne hair loss or any other skin or hair condition but if you go on the internet and you google dim supplements and acne you ton of testimonials singing the praises of these dim supplements claiming you know this cured my hormonal acne everybody be taken dim dim dim dim i caution you against falling for that kind of thing because it is an anecdote you know acne it can come and go and flare with certain things and when somebody is giving you a personal testimonial about a treatment be very cautious because that you really getting a full picture of what else is going on what their life and so that is where you need objective data to really say if something is a good treatment option or not anecdotes alone they actually end up being dangerous in some cases suffice it to say we don have research studies on taking dim supplements for any scare so suffice it to say we have zero studies on taking dim supplements for skin or hair or any any skin issue that you might be concerned with oiliness pores i mean there by which it might work the majority of the studies that we have on dim supplements do come from cells in a dish but we also actually do have clinical studies on real humans looking at this supplement in people with cancers there is one small clinical study that suggests dem supplements may be an option for certain types of treatment resistant prostate cancer and some other studies looking at dim supplements in breast cancer but saying there research to support taking a supplement for something it doesn from selling you the supplement and it doesn it out so is this supplement actually safe well in the clinical studies that we have on the cancer studies using doses between 200 and 400 milligrams daily there were no adverse effects reported so it appears to be relatively safe now i mentioned that it antagonizes the androgen receptor but there is also some research to suggest that it may influence the estrogen signaling pathway as well and so that could potentially be dangerous especially if you are taking oral birth control pills it may actually you know oral birth control pills they do come with a small risk of an increased risk of blood clots and if you are taking a supplement that may interact with the estrogen pathway well that could actually further elevate your risk of blood clots in fact there was a case report of somebody who did develop blood clots while taking a gym supplement now that individual had other risk factors for blood clots namely i think they were a smoker and maybe they even had a history of cancer which puts you at risk for blood clots but it of your mind as a potential risk because this does interact with some of the estrogen signaling pathways it could in theory put you at risk for blood clots that is theoretical though we only have that one case report but because it interacts with the estrogen pathways and the hormonal pathways it is contraindicated if you are pregnant planning to become pregnant or breastfeeding so it situations and another important cautionary tale about taking dim supplements is that from the clinical studies we do have we have learned that it actually uh interacts with the enzymes that are involved in metabolism of medications it can end up uh perhaps rendering medications you taking ineffective and the medication that uh that comes to mind that i would worry the most about that would probably be the most germane to people watching this video is going to be oral contraceptive pills this could in theory render oral contraceptive pills ineffective there has also been a case report of visual impairment in an individual who is taking quite high doses of dim for a couple of months the the symptom of visual impairment resolved i think about eight weeks after discontinuing it so it wasn visual impairment but that is concerning and then there is another case report of an adverse drug rash while on dim supplements but overall from the limited research that we do have does suggest that it learned about some of the mechanisms by which it works you do have to exercise caution especially if you are taking certain medications so as with any supplement definitely discuss with your doctor your health care provider if this is right for you go over the medications that you might be taking including any other supplements that you are taking and you know to see if this is something that would be safe for you and you know discuss with them as far as any other medical issues that you might have it a really important conversation to have before starting any supplement so why not just eat broccoli cauliflower brussels sprouts all the good cruciferous vegetables i highly encourage everyone to do that you know i getting a good balance of fruits and vegetables they have a variety of beneficial compounds antioxidants you know broccoli has something called sulfurophanes which actually can increase the antioxidants in the skin so yeah definitely consume your cruciferous vegetables however unfortunately while this compound is you know derived from cruciferous vegetables you may not actually get meaningful levels of it from just eating these vegetables because the amount of of dim in cruciferous vegetables is going to be highly variable depending on uh the soil the rainfall the type of seed it was grown from as well as the relative expression of certain enzymes in the plant that are needed to actually you know process and lead to the end result of dim so it quite variable and honestly i can you a guide as to you know where to source your broccoli and cabbage and i think when you go to that level of trying and scrutiny i think it just becomes a bit too much and you off just you know eating a balanced diet and trying to get in a good amount of fruits and vegetables including those cruciferous vegetables what if you hate eating cruciferous vegetables you hate the way they smell they taste you cannot stand them honestly you know just because the studies show an inverse correlation between consumption of cruciferous vegetables and you know cancer associations with certain types of cancers that doesn necessarily mean that this is the only way to lead a healthy lifestyle is by eating broccoli you all know i it miserable you know for a you know supposed health benefit there are other beneficial fruits and vegetables out there that will benefit you you don suffer through broccoli if you detest it i do not like broccoli not gonna do it so that tell you about dim die into oil methane supplements you know in the clinical studies we have yes they do appear to be relatively safe with no adverse effects however given the nuances of what we have learned about you know how it interacts with the estrogen pathways and its effects on metabolism of drugs you know you do have to proceed with caution again i emphasize discussing with your health care provider if this is right for you in the description box i to link my video on like the best foods for acne the acne diet other you know foods and things that can influence relative oiliness so if you are dealing with cystic acne make sure you check that video out you know it fear mongering certain diets or foods or whatever it the evidence that yeah certain foods may increase oiliness in some people so check that video out if you are dealing with oiliness acne breakouts uh it may be helpful to you to you know take a look at it i on the internet to see what people were saying about the supplement before doing this video and i interesting comments of people you know wondering if this would be an alternative to spironolactone and people were like i don spironolactone and definitely that medication that it you know antagonizes the androgen receptor i don take spironolactone indefinitely i would rather take something more natural but i against this natural fallacy because taking super physiologic doses of a compound is not natural even if it comes from broccoli it can go down a pathway where it ends up causing you harm at least with spironolactone it is a regulated medication we know the dosage we know the side effects to monitor for it is safe long term whereas with a supplement you in the dark there a you don you studies on the long-term safety ramifications of taking a supplement like this at super physiologic levels you know and that sort of thing so don don more natural than a prescription drug so in my opinion this is just my opinion you know i wouldn supplement natural it take super physiologic levels of something and while it appears to have beneficial outcomes in lab studies and cells in a dish and what have you you can we have learned this lesson from dietary antioxidants you know there are studies on vitamin e supplements actually increasing the risk of lung cancers and smokers so you certainly can tip the balance in the wrong direction by taking super physiologic doses of compounds that are naturally found in fruits and vegetables and plants i hope you enjoyed this video comment below and if you have heard of dim do you know anyone who has taken it have you taken it let us know in the comments on the end slate i going to link my video on acne and diet so check that out if that in or dealing with but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen and subscribe i guys tomorrow bye [Music]

10 SUPPLEMENTS THAT MAY BE CAUSING YOUR SKIN PROBLEMS | Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBQBjq4sA8U	Dr Day	well hey guys in today to be covering 10 dietary supplements that could be negatively impacting the health of your skin as i go through this list i want to emphasize to you guys it vitamin mineral or nutrient that is problematic and you should strictly avoid it but the theme here is supplements that contain higher levels than what is necessary especially in the absence of deficiency supplement number one is whey protein whey protein is really popular amongst bodybuilders athletes people looking for muscle building and it has been associated with stubborn acne breakouts it may be because whey protein is derived from dairy and you guys know from my video on the connection between dairy consumption and acne that we do see in some cases some dairy products are associated with acne we don it may be due to the fact that dairy products lead to increase in the hormone insulin like growth factor which drives oil production increasing the lipids on the surface of the skin making a more hospitable environment for that little bacteria and the poor cutie bacterium acnes leading to acne flares not everyone who takes a whey protein supplement is going to have acne though it but we definitely observe that you also have to be careful not all protein powders are just pure protein they often have other vitamins minerals nutrients added often at high levels and some of these vitamins minerals nutrients etc also can be associated with acne flares and i common offenders later in the video number two is gummy vitamins it doesn matter the supplement actually it really in this case the uh form gummy vitamins why well they have sugar in most cases they have corn syrup some kind of sugar to make them taste good which in and of itself is problematic food tastes good food has vitamins minerals nutrients you shouldn individual nutrient in it gummy vitamins they taste good people may end up inadvertently eating too many sugar spikes insulin leading to more oil production and flares of acne i have a whole video on the clear skin diet and in that video i explain how sugar can definitely worsen acne and eating sugary processed foods can contribute to that throw in some unnecessary candy gummies and there you go you have more sugar in the diet that contribute to acne also high glycemic foods sugary foods sugary supplements they contribute to advanced glycation and product formation in the skin you guys know from my videos on the worst foods for collagen that process sugary foods that can negatively impact the health of the collagen and elastin in your skin and that can lead to exacerbations of the visible signs of skin aging deeper wrinkles loss of elasticity if you foods eat sugary foods don vitamins taking in that sugar unnecessarily it also can lead to more inflammation in the body i mean it extra candy number three is b12 supplements now i take a b12 supplement because i follow a vegan diet and many people in the us are b12 deficient and do need to be on a b12 supplement so i not saying they are you know bad or anything like that if you need to take one you need to take one clarify that with your treating health care provider consuming greater than 5 to 10 micrograms of b12 per day is associated with acne why it happens we some research to suggest that b12 suppresses cutie bacterium acne and that causes acne and it suppresses it in such a way that causes bacteria to release more inflammatory mediators leading to more acne when you stop the unnecessarily high amounts of b12 then the acne resolves number four is actually pretty rare so i don be alarmist but that is iodine iodine can cause a particularly inflammatory type of acne that is mostly associated actually with people who consume a lot of kelp kelp is a sea vegetable is very high in iodine and the breakouts with iodine are pretty specific they meaning very red they often happen on the trunk there is an absence of what are called comidones basically blackheads and whiteheads just all you have are these really inflammatory papules bumps and it varies from person to person there was actually a study done by the fda in the 90s that showed that some people are able to tolerate really high levels of iodine so if you who has been eating kelp daily a lot of it and you don fine number five is biotin biotin is really popular in hair skin and nails supplements and people take it with the hopes of growing long healthy hair but there is really no data to show that taking biotin in the absence of biotin deficiency is going to be beneficial for hair growth whatsoever as far as the nails there is some evidence that for brittle nails taking two and a half milligrams of biotin daily can help strengthen the nails but you have to be careful with biotin supplements they are like these other supplements associated with acne breakouts this is another one where we don it increasingly so in recent years as biotin supplements are gaining even more popularity and becoming even more widespread throughout the supplement market people getting acne breakouts from their biotin supplements i cautioned you guys in other videos before too about the risk with taking biotin supplements is that it can interfere with the accuracy of certain blood tests that rely on something called a biotinylated assay so if you go to your doctor to have your thyroid checked they and that biotin supplement you could interfere with the accuracy of that blood work and make it look like you have hypothyroid disease if you are taking a biotin supplement it is recommended that you stop taking it about a week before going in to have blood work number six is vitamin a it actually pretty easy to get to too high of a level of vitamin a when it comes to taking vitamin a supplements vitamin a is a fat soluble vitamin stored in the body of course there are certain health conditions for which vitamin a supplementation is recommended for example it treatment for measles but you have to be careful because it is a fat soluble vitamin it that means it will be stored in the body and it get to high levels that can be toxic exceeding 25 000 international units of vitamin a a day is too much another way that you can get to too high of a vitamin a level is if you are eating polar bear liver as far as skin manifestations of hypervitaminosis a or too high of a level of vitamin a you going to get dry lips dry skin and hair loss hypervitaminosis a also can cause painful swelling of the long bones and it can cause elevation in liver enzymes problems with your liver number seven is pretty rare but definitely happens and that is consuming too much vitamin b6 can make you sensitive to the sun specifically the uva rays can cause a photosensitive rash redness even blistering it can be pretty painful and uncomfortable it issue because vitamin b6 it water-soluble vitamin so excess levels they going to store it so it that common but taking high levels can cause a transient increase in blood levels and that can be associated with photosensitivity number eight is selenium you can actually get too much selenium selenium is touted as being beneficial from a cardiovascular point of view it has heart health benefits but you can definitely get too much of a good thing and that can cause skin and hair problems you can get hair loss you can get this kind of rash that looks like seb derm but more intense with scaling redness sometimes acne like breakouts on the cheeks the face the forehead and you can have nail abnormalities with ridging of the nails horizontal ridging oddly enough celinosis often presents with garlicky breath not sure why that is but that is a presenting sign exceeding 200 micrograms per day of selenium is where you can run into this problem a while ago there was a supplement called total body formula it had to be recalled because on the label it said that it had 200 micrograms of selenium which is high to begin with especially in the absence of any deficiency however on further analysis the supplement was actually found to contain 200 times that as a result there were reports of celinosis from taking this supplement now vitamin b3 can actually be helpful to your skin and to your total body health there are actually two forms of vitamin b3 there niacinamide niacin is often given because it can have a cardiovascular benefit it can help reduce your cholesterol levels however niacin niacin can unfortunately cause flushing and that is a very uncomfortable sensation if you have ever experienced it burning redness and and discomfort niacinamide is a form of vitamin b3 that we actually recommend to a lot of patients who form many skin cancers because this has been shown to reduce the number of certain types of skin cancers that these patients form however you can actually again have too much of a good thing and it can cause itch it can make your skin itch niacinamide as a side note is not associated with flushing but it can cause dryness irritation and itch last but certainly not least is anabolic androgenic steroids this is really popular in the bodybuilding community people looking to build muscle and it not just amongst people who intentionally take anabolic steroids many supplements are adulterated with anabolic steroids and anabolic steroid-like compounds anabolic androgenic steroids not only can cause acne but they can also cause male pattern hair loss receding hairline if you have a genetic tendency towards male pattern hair loss otherwise known as androgenetic because it and genetic uh alopecia well then these supplements will hasten the onset of that um i mentioned that these steroids cause acne in many people they can cause a particularly horrific type of acne called acne fulminants acne pulmonance predominantly affects the trunk you get lesions on the chest the back the shoulders but it not just pimples it is these ulcerated weeping oozing painful necrotic skin lesions patients presenting with acne pulmonance they have elevated inflammatory markers their crp will be high which is a marker of inflammation in the body they often have painful arthritis they can have an enlarged liver and large spleen they can have fatigue uh decreased appetite weight loss and it acne acne fominans is more of an immune response to proteins on the surface of that bacteria that lead to this systemic immune response and of included in that systemic immune response are these alternative painful acne lesions mostly on the trunk but then you have systemic issues you have painful joint joint pain you know it definitely requires immediate attention it prednisone which is an oral anti-inflammatory medication or it can be treated with other immunosuppressive medications there is a study done by the fda of 776 supplements and they show that approximately 89 of them were adulterated with uh with anabolic steroids or anabolic steroid-like compounds namely though they were those that are labeled muscle building so it your multivitamin is going to have anabolic steroids in it or something like that specifically those types of supplements that are taken by bodybuilders for muscle building that can be adulterated with these things and by adulterating i mean like if you read the ingredients it listed on there but when they actually go in and analyze the the uh supplement they find these compounds in there that can definitely contribute to acne to be clear though acne fominions is pretty rare but acne as a result of anabolic steroids is not that rare that common but this more severe form of acne to be clear is pretty rare it due to an underlying genetic predisposition to this all right guys those are the 10 supplements that can negatively impact the health of your hair skin and nails but i want you guys to understand that it it your food labels obsessively to make sure you b6 it more has to do with supplements and taking high levels of these things unnecessarily vitamins that are more likely to be problematic and lead to harm are those that are fat soluble they the body and the fat soluble vitamins are vitamins a which i talked about here d e and k when it comes to choosing a dietary supplement you know like i said i take a b12 supplement well i actually take a multivitamin supplement that has b12 in it that athletic greens drink but always look for third-party testing that can help you know give you some confidence just going to be adulterated with things so always look for things like the nsf certification i think that is a good thing when choosing a supplement let me know in the comments have you developed any skin issues that you were able to pinpoint to a supplement was it any of these ingredients that i mentioned here or you know vitamins let me know in the comments but i hope you guys enjoyed this video on the end slate will be my video on the worst foods for collagen so if you foods and supplements for skin and and whatnot check that out i think you will enjoy it but if you like this video give it a

SHOP WITH ME |SKIN CARE & SUPPLEMENTS at VITAMIN SHOPPE | Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls1J_LKapTU	Dr Day	[Music] all right we i want to chit chat with you guys about any supplements they might have in here i reviewed the mad hippie skincare products once enough whole foods but let serum here what kind of form of vitamin c does it have the mad hippie vitamin c serum has sodium iscorbill phosphate as its form of vitamin c that more likely to get into the skin than ascorbic acid but it does have to be converted to ascorbic acid in the skin this also has ferulic acid and antioxidant that has a skin brightening effect it inhibitor so it can improve the look of hyperpigmentation looks like this one has a 12 month shelf life unlike the unlike the timeless one which is uh only three months it is corbil phosphate is a lot more stable than ascorbic acid but not well studied like ascorbic acid what refresh my drink it i sea buckthorn oil is rich in antioxidants and has a lot of fatty good fatty acids that are nourishing for the moisture barrier as just hemp seed oil unfortunately i don the sweet orange oil was a great addition to this because citrus oils can be very irritating to the skin i don that sunflower seed is good you know facial oils they act as emollients and give the skin a nice glowy healthy hydrated look but they not the best in terms of reducing water loss out of the skin where i find facial oils to be most beneficial in someone routine is if you you peeling like from irritation from a topical retinoid or something most people want to pick that off and scrub it off instead use a little facial oil it will help dislodge those shedding skin cells but isn the skin that use a facial oil actually is when you dealing with a lot of peeling now i reviewed these products before for you guys but that these are some of the more commonly requested products you guys asked me to review from them this is home health psoriasis medicated scalp and body wash salicylic acid is the active ingredient that would say for a scalp product just go with a salicylic acid shampoo because they typically have a three percent oh it may be helpful for dandruff but you guys know the limitations of tea tree oil it can cause uh contact dermatitis it substance compounds within it degrade easily do they have it here they usually do treat oil floating around um yeah it can degrade easily speaking of tea tree oil yeah it can degrade the compounds within it they become very irritating pretty easily like i desert essence sells their tea tree oil in a clear colorless bottle that would allow light to go through i went through a phase where i was putting a few drops of this in the toilet pole to disinfect it it was helpful actually ooh ancient earth secrets indian bentonite clay bentonite clay is good for reducing bentonite clay can help absorb sebum from the surface of the skin and from within the pore that temporary degreasing effect can allow your skin care products to penetrate better so a lot of people like to do a bentonite clay mask they make their own you know i the aztec healing mask before what is this mediterranean red clay powder kind of a similar principle it to make them yourself although it can be a little messy and it can be drying that cetaphil clay mask because it really moisturizing ingredients in it aloe vera gel oh this there was a shortage of this correct me if i but i feel like people were really struggling to find aloe vera gel aloe vera actually has compounds in it allicins that can have a skin brightening effect improve hyperpigmentation is anti-inflammatory people like to put it on a sunburn does this have anything else besides aloe in it carrageenan which is a thickener and potassium sorbate um that looks pretty good actually 4.99 just buy one get one half off lily of the desert aloe vera jelly this one has vitamin c and retinol palmitate those are antioxidants may help with healing no fragrance this one looks pretty good actually this lily of the desert that looks like a good product castor oil as a reminder very very moisturizing does not grow hair does not grow hair does not grow hair it viscous it deposits on the baby hairs that you really can look thicker and creates the illusion that the hair is growing and because it argument that breakage so i actually going to affect the hair cycle this is one of my favorite dermaini products eczema relief cream it is so good highly recommend it it colloidal oatmeal in it it the face or the body they also make a scar cream spf 35 that has um i think it has panthenol in it it miracle product oh god the sea salt frenzy all over tik tok i commented did i talk about sea salt in on youtube or was it just on tick tock did i talk about it i forget what content i um anyways the sea salt thing it skin care you know put it on your face whatever you want to do but is there like solid evidence that using sea salt water on your face is going to cure your acne no this product however actually looks pretty promising for people who have acne although unfortunately it essential oils in it because it kaolin in it which is good for absorbing oiliness hmm look kind of promising these bar soaps look pretty good actually activated charcoal that absorbing oil oatmeal milk and honey olive oil coconut oil shea butter do they sell speaking of oatmeal do they sell colloidal oatmeal here they don i you just reconstitute in some water it great as like a you can actually use it if you have really sensitive skin you can actually use it to kind of wash the face or the skin it anti-inflammatory full of antioxidant compounds i mean it is is it on some hero what are these nature well products vitamin c brightening moisturizing cream this has fragrance in it which can be irritating it has tetrahexal desole ascorbate and sodium is scorebill phosphate and ascorbic it forms of vitamin c in it vitamin c you guys know it at least ascorbic acid which is the form of vitamin c that for having a skin benefit not the most stable ingredient difficult to stabilize but it can help in improving hyperpigmentation this has coconut oil in it too now some people with acne prone skin find that coconut oil coconut oil aggravates their acne what in the collagen cream collagen is too large to actually get into the skin but it can act as a humectant in skincare products drawing water into the top layer of the skin and like it says improving skin plumpness and restoring moisture and suppleness this has dimethicone which is great for reducing water loss this looks promising aside from the fragrance oh it enough horse chestnut is good for um lower extremity edema if you have lower leg swelling horse chest not for whatever magical reason seems to be beneficial i know right he would have thought retinol advanced moisture cream this has retinol in it which is good for increasing skin cell turnover may help improve the look of stretch marks this also has antioxidants retinol palmitate tocopherol and ascorbic acid and then it dimethicone and dimethicone to reduce water loss out of the skin coconut oil which is moisturizing but can be problematic for people with acne prone skin this just looks like a coconut oil scented moisturizer all right magnesium in skincare magnesium is important for total body health it electrolyte but when you put it on your skin it not like it the cells and act as an electrolyte however there are some studies or at least one that suggests topical magnesium may be helpful for hyperpigmentation it anti-inflammatory and there suggestion that it may help repair damaged dna wow that anyways it kind of like the sea salt thing i mean it the sea salt thing there little bit of data there this than the sea salt thing magnesium gel highly concentrated gel a pure magnesium chloride apply a generous amount of the gel under the skin [Music] 16.99 one of these flakes from the ancient seabed the body and foot soaks collagen supplements are not going anywhere anytime soon they are popular i have several videos on collagen supplements for skin there are some studies actually supporting the efficacy of dietary collagen supplements for improving skin hydration and minimizing wrinkles they have their limitations they small poorly controlled etc etc overall it seems pretty safe to take side effects include bloating um digestive upset and of course if you fish shellfish or fish you want to be careful of some of them because they are fish derived and the marine ones actually are supposed to be the best the beef ones i think i can what the rationale was but there actual evidence that they do in fact get into the skin through ra radio labeling studies suggested that the peptides actually do make it into the skin hyaluronic acid supplements are kind of similar they too have been shown to improve skin hydration but it difficult to say for sure if it supplements or just something else about what was changed in the study they not really well controlled the problem with a lot of these studies is that they forms different doses different routes so or you know having the people do something else but anyways this you have to be careful though with the biotin supplements first of all they can flare acne for some people and they can interfere with the accuracy of certain blood tests they actually don impact hair growth unless you have biotin deficiency which is super rare and they they may help though with strengthening the nails but not a lot of data for it anyways they biotin supplement and i noticed my nails grew a lot grew faster seemed healthier but like as soon as i heard that biotin supplements as soon as i learned that biotin supplements can interfere with the accuracy of like thyroid tests i was like no i so if you go back on my channel to like the very early days you vlogs i used to take it but i don anymore and that i don control sorry i have to say this place is not living up to its namesake because sprouts tends to have more vitamins it seems like this just has like multivitamins what is life force multiple energy activator i don oil of oregano it anti-inflammatory properties it thymol in it and carvical obviously you have to be really careful when it comes to essential oils there a lot of variability from product to product batch to batch and you definitely would never want to put plain essential oils on your skin can be incredibly irritating but the carbocral which is what this is seventy percent um carbocral and thymol they are not only anti-inflammatory but they have antibacterial properties may help in reducing the burden of staph bacteria which can cause impetigo for some people certain strains of staff oregon oil also may be helpful for candida yeast infection like thrush and if you get candidal inner trigo like under the armpits under the breasts this ingredient may be helpful but i would caution you against putting oil of oregano on your skin just because essential oils can be pretty irritating otherwise but it as an antimicrobial beta glucan this is a dietary supplement but in skincare products it wonderful humectant really can help with moisture content and helping keep the skin hydrated speaking of coconut oil we have a quite a variety here what when i was taking this it not delicious but i kind of enjoyed it it is really high in omega-7 fatty acids and that anti-inflamma which is anti-inflammatory i was really into taking this for a while and then i kind of fell off lipoic acid is an antioxidant that unfortunately has poor bioavailability so taking a dietary supplement is whether or not it actually gets absorbed is questionable but applying it to the skin there is some suggestion may help in reducing sun damage and improving wrinkles anti-aging effects by reducing free radicals that otherwise damage dna and the cells in your skin need aging same thing with the resveratrol another antioxidant that actually has some good evidence at least when applied to the skin for reducing free radical damage i mean all antioxidants have the stability issue but it seems like there that we could be zoning in dhea speaking of essential oils there is some suggestion that rosemary oil can help with hair growth the data is pretty limited so don would not put straight rosemary oil on your scalp definitely can cause a lot of irritation well hopefully you guys enjoy the shop with me if you all enjoy shop with me videos on the next slide will be my last one but if you like this give

Skin benefits of HYALURONIC ACID PILLS, DRINKS, & SUPPLEMENTS| Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEHjLp4Jghs	Dr Day	well hey guys in today to be going over hyaluronic acid supplements for the skin i covering the research behind taking hyaluronic acid in terms of skin benefits and i to be answering your questions about is it good to take hyaluronic acid if you andrea i dermatologist i would love it if you would subscribe to my youtube channel and hit the thumbs up it really helps my videos out a lot the nutraceutical field is booming people are now more than ever motivated to take supplements to not only improve their health but also to improve the look of their skin there are a ton of them out there and as a side note i do have a video going into the research behind collagen supplements for skin so make sure you check that out if that but hyaluronic acid is up there along with many others personally i don but i do love my drinks and that being said before i get into the research behind hyaluronic acid skin i sponsor peak tea you guys know i am a long time fan of their amazing delicious high quality teas if you are not aware there are so many benefits to your health that come from drinking good quality tea tea is packed with antioxidants nutrients there research to suggest that drinking tea can benefit your skin in terms of improving its ability to handle all those environmental stressors like ultraviolet radiation and pollution peak is my favorite brand of tea and i go back to them time and time again because of the quality and the quality and the purity of the ingredients they have over 20 delicious flavors to choose from and they including from the global t championship they have tons of five star reviews on their website and i can them and the other thing i love about them is i cannot be bothered with the tea bag it their tea crystals dissolve quickly in water so that you don around with a tea bag so i really love that they use a cutting edge cold extraction technology that locks in the nutrients and antioxidants that are going to support radiant health and i love that it dissolves in seconds there preservatives and they also offer a 30-day satisfaction guarantee so if you satisfied you can get your money back i incorporate their teas multiple times a day actually into my daily routine most notably i love having one of their teas at night as a tea latte that has been something i really been enjoying lately but when i need a little energy pick up or improve focus in the early morning or midday i reach for the sun goddess matcha it egcg which support cellular health and protect cells from free radical damage peak actually shades their matcha trees 35 longer which leads to extra l-theanine that promote calmness and reduction in stress so that you know can ultimately help with things like acne it ceremonial great and it does not clump they even screen it for pesticides heavy metals toxic mold and radioactive isotopes i also love getting in the curcumins from turmeric through their electric turmeric tea this supports healthy response to inflammation and it turmeric that bioavailability it ayurvedic herbs like cinnamon and ginger for enhanced benefit the hibiscus beauty elixir is going to be a summer go-to ice but i have it all the time as a hot tea it to support healthy collagen synthesis which we need for skin hydration and smoothing out wrinkles and plump bouncy skin the ginger digestion elixir is perfect after a meal because the ginger helps with digestion and it anti-inflammatory gingerol oh and a favorite of mine is the mint herbal it great for freshening your breath and it which is anti-inflammatory you guys i know you many of you have been on the fence about trying them you see me have them in my vlogs and you know it interest uh so definitely take advantage of the link in my description box because i was able to snag five percent off your first order so take advantage of it because they hardly ever offer discounts all right what is hyaluronic acid it biopolymer and it body um it it it lubricates the joints it the heart valves i mean pretty much every tissue throughout the body and it binds onto water so it helps keep your skin hydrated it gives the skin kind of a bouncy glowy look smooths out wrinkles we start losing both hyaluronic acid and collagen in our skin as we get older because not only related to age-related change but due to all of those external environmental stressors that generate those free radicals that damage collagen and weaken the skin overall that ultimately is what leads to wrinkles and compromised skin barrier function for example at the age of 75 you about a quarter of the quantity of hyaluronic acid in your skin that you had when you were 19. hyaluronic acid is most well known for its water binding ability it can bind a thousand times its weight in water you will find hyaluronic acid in tons of skin care products which i here on this channel before serums toners moisturizing creams lotions even sunscreens often will have hyaluronic acid or it and it and when you apply it to the skin it holds onto water in the skin and that can have a wrinkle smoothing effect but it motivated to ingest it in the hopes of enhancing hydration in the skin smoothing out wrinkles and plumping up the skin but how exactly would hyaluronic acid get into the skin is that even possible wouldn you know digested in your intestines in your stomach um there actually is some stud there actually are some studies that suggest that hyaluronic acid supplementation or dietary hyaluronic acid can uh be taken up um from the digestive tract and localized to the skin a lot of these studies however are done in laboratory models and in mouse models so be aware of that you know we cells in a dish we uh laboratory animals we are people these lab-based studies suggest that dietary hyaluronic acid may its absorption may be influenced by its molecular weight for example lab studies looking at monolayers of intestinal cells in a dish show that small molecular weight hyaluronic acid can pass between the cells and there are some studies in lab animals that are able to late where they the hyaluronic acid and show that it localizes after ingestion to the skin to the deeper layers of the skin where presumably it with hydration and plump up the skin the studies that we have on dietary hyaluronic acid are not just restricted to cells in a dish and lab animals there are a few studies in humans that suggest potential benefit of dietary hyaluronic acid supplements a lot of these studies have been done in japan or korea i think it you know something of interest there and specifically a lot of them have been done with a brand of hyaluronic acid it cupi um which i don same company that makes that japanese mayonnaise that you can get on amazon i i assume that they are the same company anyways um a lot of these studies use a particular hyaluronic acid supplement from that company there women age 30 that took uh 240 milligrams per day of hyaluronic acid with a molecular weight of 75 000. they took it for eight weeks and the hyaluronic acid group had fewer wrinkles than the control group who didn at the end of the eight weeks suggesting improvement in wrinkles there looking at 28 japanese women aged 30 to 49 who had crow and they took same dose 240 milligrams per day of hyaluronic acid this time the hyaluronic acid was smaller they took it for eight weeks and at the end of the eight weeks they showed a decrease in wrinkle depth of crow comparison to the control group suggesting again improvement in wrinkles and then last but not least there actually wanted to look at if there any difference between smaller versus larger molecular weight this time 120 milligrams per day this time for 12 weeks instead of eight and truthfully at the end of the study while they did show that those taking the hyaluronic acid supplements had an improvement in wrinkles smoother skin in comparison to placebo it did not seem as though there was really any difference between the different molecular weights there are also some studies of dietary hyaluronic acid supplements that suggest improvement in skin dryness so if you cope with a lot of dry skin that makes sense you know hyaluronic acid helps with skin hydration that a supplement if it actually does work may help there though we don optimal dose is and these studies are pretty small so it larger randomized control trials of supplements there terms of the size and the amount between the different studies so it as far as looking at any one particular outcome and the duration but suffice it to say these studies do suggest that dietary hyaluronic acid is safe to ingest there are no adverse effects associated with it so if you want to take one seems low risk and it does suggest that there is improvement not only in wrinkles but in dry skin with a hyaluronic acid supplement because hyaluronic acid is a polysaccharide another potential presumed benefit of ingesting hyaluronic acid is that maybe it may help improve the gut microbiome and there is an intimate connection between the gut microbiome and the cutaneous microbiome and a lot of times uh skin health is a reflection of gut health so part of the benefit and you know subjective benefit of taking hyaluronic acid could potentially be related to the gut microbiome it showing that it showing you know decrease in wrinkle depth although the studies are small and limited however you know bear in mind that a lot of what you probably are hearing and being hyped up is largely going to be anecdotal so it say whether or not what one person observes is going to be applicable to other groups of people one thing too about a lot of the hyaluronic acid supplements on the market is that they have other ingredients in them i don the these particular studies i mentioning are looking just at hyaluronic acid so we isolate that but other supplements that you find like that you know i was just scrolling on my on i herb looking at the hyaluronic acid supplements many of them have other ingredients that could also you know be beneficial for the skin things like vitamin c collagen again i before about the studies on collagen for wrinkle smoothing so it benefit from those supplements that maybe isn hyaluronic acid that it does appear to be safe but honestly you know focus on a balanced diet getting your fruits and vegetables and having fiber in the diet is really important ideally from whole food sources um you know limiting your sugar you know that sugary refined carbohydrates uh can contribute to age related change in the skin by the formation of those advanced glycation end products on the collagen that can generate a lot of free radical damage down in the skin and lead to prominent wrinkles so be mindful of your sugar consumption whatever benefit that you see with the supplement you to continue to take it uh long term to maintain that it likely going to take some time before you start noticing results if you do take one so you know nothing works overnight in the skin as i mentioned in the beginning of the video i personally you know don hyaluronic acid supplements so for me you know i just would not be compelled to take a supplement uh instead i you know i think it your nutrients building blocks for healthy skin from whole food sources in your diet and but you know at the end of the day it doesn and it may improve the look of wrinkles fine lines and improve dry skin which you know is something that you also deal with a lot as you get wiser because the skin moisturizing factors your skin is more prone to dryness and as a result it irritation so i can see the appeal of it and like i said it appears to be safe um that we know of uh if you take other medications always clear these things with your treating healthcare provider you know i get i can think of how even though this is safe you could make the argument well is it going to affect the absorption of other medications you know hard to say so definitely check in with your doctor before

Vitamin D and HAIR LOSS| Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MUKLjiN0l4	Dr Day	well hey guys in today to be talking about vitamin d and hair loss i know a lot of you guys cope with hair loss thinning hair it and you may not be aware of the fact that there is a connection between vitamin d deficiency and hair loss if you are new here welcome my name is andrea i am a board certified dermatologist i would love it if you would subscribe to my youtube channel and hit the thumbs up it really helps my videos out a lot vitamin d deficiency gets a lot of publicity we know that people nowadays seem to be low in vitamin d and it function bone health and mood problems when people are struggling with hair loss one of the first things i want to know is is there something in my diet that causing this or is there a supplement that i should be taking that can rectify this and as a dermatologist we start looking for causes of the hair loss before we advise on whether or not any type of supplement or dietary modification is going to be necessary now when it comes to hair loss and healthy hair you kind of have to think of it as a garden and the scalp health is like the soil you want to make sure that the soil is rich in vitamins minerals and a big part of ensuring healthy hair growth is cleansing the scalp regularly to remove sebum buildup that can contribute to inflammation and subsequent hair loss for me personally i shampoo my hair every day and i am a fan as you guys know of function of beauty hair care and i them again on today function of beauty is fully customizable hair care products that you can get delivered right to your door i have been using their shampoo and conditioner for over a year now and i tremendous benefit in the health of my hair it more manageable a lot shinier and i love the fact that it is completely customizable all you have to do is go in and take a quick quiz outlining your hair type and specific hair goals you can choose up to five and then you can get shampoo and conditioner that is completely customized to meet your specific hair care needs hair care needs change with age environment you know maybe at a certain time

link in my description box you can get 20 off your first function of beauty order so thank you function of beauty for sponsoring today but getting back to this role of vitamin d and healthy hair growth again think of the scalp as like the soil and you need good nutrients in that soil to facilitate healthy hair growth now the skin cells the keratinocytes they actually metabolize vitamin d and they these are the cells that are responsible for making keratin that is that protein that constitutes our skin our hair and our nails it important to strong hair and healthy healthy hair and healthy nails and healthy skin when vitamin d is low then the keratinocytes in the hair follicle they slow down in terms of making strong healthy hair and you can get an increase in hair shedding this is known as a telogen effluvium and so when you go to a dermatologist presenting with a complaint of hair loss one thing that checked is your vitamin d levels and there is some evidence that these are associated but overall how common is it that vitamin d deficiency is the cause of hair loss there are so many types of hair loss out there that it isn pointing this out because i don you guys to just start taking a vitamin d supplement in an effort to improve your hair or improve your hair growth it though that low vitamin d it it see a board certified dermatologist for evaluation of your hair loss and for a complete workout to figure out what the cause is as part of that that includes blood work checking for vitamin d but we going to check other things like your iron levels low iron too can contribute to hair loss to check something called a ferrotin and we uh your blood levels with the complete blood cloud make sure that there isn underlying medical cause also thyroid hormone would be another thing that we would check and in many cases depending on the physical exam meaning after we examine your scalp and take a look at your hair in many cases we also might perform a scalp biopsy and that is a really really valuable tool in getting a correct diagnosis you know on social media i get a lot of questions what can i recommend for hair loss what can i recommend for hair growth and you guys the diagnosis is what i recommend you have got to get a diagnosis before you can ever begin to address your address your hair loss needs because there are so many different types of hair loss and you are doing yourself a disservice by not having that diagnosis because how do you really know how how to navigate it beyond just scalp cleansing and scalp hygiene there are specific treatments for these different types of hair loss one of the more common types of hair loss that is associated now with the low vitamin d situation is something called telogen effluvium that is basically hair shedding it can happen though after any type of stressful event and really what it is is that your body sees a stressful event it not the time to prioritize growing strong healthy hair and that may be because you are low in vitamin d leading to more shedding or low in some other vitamin or mineral maybe you have gone through a very stressful life event strong emotional stress can trigger this or maybe you had surgery that is a stressful event or maybe you took a new medication that just kind of shifted the hair cycle around a bit and put put more of your hair in the shedding phase um or you had a baby that is a very common reason and so this type of hair loss telogen effluvium it typically presents you know roughly six weeks to six months following the stressful event as an increase in shedding hairs it doesn lead to baldness but what can happen is that it can ma uncover another type of hair loss that is common in women androgenetic alopecia or female pattern hair loss basically the hair follicles start becoming are more sensitive to the male hormones they miniaturize and that first presents as a widening of the part and maybe a lot thinning of the hair around the temples and if you undergo a telogen effluvium that something that you as those hairs are shedding and also you losing all this hair but my hair is really thin and i i can see my scalp that often can happen vitamin d low vitamin d may be the cause or it may not it may be one of these other things that is so important beyond taking care of the health of your scalp make sure that you have a healthy diet that is balanced and includes uh fruits vegetables uh vitamins and minerals should you know mostly be obtained from your diet you know it can all be obtained from your diet you don special supplement although of course you know many people take a multivitamin myself included to bridge gaps in day-to-day uh eating for example you know if you stressed out and busy sometimes that derails your eating plans so many people take a multivitamin to kind of bridge those gaps but overall you can get everything that you need from food and including vitamin d can get be obtained from food sources a well-balanced diet that supports healthy hair growth has protein in it too keratin is really what makes up your hair and nails and skin and so if your protein you know getting good quality proteins in the diet it can be plant-based you don be animal based to provide those amino acid building blocks for strong healthy hair and you want to make sure that your diet is got you know fruits and vegetables those not only contain tons of vitamins and minerals that nourish that scalp soil but they also have a lot of antioxidants that can fight off some of the inflammation and oxidative stress inflammation and oxidative stress can impact the hair cycle in the in the scalp that you need to cleanse the scalp to remove dirt oil sebum pollutants gunk that creates irritation and can contribute to oxidative stress and affect the hair cycle but the other thing is is delivering some anti-inflammatories through the foods that you eat fruits and vegetables legumes nuts seeds these are all good sources of those eating a balanced diet and consistently washing your hair as frequently as your hair type tolerates those are things that you can do to ensure strong healthy hair growth and you know keep your scalp healthy to really ensure that inflammation is to a minimum but if you do develop hair loss and you see your dermatologist and you find out that your vitamin d is low what is the treatment typically it is supplemental vitamin d at a thousand international units daily for 12 weeks so it to necessarily supplement for the rest of your life and that can help it for return to baseline but with time borrowing there are no other external stressors that go on and further you know shift your hair cycle around then you can get restoration of your hair density and hair you know normal hair your return to normal hair growth but if you have an underlying female pattern hair loss that was made more obvious by the telogen effluvium this is not going to stop that that is a process that happens again in relation to hormones in the body namely the testosterone that we all have so in summary vitamin d is really important for healthy hair skin and nails can be obtained from the diet and if necessary from supplements in the setting of vitamin d insufficiency or deficiency always see your healthcare provider though for diagnosis don taking supplements marketed for hair loss without getting that diagnosis first because you could be just taking supplements unnecessarily and not helping your cause and losing time uh for appropriate treatment that will correct things don check out function of beauty if you are in the market for some good quality hair care products that you can customize for every hair care need that you may have at the moment i you know i love them i love the way my hair looks uh since using them and i strongly recommend them check out the link in my description box you can get 20 off your first function of beauty order but i hope this

CHLOROPHYLL WATER FOR CLEAR SKIN: Tiktok skin care FAIL| Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a87sHnm9i8E	Dr Day	well hey guys in today be covering this tick tock craze about taking liquid chlorophyll for acne if you are new here welcome my name is andrea i am a board-certified dermatologist i would love it if you would subscribe to my youtube channel and hit the thumbs up it really helps my videos out a lot what is chlorophyll chlorophyll is a plant pigment it green that you and it also can protect against dna damage now on tick tock people are taking liquid chlorophyll claiming that it helps their acne it water-soluble form of chlorophyll the plant pigment and this type of product supplement what-have-you has been around for a very long time well before the advent of tick-tock and many people take it uh claiming that it help detox the body ordinarily i roll my eyes whenever anybody says detox however there is a little bit of truth to this what uh chlorophyllin supplements have actually been shown to limit the bioavailability of alpha toxins chlorophyllin is an antioxidant so it can help fight off free radical damage from exposure to any environmental carcinogens and it also has this ring-like structure it maybe it can kind of bind up some of these things and again limit their bioavailability so there is actually some truth to the detox claim about this ingredient and it has been demonstrated that it limits the bioavailability of carcinogens so i references down below if you guys want to read more all right but what about for acne all right first of all you have topical chlorophyll uh stuff that you put on the skin now truthfully there are no like studies of putting chlorophyll on your skin for acne but it is antibacterial it is anti-inflammatory it logic follows it could potentially help with acne so you will find it in several over-the-counter acne products including the line bioclarity that i have used and talked about and promoted on here before it is you know they have some good products anyways i digress but what about taking liquid chlorophyll or chlorophyllin chlorophylline is a photosensitizer and there is a small study examining using chlorophyll-a as a photosensitizer for the purposes of something called photodynamic therapy for treating acne what the heck is photodynamic therapy it is a type of treatment we use in dermatology to treat skin cancers and a variety of other skin conditions it involves administering a photosensitizing agent either applied to the treatment area or given to the patient systemically once that photosensitizing agent is allowed to accumulate into the given tissue then the area is treated with either blue light or red light and this results in something called photoactivation and the generation of singlet oxygen species and subsequent death of the the type of cell that we trying to kill off in the diseased area now photodynamic therapy has been used to treat acne successfully because photosensitizers accumulate in the oil gland chlorophyll is a photosensitizing agent that can be used for the purposes of treating acne and was shown to be effective so should you be taking liquid chlorophyll for acne or chlorophyllin no this is merely used to make the visible light treatment more effectively and it conditions taking a photo sensitizing agent can be very damaging to your skin chlorophyllin can accumulate in the lining of the blood vessels in your skin and it can cause rashes burning stinging redness blistering a photosensitive reaction chlorophyll is present in the foods that we eat uh green specifically spinach broccoli green leafy vegetables so you can get chlorophyll from your diet however if you take it in a supplement form it 10 cups of spinach or something all at once and it accumulate in the tissues and cause photosensitivity i comes to the chlorophyll and supplements it is well established that chlorophyll and supplements are a known cause of something called pseudo porphyria what the heck is that it is a skin condition in which individuals are become sensitive to light because of something that they are taking or exposed to this can be observed in people who are undergoing dialysis people with chronic renal failure people on certain medications and it has been observed in people who use tanning beds and we don in some conditions it makes sense patient is taking something that is photosensitizing it accumulates in tissues and then they have this what it present painful blisters on the backs of the hands uh it can not only be painful and have blistering but you can have redness you can have swelling and you can even have numbness on on the backs of the hands in particular is where it often shows up it porphyrias are a group of hereditary diseases of porphyrin heme metabolism that makes people very sensitive to light but you can kind of get a pseudo porphyria state triggered by certain medications and in this case chlorophyll and supplements this has been well established well documented in case series case reports and the treatment for pseudo perfuria of course is stopping the offending agent so for example if a patient is taking a medication that triggered a pseudo porphyria we stop the medication yeah basically the photosensitizing agent it gets concentrated in the line the cells that line the blood vessels and then when you light visible light like indoor lighting can trigger this uh it creates tissue destruction and you get these blisters that are painful you have redness you have swelling and you can have numbness now this isn going to happen to everybody but it does happen and it probably is uh going to happen more likely the longer that you take this because it could accumulate in those tissues we don pharmacokinetics of these supplements and supplements are not drugs they so the dosage etc is you know it to vary from company to company and companies are not really required to do any standardization and present that in a uniform way like an over-the-counter medication so it can be problematic it could potentially accumulate in your skin and cause a photosensitive reaction now for people uh who experience this not only is it painful not only do you have these blisters there you and that it could cause hyperpigmentation that either doesn long time to fade and that you are somebody with a medium to deep skin tone um that is an adverse reaction that is more likely in those skin types in the case of pseudoporphyria triggered by chlorophyll supplements it as simple it just stopping the medication some patients have been reported to still have photosensitivity up to six months after stopping the supplements suggesting that something in the chlorophyll and maybe binds to blood vessels or red blood cells causing a more prolonged manifestation of the of the pseudoporphyria in my opinion it is much better to derive the benefits of chlorophyll and in terms of its antioxidants uh you know free radical scavenging etc simply by eating green leafy vegetables consuming high concentrations of one component of a food often can result in problems and this is one such example uh just because it is natural just because it comes from a plant doesn mean it in concentrated amounts for a prolonged period of time yes in the case of acne it has been shown to be beneficial but the reason it beneficial is because it makes it only beneficial in patients undergoing photodynamic therapy so it is going to help acne the reason that study showed it was beneficial in acne is because it of photodynamic therapy which you shouldn yourself without the supervision of a dermatologist because again you can have blistering redness painful reactions and if you take this long term it can potentially accumulate in the lining of your blood vessels triggering possibly a pseudo porphyria that has been reported it is a well-established risk of taking this this is also a problem in ruminants uh you know [Music] uh cows by the chlorophyll uh causing photo being photosensitizing i mean it originally reported in the veterinary literature i believe uh so it for people you know it you should be taking in high levels in my opinion based on this potential risk of a photo sensitivity which is not something you want to mess around with and in my opinion a far safer way to obtain some of the benefits of chlorophyll is simply by eating leafy green vegetables like spinach broccoli uh these are these are much better ways to get this beneficial compound into you rather than these very high concentrated levels in these chlorophyll and droppers supplements etc i just a puppet of the pharmaceutical industry and that is why i am cautioning against chlorophyllin but those of you who are here for an evidence-based answer i will put my references down below documenting the uh cases of pseudo-porphyria from taking chlorophyllin supplements including the individual who had symptoms six months after stopping not something that you want to be dealing with i hope this video was helpful to you guys if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don i [Music] you	Success
Does pantothenic acid (B5) CLEAR SKIN?| Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzg3pQEeHlQ	Dr Day	hey guys what if b5 is the secret to clear glowing radiant skin if you my name is andrea i dermatologist i would love it if you would subscribe to my youtube channel and hit the thumbs up on this video it really helps my videos out a lot now i the years to please talk about pantothenic acid aka vitamin b5 for clear radiant glowing skin is it helpful is it something that can clear up acne and should we be taking it first of all what is panthothenic acid or b5 it is a b vitamin you probably are aware of the fact that there are a ton of vitamins that we get from our diet and are critical to our life and b vitamins there are eight of them uh for which uh b5 is one b5 plays an important role specifically in the conversion of carbohydrates proteins and fats into energy and specifically it is responsible for increases in something called coenzyme a which is really important for a variety of biochemical processes throughout the body pantothenic acid is really important for the health of your skin it plays a key role in epidermal barrier function and it also helps in regulation of oiliness aka sebum which plays a major role of course in acne so if you you logic follows that pantothenic acid is something that your diet for helping that out to be clear deficiency and pantothenic acid is incredibly rare we get it from our diet and yeah it in this b vitamin um however given its vital role in epidermal cell turnover inflammation and oiliness it that perhaps people with acne may have a lower level of pantothenic acid and would perhaps benefit from supplementation with b5 or pantothenic acid is there any truth to this well there actually a study that examined taking pantothenic acid for acne for clearing up acne lesions this study was a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial that took adults with acne and either gave them a placebo pill that had nothing in it or a pill that had pantothenic acid in it and at the end of the 12-week study they demonstrated a pretty notable reduction in the number of acne lesions with the pantothenic acid supplement so that importantly throughout the study there were no adverse effects attributed to this supplement um and people tolerated it well and they were happy because their skin was getting clear in comparison to those who were receiving the placebo pill they did not appreciate this improvement in their acne they didn skin from the placebo so the the treatment group those that got the supplement they were a lot happier at the end of the study and objectively they had fewer acne lesions than when they started pantothenic acid is safe like all b vitamins it so what that means is that uh if your body doesn you notice if you take a b supplement a b vitamin supplement that you have like a really bright yellow pee your urine is is bright yellow yeah it just because you you it has decent bioavailability when you take pantothenic acid somewhere between 40 to 60 percent will actually be absorbed so in this study it looks as though the supplement they were given helped give them clear skin i mean it pantothenic acid it increases levels of coenzyme a which is important for reducing oiliness and oil control and it acne that people don realize is that the skin barrier there you if you have acne or a tendency towards acne you of the skin for the skin to become easily irritated and if you have low you know in theory if you have low levels of pantothenic acid that might contribute to an increased irritability of the skin and more breakouts down the road so those are theoretical mechanisms by which pantothenic acid might help give you clear radiant skin however there are a few problems that i should point out with the way that these studies were done first of all very short period of time 12 weeks i know you know for teenagers with acne that seems like a lifetime obviously you wanted to clear up fast but 12 weeks is pretty short so we don understanding of the long-term ramifications how you know how long do you have to take it um you have to take it indefinitely is it safe to take it indefinitely what are the long-term potential adverse effects as i said pantothenic acid is pretty safe and you mostly just pee out what you don you know absorb uh however you know we don we don interfere with other medications hard to say uh so there was pretty small too not a ton of people and somewhere around 50 and one thing that i noticed is that there were very few men in this study um doesn they they tend to once they once they reach adulthood acne doesn typically is no longer a problem it tends to affect women throughout adulthood so that that surprising but my point is if you teenager or a young person a young male with acne i want i just question would this be as beneficial given that there are so few male participants the elephant in the room though with this study is that it designed actually to test if pantothenic acid is beneficial for acne instead it tests is the supplement panthothen beneficial for acne and that pantothenic acid specifically and you like what the heck is she talking about well this trademark supplement is more than just pantothenic acid it acid and it also has all the other b vitamins it has thymine 1.5 milligrams riboflavin 1.7 milligrams niacin 20 milligrams b6 2 milligrams folate 400 micrograms uh b12 in the form of cyanocobalamin i always have a hard time spitting that out six micrograms and biotin another b vitamin at 300 micrograms plus it has l-carnitine in the supplement at 733.3 milligrams so there are a few other players going on now i mentioned that the study was placebo control but the placebo pill didn anything in it it you know it didn have any any of these other ingredients so the study doesn the outcome of pantothenic acid supplementation specifically it addresses it tests the outcome of pantothen this trademark supplement in acne uh and that we already know that like some of these b vitamins like niacin it how do we know that that helping the acne also the l-carnitine has been shown at least in lab-based studies to have a sibo-suppressive effect so that could be really what is doing the work the other interesting thing that i point out is that we supplementation with high doses of certain b vitamins is associated actually with worsening acne for example biotin supplements have been reported to worsen acne and it enough that the reason this might happen is that biotin competes with pantothenic acid as far as absorption and so maybe people who over supplement with biotin they don of the of the pantothenic acid from their diet so they get you know a little bit of a low level but this product has biotin in it at 300 micrograms and again remember i told you they at 12 weeks so i question you know if the if the users continue to take this without biotin maybe it start interfering with some of the benefit we don of course with biotin is that it actually can interfere with the accuracy of certain blood tests namely tests that are run in the setting of determining if you attack so obviously throughout this 12-week study nobody but you know say say later on you develop some kind of a problem you need testing uh you know go to your doctor and get get blood work done maybe that supplement might actually interfere with the accuracy so that and then the other thing we appreciate a worsening of acne with high doses of b12 and it might actually interfere with the gene expression of ketobacterium acnes a little bacteria that lives in the pore and is responsible in part for acne um now i will point out that um most of the data suggests the data suggesting that is with methylcobalamin um a different form of b12 that is more readily absorbed in the panthen supplement you cyanocobalamin so less absorbed in comparison to to methyl but still you know something to take into account maybe you to capture these things in a 12-week study i can panthothenic acid supplements are the key to clear skin because this study just doesn it it tests is panthothen the trademark supplement that has more than just panthenic acid in it is that the key to clear skin after 12 weeks uh the the participants had fewer acne lesions clearer skin after 12 weeks but is that the secret long term to clear skin big unknown there potential long-term adverse effects of taking this supplement big unknown although overall likely is safe again your body handles excess b vitamins pretty well excretes them through the urine pantothenic acid is abundant in many foods that you can incorporate into your diet it in meat is it high in lentils shiitake mushroom avocado is packed with pantothenic acid as is cabbage and sweet potato and broccoli one of my favorite vegetables uh so yeah i mean you can just make sure that you you are very likely to be getting these b vitamins in more than adequate amounts uh you know unless you have a confirmed deficiency or insufficiency then just taking a supplement uh you just peeing out the peeing out the pantothenic acid so in my opinion it this from your diet from actual food sources and it so again it deficient in b5 maybe perhaps some people have slightly low levels and that makes them more likely to have worse acne but try incorporating some of these foods into your diet on a consistent basis on a regular basis and you know that might help not to mention these foods have other beneficial compounds in them like for example avocado is rich in healthy fats that are helpful for the moisture barrier and for healthy shiny skin and hair you know sweet potato has carotenoids in it which help your skin handle inflammation better and fight off free radical damage better and you know lentils are packed with minerals broccoli actually can help through a complicated mechanism it actually can help uh boost up your skin namely glutathione you guys there quick solution to get clear radiant skin uh there deliver results or anything like that but having a balanced diet that includes a diverse array of whole foods is going to help your skin long term it guarantee the you know acne control or anything like that but it will help your skin health overall by ensuring adequate levels of essential vitamins minerals amino acids fatty acids things that are really important for the moisture barrier for control of inflammation for reduction of oxidative stress and for controlling skin cell turnover and oiliness so that that is it you know you don after a supplement but overall this supplement seems to be pretty safe and unlikely to cause harm i would definitely like to see more studies however comment below if you have taken this supplement for your acne did you appreciate any skin benefit yeah the reviews on amazon are glowing but hey if you made it this far if i can teach you anything it don they are always biased and you going to get your answer from reading reviews uh truth be told they are they are riddled with misinformation and bias and a lot of times they are financially incentivized to leave those reviews yeah be always be cautious interpreting uh consumer reviews there are so many unknowns that you as a consumer will never have but that for clear skin i hope you all enjoyed this video if so give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don sunscreen and subscribe i guys tomorrow [Music] bye [Music] you	Success
HUM MIGHTY NIGHT CERAMIDE SUPPLEMENTS REVIEW| DR DRAY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA331IYr41Q	Dr Day	hey guys in today I ceramide supplements these as a reminder were gifted to me from home through the octoly platform in exchange for this review this is not a paid promotion or sponsored video but I did not pay for these myself they were sent to me in exchange for this review so you should know that going in I did not pay for them to cut to the chase though I don recommend that you go out and buy them and plunk down money for them and in today science behind the different ingredients and ultimately tell you why I don think they though I what I think most of you want to know about is what is the science behind taking a ceramide orally in a supplement for skin health Sarah mine is just a backtrack our lipids that are key component of our skin barrier they are essential for our skin barrier to function to keep our skin hydrated healthy and function as a barrier to the outside world they are the most abundant lipid in the very top layer of our epidermis which is called the stratum corneum and in conditions like eczema or atopic dermatitis as well as with aged ceramide synthesis can be deficient and as a result lead to dry skin and increase transit the dermal water loss and impaired barrier function so ceramides applied topically to the skin and moisturizers have been shown to be helpful in restoring skin barrier function and so with that there came about quite a bit of interest in taking ceramides orally a lot of this started out in Japan and would you actually have some studies showing that an oral ceramide supplement can potentially be helpful for skin barrier function now I supplements the ceramides are derived from wheat these are however gluten free so you know I how they are gluten free but it wheat seed extract so I guess I guess that makes some sense the gluten would not be present in that part but I would still be nervous if I had gluten sensitive enteropathy to take these but they they claim to be gluten free so yeah they plant-derived ceramides ceramides are actually present a lot of different wheats and greens present and rice so they there are animal mammalian derived ceramides and you know we outs as human so our ceramides are a little bit different from plant ceramides but the studies i want to tell you guys about today we supplementation with plant derived ceramides there was a three-month study of 51 women with dry skin at baseline that showed that a ceramide meat extract such as what is contained in the hamsa comment significantly increased the hydration of their stratum corneum that well as increased measurements of skin hydration not only on the arm but also on the legs this study was done over three months so it suggests that suggests that it may be helpful for skin hydration and there are some other studies looking at oral ceramide supplementation and showing improvement in measurements of trans epidermal water loss so they seem promising but a day is still very preliminary and these studies were very very small so it something that we can go about recommending on a general basis to the general public oh yeah you should be taking ceramides for your skin health and you know while it we might have more data to suggest it as a treatment for people with conditions like eczema we point we really just have very preliminary small studies and I out that we don understanding of pharmacokinetics of orally administered phytoceramides and by that I mean how how is it best absorbed what is the best formulation of the supplement be a capsule should it be a tablet should it be a liquid that you put on your tongue all these kinds of things I really don how it would best be absorbed and in what forms what ratios what doses and so really without that sort of knowledge it the best ceramide supplements because we don how it is but that being said because we have these few studies showing there improvement and measurements of transit Mederma water loss supplement companies are going to jump all over that and start to make a lot of claims about what else oral steroids can do and so of course they want to make you believe that it gonna change your skin revolutionize your skin but it may do nothing you know these studies were done in people with dry skin conditions at baseline so whether or not taking oral ceramides would be helpful if you don have a disease like eczema who knows it may do nothing and who knows if the ceramide the wheat ceramide in this is the same as what was done in the studies that suggest potential benefit the next ingredient though in these supplements is ubiquinol ah you mean panel or coenzyme q10 it the mid 50 part of our body lipid soluble meaning it dissolves in that antioxidant so it an antioxidant that is present in our body and all membranes of cells so this cell membranes have you be clean all in them and it in ourselves it is a cofactor for different enzymes in some of the little powerhouses within the cell and it also helps in reducing free radical damage so it including humans make coenzyme q10 it found in human blood in ranges of 0.1 0.4 micrograms per milliliter in some studies and other studies 0.41 to 1.60 micro moles per liter so it in the blood in other words where can you find it in the diet meat as well as dietary fats but in human skin on with age the levels of coenzyme q-10 actually begin to decrease which means we start to lose some of our ability to combat free radical damage that ultimately leads to skin aging so there was a 20-17 study that looked at supplementing Co Q 10 at 50 milligrams per day or 150 milligrams per day for 12 weeks it placebo-controlled study of 35 otherwise healthy subjects and at the end of the 12 weeks both the 15 milligrams per day group and the 150 milligrams per day group had a decrease in wrinkles and micro relief lines with a little fine fine wrinkles and lines as well as overall improved skin smoothness in comparison to placebo and both doses were effective at that the higher dose 150 milligrams per day goes showed additional improvement though in wrinkles around the Nate what nasolabial folds as well as the corners of the mouth and the upper upper lip lines so suggest that higher doses may have more benefit in terms of some of the deeper wrinkles but coenzyme q10 didn skin hydration so I really only seem to be helpful and wrinkles but not necessarily dryness in other ones so that healthy people in other words we don have a lot of data to support supplementation with coq10 for any particular skin condition or the general public who is otherwise healthy very small study in addition to the coenzyme q10 which if I didn is that 25 milligrams so these studies that I did the study that I just mentioned looking at 50 and 150 milligrams per day but this all 25 milligrams in it so not even the same dosage that the next ingredient in this is transfer Olek acid sound familiar that in your vitamin C serums from rolek acid is another antioxidant in this supplement it is a hundred milligrams you which by the way is roughly the same amount of folic acid as is in one kilogram of spinach about 2.2 pounds of spinach is the same amount of folic acid so you know that bag of what I call it the fresh and quicks pitch that I get at Costco looks like I acid by going through that and in four five days so I you know you can get it from your diet it it grains I already alluded the fact that it oats rye barley and rhubarb it easily absorbed and it stays in the blood for longer than any other antioxidant so it can persist around for a long time now you know that important because we do have studies like with vitamin E as well as b12 and b6 showing that high high levels supplementing with high high levels can actually increase the risk of different cancers namely lung cancer so given the transferor Lacasse it does get you a pretty high level and the blood just through our diet you really have to question like I wonder how safe it is to be supplementing with it as well and the truth of the matter is we don long-term safety data to address that that unknown risk that you are as you exposing yourself to you when you take a supplement like this with poorly studied ingredients in addition to that it also has available Aryan in it which is an ink Co lytic or calm it have a calming sealing property but a very poorly studied ingredient and not definitely not recommended as first-line for any kind of sleep disorder or any difficulty sleeping or anxiety so if you have anxiety do not believe that valerian is going to treat your anxiety be very misleading information but it is you know Santee totally people find that it is very calming so I guess that they put that in here to help you fall asleep at night that means out I tried these and did not find that it calm me down whatsoever I notice any effect I just took them for a few nights just to kind of give them more all for you guys and it also has something called hot flower extract and passion flower extract which again I probably going to be rich in antioxidants but whether or not they are while available in these soft gels is a big unknown these are vegan so you know that is why I was able to give them a try I do fall a vegan diet and you know I didn upset my stomach or anything like that I didn but you know there support the use of these ingredients of supplements and there unknown in terms of long term safety it risk and you know little established benefit not only that as I put it out in my last video supplements are non drugs they are not regulated by the FDA and they do not have to demonstrate safety or efficacy so while this is intended to be taken at night and it supposed to have this kind of calming effect anecdotally this also has peppermint oil as a kind of an active ingredient and I did kind of taste that when I saw these and peppermint oil can worsen your worsened reflux disease if you have if you have acid reflux or do you like you know at nighttime when you lie down peppermint can actually worse than that so if anything these might give you a little bit of acid reflux or worsening of your acid reflux so hopefully you guys can understand why I don are very poorly studied very little evidence to support any benefit to the skin I you know they literally as far as unknowns in terms of long-term safety you know my last video I pointed out some of the known risks with those ingredients like biotin and interfering with lab tests but these you know who knows a lot of a lot of a lot of these ingredients you know it we don information yeah because they something you know if it do clinical trials so we can look long-term at long-term outcomes of safety measures we have a better sense of things when we have controlled trials but in small things and in supplements where there standardization or reproducibility it becomes very very very very loosey-goosey so you know as physicians we recommend supplements because of that poor poor evidence to support their use potential harm and a big unknown as to which ones are the best ones if any to recommend to you guys so yeah you don need to plunk down big bucks on these supplements to support cell turnover at night all you have to do is go to sleep so you know that being said a lot of people suffer from sleep disorders and it cope with so if you suffering with those my heart goes out to you sleep is so imperative not only for you know looking good but for your brain function your day-to-day function your reaction times your responses driving safety it being sleep-deprived is a huge risk for forgetting an accident so you know that being said invest in strategies and techniques to ensure good sleep things like turning off your cell phones and computers a few hours before you go to bed don you go to sleep keep the room cool dark you know share your tips and tricks down be alone on the calm but my tip would be don this is just an expensive black box quite literally so that the mighty Knight thank you home for sending me of these supplements to review for you guys I hope this information was helpful to you all if you liked this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and that and subscribe I tomorrow

MSM PILLS, CREAMS, AND LOTIONS FOR SKIN CARE| DR DRAY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z8k7OlduH4	Dr Day	well hey guys I hope your week is going well I you all over the years to do a video talking about methyl sulfonyl methane or MSM you guys were wondering is taking it a good idea for skin health can it improve the look of skin or acne so this we but oral supplementation as well as MSM and topical preparations MSM is a dietary supplement that it popular and is pursued for a variety of ailments mostly as an anti-inflammatory MSM is actually very well studied in terms of its safety tolerability toxicology bioavailability there are many animal studies on MSM as well as human experimental studies and clinical trials demonstrating the tolerability and safety of MSM so much so that the FDA in 2007 deemed MSM generally regarded as safe for daily consumption doses somewhere around four grams per day so it tolerated and considered safe and effective in clinical studies health specific outcomes that have improved with supplementation of MSM include joint pain muscle aches and inflammatory condition in the bladder known as interstitial cystitis and it has a good backing of evidence to show that it is a functional antioxidant meaning it can help to scavenge free radicals that accumulate in the body and lead to damage and aging of body systems including the skin it also is a anti-inflammatory meaning it can lower inflammation in the body that drives things like arthritis muscle aches and skin aging and in addition to that it has some immunomodulatory properties meaning that it can help our immune system in our body behave in our favor and specifically in situations of stress and in stress response it can help kind of guy our immune system so it behave in our favor and not be as pro-inflammatory and damaging to to our body systems including the skin currently it is actively pursued as a supplement and has been studied in a variety of clinical settings but prior to that MSM was used primarily as a solvent similar to its parent compound dimethyl sulfide or DMSO DMSO or dimethyl sulfoxide has been extensively studied as a membrane penetration enhancer meaning it is an agent that can help get active ingredients into cells better and so it addition to being a solvent it has a long-standing track record an established track record as an antioxidant and as an anti-inflammatory so MSM is derived from DMS L in the late 70s crown Zellerbach chemists began to look at MSM to see if it demonstrated similar therapeutic potential I was the parent compound DMSO in 1981 the u.s. actually granted these chemists a patent to look at MSM as an ingredient to smooth and soften both the skin and nails as well as as an ingredient to be added to blood products as adil youant similar to parent count the parent compound DMS thereafter in addition to their work and the animal studies and larger studies and humans then in 2007 is when the FDA said okay this seems very safe so we it G Ras are generally regarded as safe and ever since then sales of MSM have been on the rise as a dietary supplement naturally MSM is made in the ocean by marine organisms algae plankton phytoplankton make MSM and it is subsequently aerosolized in the atmosphere deposited in the soil and taken off and incorporated in plants to varying degrees the accumulation of MSM implants varies based on the species in a variety of environmental conditions the technicalities of which I well-versed on but suffice it to say there is naturally-occurring MSM in plant whole food plants but at a very low level so there subsequently has been interest in generating this synthetic lace about as humans we can consume it at higher quantities not necessarily have to consume an ungodly amount of food to to get the benefit of MSM so synthetically made MSM is just made by a little lag reaction of DMSO which is a parent compound with peroxide hydrogen peroxide and that results in MSM daily ingestion of synthetic MSM at judges of three grams per day and human subjects has been shown to increase serum levels of MSM and with ongoing use those serum levels remain elevated and continue to increase suggesting that MSM can accumulate in the body with continued use I already mentioned it anti-inflammatory and antioxidant and has immune regulatory functions but it also a sulfur donor and therefore functions to strengthen protein protein interactions oral MSM is safe and well tolerated but topically applied MSM in creams and lotions has been investigated in a few small human studies and appears to be very well tolerated and is not irritating both in animal models as well as in human studies so it doesn to be problematic as far as tolerability safety for topical use one of the first studies looking at MSM and skin appearance showed an improvement in skin texture and skin appearance kind of by subjective grading of Examiners as well as participant self-assessment and some instrumental analysis another study looked at another human study looked at doing chemical peels with pyruvic acid and MSM in combination they did for chemical peels separated by periods of time of two weeks and in that study of in people they showed an improvement in hyperpigmentation subjects with melasma had improvement in their melasma there was also an improvement in skin elasticity and skin texture and the degree of wrinkling was also lessened and then the next human study that we have suggesting benefit in the skin is one looking at a supplement that contained both silymarin as well as MSM in people with rosacea people with rosacea taking this supplement for one month at the end of one month they should improve measurements and some of the symptoms of rosacea by burning redness irritation and itch one of the more recent studies that I with and have found looking at MSM as a supplement and showing it potentially to be beneficial is a randomized placebo-controlled trial that looked at a supplement that contained three ingredients not just MSM but three ingredients in total it contains 200 milligrams of hyaluronic acid 500 milligrams of L carnosine and 400 milligrams of MSM and it was a randomized control placebo randomized placebo-controlled trial and at the end of two months obtained this supplement subjects who are taking this supplement had an improvement in skin hydration and elasticity through instrumental analysis based methods and they also showed a decrease in sebum production and so that suggests that MSM maybe as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory can be beneficial for improving the appearance of skin and the skin hydration in terms of another outcome they showed also was an improvement in wrinkles around the eyes peri orbital wrinkles crow there was an improvement in the appearance of those and subjects taking this supplement as opposed to the placebo but a problem with this study is it these outcome is due to which compound in the supplement the study authors positive out it all three things that are giving this this outcome that they it degree each one helps for what in terms of the observed outcome on sebum because I know a lot of you guys are wondering is this helpful for acne is it beneficial for acne the study authors pointed out that they really couldn draw any solid conclusions about the decrease in sebum because all study participants at the beginning of the study had differing amounts of baseline sebum so it not and they think that they saying you know kind of their average ended up being lower due to differences in starting sebum from the different from the different participants so really hard to say for sure but they posit perhaps it might have something to do with the hyaluronic acid but they really couldn wouldn for for acne per se as I said it has been deemed generally regarded as safe a dosage is less than four thousand eight hundred and forty five point six milligrams per day again we do have evidence that taking it daily it does lead to bioaccumulation it for sure how beneficial it is so take-home point it really doesn to be harmful but you know I wouldn I wouldn from MSM the other thing I is that while it is generally safe there no side effects MSM because it is a sulfur like compound there is some thought and some anecdotal reports of this interacting with alcohol meaning if you drink alcohol and you take the supplement it can have a reaction and make you sick this is something that we see with an occasion called antabuse that is given to people with alcohol abuse disorders alcoholism to deter them from consuming alcohol because they take the medication if they drink alcohol and make something terribly sick called a diet self um reaction it can happen with other with antibiotics that have sulfur like moieties to them to a certain degree and so the degree to which that occurs with MSM supplementation has not been examined really but there are anecdotal reports of people feeling sick when they drink alcohol and consume us so be conscientious of that and aware of that if you are taking this as a supplement that that might be something that you might not enjoy as a potential side effect I know you all are always curious about MSM creams and lotions and which ones can I recommend I really struggle to recommend any of them I data and topical use at this point they benefit and I don dialed down the concentration or the vehicle whether it needs to be a lotion or cream and the other reason that I apprehensive to recommend MSM creams is that by and large the majority are the ones that I find that I other ingredients that can be irritating most of them contain essential oils for whatever reason and you guys know essential oils they really can cause a lot of problems with irritation in order to contact dermatitis and they can degrade and topical products and cause a really problematic irritation for example there are a lot of creams out there MSM creams out there they have tea tree oil in it tea tree oil I have a video on it really has some issues in terms of stability so I recommend an MSM cream knowing that there is one MSM cream on Amazon I found that does not have that and does not have essential oils in it it for two ounces what is the brand Oh at last Naturals $9.99 for two ounces I disclaimer I don good or not but that is one that I have found that doesn does contain aloe vera in it I talking about aloe vera and topical products and how it can be helpful so check that out if you are wondering about aloe but it product that I found on Amazon does have aloe in it but it doesn tree oil or some of the other essential oils not a lot of them do so I feel like you know maybe that okay but again I I before so disclaimer I I really can say for sure if that I interested comment below though you guys if you use MSM products which ones you use I know Madhuri labs makes one but again that has essential oils in it I know Sun foods makes a couple of them and some topicals all again with fragrance and essential oils you know kind of hard for me to recommend those and just kind of the lack of strong evidence to push for MSM in terms of skin benefit so I really haven the claims that MSM can improve acne can improve the appearance of post inflammatory hyperpigmentation from healing acne or acne redness I lot of testimonies online of what MSM does for people I just don clinical data to support those statements and those claims things like post inflammatory hyperpigmentation post inflammatory redness and acne they tend to gradually improve over time so whenever I read that I did that actually improve because of that product or did it improve because that is the nature of the disease process so you know a little bit of skepticism on my part that this actually works topically to any great degree so I hope this video is helpful to you guys in terms of MSM what it is seems to be a pretty safe though so if you liked it give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don sunscreen and subscribe I guys tomorrow [Music]	Success
SUPPLEMENTS FOR HAIR GROWTH| Q&A WITH DERMATOLOGIST DR DRAY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAb4c0o5M7A	Dr Day	while hey guys I hope your week has gone well in today into a topic that I get questions about and that is the role for different supplements different botanics vitamins what have you in treating female and male pattern hair loss is a type of hair loss that is referred to as androgenetic alopecia the genetic part underscores the fact that there is a genetic tendency towards this condition but it is very common presenting in 70% of males on you know roughly 30 to 40 percent of females at any time in their adult wife and I consists of thinning of the hair and bald patches and man this tends to occur on the crown on the vertex of the scalp as well as it presents with a receding hairline but in women it presents us just a few spinning of the hair and hair gradual hair loss over time and it is a very very frustrating condition to cut with particularly when it has been going on for quite some time I have many videos dedicated to the different treatments that are FDA approved for androgenetic alopecia a video talking about minoxidil minoxidil is the only over-the-counter treatment that is FDA approved for hair loss in men and women and you guys know the limitations in minoxidil it it irritating to many people it can be drying and for women in particular one really annoying side effect associated with minoxidil is that if it trickles down on your face it can cause high perch are Co SACEUR hair growth in those areas so it to keep up with and you guys know for my minoxidil video that once you stop it then the hair loss just goes back to you where it would have been in the beginning how do you never use minoxidil so this is really frustrating a lot of people to here they want they to fix the problem and they don it to just hide the problem I have a video talking about just kind of supplements in general for hair skin and nails and sort of my issue with supplements and that is that supplements just in general they they medications are in that they do not have to demonstrate necessarily efficacy or safety and they don level of monitoring and scrutiny oz s prescription and over-the-counter drugs so for example minoxidil in the case of an over-the-counter or in the case of a prescription pill for hair loss and I talked about before finasteride which goes by the brand name for pichia you know that is well known and it well studied for for male pattern hair loss so you know supplements they bit they to speak but they do have some evidence to support their role in male and female pattern hair loss that do a dedicated video on this topic because you see them everywhere and I continue to get questions so first up botanicals I think these are an area that are really popular and you guys are most curious about particularly you men out there who are frustrated with the idea of having to take potentially finasteride you don so you have asked in many of my videos what about plants DHT blockers so there are a variety of plant based supplements botanical based supplements that function kind of their function is postulated to be to decrease something called 5-alpha reductase activity which is the enzyme responsible for the production of something called dihydrogen stas Tyrone dihydrotestosterone is the culprit hormone at the level of the hair follicle responsible for both male and female female pattern hair loss that little male hormone that everyone has both men and women in some individuals those with a genetic tendency there is a sensitivity of the hair follicle to that and it results in premature hair loss premature thinning of the hair in that vocal we don and to what degree there are some randomized controlled trials however looking at supplements botanic supplements that are postulated to work this way specifically there is a small randomized control trial the demonstrated efficacy of a 5 alpha reductase inhibitor a botanic 5 alpha reductase inhibitor in the treatment of male pattern hair loss in men so specifically this was a study looking at a combination of two plant extracts saw palmetto as well as something called beta Saito steer all and interestingly 60% of the men in this randomized controlled trial had improvement in the density of hair growth in the scalp whereas 11% of the placebo men in this study had improvements but what nice about this supplement I think what is attractive about it is that there are no reported adverse side effects specifically there are no reported adverse sexual side effects I think fears around it is fear surrounding the potential for some of the sexual side-effects that I addressed in my finasteride video there of patients a lot of consumers have fears around those and not you know they don this appears to be a a alternative although how effective it is in comparison to finasteride it seems it there was an open label study so this is just people coming in and getting getting a supplement that contained biggest itas beta side of steer all the 5 5 alpha reductase inhibitor and the DHT lowering botanic along with green tea extract green tea is a polyphenol that functions as an antioxidant so it can scavenge free radicals there damage going on in the hair follicle due to inflammation that potentially could dampen that and in this study they demonstrated a statistical improvement in hair growth hair mass index meaning the the mass of hair in the prior area of hair loss that improved statistic to assistance 2 and statistical significance and there was an increase internal hair growth they they determine this through objective measurements something a little trichogramma so they were just you know looking willy-nilly and also they had improvement in the hair density by photographs comparative trial of saw palmetto versus finasteride at 24 months in this in this trial twenty at 24 months 68 percent of men who were treated with finasteride had improvement in hair growth at 24 months that finasteride already though however the other group those that just got saw palmetto 38 percent of them saw improvements so what this shows is that while saw palmetto is not as effective as finasteride it does seem to be helpful and again no adverse side effects were reported in that in that group so that that you know maybe maybe that you this that at this point appears to be safe but not as effective as finasteride but not not useless and then I get some questions about rosemary oil as well and to be honest with you I had never really heard about using rosemary oil topically for hair loss I mean it there not standard of care standard of care fda-approved treatment topically for hair loss in men and women is going to be minoxidil but you guys wanted to know about rosemary oil and there is a study that I found of a hundred patients who got either these were female patients on specify a hundred female patients who used either a rosemary oil or minoxidil 2% and interestingly at six months after using either treatment there was no stew there was improvement in hair and hair growth in both groups there was no statistical difference between the two groups so you know that kind of hints at the fact that at the idea that I rosemary oil is something we should be exploring exploring further as an alternative to minoxidil it appeared to be well tolerated in the study with no adverse side effects however you know as a small study a very short window of time they not very long and in terms of looking at the looking at the you know life cycle of the hair very very preliminary very very overly bought you know I can see why you all were interested in it and it may be something that has been pitched to you as as a treatment for hair loss doesn now what about vitamins I have talked in my videos numerous times about biotin biotin continues to be a mainstay and hair supplements it continues to be you know promoted sold there are thousands of biotin supplements over the counter that you for hair loss many dermatologists frequently you know say short take biotin it might be helpful I myself you know have told patients to take biotin for hair loss but as I told you guys in a video in my video on hair skin and nail someone the hair literature out there there really no supporting evidence to to to support the role for biotin supplementation in hair loss biotin is critical for the growth of the hair and nails and the success of you know hair growth and nail growth but in the developed world in particular biotin deficiency it is incredibly at rare I mean there are few genetic diseases that are rare and when biotin is you know there are issues with the metabolism and absorption of biotin those individuals do you have hair loss as a result of God and you know that biotin supplement is actually mandatory for life and those in many in those people but you know everyone else out there biotin deficiency very very very very unlikely and so there to support just taking biotin supplements for hair loss in the absence of biotin deficiency is it harmful you know we we recommending it but if you over call back to my hair skin and nail supplement video we do know now that a lot of the biotin supplement that the biotin supplements can interfere with the accuracy of certain labs lab tests you might have so it can the accuracy of thyroid studies the other vitamin that husband examined is vitamin b3 which is niacin applied topically to the scalp there is some evidence that in women not resulted in an improvement in hair hair thickness subjective improvement so in other words women applying nice topically like an Angele and an oil Dejan they felt like their hair was healthier thicker and they had improvement in hair loss and you know anything you would put on your skin always says the potential to cause irritation for you so you know that that could run into but otherwise seems to be okay and then one area that I think gets undersold to you is the role for topical zinc in topical zinc pyrithione containing shampoos I mentioned this in my recent a recent Walgreens shop with me video I pointed out the the anti dandruff shampoos right next to the hair supplements I a moment and I mentioned not you know we kind of a Missouri observed anecdotally that we tell patients to use an anti dandruff shampoo sometimes that seems to help their hair loss and it turns out you know we know that zinc pyrithione can inhibit some that only East that naturally lives on our skin who may just call some low-grade inflammation that can kind of contribute further and we do have good evidence down zinc pyrithione containing anti-dandruff shampoos do perform quite well in in helping hair growth specifically there was a randomized control trial looking at subjects with with pattern hair loss who used for six months again a short window used either one percent zinc parathion shampoo or they use standard 5% minoxidil brand name Rogaine or a third group used both and what though about this study that is that the group that used inc pyrrha theone after six months had improvement in their hair density and hair growth less hair thinning less hair shedding likewise a group treated with minoxidil saw the same thing however the group that that was treated with both minoxidil and zinc piratey on shrimp combination they they got better but they didn group treated with just minoxidil so in other words it doesn appear to give you any additive benefit but it definitely can help so it know low risk potential for high high reward the one supplement that I about I get questions about and I have a video about collagen supplements collagen supplements for you notice hairs if most of your skin and talking about wrinkles and fine lines but what about for hair marine fish extract marine extracts fish colleges there are us actually they studies looking at this for how dirty hair loss specific mostly in females the visit couch I have here I got this as a sample at a recent meeting I don this because it fish it vegan diet this is shark cartilage and oyster oyster extract powder it is a dietary supplement this different marine collagen and there have been five randomized control trials looking at marine collagen to date four of them were done in women using the visit Cao Viscount and in all of those studies women have show that there is an increase in the hair count the number the actual number of hairs with taking the discount and decrease in shedding and women are in these studies are much happier compared to you compared to those who do not take it so it definitely seems to help how much it you know these studies don us that kind of information but it seems promising and they don any side effects it that you know that that effect you know the same still holds true true is what I videos supplements kind of like the wild wild west you never know what you getting they you know they don the same level of safety and efficacy but you know here in the hair in the realm of hair loss and pattern hair loss we do have some some studies albeit small looking at these things not sure they tolerated and they seem to be saved so I hope this video is helpful in addressing your questions about these different supplements I learned a lot you know I didn topical rosemary oil and so thank you guys for always asking insightful questions I appreciate it if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen to subscribe to guys [Music]	Success
SUPPLEMENTS FOR HAIR, SKIN, AND NAILS| DR DRAY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKctKNrUex0	Dr Day	well hey guys I hope your week is going well so as you can tell from the title and thumbnail today to be one that has been so highly requested for quite some time and that is can I discuss the evidence for hair skin and nail gummies or vitamins as well as supplements for hair skin and nail health are these good something that we should be taking are they helpful so today cover the data that we have to support if any use of certain vitamins and supplements albeit it is quite limited but the first thing that I is biotin biotin is a water-soluble B vitamin that is an essential cofactor for many enzymes in the body frank biotin deficiency however is incredibly incredibly rare it only occurs in a very few select number of conditions it can happen in somebody who is in the hospital and on what parenteral nutrition and they to feats and that nutrition perhaps is not adequately supplemented with biotin so they can become biotin deficient there are certain rare diseases and abnormalities in the GI tract and which biotin is not absorbed and there are some rare genetic diseases with deficiencies in the enzymes that process biotin so in those cases biotin supplementation is essential for life and then a very unusual condition that can occur is in people who consume raw egg whites can actually become biotin deficient raw egg whites have a protein called avidin in it and the avidin can bind up biotin and make it unavailable for for what it body and therefore consumption of raw egg whites can lead to that cooking the egg whites denatures the avidin and therefore eliminates that risk but if anybody out there is drinking a ton of raw egg whites be careful you can develop biotin deficiency but otherwise biotin deficiency really in industrialized countries in particular is it no daily recommended biotin allowance it gut make most advance and that we need for our day-to-day function you know we obtain it just from our food so it supplement our diet with biotin outside those conditions that I already mentioned so where did this recommendation come from for biotin and biotin supplementation for hair skin and nails they you know biotin has been something that has been suggested for hair loss and dermatology probably dating back to you around the 80s I want to say not only in dermatology but also in pediatrics it was recommended that biotin be given to any child presenting with hair loss as well as some other symptoms of biotin deficiency and the recommendation for this perhaps was rooted in the fact that biotin is fairly low risk and in children presenting with those symptoms supplementation of biotin should they have something say like a genetic biotin enzyme disease could help them so perhaps that came from but as far as hair loss in general you know in the 60s there was actually a study of 46 females who took on I don supplementation just sort of variable doses of not biotin and no effect was observed on a hair in that study then in the 80s there was a study in dogs it kind of unusual 119 dogs you had quote dull coat I don I unknown factors these dogs were given five milligrams of by ten for ten kilograms of weight for three to five weeks and of those dogs 60% of them had resolution of their dull hair 31% of them had a partial resolute if they change so that kind of got people interested I guess invites in for human hair bear in mind that human hair biology and the human hair cycle and dog hair biology and dog hair cycle they entirely different their the the physiology governing the hair cycle and the the chemistry they different but that where we started getting intrigued by biotin for hair loss um however at the molecular level we don support to suggest that biotin is helpful for hair biology at the molecular level it doesn keratin production and has no effect on proliferation of the hair cells themselves so really there is quite limited if any evidence to support the use of biotin for hair hair growth outside of two conditions one is an individual acid which is the seizure medication that is given not only for seizure disorders but also a variety of neurological neurologic diseases and psychiatric conditions mood disorders those individuals as a result of the eval prog acid drug can develop hair loss related to the drug and it has been shown that supplementation a biotin in that condition can help improve their hair and help improve that side effect and it interferes somehow in by two metabolism and perhaps contributes you to that hair loss to that hair shedding it really been rigorously substantiated but those individuals will will show improvement when they take supplemental bites and then another very rare and unusual condition called pili triangle i at canaliculi which this a genetic hair shaft deficient disorder which the hair the hair shaft itself has a little triangular shape to it and a groove on it it syndrome the presents in young children or an early adolescence as just hair that is literally uncomfortable it looks like spun glass it and the hair doesn those children it has been you know a an attempted intervention is to supplement with biotin basically because we never known what else to do to help and biotin for the most part is fairly safe so we a try and in children with uncommon well hair syndrome treated with supplemental biotin they uncle uncle noble hair improves in many cases that being said a lot of cases of uncommon well hair syndrome will improve spontaneously as the child grows regardless of what you do so whether or not they improvement on biotin has anything to do with biotin we don but it in that situation because it is so unusual and you know I of cases of it myself I think one of you in the comments has this condition so yes biotin is usually recommended for that so that don hair shedding related to you like medical illness or crash dieting or pregnancy or birth control pills we have no evidence that it slows male pattern hair loss or improves male pattern hair loss or female hair loss female balding we have no evidence for that any any any hair condition outside of what I rigorous evidence or randomized controlled trials to support this recommendation for biotin supplementation for hairs really those those are the only two conditions there of biotin for skin health none whatsoever as far as nails there is a one condition in which it is recommended to supplement with biotin and that is brittle nails syndrome so brittle nails syndrome you know effects oftentimes women can be related to you know age-related change and we don supplementation helps helps this condition we just have observed that it does it tends to observe it tends to improve the condition of brittle nails syndrome usually about two to three months after the biotin has been supplemented and the recommendation are kind of how how it is is delivered if you will is the individual with brittle nails syndrome is followed if they improve on the bunch and then you know it is stopped if the brittle nails Syndrome returns it is resumed if they don biotin is stopped because there sense in taking something that isn helping so that comes into play often times for nails is in the condition brutal male syndrome it doesn general for nail growth we don any evidence to support that personally a while ago I was taking buy it to myself and I noted anecdotally an improvement of mine in my nails I have since stopped taking biotin and I haven so long story short I recommend it you know to people in these in select conditions and for the most part it appears to be very safe so we felt pretty comfortable being a little cavalier with it what commonly reported adverse effects are a little bit of GI upset and many of you report acne on this on when you take by to in supplementation report flares of your acne I over and over again I tell me that I have spoken with other other dermatologists you know my colleagues and they too have had patients come and say yeah I think my acne is getting worse that this five cent supplement and then it gets better when they stop we don any studies showing that for sure but that is something that people report but the thing that you should be aware of is that biotin supplementation we now have have more evidence and found out can actually interfere with the accuracy of certain lab tests and that specifically a lab test for example thyroid function testing bias and supplementation can with the accuracy of thyroid thyroid function test it can interfere with the accuracy of certain tests used to detect if you might be having a heart attack and certain tests you detect if you might be having a presentation of congestive heart failure so that of scary you know if you are somebody with a cardiac history you have chest pain and you go to the emergency room one day with with new chest pain the bloodwork that they might take in in order to evaluate your chest pain to determine if you are having a heart attack or or a congestive heart failure or what have you it could be falsely negative because a biotin supplementation we now know that and for me personally I taking the biotin I probably in about a year but it is something that we continue to recommend particularly in the cases that in the situations that I have mentioned for which it seems to be helpful all right and then the next ingredient that we have a little bit of evidence for something called saw palmetto saw palmetto is derived from the American dwarf pine and this is something that can inhibit the enzyme 5 alpha reductase as well as antagonize testosterone so these are two components of things that play a role in male pattern and female pattern hair loss there is one double-blinded placebo-controlled trial that looked at a pill called hair Genesis that had 200 mil it has 200 milligrams of salt palmetto plus 50 milligrams of beta C tosser all in people taking that 60 percent self-reported improvement in their hair loss in comparison to the placebo group only 10% reported improvement southbound Mehta appears to be safe it does not appear to interact with any medications that we know of this common adverse side effect from saw palmetto it is a little bit of GI upset does it appear to also renew any as well and you interfere with any blood work so it seems to be fairly safe but how effective it is for hair loss that really the only the only data that we have to be honest then there is this supplement on think by online that people ask me a fair amount about a Bacoor this is a this is a three-part system of course it and fifty dollars for our shampoo some sort of topical solution in a supplement the supplement has inko bilberry saw palmetto which i horsetail so the saw palmetto you know I told you the evidence for that the other three things we don for in hair loss but that there their website summarizes these clinical these you know this clinical study in which people saw improvement in their hair loss but that clinical study is not actually published it a peer-reviewed journal and the only way you can obtain it is if you buy the body of a car so I can about the efficacy of a car I don recommend it to anyone I on that then the other supplement is marine extracts marine extract is what is in supplement the dis cow which is sold to promote hair growth again not something I recommend or that has rigorous evidence to support recommending this supplement but there have been some there has been one report of visual at least people reporting visual improvement in male and female pattern hair loss and it seems to be well tolerated so you know there haven been any reports of adverse outcomes on it but whether or not it can really not any evidence to so I don tell people to go out and take bringing extracts for any type of hair loss there then the other thing is oral zinc supplementation oral zinc supplement station really has only been shown to be helpful in cases of hair loss and children who are deficient in zinc due to very very rare conditions zinc deficiency is very very rare so there really not any evidence to go suggesting supplementing with oral zinc for hair skin or nail health there is a little bit of evidence for zinc for acne but the reports on its success are conflicting and it can cause some GI upset so not not recommended not enough evidence to to recommend it then last up the only other ingredient that I definitely think bears mentioning because I get asked about it a ton is collagen supplements and you know when I first heard my channel two years ago there really was only laboratory data at that time to suggest you know perhaps taking a collagen supplement could be helpful for skin and I wasn impressed with that since that time you know in June of this year there have been some more studies and actual people and with that appear to be promising again preliminary early stuff from limitations of being small and underpowered but promising okay for collagen supplements specifically taking low molecular weight collagen peptides at a thousand milligrams for 12 weeks in 64 women ages 40 to 60 who had a diagnosis of photo damaged skin all right so you had to you had to have photo damaged skin at baseline those women after 12 weeks showed improvement in skin hydration wrinkling and elasticity then there is another small study looking at OVA derm which is derived from ground-up eggshells and that showed improved hydration in the skin and some improved elasticity as well then the other studies are largely in largely in skin models and in laboratory laboratory conditions so the collagen supplementation is potentially promising but not not enough data definitely to make it a routine recommendation or any kind of standard of care recommendation or says to suggest that it it really hasn for that long to have a good sense of how safe it is and if it might interfere with with you know medications and things like that really don seems to be fairly well tolerated and is very popular on the Internet so there that but you know it personally I don it and I don because there recommend it at this point so yes that is really all I can say about what evidence we have in terms of different nutraceuticals different supplements those are kind of the main ones out there and really what there is as far as actual literature to support the use but big picture wise as far as supplements what I want to communicate to you is the supplement industry is like the cosmetic industry it that supplement manufacturers make are not regulated at all they can say whatever they want the FDA has no oversight into supplements whatsoever they don regulate them these supplements are not required to demonstrate safety efficacy [Music] purity anything like that and you know there have been cases in the past of supplements that are contaminated there as purity like you would get from a prescription drug so they come with some risks not only are they not regulated they way that prescription drugs are so we can people are using purity of it how it interferes with lab things and how it might interact with medications it to track those things when you have something that is unregulated and there are so many so many different supplements out there with such a little oversight so buyer beware you know these things are not necessarily safe and not necessarily you know there little data to support using them so you kind of have to ask yourself is it worth putting myself potentially at risk for something that frankly at the end of the day not a whole lot of research to support its use on my channel I get requests all the time to review certain hair and nail gummies that there of passion for in YouTube I think what was it maybe six months ago there were some very specific hair nail gummies that I was asked to review on a daily daily basis and I have no intention of going into every single hair nail supplement out there my hope is that this video will provide you with with the evidence-based knowledge to kind of make an informed decision for yourself as to if you want to pursue any particular hair skin and nail gummy but at this point you know I don them outside of the cases that I mentioned to patients generally and I don know an valproic acid I don mobile hair syndrome so I don take any of these I don nails syndrome so for me personally I don and enough evidence for me to recommend them clinically to anyone that I see so you know it it doesn to go reviewing all of these I have no way of objectively giving you that furthermore I would just caution you as well to you know tongue-in-cheek a little bit any anybody a particular hair and nails supplement it not improve all taking a supplement or things didn as their skin hair and nails but big picture wise is the dermatologist I can hopefully impart this on you the complex biology of the hair cycle of nail growth is regulated and controlled and and modified and influenced by so many factors out there that somebody hey I and you know my hair is great whether or not that has anything to do with the gummy or just the fact that a lot of hair and nail things eventually with time albeit slowly it can you as the viewer or friend or whatever you have no way really of knowing completely the full picture of what going on for that individual have they have they been sick in the past year that led to a hair loss later on that improved on its down as it would otherwise and maybe that improvement coincided with them taking this vitamin who knows are they have they been on other medications in the past do they do they start and stop birth control pills have they been pregnant at all during this time did they have some fibroid issues at one point that I have been addressed now and slowly their hair loss is recovering those are all potential reasons have they been on any have they don exercise routines in the past year and you kind of crash diets these are all part of their medical history now you not gonna know are taken that influenced how that person skin may be responding nothing to do with the supplement so you really can yet you really can objective review of a hair skin and nail vitamin it you need studies for that you need a randomized control trial to really give you objective information otherwise you know it your favorite gummy like because it cute or this one happens to be vegan or you know I like this person and they promoting it and that know you can make that decision yourself those are those are just objective components that go into picking that objectively though I can information on I and nail supplement but at the end of the day there very little evidence to support to support their use not saying can helpful not saying you might not see improvement just can can where why how etc but if you are electing to take a supplement a few tips you can look for certification on the supplement that it has been independently tested to at least affirm that the dosages of the active ingredients that they there or in there at the amount they saying and that the supplement is not contaminated there are a variety of things like the USP organization I list some of the names of these independent testers down below you can can look for that certification on on your supplements to give you a little bit of extra in assurance that the product is is at least not contaminated and at least contains the dosage that the manufacturer is claiming and then lastly I will link down below the link to the FDA if you are someone you love is taking a supplement and you believe you develop an adverse I rash or a bad reaction some you report acne with certain supplements you know report that to the FDA that you know I can help people down the road the FDA it can go in and potentially if they get enough reports of that maybe they whether or not they do I don it reporting you know it could potentially could potentially help people down the road so I hope this video was helpful to you guys if you liked it give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don subscribe [Music]	Success
How To Treat Baby Acne On The Face: Dermatologist Tips	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2FCRFt3kGA	Dr Day	why on Earth is my sweet tiny little baby who is pretty fresh out of the kitchen if you know what I mean why does my little baby have acne what is going on what is happening why is this happening well don don dermatologist and I you that babies do in fact get acne they actually have a few different flavors of acne available for baby to get and we going to talk about these why they happen how to go about dealing with it and what to expect first and foremost watch the video don to Tik Tok YouTube shorts and go searching for some home remedy for baby acne cuz I guarantee you encounter somebody wrapping their baby up in Castor oil you don that trust me um no castor oil mummy baby okay so what is going on so first of all there are kind of two main flavors of baby acne the first happens usually around the age of about 2 weeks but it will have its onset within their first 6 weeks of being on the planet fresh out of the kitchen so to speak this is a neonatal acne it can happen on the cheeks the chin the forehead the neck the chest the back neonatal acne you get these little red pimple-like bumps importantly you don blackheads and white heads there are no comedones because this is not true acne it looks like it but it parts if you will it remember acne has comeon blackheads and white heads the common terms for comedones there with neonatal acne why does my little sweet less than 6 week old okay that when this starts and that less than six week old baby have these pimples well a few things first of all guess who fresh out of the kitchen they there you guessed it that pesky annoying little yeast malesia yeah the one that causes dandr tinia Versa color fungal acne well newborn tiny babies they they can have some of the same issues going on with malesia yeast especially at that age so yeah for all intents and purposes neonatal acne is basically kind of thought to be like a neonatal version of fungal acne as it although it the correct name is malesia foliculitis or pitos foliculitis it that but there fact that babies at this age they actually make quite a bit of Androgen hormones uh because their little adrenal glands which sit on top of the kidneys are pumping out Androgen like hormones that signal to their sebaceous oil gland to put out seab buum oil neonatal acne is not uncommon it affects about 20% of newborn babies now calm down good news this doesn people always complain that they go to the dermatologist and all they do is write prescriptions guess what you don actually have to treat this doing nothing here is an option it is an option it is a reasonable option it is a great option because guess what do nothing and it goes away it goes away cuz with time the Androgen hormones kind of level out as babies developing their immune system develops so that they not quite as bothered by the anesthesia and this goes away importantly in contrast to a true acne which this is not uh remember there this will not scar baby will not be left with a scar which is why doing nothing is a good and reasonable option um now if you you you know you you want it cleared up your dermatologist can prescribe ketoconazol cream which I talking about ketoconazol it fungal that will help calm down that yeast and help this to clear up a little bit faster it usually goes away within a couple of weeks to maybe 4 months if you do nothing okay so deal with the prescription if you but remember doing nothing is is probably a lot more doable because now if you if you get a prescription then you you keep that in mind some people want to treat it understandable ketoconazol is an option because of the influence that Androgen hormones have boys are more likely to have neonatal acne than girls so they both get it and boys not only do they have their adrenal gland but they also have Androgen production from the test testes so there said once they get a little bit older that until they hit puberty and then the androgens they they they pick back up again signal to the oil gland and then that getting true acne now like I said there are a couple of different flavors of acne the reason I mentioned the six week thing is that if your baby has developed what you think is acne after the age of 6 weeks for for the first time they what looks like pimples for the first time after the after 6 weeks that probably something called infantile acne infantile acne and contrast to neonatal acne which remember before 6 weeks neonatal acne after 6 weeks likely infantile acne infantile acne is true acne there also blackheads and white heads there can be cysts with infantile acne you likely would want to consider perhaps seeing a dermatologist because there are some more things that could be going on it affects about 2% of children it is true acne so they white heads cysts nodules and the reason one of the reasons to see a Derm is that if it needs to be treated that important because if left untreated it actually can scar in contrast to neonatal acne where there was no scarring infantile acne can scar no one wants to scar their baby infantile acne untreated can persist 1 to 2 years infantile acne doesn anything to do with malesia say but does have to do with persistently elevated androgens which is another reason to see a dermatologist because yes that could be normal just part of how your baby normally is but there are certain underlying hormonal disorders like congenital adrenal hyperplasia for example for which there are abnormally High Androgen levels and that would need to be investigated so this more stubborn acne in your baby could be an early warning sign of that babies who have infantile acne they get acne when they become teenagers as well so how is infantile acne treated because the risk of not treating is scarring so many of the same treatments that we use to treat teenage and adult acne can actually be used in the infant kind of a first line approach would be topical arthro myosin an antibiotic benzo peroxide even Tron which I shocks people can and has been successfully used to treat infantile acne although you guys know from my videos troin can be pretty irritating so for a baby a low percentage strength but it can be necessary and an option there are even cases of neonatal acne treated with Accutane yep you can do that I know it sounds shocking but it can be done early initiation of effective treatments can help clear it up and prevent scarring that between the two different types of acne but also keep in mind there are other things that can happen especially on the head of little babies that look like acne and aren which is a type of heat rash milia little CIS and another condition called athema toxicum neonatorum so there are some mimickers so it may not be a slam dunk is what I it is your baby benefits of seeing a dermatologist for your baby confirm that it infantile versus neonatal you know there are some other mimickers of these conditions in young babies so you confirm the diagnosis which is key you also would then rule out internal reasons to have acne like I mentioned congenital adrenal hyperplasia for example hormonal disorders that your baby has causes of hyperandrogenism in a baby would need to be investigated in certain cases especially of infantile acne that is very stubborn and persistent and with infantile acne you initiate early treatment to reduce the risk of scarring what are some things that you can do well number one like I said don internet looking for remedies baby skin is still developing it lot more prone to irritation and again there are other issues that could be going on that are not acne and it may not be clear to you at the time what it is you the skin I say that all the time when it comes to adult skinc care but it definitely holds true for baby skinc care so don on your baby don try and exfoliate it away don use skin care products or over-the-counter acne treatments unless you pediatrician or your dermatologist when you bathe your child and wash their little face off just use lukewarm water water don don might want to pause is if you using um ointments on your child which generally are well tolerated and don but remember baby skin is kind of still developing their pores are very immature and so o heavy ointments might aggravate irritation around the pore opening more so in a little baby and be contributory so pause things like um petroleum jelly which love but you know in this case you might want to take a a break from it or other ointments for example all right so that infantile the key time point is 6 weeks of age acne that starts for the first time after 6 weeks of age in a baby is infantile acne and that where the consequences are a little bit more extreme not to say that your child is going to have scarring or has an underlying hormonal disorder but it worthwhile for sure seeing a dermatologist in those situations now moving on into Early Childhood acting between the ages of one to roughly 7 years of age before puberty is a lot more concerning for a potential underlying hormonal Disorder so that another situation where you definitely want to take it seriously it know kind of normal par for the course development but acne starting at puberty is a lot more common due to the increase in Androgen hor hormones that happens at that time adrin Archy and that results in more sebum production and starts the Cascade of things that can lead to acne and people who are predisposed to getting it remember all acne is hormonal this video hopefully illustrates that to you that even acne in babies is hormonal and in infants there contribution of remaining hormone from Mom that also can be playing a role all right y with regards to acne and a baby don freak out it does happen so I hope this video was helpful to you now on the end slight I all about skin care for kids and babies I do get a lot of requests for these types of videos but then no one watches them so I don but if that that one next but if you guys like this one give a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow bye [Music]	Success
*BEST* Skincare For Scars: Dermatologist's Picks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ucBjBi50RA	Dr Day	well hey guys we video we and I recommendations for affordable skin care for scars number one mistake to avoid when it comes to scars is assuming that there is a single best treatment for scars scars often require different procedures different approaches combined to get the maximal results mistake number two confusing surface changes like persistent redness hyperpigmentation with scarring they not the same thing yes you can have hyperpigmentation and redness overlying a scar you can have redness within a scar but in today talk about ingredients that address all of these things the redness the dark spots the thick and raised scars and the indented depressed scars now a topical retinoid can go a long way for a variety of these issues this is a daping it acne treatment it also prescription retinoids like troid to serotine tritin if you have a race that can scar over time this can help soften and smooth the surface of the race thicken scar topical retinoids such as adap also can improve collagen production and the deeper layers of the skin so if you have a depressed scar that can help subtly soften a bit and plump the skin now it will not get rid of those but it can over time with consistent use improve the appearance plus if your scarring is due to acne this will help control and prevent future breakouts now this alone may not be enough to control your acne but it a good start stting point and that important because so long as the acne goes untreated addressing the scarring is feudal because you have that process going on that is driving the scarring this is the exact same thing different brand adap also going to be helpful for hyperpigmentation it helps slow down the pigment producing process and helps lift up the hyperpigmentation up out of the skin plus it anti-inflammatory now if adapalene is not up your alley retinol is a version of topical vitamin A that also can have some benefits not an FDA approved treatment for anything it ingredient but with long-term consistent use may also improve collagen production but this particular product is uh inspired by cab resurfacing Retinol Serum it has licorice root and niacinamide licorice root is helpful for redness the niacinamide is also helpful for both redness and hyperpigmentation so this can be really helpful for overlying surface changes and P possibly possibly subtly soften the appearance of the depression of depressed scars now these hydrocolloid patches are helpful for people who have breakouts because they help reduce picking but they also serve as a protective barrier against frictional forces that can lead to the type of thick and raised scars so if you have acne that often heal with thick and raised scars this might help cut down on the picking as well as just protect it from those forces but regardless of if it redness or hyperpigmentation sun protection sun protection sun protection that radiation from the Sun including the UVA rays that come through window glass do impair the healing process they also regulate the factors that lead to hyperpigmentation inflammation redness Etc now whatever sunscreen you like enough to use consistently that is the that is the one to use I don it hybrid I don the one that you like that the best but I will mention that a tinted sunscreen might get you a little bit something extra in terms of the realm of hyperpigmentation because the iron oxides in tinted sunscreens can help protect to a certain extent against Blue Light that is visible light it not ultraviolet radiation though it does come from the Sun and the sun light is the one you need to concern yourself with that blue for people who have deeper skin tones can exacerbate hyperpigmentation and a tinted sunscreen offers some protection against that also your makeup that foundations also can protect so if you scar that also will get you a little bit but you don protection from that now those of you who have been around the over-the-counter hyperpigmentation game for some time now you probably are familiar with Ambi ever since hydrocone was removed from the market the Ambi fade cream is not unique compared to other skincare products it no longer has hydroc conone it has an niite it has um vitamin C which both of those can be helpful for dark spots and redness but guess what like the vast majority of moisturizers and things on the market have that um and Ambi fade cream also has a strong fragrance which can be irritating and the irritation this is key irritation anything that is irritating to your skin can aggravate redness hyper pigmentation make scarring more stubborn more involved this right here is one of the most evidence-based things for raise scars going on 40 years of use for raised scars we the silicone scar sheets intended to be worn Around the Clock can often be reused comfortable flexible protect against frictional forces also help hydrate the scar reduce certain triggers and Pathways that lead to more scar formation what about maderma maderma is an allent toen skin protectant with onion bulb extract onion bulb extract may have some anti-inflammatory compounds in it that could in theory be helpful for scars allent toin is a good ingredient for um scars any skin protectant um you know if you if you pick up a product and it says active ingredient da d d da and then purpose skin protectant that can ultimately be helpful for scar whether it dimethicone glycerin all by lubricating hydrating and protecting this also has sodium hyaluronate the salt of hyaluronic acid that does have fragrance though which again can be irritating and ultimately aggravate scars so not like the best option you just the plain uh medical grade silicone and yes I know I know I know I talking about how medical grade skincare is not a real thing there thing as medical grade skincare but there is such a thing as medical grade silicone as opposed to like machine Lubricant silicone for example it silicone that it is a real thing medical grade silicone speaking of which maderma also has silicone scar sheets so same thing we just talked about great for raised scars now silicone is not going to address depressed scars if you have ice pick scars rolling scars box carar scars this is not going to do anything there we topical retinoid like adapalene and interventions like uh laser resurfacing TCA cross also a drop a filler in depressed scars can smooth out and plump up the skin surface check out my video on fillers for scars go into more detail there with in terms of what to expect there good compression to reduce the forces that lead to thickening silicone scar sheets strips also really good if you are have planning to have a C-section recently had a C-section to put on the scar to prevent thickening and help it to heal optimally but getting back to what I was saying earlier about anything that helpful for raised thickened scars because it lubricates the scar and cuts down on friction and a lot of scar formation raised thicken scars known as hypertrophic scars a lot of what tips the balance in favor of that forming is the body sight location so the central chest is a common common area for thick and raised scars because you have a lot of tension there keeping that skin lubricated can definitely help likewise can be helpful for choid scars keloid scars are a type of thick and raised scar that in contrast to a hypertropic scar can extend beyond the borders of the initial injury so if you got a cut that was a line a hypertrophic scar will only be in that line a choid will put claws out choid literally is like a crab claw that I brand named Vaseline a skin protectant but mineral oil whether it be baby oil although that has fragrance or just mineral oil USP as a lubricant for the skin another option CVS always upcharges for their mineral oil a lot of scars can also be very painful itchy and restrict Mobility like burn scars you know if you have a big scar over your hand it can really get in the way of quality of life these topicals that we that are skin protectants that lubricate petroleum jelly mineral oil Allen toen silicone dimethicone which is a silicone they will help alleviate some of those symptoms of itch and discomfort speaking of itch and discomfort if you have a raised thickened scar that is itchy a um hydrocortisone can help with the itch applied twice a day for like 2 weeks at a time solely for the itch now for thicken rais scars a treatment is actually um steroid either injected in most commonly directly into the scar to soften it or sometimes a topical potent steroid can also be prescribed and effective this is too weak to soften a raised scar whether it be hypertrophic or choid but might help alleviate some of the itch I know what you she supplies section she doesn more pens let no no no so one thing that can totally change the trajectory of healing for a raised scar is compression whether it be choid or hypertrophic and if you had a choid scar or hypertrophic scar treated there doctor recommended perhaps some form of compression therapy for example a lot of people get choid scars on the ear Lo related to ear piercing and treating those usually with steroid injections but wearing these special earrings from the company delasco that are compression they you clip on there squeezes down that Scar and it helps it to soften several years ago there was a case report in the medical literature of using binder clips to do the same thing as a coste effective option for compression for choid scars choid scar on the ear loobe this can really help not going to work on other body sites right but on the earlobe yes those of you who watch my video on how to fade redness you recall this tip but persistent redness within scarring or overlying Surface redness known as post-inflammatory aemma like from healing acne oxy metazine actually can help to lessen that and that is what is in afron nasal spray just uh put a little bit on your finger rub it into the redness uh there we have it L Ro P caash gel we glycerin as a skin protectant you can really see it so well there but this product also has compounds from cantella that from that can actually be helpful for healing so another great option I also want to talk about tranexamic acid um in this product this product has a very strong fragrance which can be irritating so this might not be the best option but it that has tranexamic acid um as a side note e.l. makes a tranexamic acid containing lotion that would be a great option but tranexamic acid is something that we give by mouth to treat melasma but applied topically it shows a lot of promise for post-inflammatory athma also it barrier and ultimately that be beneficial because anything that good for the moisture barrier ultimately allows for better hydration better exfoliate natural exfoliation of the skin more efficient and reduced penetration of irritants microbes into the area that you exfoliants like Alpha hydroxy acids glycolic lactic mandelic as well as salicylic acid can be really helpful for post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation the dark discoloration that might overly a scar um by helping to clear and lift it up out of the skin through the exfoliation processes provided it is not irritating okay big take- home Point anything that all these issues for you I have a video reviewing this product specifically as well as how to use an alphahydroxy acid like glycolic acid so I give a lot of tips in those videos but take-home Point these can be helpful for surface changes but they True scars whether it be raised scars or depressed scars except 12% or higher lactic acid in amlactin it promise for improving not just the surface change but also the deeper layers of the skin specifically with regards to wrinkles could potentially also help soften the rough sloping if you will of a depressed scar but what about bio oil okay bio oil anyone who says that this is helpful they getting essentially the benefits like I said of using mineral oil to lubricate the scar cut down on frictional forces but they point $38.49 mind you plus fragrance which again can be irritating not always but for some people it can be irritating fragrance and essential oils ultimately will worsen the appearance of the scar so this is not something I recommend but people who use it and claim that it helped their scars just know it worked by lubricating the skin surface you can get that same effect for half the price without the risk of irritation from fragrance just by using mineral oil or any of the skin protectants we talked about earlier so one thing about this e.l. acne fighting putty primer is that the salic silk acid can help not just with um blackheads and white heads of acne but also with the overlying hyperpigmentation but the green can mask redness can provide some cosmetic camouflage if you have acne don bail on your acne treatments once the acne clears up talk to your dermatologist most cases you would continue using them even when the skin is clear to prevent future breakouts and a lot of the active acne treatments can help begin to address the scars too well guys that the best drugstore options for really all different types of scars scars there is no one single best treatment and most of what I went over in today not going to really be adequate might be adequate along with patience time and correct ction of underlying abnormality of correcting overlying surface residues of dark spots redness but nothing that we talked about today will completely eliminate a scar whether it be raised or depressed don surface change like dark spots and redness because the dark spots and redness often times will improve with time and patience but scars in order to change them and improve upon them they need interventions and usually a multi-pronged approach with different procedures and the best procedure or procedures depends on so many factors the type of Scar the location the age of the scar the background skin type all of these things come together for scars now one issue within scarring that we did not address in there is hypo pigmentation within a scar meaning the scar has healed with a white Mark as often often happens there are treatments that can stimulate the color to return but there far as a product that you can buy and apply or a remedy a modality that will bring back color in those hypopigmented scars anyway I hope you guys found this video useful I have a lot of videos on scarring here on this channel I to put one of them on the end slate but if you guys enjoyed this one give it a thumbs up share it with your

Clearing Back Acne: Expert Tips And Tricks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WgnoB99nnM	Dr Day	well hey guys let I don most videos I talk about acne on the face but back acne as well as chest acne this is pretty common because there are a lot of oil glands on your back and your chest when it comes to back acne it can be a true acne vulgaris which is related to a couple of factors your genetics of course oil production from the sebaceous oil gland which is driven by hormones the acne causing bacterium cutie bacterium acnes which breaks down that oil and generates inflammation coupled with a tendency for the lining of your pore to turn over abnormally get stuck together and form a black head or a white head this can ultimately lead to the formation of deep painful cyst that ultimately can go on to scar if left untreated but a lot of people deal with breakouts on the back that look like acne and are something totally different a common example of that is pittosporum foliculitis otherwise known as malesia foliculitis people like to call this fungal acne fungal acne this is essentially a foliculitis related to malesia yeast here also have a bit of overlap between the two conditions acne breakouts on the back are going to be aggravated by friction on the skin as well as sweat people who live in tropical climates with a lot of humidity especially those who are active Outdoors maybe as part of your occupation you get really sweaty that leads to more acne breakouts just because of the trapping of the sweat on the skin which is an irritant and it creates a favorable environment for that little malesia yeast to thrive it really important to stick to loose breathable Fabrics that are moisture wicking so as to reduce the accumulation of sweat on the skin and also to course shower regularly to remove that sweaty oily residue off the skin surface and you certainly want to avoid picking at the acne breakouts it makes the acne worse and it doesn treatments which we this video to effectively work like acne on the face back acne can be driven by and exacerbated by things that influence our hormones in women that might be the menstrual cycle it might be a hormonal contraceptive pill or it might be going through menopause postmenopausal hormonal levels may lead to acne breakouts in men the Androgen hormones certainly drive oil production but if you are taking say a performance enhancing drug testosterone replacement therapy it is possible that those things Drive particularly inflammatory acne breakouts on the back and certain dietary supplements have been associated with sudden outbreaks of body acne including on the back now in these situations the acne is what we call monomorphic meaning all the acne spots look basically the same and it sort of comes out of nowhere the good news with this type of acne is that if you stop the supplement the acne will clear up in a matter of weeks and that is it check out my video on dietary supplements that trigger acne because I do a a deep dive on the different types of supplements that may be contributing to your breakouts including back acne when it comes to your hygiene routine you can incorporate a benzo peroxide wash in the shower to treat the back benzo peroxide helps reduce the acne causing bacterium cuy bacterium acnes it it helps to break up the blackhead and white head formation and it anti-inflammatory I like recommending using a benzo peroxide wash as opposed to a product that you leave on the skin because benzo peroxide unfortunately will ruin your clothes it bleaches fabrics and so if you put it on your back you get dressed well that article of clothing is going to be all messed up a wash on the other hand you lather to the back let that leather sit on the skin for a few minutes so that it has a good chance of penetrating thickened acne spots and then rinse it off this way you rinse it off you get the benefit of the ingredient but you don bleaching your clothing now of course you can bleach your washcloth so be careful there but yeah it approach in that regard alternatively or in conjunction you might also elect to incorporate a salicylic acid body wash into your routine salicylic acid is anti-inflammatory it may help cut down to a certain extent on issues related to malesia and salicylic acid importantly helps to break up blackheads and wh heads similarly just lather it to the back let it sit on there for a while so it can really penetrate into thickened acne spots and then rinse it off you can even use both of these washes alternating them one one day and the other the next day now if there element of malesia foliculitis going on you also might benefit from incorporating an anti- dandruff shampoo used as a body wash to these areas anti-dandruff shampoos have ingredients that help reduce the burden of malesia and can certainly help clear up pittosporum foliculitis examples of which include zinc python ketoconazol selenium sulfide another atome treatment that won reliably but may help quite a bit because it is something that can be quite effective for acne is to incorporate a Lon sulfur product now warning sulfur does have that little funky smell of eggs but it definitely can help it anti-inflammatory I always recommend the de la Cru uh Sulfur acne treatment that treatment that uh is meant for people with rosacea that also can be helpful uh just smear it on the upper back and leave it on there you can use it daily multiple times a day even and unlike Ben peroxide that Fabrics you honestly troin can be used on the back to treat back acne just like the phase but success with that is kind of variable several years ago though a new retinoid came out called tritin tritin and contrast to tretinoin is a lot more specific for certain retinoid receptors and it is FDA approved for treating acne on the trunk and can be helpful now if there foliculitis going on your dermatologist might prescribe a topical antifungal such as ketoconazol and they may even prescribe you a course of an oral antifungal to address that we already about a lot of washes that you can buy in the store and incorporate into your shower routine but your dermatologist might actually prescribe you a wash called avar avar is a combination of sulfur which we already talked about with something called sodium sulfacetamide and these two ingredients together exhibit Synergy for reducing inflammation breaking up clogged pores and helping to clear up the acne now not going to necessarily eliminate back acne but really can help patients turn a corner when it comes to clearing their back acne in dermatology we prescribe a lot of antibiotics for things that are not infections and this always puzzles people like why treat patients with antibiotics when they don while there is bacteria playing a role it this anti-inflammatory property that is actually pretty effective for clearing acne um it but it can be a helpful tool in this case in particular particular for clearing up the acne so that it doesn go on to scar and in the meantime initiating therapies that might take a little bit longer to start working um that way you don for scarring so there can be topical antibiotics such as clintom myosin your dermatologist might also prescribe you a course of oral antibiotics usually 3 months sometimes more and this really can help clear up the back acne but it does come back usually when you stop so it it have so that other treatments can be initiated that take longer to start examples include doxycycl Minocycline cycling earlier I mentioned the key role Androgen hormones play in driving back acne or acne in general so there topical antiandrogen medication called wi leevy otherwise known as clascoterone but speaking of anti-androgens for women spironolactone and oral medication can be particularly effective for acne in general including acne breakouts on the back oral spiral fractone however is not something that we prescribe to males because it does have several adverse effects in males such as breast development check out my video on spironolactone because I go over the way we prescribe it and the various side effects that one might expect if you have a particularly inflammatory acne lesions one way to clear them up quickly that can be very effective is to do an intralesional steroid injection with hot triamcinolone this is a steroid medication but we can just place it in the skin to calm down the inflammation and help shrink those inflamed nodules reducing the chance that it goes on to form a scar chemical peels can be particularly helpful for acne on the trunk including the back and also offer some benefit in terms of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation for deeper skin tones they don eradicate acne on the back they usually not enough on their own but coupled with other treatments they really can help patients turn a corner in many cases there called avac clear which I have a whole video about that targets the sebaceous oil gland to destroy it and can really be quite effective for treating acne while it sounds like it might offer the potential to cure acne in most cases patients need to continue some sort of acne treatment but it definitely can help people get to the level of clearance that they are seeking to control their acne the thing about these lasers is that not every dermatologist has them and there is an expense with maintaining them and having them in office and they are an expensive treatment for patients for some cases of acne that is quite inflammatory especially in patients who have other skin conditions going on that are related to acne like hyri adontis stiva can often coinside with this type of acne um in men there is a condition called dissecting cellulitis of the scalp also a condition called Pyon nidal sinus in Hydra antis to Piva you guys know it can be quite debilitating get these boils like in the skin folds that drain and go on to scar I mean a really really tough disease there medications called tanif Alpha Inhibitors such as a tanp otherwise known as embil that can really really really help to clear up this more severe type of acne so you might be a candidate for that if you these other things going on it something that we don about a lot in my videos but definitely worth mentioning especially here also there is a medication called dapsone dapsone is a an antibiotic uh that we actually use quite a bit in dermatology because one of the ways it works is by suppressing nutrifil migration and that can really be helpful for clearing up a variety of different types of inflammatory skin conditions and in some cases can be particularly helpful for acne there dapsone goes by the brand named axone and then of course we have isot troan and isotron commonly referred to as Accutane actually offers the potential to cure the acne and Shrink those enlarged abnormal oil glands and help to heal up those breakouts and quite honestly get them to go away isoto can also be helpful for people who deal with recurrent balance of malesia because it is se you know reduces sebum and sebum is the you know root issue going on with malesia excessive sebum isotron does have various side effects so depending on your medical history you may not be a candidate for it but it can be very effective especially for this acne on the back patients who are on this medication they need to follow up with their dermatologist to monitor for side effects but check out my video on Accutane I have several or I go over the side effects in more detail but it can be a game changer for acne on the back then for women combined hormonal contraceptive pills mean they have an estrogen component can also be very helpful for acne breakouts because they reduce the Androgen forces if you will on the oil gland and ultimately help to clear up face and body acne all right guys so that is a rundown with regards to back acne there is no like single best treatment you know it it tailored to the individual depending on the severity your background skin type as well as your medical history what else you have going on and you as an individual that treatments are really great for certain patients you take another patient whose acne looks exactly the same and that treatment is not going to be right for that person maybe because of their lifestyle maybe because they have some other things going on or maybe because they have something in their medical or family history that makes a particular treatment less ideal I really hope this video was informative to you guys who struggle with breakouts on the back I encourage you to see a board certified dermatologist to have your acne evaluated because as I and alluded to throughout this video maybe it foliculitis in which case you know a different treatment would be needed maybe you have pedos from foliculitis malesia foliculitis maybe that primary thing that you have going on um maybe you would benefit more from an oral antifungal maybe you have a bacterial foliculitis related to staff bacteria so there are some other entities that could be going on but acne breakouts are pretty common so I really hope this video was informative to you guys in discussing the different therapies that are available if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen And subscribe I to you guys guys tomorrow bye [Music]	Success
Clear Acne At Home With Phototherapy | Omnilux Clear	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aE6jRBftyY	Dr Day	well hey guys it all things acne awareness month and for today at home LED therapy for acne today video is kindly sponsored by omnilock let acne can take on one it cope with now on my channel I have a lot of different acne videos talking about different acne treatments there are many Fantastic atome treatment options for mild and moderate acne and one of them which I often recommend is Led therapy at home otherwise known as photobiomodulation that is a fancy term but what exactly does it mean photobiomodulation involves delivery of specific wave lengths of light visible light or near infrared these are absorbed by Targets in the skin to elicit a Cascade of events that results in things like an Improvement in circulation a reduction in inflammation as well as an improvement in collagen production but some specific wavelengths of light for acne can be particularly effective for targeting the root cause issues that lead to breakouts in the first place so let exactly acne happens in the first place it factors first is the cells lining the pore are a bit inefficient in their mat atation and turnover processes as a result you get a plug or a comone you also have the issue of an increased production of sebum into the pore sebum is basically oil and some people make more sebum compared to others just as part of their genetics also our hormones influence sebum production and changes in hormones can lead to Oiler skin and more acne breakouts certain medications may also influence this but the third part of acne that definitely Bears attention is the role of the acne causing bacteria cutie bacterium acne now for people with acne they have some disbiosis going on down in the pore that leads to over representation of certain strains of cutie bacterium acnes which are problematic because they break down the cbum which is already increased by nature of well acne and as a result release inflammatory mediators into the skin that lead to acne as well so a big part of acne is not just the bacteria but the inflammation you also have some other things that bear addressing when it comes to taking care of the skin of acne and that is secondary changes not just the pimples that are coming to the skin surface not just the blackheads the white heads but the surface changes that can result from the inflammation that includes hyperpigmentation as well as dry skin ironically most people with acne have oily skin and they assume oh I have oily skin so I must not be prone to dryness and it often times the opposite and as the skin becomes dry it becomes more vulnerable to irritation inflammation and that can not only aggravate the acne but limit one topical treatments furthermore you also have redness for a lot of P patients that inflammation leads to obvious skin redness there are several advantages to photobiomodulation with LEDs whether it be in office or from the comfort of your own home first of all it it sitting around watching TV even convenient you can do it on your own time it used to treat a variety of different things and we what attributes are useful for acne it also non-thermal meaning it doesn up the skin so you don concern of heating up the skin to the point of skin injury photobiomodulation using LEDs can also be used in combination with other established treatments how exactly does photobiomodulation with LEDs work for acne well it advantage of blue light blue light is part of the visible light spectrum and blue light actually targets the acne causing back bacteria cutie bacterium acnes cutie bacterium acnes lives down in the pore and a byproduct of its metabolism is something called porin porin will absorb the wavelengths of blue light it is a target of that blue light and the downstream effect is destruction of the acne causing bacteria that would otherwise break down your oil and generate a lot of inflammation and more acne blue light is also anti-inflammatory in addition to blue light though red light can also be particular ly useful for acne it has been demonstrated to help in reducing sebum output red light therapy has also been shown to reduce keratosis of the follicles so the plugging aspect of things another important attribute of red light uh photo therapy is that it can reduce what transepidermal water loss improving moisture content of the skin reducing the tendency towards dryness and irritation red light therapy is also anti-inflammatory which can be particularly of benefit for acne and inflammatory skin condition not only for the acne itself but for the sequella of hyperpigmentation or redness so utilizing blue and red wavelengths of light for photobiomodulation for acne not only addresses the root causes of acne the bacteria the pore plugging and the increase in seum but it also is addressing some of the secondary changes that let impactful on an individual as the primary skin problem was to begin with that includes dry skin as well as redness and possibly hyperpigmentation all through reducing that inflammation and improving what transepidermal water loss the omnilux clear device is a LED device that uses a combination of red and blue light again specifically for the treatment of acne within the mask there are 132 LEDs there actually 66 bulbs but each bulb is a dual chip bulb for two LEDs one red and one blue the wavelengths of light used in The Mask are evidence-based and have been backed by clinical trials and include the 633 nmet wavelength for the red light and 450 NM wavelength for the blue light here clear device you want to start with a clean bare face you don any products on your skin that could potentially just lessen the uh extent of penetration of the light into the skin you do the mask for 10 minutes that all it takes four times a week for the first 6 weeks thereafter you use the mask at the first signs of a breakout why do I recommend omnilock when there are so many devices on the market not all devices are created equal the reason I recommend omnilux is their reputation frankly omnilux trademark technology has been used in the industry for over 20 years backed by clinical research over 40 peer-reviewed published papers with omnilux technology the same technology that is used in the masks that you can use at home another point I want to make is that onux clear is actually the only flexible homeuse LED mask that has passed FDA TGA and C regulations for treating acne we use an omnilux device to treat patients in office how does a clinical device differ from the omalo clear mask well if you pursue a treatment in office you the red light treatment and the blue light treatment separately whereas when you do the omnilux clear mask at home the bulbs have both red and blue light in them so you get both treatments at once cutting down on the time making this very convenient to do at home how long does it take to see results with the omnilux clear that really varies from person to person but within a few weeks you can start to appreciate clearing up of existing breakouts and with continued use as directed it can help prevent future breakouts one question I get the most is Will atome LED therapy help with hormonal acne that you all know is notoriously stubborn to treat it the main driver is the hormones uh that signal to the oil gland to make more oil now it should be clear all types of acne hormones are signaling to the oil gland to make more oil but hormonal acne when people say hormonal acne that big driving Factor so much so that a lot of treatments are just not super effective for that type subtype of acne um the omx clear device can be effective for that type of acne it necessarily going to address the hormonal component per se but via its anti-inflammatory and cuti bacterium targeting effects it can benefit hormonal acne when used as directed the other question I get is will the ominux clear be helpful for scarring it possible it will help in reducing the risk that acne heals with a scar via its anti-inflammatory effects however the omnilux clear is not intended to treat existing scars now like I said there are a lot of devices on the market so what exactly is the difference between this device and a device like the omnilux Contour or the omalo men in contrast to those devices this device uses Blue Light which is specific for treating acne whereas those devices use a combination of red and near infrared wavelengths for the purposes of photo rejuvenation for anti-aging purposes right to stimulate collagen to smooth out wrinkles to improve hydration to reduce inflammation to improve skin surface tone the omnilux clear on the other hand uses a combination of blue and red LEDs to specifically Target the issues related related to acne cuti bacterium acne um the inflammation The increased oiliness to a certain extent the pore plugging effect as well as also an anti-inflammatory effect that to help with a lot of the secondary changes that happen with acne so if you are seeking a device for just improving skin tone and improving the appearance of wrinkles the omnilux clear is not for you the omnilux clear is meant for individuals with mild the moderate acne the other difference you that the omnilux clear has these little built-in eye Shields now to be clear no pun intended both the omalu clear as well as their other devices have been tested to be perfectly safe for the eyes when used as directed as a mask without actually needing eye Shields or anything of that sort however some people are very sensitive to Blue Light with their eyes so as an added precaution they went ahead for this mask they went ahead and put in those extra little eye Shields so that is another slight difference as a dermatologist in my opinion the omnilux clear is an excellent option for atome treatment of mild to moderate acne it flexible it convenient you can do it on your own in the privacy of your own home it to travel with it walk around with it you can get your your morning started in your kitchen and by the time you coffee you have already finished it so it I only as good as you are at staying consistent and using them so if a device is too cumbersome to use it awkward um it your routine you that why I like the omnilux clear is just the way it is engineered to be easy to use at home not to mention their reputation they are leaders in the field of photobiomodulation they have over 20 years of experience their technology is what we use in the clinics to treat patients all right y everything I wanted to say with regards to the use of photobiomodulation for acne specifically um check the description box if you are interested in the omnilux clear device I have a link down there also let me know in the comments what other questions do you guys have because this is an area where there there excitement in the realm of photobiomodulation like I said it versatile it in the comments what additional questions you guys have and maybe in the future I this topic cuz there say I feel like we scratched the surface here anyway y I hope you enjoy enjoyed this one if so give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow bye [Music]	Success
Why You Get Period Acne And Hormonal Breakouts	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQTvVO3iGAc	Dr Day	well hey guys in today to talk about why it is your skin breaks out around your period we get into the nitty-gritty details of why it is your skin seems to freak out whenever it acne is a really common condition for adult women to struggle with while we mostly going to talk about how your period can lead to acne breakouts I want you to keep watching this video even if you don because understanding how your menstrual cycle influences Direct L things going on in your skin might help you better understand why it is you experience certain symptoms with your period whether it be increased dryness sensitivity redness irritation or flares of other conditions that you might be dealing with in terms of your skin having acne can take a huge toll on someone quality of life unfortunately there is a huge negative stigma around acne acne severity in adulthood runs the gamut from mild all the way to quite severe but regardless of where you are on that severity Spectrum one thing that a lot of women fail to do is to accept the fact that their acne is worthy of medical attention a lot of women feel like oh it something that I shouldn doctor with the downside of putting off treatment is not only dealing with ongoing acne breakouts that are poorly controlled but those ongoing acne breakouts then end up healing with a variety of things that can take even longer to clear up or in some cases are permanent depending on the severity for example post- acne redness and post- acne hyperpigmentation are things that are commonly left behind and take a long time to resolve and then there is acne scarring there are raised acne scars and there are depressed acne scars I have lots of videos on these but acne scars are a lot harder to treat than the initial acne and so treating it early helps prevent those things from happening facial acne is primarily a disorder of the spaceous oil glands which we all have they become more active at the time of puberty which is why that scene for most people and they are responsive to hormones which is why your menstrual cycle is directly linked to flares of acne the four major factors that come together and are what explains the root cause of acne are an increase in seum production from the sebaceous gland also a plugging up of the pore due to hyper cariz of the follicle lining basically the skin cells lining your pore they turning over in an abnormal fashion so they get stuck together and make a little plug you also have a bacteria that naturally lives down in the pore the bacteria is called cutie bacteria acnes and that bacteria breaks down the oil and releases free fatty acids that compromise barrier function of your skin and also bring in a lot of inflammation and inflammation is the fourth factor in addition to those four main factors you have contributions from your genetics your genetics are such that the cells lining your pore have a tendency to get stuck together or your genetics are such that your oil glands make a little bit too much oil or your genetics are such that you are colonized with a subtype of CD bacterium acne that is more problematic in comparison to people who don without a doubt especially as it relates to the menstrual cycle is hormones specifically the Androgen hormone testosterone hormonal imbalance as it relates to the condition PCOS and maybe hormonal influences as it relates to certain types of oral contraceptive pills that have more of a progesterone component to them you also have the contribution of stress hormones stress hormones directly influence the oil gland and you have smoking which hopefully you guys do not smoke but smoking drives acne because it generates a lot of inflammation and has a lot of direct negative impacts on the pore itself so much so that people who smoke for many years they get a specific type of sun damage known as a smoker basically these very large blackheads due to the combination of destructive factors from smoking and the sun why is it that acne breakouts tend to coincide so closely then with our period Well it all boils down to the influence of hormones which signal to the oil gland to make more oil specifically when you are ovulating you have a peak in testosterone testosterone tells the spaceous oil gland to make more oil so it the pore that the bacteria that lives down there is like oh wow this is tasty let breaking down sebum and releasing free fatty acids not only is that inflammatory but it also impairs Your Skin Barrier and this is where there is a huge disconnect in terms of the products that you might reach for because your skin is feeling oily it counterintuitive to realize this but you also have because of that oiliness and the breakdown of that oil you have an impaired skin barrier which is going to allow better penetration of irritating things loss of water dryness more overall irritation and Hyper irritability of the skin and inflammation and worsening of acne breakouts so that is important to keep in mind because the rhetoric from like the 80s and oh dry it up dry it up we had all those kinds of uber drying alcohol-based toners seab breze and um for many many people that is very counterproductive to the acne because you actually need moisturizers you have your period and then you have um about a week where you are still in the follicular phase then you ovulate and that rise in testosterone and you have an increase in oiliness so that skin is more likely to become oily and it barrier so following the peak of testosterone at the time of ovulation you then get an increased in sebum output you have a greater tendency to have an impaired barrier and you have a more favorable environment for pore clogging because of the negative effects of those free fatty acids on uh the cells lining the pore therefore many women experience acne breakouts somewhere between day 22 and day 28 of their menstrual cycle which is roughly about a week before your period starts on the other hand some women actually experience a breakout a week after their menstrual period rather than the week before it really just varies quite a bit from person to person again we all carbon copies of one another and our genetics do play a big role in these things those of you out there who don necessarily deal with acne breakouts this is a period of time where you also can appreciate some other skin changes symptoms Etc like sensitivity maybe you find that your products that you are using burn sting or you might just find that your skin is more prone to irritation maybe you have another skin condition like rosacea for example a lot of patients with rosacea find that it is aggravated around the menstrual cycle and so this could be a time where you have more flaring of your rosacea when it comes to your skin care routine one of the most practical things that you can do in terms of this is addressing uh removal of the excess sebum by daily cleansing and also addressing that barrier issue by using a moisturizer daily cleansing by removing that oil can also help prevent microone formation so comedones are the little white heads and blackheads and while they you end up seeing with your eyes before you even see them with your eyes they are already developing below the skin surface but with consistent cleansing you remove seab bomb that would otherwise break down impair barrier function and contribute itself to pore clogging by leading to more disc caratos of the cells linning the pore you kind of help reduce all that just by removing some of that oil that builds up on the skin surface the reason moisturizers help so much is that they help with improving water content in the stre strum corneum and the reason that helps the acne out so much is that it allows for the skin to turn over more appropriately to mature efficiently and remember that is one of the root cause problems with acne is that the cells lining the pore are not maturing efficiently properly they stuck together but by moisturizing you help reduce water loss you improve the water content in your skin this helps reduce com formation and can ultimately help cut down on overall acne severity breakouts and because it helps with barrier function it also can help you tolerate acne treatments better because many acne treatments themselves can be very drying and very irritating there still a lot of rhetoric online about comedogenic ingredients dermatologists have a tendency to emphasize the use of non-comedogenic moisturizers and skincare products while simultaneously also acknowledging the fact that non-comedogenic is kind of a handwavy claim in a lot of cases the labeling of ingredients as cogenic is flawed based on the types of studies that are used to determine that furthermore it specific ingredient per se but rather the formulation overall so you can have an ingredient that on a rabbit ear model was concerning remember you rabbit um but then the product overall is formulated in such a way that that ingredient is at a low concentration it don avoid specific ingredients um but rather if you find that certain products consistently are aggravating your skin who cares about what the ingredients are avoid that product there however about an ingredient list or about a specific product that reliably prod predicts whether or not a product is going to aggravate your acne so whatever you have observed for yourself as problematic pay attention to that cuz it guide you to or away from there been some thought that the use of really heavy ointments on the face May aggravate acne because maybe it impedes the outflow of seab buum from the pore however we also have studies showing that one of the most occlusive ointments petrolatum actually has been shown to help patients with acne so it really not consistent so I try and encourage people rather than hyperfixate on ingredients and products to yes be mindful of things that consistently seem to aggravate their skin but also hopefully because of this video you now have a better understanding of may not actually be the skinc care products but merely oh I period where my hormones are such that it skin and that this product that I guilty bi asociation all right guys that today no matter who you are no matter what life stage you are at but I know a lot of adult women really really struggle with acne and suffer a lot of social isolation and Frank bullying especially on social media and let me tell you the comments the stigma The Bullying it all comes simply from a place of ignorance people who point fingers and tell you you need to eliminate something from your diet they say no Dairy no sugar no carbs no this no that follow this diet follow that diet da d d da they really don probably couldn menstrual cycle to you and they have no experience treating anyone with acne and they don of acne there choices I suppose that definitely can make your acne much worse in comparison to what it at Baseline is such as picking your skin which in of itself is something a lot of people struggle with if so check out my video all about skin picking disorder I give tips on how to stop and I talk about treatments for skin picking disorder um being under a lot of stress isn something you can control but I do have a recent video on how to lower your cortisol it I give a lot of practical lifestyle tips so check that video out also there are certain dietary supplements that are linked with more stubborn acne so I going to link my video down below in the description box going over all those supplements so check that one out that way you know if that life maybe eliminating it can help in reducing the severity of your acne breakouts so I will link those videos in the description box but I really hope this video was helpful to you if you enjoyed it give it a thumbs up

influence the oil production in the sebaceous oil gland as well as the turnover of the cells lining the pore treating acne early is important important not only to clear it up but also to prevent scarring and the nature of the skin on your chest is such that it is a lot more vulnerable to the formation of raised and thickened scars people of African descent are more likely to form thickened

Fabrics sports bras especially if you them and then you them they can really be a contributing factor because they skin and they trap sweat there that can lead to more stubborn breakouts so in addition to wearing loose fitting comfortable clothing make sure you change out of sweaty clothing sweat left behind on the skin is irritating and that irritation can further aggravate the acne so when you try and take a shower to rinse the skin of sweat which could irritate your skin otherwise hi hypoc Cloris acid sprays I find can be pretty helpful in those situations where you can jump in the shower right away after a workout to rinse the skin of sweat hypochlorous acid is made by your immune system to fight off infections it anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial and I find it very helpful not only for cutting down on sweat induced irritation in the skin but also for deodorizing because it cuts down on the bacteria that break down your sweat and lead to body odor it although it can be a little bit drying I this on Amazon this is just the one that I use and recommend um but uh it does say face but you can use that on the body when it comes to bathing choose a body wash with an active acne treatment such as benzo peroxide salicylic acid these ingredients can be effective in a wash form lather the wash of your choice to the chest and any other body sight where you deal with acne Breakout out let the lather sit on the skin for a few minutes before rinsing it off now when it comes to leave on acne treatments that may reach for those things Leon benzo peroxide for example helps to reduce the burden of the acne causing bacteria cutie bacterium acne and it also helps to um prevent breakouts in the future however be aware of the fact that leaving it on the skin will bleach your clothing so that recommending a wash the shorter contact is still an effective therapeutic modality but with fewer side effects of dryness irritation and you don worry about bleaching your clothing speaking of treatments that you leave on the skin one of the go-to acne treatments is a retinoid a form of topical vitamin A that not only can help in controlling the breakouts it can help with normalizing the pore lining turnover so you don open comedones now you can buy an FDA approved retinoid for the treatment of acne over the counter without a prescription a dine adapalene can be very effective for acne but on the chest it may be a little less effective so you may find that you try it out and it doesn not uncommon um it works for some people on the chest and and body but not for others now alternatively you know of course see a dermatologist a prescription retinoid may be better suited for your type of chest acne for example one of the newer prescription retinoids that we have nowadays is trifero Tee this is a retinoid that is specifically FDA approved to be used not only on the face but on the trunk it is the first prescription retinoid that is FDA approved for acne on the trunk and one of the advantages of this prescription retinoid is that it is a lot more selective in terms of The receptors that it binds to you the formulation has a much lower percentage of retinoid needed to achieve the desired outcome of acne control so that might be a better option for you and it tends to be less irritating than troan probably because it is a lot more selective in terms of the receptor that it binds you if you want more information on this check out my video on tritin I talk more about it there all right so those are some active acne treatments that can help in clearing up and preventing the chest breakouts the other thing if I didn is do not pick it can be very challenging to resist the urge to pick at pimples on your chest uh you may do it subconsciously lean into a hydrocolloid patch serves as a barrier keeping your fingers away picking is problematic because it prevents the acne from healing makes the acne resistant to the treatments and it also puts you at risk for infection scarring and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation in addition to helping prevent you from accessing the pimples hydrocolloid patches are advantageous because if in the case where you have a pimple with quite a bit of postular content inflammatory exate it can help draw some of that out and flatten the pimple facilitating healing don neglect moisturizers that is something that a lot of people with acne are fearful they approach moisturizers with some trepidation out of concern that they moisturizers actually end up being really useful for acne because they address the Skin Barrier people with acne typically have an impaired skin barrier they water from the skin and developing irritation which ultimately worsens the acne um because moisturizers that feel greasy may not be comfortable to those with acne due to the oily nature of the skin of people with acne I can suggest some moisturizers that tend to feel more lightweight have hydrating ingredients and ingredients that support the barrier such as ceramides when choosing a moisturizer I also suggest considering a moisturizer that has niacinamide niacinamide is an ingredient that is an antioxidant it anti-inflammatory it can help with a redness inflammation it also helps cut down on and help clear out hyperpigmentation and it specifically to be beneficial for acne so I will list down below in the description box some moisturizers that are more hydrating more light weight don take into account if you has long hair is the hair care products that you are using is your hair coming in contact with like this part of your chest is that where you breakouts because a few things may be going on first of all any leave on styling products that you have they may actually be contri uting to the acne certain thickeners and conditioning agents and hair care products oils used in styling products have been associated with acne breakouts it acne so if you do have longer hair try and keep your hair up off of your chest you know if you let it hang in the front also um certain ingredients in shampoos and conditioners especially have been shown to stay behind on the skin and this is thought to perhaps not proven but perhaps play a role in acne breakouts on the chest and back so when you you you rinse all that stuff out before you come in with your body washes and or your acne wash of choice it will help remove that potential residue and reduce the potential for those things to further aggravate your acne understand that certain medications dietary supplements can actually be a culprit in acne breakouts on the chest and back specifically testosterone drives more oil production leads to breakouts anabolic steroids that people may be pursuing for muscle purposes or what are called selective Androgen receptor modulators or sarms these are also um substances that are used by bodybuilders people looking to put on muscle these can all impact the sebaceous oil gland and lead to pretty inflammatory acne that has a predilection for the chest the back as well as the face um and it can be quite inflammatory quite cystic and it can certainly leave you scarred high doses of iodine can also cause acne breakouts certain B vitamins are associated with acne breakouts there is some association with the consumption of whey protein and more stubborn acne breakouts although that has not necessarily always been reproducible it people who consume a lot of skim milk may have a tendency towards more stubborn acne although again that is another one of those is it Guilty By Association harder to reproduce more research is needed but I do tell people that if they um want to try cutting out skin milk and in favor of full fat dairy or you know choosing not to consume Dairy it out seeing if it makes a difference because it is a relatively easy thing to do and if it doesn then clearly it was not the culprit for you um so all that to say you will hear a lot of people on the internet tell you oh cut out Dairy cut out Dairy you don necessarily have to cut out all Dairy but you might consider a trial of going away from skim milk in favor of either full fat dairy or again you know maybe not drink so much milk um just know that that Association is not that robust um same with whey protein supplements which is a milk derived ingredient the issue with the Whey Protein Association is always like well where are these people in these studies also on things like anabolic steroids that maybe push them over the edge to more stubborn acne so more research is needed in that regard I do have a video All About supplements that cause breakouts so I want you to watch that one if you are dealing with breakouts on the chest um or the face or anywhere in general so that you have an understanding of how to tell if the supplements you were taking are playing a role the acne manifestation is a little bit unique um I think that video will be of use to you so I link it on the end slate but that about wraps this one up in terms of my tips and tricks for how to get rid of acne on your chest I really hope this video was helpful to you if if you liked it give it

Affordable Skincare For Acne Prone Skin	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhsdrsHz510	Dr Day	the best affordable skin care for acne pruned skin well hey guys times they are expensive now if you dry skin check out my recent video on affordable dry skincare products I will link it down below in the description box now when it comes to acne you have basic skincare products and you also have acne products with active ingredients in them that are approved to treat acne depending on your acne overthe counter acne treatments might actually be all that you need to control your acne now when it comes to acne consistency is key you can and stop things when your acne seems to be at its worst you have to stay consistent that not only helps clear the acne but it also helps prevent future breakouts and it makes it so that when you do have breakouts in the future they treatment ingredients which are proved to be sold over the counter without a prescription you have a basic skincare routine now you don stuff you don toners lotions Etc all you need is a basic cleanser a moisturizer and a sunscreen and in this video I some really affordable budget friendly ones but don of the basics every step of a basic skincare routine cleanse moisturize sunscreen supports control of your acne cleanser removes dirt pollutants collections of sebum off the skin surface that otherwise oxidizes causes inflammation that further aggravates acne moisturizers help address your barrier if you have acne there chance you have oily skin there misunderstanding that oily skin means the skin is moisturized when in reality in the case of acne most acne patients have an impaired skin barrier they have a tendency to lose water for irritating stuff to get into the skin more readily leading to aggravation of the acne which is an inflammatory condition more breakouts consistent use of a moisturizer do not fear it can help improve barrier function help you tolerate your acne treatments better and then of course do not shy away from good sun protection sunscreen is so important because UV rays from the Sun they get in the way of proper healing Pathways they suppress the immune system a lot of people find that their acne seems to clear up sometimes when they go out in the sun in the beach only to have it flare and get much worse when they stop going out in the sun kind of a rebound effect due to the way it messes around with the immune system furthermore the sun it will not only slow down the healing of your acne but make it much more likely that your acne will heal with a dark mark once the acne has gone and that dark mark especially if you have a deeper skin tone can take a very long time to clear up all right so let start off with some affordable budget friendly skincare products with active acne treatments I three you don all three of these let acid salicylic acid is an over-the-counter acne treatment and it has a predilection for the pores it helps exfoliate them it anti-inflammatory and can also be beneficial in improving hyperpigmentation you can buy products that have salicylic acid that can be used one to two times a day that you leave on the skin or or you can use a cleanser with salicylic acid one of my favorite affordable cleansers I forget to mention it sometimes is by the brand zapit lesser known you get a ton of promotion for zapit over on Tik Tok or Instagram or here on YouTube you they wash cleanser $6.90 as of the filming of this video for 6.2 5 oz I like this because it has salicylic acid and not a whole lot else going on it you use this use this to take advantage of the salicylic acid it is not a product that you should be using to remove your makeup at the end of the day it it with the point in mind of short contact therapy and what I mean by that is you face avoiding around the eyes avoiding around the mouth and avoiding around the nose and avoiding the neck because salicylic acid can be irritating in these areas you see it wash off your makeup per se so don using it around your nose into your whole face it can end up drying the skin out there but let that leather sit on the skin for a few minutes and that will really help allow you to get that salicylic acid on the skin to take advantage of the ingredient and then you rinse it off then after you rinse it off you going to follow with a moisture izer and I facial moisturizer that won bang in a moment that is one option you can use it one two even three times a day if you have nothing better to do than experiment around with washing your face but most people cannot comply with washing their face three times a day be careful that could dry out your skin one to two times a day as tolerated and as tolerated will vary depending on how oily your skin is but overall this is not a super drying acne cleanser number two is benzo peroxide now benzo peroxide has a long long long-standing history as an effective and safe acne treatment it spot treatment because if you get a pimple out of nowhere and put a little benzo peroxide on there it up that pimple a lot faster it works by targeting the acne causing bacteria that lives down in the pore cutie bacterium acnes it because in contrast to antibiotics benzo peroxide the bacteria on your skin they cannot become resistant to it so it safe to use longterm now there has been some recent controversy regarding benzo peroxide Valley Shore a lab found Benzene a carcinogen in benzal peroxide products but before you freak out about that you have to understand that the condition for which the benzo peroxide products were tested were far from realistic this study was not pure reviewed meaning no one was able to critique it before it was published to the internet it wasn published in a peer-reviewed journal so no one was able to weigh in on the methodologies if they were appropriate this company also has a track record of inadequate inappropriate laboratory methods they have been critiqued by FDA and this this company also has a um patent for a shelf stable Benzel peroxide which was not disclosed to the public as of the posting of these results recently so there are a lot of red flags there this needs to be reproduced but all that to say you can feel safe with regards to the benzo peroxide products that are sold in the stores um I will tell you however that whether it be benzol peroxide or any skincare product you use do not store it in extremely hot temperatures for prolonged periods of time in other words don car in the middle of summer for weeks at a time because it can degrade same thing with other skincare products makeup the formulas can break down in extremes of temperature benzo peroxide option is from up and up that is the Target store brand up and up has some great skin care check out my video reviewing the best skin care from up and up and you recall from that video that the acne spot treatment with 2.5% benzo peroxide was mentioned in that video $5.89 free of fragrance now I mentioned this as a spot treatment that lot of people end up using it but it can also be used to the entire face and it works better used to the entire face of course sparing around the eyes around the mouth the corners of the nose these are areas that are more sensitive and can dry out 2.5% is a nice percentage because it percentages but it is as effective the reason using it to the entire face is better than just using it as needed as a spot treatment is because it helps to prevent future breakouts when you do that when you use this you just need a very thin film you don glob um and you can use it in the morning you can use it in the evening it is on the drying side that will vary from person to person as far as all the benzo peroxide leave on products out there this one is not too drying it actually relatively moisturizing you of course going to want to make sure you use a moisturizer with it do be aware it comes in contact with Fabrics it will bleach them so just be aware of that it doesn comes in contact with it it may bleach the hair as well so be careful not to get your hair to touch your face while the benzol peroxide is wet don down on your good bed sheets with benzo peroxide on your face put an old towel down that you don people to do that so that affordable all right number three is y videos on this active acne treatment it is adapalene um brand name different but you don since ad appoline became approved for being sold over the counter without a prescription well other companies have come out with adoline so you don need to use different um for example R POS Neutrogena and all of the formulas are going to be as effective because it the company I found that has an affordable option is acnefree they adapalene 0.1% gel alternatively I believe Walgreens and CVS does have their own store versions of adapalene but last I checked they weren inexpensive in comparison to even the brand names but acnefree is a good option now this is a retinoid I want you to watch my videos on how to use a retinoid I have a whole playlist regarding retinoids um I give a lot of tips and tricks in how to introduce it um it can be very irritating in the beginning but adap is one of the least irritating retinoids and it has a variety of benefits for acne specifically in that not only is it a less irritating retinoid so people tolerate it better but it also has anti-inflammatory properties and it can help lighten and prevent hyperpigmentation now this like the other active acne treatments we just covered you don eyes you don corners of the mouth corners of the nose and again you only need a very thin film can be used at night time or in the morning in contrast to some other forms of topical vitamin A topical retinoids adapalene is photostable Technic technically can be worn dur during the day although generally I advise people to put it on at night time some people will need all three to control their acne some people may only need the two or one I can a board certified dermatologist if things are not controlled cuz you may need prescription treatments all right let active acne treatments moisturizer is important do not neglect moisturizer moisturizer is not only going to help reduce dryness it to help you tolerate whatever active acne treatment you are on whether that be benzo peroxide salicylic acid adapalene or you know another retinoid oral medications that may make your skin dry like isotretinoin and one that I haven e.l.f it this is currently $112 for 22 o the reason I like this for acne is it has niacinamide an antioxidant which is anti-inflammatory and also helps with redness and hyperpigmentation and and has a track record of being helpful in particular for people with acne prone skin and and niacinamide also can help improve barrier function which if you remember back to the beginning of the video can be an issue especially for people who have acne so great there I like that it has ceramides which can help with your Skin Barrier they naturally Part Of Your Skin Barrier and when applied to the skin can help improve barrier function hyaluronic acid a humectant which is anti got has and also oat which has anti-inflammatory compounds it moisturizing now this particular moisturizer I have used it goes on a little streaky but it it the texture of this e.l.f also makes a holy hydration face cream that is pretty affordable now while ni in mind has many benefits for the skin and can be particularly beneficial for those of you who are acne prone some people find that it is irritating it burns it stings they don good moisturizer with no niacinamide equate Beauty has a version of neutrogena moisture which if you have been here since the beginning you know I used to personally use that Moisturizer in my skincare routine Neutrogena discontinued it on us equate has a version of it that is excellent listen to this $667 for 4 oz the beginning of the video we covered one cleanser with salicylic acid you may or may not benefit from salicylic acid and again that particular cleanser is not one that you necessarily would use say to remove like your makeup to really wash your face um it might be something you use in the morning to benefit from a short contact therapy with the salicylic acid but what is a good basic cleanser then for acne prone skin honestly you can use any cleanser that you like there isn anything in particular about a cleanser but one that I find very effective for acne prone skin in terms of its ability to remove oil but not be overly drying and is also a affordable is the vany cream gentle facial cleanser it is $129 for 8 O which I Happ to think is a pretty good price very basic ingredient list no active ingredients no niacinamide um no fragrance VY cream as a side note is a wonderful brand hopefully they don cleanser they have a track record of discontinuing things I aggressively recommend I don vendetta against my audience or what but uh yeah I really like this cleanser especially it option if you have skin problems acne rosacea or um eczema you know it of common allergens and irritants it does a job all right let area of contention and that is sunscreen if you have acne prone skin there good chance that sunscreens are your Nemesis like it seems like everyone that you try aggravates your acne sun sun protection is super important of course I especially for people who have acne prone skin it can be tremendously beneficial but I also want to emphasize the importance of the other Sun protective behaviors that need to go alongside sunscreen sun hats Sun protective clothing sunglasses seeking shade being mindful of how long you outdoors in the sun especially during midday when the sun intense don sunscreens are 100% guarantee going to work out for you there any skin care product on this list that is predictive of it being 100% foolproof for somebody with acne there ingredient list out there that like gets a seal of approval as being acne safe and if you want more information on that you believe that there is some seal of approval check out my video debunking acne safe skincare I talk a lot about how there about a product that is predictive of if it it boils down to the individual as a person in their skin but one I really like a lot is by Banana Boat uh Banana Boat is one of the more affordable sunscreen Brands and they have a facial sunscreen that they came out with last year that I really really like personally worked out well for me um it referred to as a chemical sunscreen no white cast now they have actually a couple of sunscreen in this Protection Plus vitamins line um one of them is specifically called out for face and that of all of them it is actually fragrance free and I haven SPF 50 which I like um so the other thing I like about it is that it resistant so it this is a great option if you to be active Outdoors participating in sport working up a sweat it also has Nia cinemon which again ni pomide can offer numerous benefits for people who have acne prone skin now I will point out it does have coconut oil which a lot of people claim is cogenic bad for acne now there who have acne tolerate coconut oil just fine however if you reproducibly every time you use a product containing coconut oil it aggravates your acne then this is not for you but otherwise I think it great option it doesn odd odor to it it nice formula in my opinion it is underhyped now the other sunscreen I want to recommend is a tinted mineral sunscreen so we have actually a few options here and affordable or the best price is going to vary depending on where you are a few tinted mineral sunscreen options out there that would be great for acne prone skin the reason you might want to consider a tint is if if you are someone who deals with a lot of hyperpigmentation because the tint in sunscreens comes from Iron oxides which help protect depending on how the product is formulated against Blue Light which as a reminder comes from the sun in in in significant quantities blue light is known to aggravate hyperpigmentation and make it more stubborn um it from the sun that you need to be mindful of in this case not your devices cuz it it also comes through window glass as a side note okay so tinted sunscreens may protect against that and you have a few good drugstore options these days you have Cave one shade a little orangey you also have neutrogena sunscreen comes in four Shades depending on the shade you choose and where you buying it from it can be on the pricey side like when this first launched this line of sunscreen first launch lach they were like 18 bucks but they have come down in price they eyes peeled I like that because it comes in a few Shades no ni inide if you sensitive and it uh is water resistant SPF 30 then you also have yerin tinted mineral sunscreen another great option only one shade a little dewy but otherwise great I really like that one a lot as well I find that it is competitive with many of the high-end tinted sunscreens that are quote medical grade I find that it looks in my opinion identical then you also have Sun balbs tinted mineral sunscreen the sun balb wand has this really nice cushiony pore blurring effect it can be desirable for people who have oily acne prone skin because tends to feel nicer not as greasy on the skin and it also has this poor blurring effect which a lot of people who have acne have very prominent pores so that is another great option those are all great options but I didn of them was the best because it individualized the prices of these vary a lot depending on what store you shopping in whether or not there sale they ballpark and one may work out for you as an individual better than the other but I wanted to give you some options all right y best in my opinion affordable products for acne prone skin I hope you found this video useful you do not need an expensive complicated skincare routine and if you breakouts keep the routine simple because aggravating your face with a bunch of products irritating the skin it worse now if you have acne prone skin on the insulate I on things you can do to help support clearing your skin I give a lot of tips and tricks in that video that go above and beyond just skin care products so watch that one next but if you like this video

Filler For Acne Scars | Dermatologist Explains	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UpQwh4Y_Rw	Dr Day	well hey guys today I want to talk about filler for acne scars specifically atropic acne scars if you with acne scarring it and it is something that doesn away it requires multiple different treatment approaches depending on a variety of factors there are numerous different types of acne scars you have different types that are raised or thicken but for today we be talking about atrophic acne scars basically scars that leave depression in the skin like when you turn to the side you can see there come in a few different types the first is a rolling scar rolling scars have this kind of undulated wave like appearance that kind of give the skin a wavy texture almost kind of look like the shape of a letter M depending on the side lighting these acne scars are thought to be related to tethering of the scar tissue down to the deeper layers of the skin they appear because bands of scar tissue form beneath the skin also variable amount of volume loss related to the prior inflammation of the acne then you have Box Car scars these are round or oval craters in the skin they can have a reddish brown appearance or they can be the color of your skin last but not least you have ice pick scars as a name implies these are a skin depression looks like basically you were stuck with an ice pick they are small and deep of all of these types of atropic scars the rolling scar is probably the most amenable to treatment but keep in mind when it comes to treating a scars there is no one single best treatment and for the most part a couple of different treatment modalities need to be pursued to get the optimal results some of the most popular scar treatments for atropic scars include subcision micro needling fractional laser resurfacing and subcision and micro needling they do have a relatively common risk of recurrence they have their limitations but they can be quite useful aside from that you have a few other modalities retinoids of course applied to this skin can improve collagen production soften the appearance of atropic scars they don completely erase them you also have a treatment that I have a whole video on that I cross um and of course you have chemical peels of varying depths that can soften and smooth the skin surface the edges of the scars like I said no one treatment is going to be the answer and importantly treatments have to be tailored to you the individual and the types of scars that you actually have some scars s are going to be more appropriate for certain treatments in comparison to others the other thing to take into account when it comes to scars is that a lot of people actually have dis pigmentation and overlying redness on top of the scars it makes it look like a scar but those things need their own types of treatment a lot of times scars can be challenging to evaluate if there hyperpigmentation or redness so addressing those things first with either topical medications or um Different Light and Laser based treatments to tackle those issues then as those things start melting away the underlying scar can be better evaluated and you can start to develop a plan for the patient for that particular atropic scar so what about filler well the nice thing about filler for atropic scars is that basically it precise volume restoration to the scar with micro needling fractional lasers things of that sort that stimulate collagen they do so broadly but with filler you are stimulating collagen just replace the filler in the case of of certain types of filler uh known as bios stimulatory filler and also you know you you just have a little bit more precise control and with certain types of filler you have the ability to reverse them if it treat atropic scars is not a new technique it years and years since about the 80s there are several different types of fillers it can be classified as temporary semi-permanent and permanent temporary fillers includ include hyaluronic acid and collagen semi-permanent is going to be the BIOS stimulatory filler polylactic acid commonly known as sculpture as a side note I have a whole video about sculptur check that out cuz I talk about what to expect with it then you also have calcium hydroxy appetite that semi-permanent filler goes by the name radius then as far as permanent filler you have silicone which is not really used you also have a polyacryamide and polymethyl methacrylate poly methyl methy plus bovine collagen it bellil it the treatment of acne scar or hyaluronic acid filler is one of the more widely used filler types for like cosmetic Rejuvenation hyaluronic acid is naturally present in your extracellular Matrix in the deeper layers of your skin it your epidermis but the thing about it as far as an injectable is it has a pretty short halflife however many hyaluronic acid fillers are cross-link to help with their overall durability while they thought to be temporary there evidence that they are much more long lasting than one might expect in fact there is evidence that they persist depending on the place that they injected for 10 years uh it can be detected on mrri now you most familiar with hyaluronic acid filler for wrinkles for rejuvenation for cosmetic reasons when it places for wrinkles we know it can move around um and a lot of that has to do with the technique of how it was injected the type of hyaluronic acid filler that was chosen and the fact that with wrinkles you have ongoing Dynamic movement in that area right that P can push the hyaluronic acid out of the space in contrast when you this to an atropic acne scar it has a better chance of staying there and being more durable because you don constant Dynamic movement like you do with wrinkles the risk of using hyaluronic acid filler to treat atropic scars is you can get some bluish discoloration you can get some blue nodules depending on how it technique is super important like I mentioned at the beginning of the video evaluating the scar is key to determining if it filler and so to say is filler good for scar well it how does it look what is the nature of it what else do you have going on on your face so I want to reiterate this I I can comes to treating acne scars what you have to keep in mind is that no treatment or combination of treatments will completely get rid of the scar the other thing is there is no single or combination best approach to acne scars in general the individual patient and their presentation has to be taken into account the age of the scar the patients background skin type their skin tone how their skin responds responds to potential treatment options um if they have overlying other things if they have ongoing active acne make sure you stay tuned to the end of the video because I will give you some tips on preventing acne from scarring what are some things that we look for when deciding if a particular atropic scar is a good candidate for filler one simple test is just pinch the atropic scar Inward and if it dimples down that good candidate for filler it suggests that there there anchoring the scar down deep and so it place the filler there in contrast if it kind of bubbles up a bit um then that probably a good sign um that negative dimple sign and means that probably more of a better candidate then you have to take into account what the overlying epidermis looks like atropic scars that have smooth gentle sloping borders are going to be a lot more amenable to treatment with filler those types of scars I circled in green then you have those scars with more irregular edges and sort of a partially scarred base replacing some of the epidermis those types of scars are shown here circled in yellow they may exhibit some partial improvement with filler then you scars with deep edges and White Scar Tissue at the base those are going to be minimally impacted by filler probably not a good option there those are shown here circled in red not only does the scar have to be appropriate for filler but the technique matters quite a bit a micr drop technique placing the filler relatively high up in the dermis is is important because if you place it too deep what that sort of bolster the scar tissue up and it entire scar as you can imagine though it just have one type of acne scar they don common typical for a patient to have a combination of not just different types of rolling scars but also to have Box Car scars in there and to have ice pick scars so then you know you also want to think about what am I going to pair with filler it going to get a good response using filler alone that enough to really get the optimal results so you have to factor in what other treatments can benefit this patient and the reason that that you pursue treatments it may best to go in with some type of resurfacing treatment first whether that be a deep peel uh resurfacing laser dermabrasion to smooth out those epidermal edges in some cases this type of treatment can take a box car scar to more of a rolling scar which as I said the rolling scars tend to be a lot more amenable to Improvement choosing to do energy based devices first makes a lot of sense when we filler because um as it turns out some some energy based devices can hasten the clearance and and destroy the hyaluronic acid filler so you lose it and kind of you know take several steps back so it doesn those treatments um all right so what can you do to prevent acne scars in the first place the number one thing to do to prevent acne scars is to get your acne treated I mean that is the reason for acne scarring is that it goes untreated or undertreated maybe related to things outside of your control maybe you don dermatologist maybe you have access to a dermatologist but you only have so many visits you can schedule your insurance changes we all know the hurdles of access to any type of Health Care these days um Dermatology is no exception but treating the acne is imperative to prevent scarring so long as the acne is active scar treatments they are not necessarily going to be your best use of time when it comes to acne treatments there are a variety of really good over-the-counter FDA approved acne treatments adapalene salicylic acid benzo peroxide in the description box I link to a list of some of my favorites and I have lots of videos on this channel talking about these ingredients how they work what to expect with them how to use them so that point but you have to also understand that for many acne patients especially those whose acne is Prim primarily cysts and nodules are largely comprised of deep cysts and nodules the over-the-counter topical acne treatments are not enough on their own in most cases and you need some kind of prescription treatment to clear it up all acne can go on to scar it the acne that acne that is just blackheads and white heads it even you know inflammation there on on the microscopic level and it can scar so all acne can scar so getting it treated and staying consistent with your treatments don prematurely just because your skin clears up make sure you follow the advice of your dermatologist in terms of how long to continue the treatments most acne treatments you need to keep using in order to control the acne and that a reason why they fail you stop prematurely If part of your acne treatment involves you being on birth control pills and you decide I need to get off the birth control pills because I want to try and conceive let your dermatologists know way in advance of stopping those that way you can plan to start some other treatment to keep the acne under control while you come off birth control remember a lot of acne treatments that you apply to your skin or that you take by mouth they take some time to start working so don until you have to stop the birth control pills and don come back to pursue treatment get on it now by seeing your dermatologist don know this can be really challenging some some people pick their acne absent minate picking is a big reason for scarring if you do struggle with picking your skin I want you to watch my video on skin picking disorder I give a lot of tips and tricks in that video to stop the Habit um but don do it a lot of people do and most people don some point um it can be a coping mechanism for stress so definitely check that video out because picking definitely can lead to scarring hyperpigmentation yeah and it it keeps it so that your act has a very hard time going away don your acne don like the comone extractors that reason for people winding up with acne scars is you know trying to take matters into their own hands quite literally with these tools that you can buy um I from those because not all acne is amenable to um being extracted and so don cannot emphasize enough how valuable sun protection is for acne healing UV rays from the Sun they are immunosuppressive and they slow down the healing process and they put you at greater risk for poor healing and scar formation as well as post acne hyperpigmentation and redness so make sure you your skin with a broadspectrum sunscreen SPF 30 or higher reapply it every 2 hours while you are outdoors also wear Sun protective clothing hats seek shade when you are outside and don Outdoors too long in the midday hours that all right y to talk about for today regards to filler for acne scars again I want to reiterate there is no best acne scar treatment filler is one tool in the armamentarium can be really really helpful for some people totally useless for other people all depends on what type of agne Scar you are dealing with and it that would be helpful probably combination of other things as well now on the end slide I video All About TCA cross for acne scars definitely watch that one next cuz that might be offered to you either by itself or you know in combination with filler so check that one out next but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don I [Music] bye [Music]	Success
*NEW* Acne Laser Treatment Explained | Aviclear	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EUveVhOoXE	Dr Day	well hey guys today I want to talk about the new acne treatment laser avac clear gotten a lot of requests please talk about the new avac clear laser is it worth it we is how it works what you might expect with this treatment and how does it compare to what terms of acne treatment so avac clear was FDA cleared for acne in 2022 so it pretty new overall but truthfully it been in development for decades uh it a technology that we really began to understand a long time ago and it now come to fruition um so things take time what exactly is it it it it work for acne with acne you have a few factors going on that contribute to the overall disease process first of all you have a problem with the skin cell turnover lining the pore you get sticky skin cells stuck together and that leads to the formation of a plugged por known as a comone then you have the role of sebum the sebaceous oil gland drains into the poor and for whatever reason some people just make more oil compared to other people and this is under the influence not just of your genetics but also your hormones increase in seone plays a huge role because the third factor in acne overall is a little bacteria that resides down in the pore called cutie bacterium acne one that pore that with oil well that bacteria breaks down that oil and releases inflammatory mediators and that pimples that can be painful that can be deep and if left untreated acne of course can go on to scar not only that but in people who have a deeper skin tone acne is known to leave behind a dark mark that can last for a good long time and takes even longer to get rid of in comparison to the actual acne itself which is really frustrating so here in comes this new acne laser how does it work well it specifically targets the cells that make up the oil gland to basically destroy them so that in effect it cuts down on oil production the nice thing about this laser treatment is that it um is safe to use in all skin types and all skin tones as you know from many of my videos certain lasers and light based devices do come with a risk of leading to Burns in people who have a deeper skin tone as well as hyperpigmentation so the selection of laser and light based treatments has to be you know has to take somebody tone into account the nice thing about this laser is that it is safe to use in all skin tones and skin types the other nice thing about this is that it um also can treat acne that is primarily consisting of blackheads and white heads that can this laser treat treat active acne breakouts but it also can prevent future breakouts as you can imagine because it is selectively targeting those cells that make up the oil gland it has the it offers the ability to to lead to sustained clearance and fewer breakouts and as you can imagine anything that helps to clear up and prevent breakouts is also going to be beneficial secondarily and preventing the formation of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation or those dark spots that are left behind once acne heals for a lot of people who have tried this treatment their acne seems to clear up completely but for other people you know that necessarily the case but as it stands now it appears that not only can this laser clear up existing breakouts prevent future breakouts but the breakouts that you have in the future after having this laser treatment they less frequently and overall are less severe so that severe less frequent breakouts less likely to have scarring easier to control and less likely to deal with as much post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation when you there lead to that really stubborn discoloration and if I didn mention one advantage of this treatment is that not only can it be used to treat acne on the face but it also can be used to treat acne on the body a lot of our topical acne treatments their efficacy on the body like the chest the back kind of variable this new laser treatment is attractive to people because you know putting on acne medications on your skin typically requires you to continue using those acne creams acne treatments people would love something that they would have to maybe cut down on the frequency with which they use those that being said while this can help clear up acne for people not everyone experiences complete cure with this treatment so it is possible that you will still continue to have breakouts although hopefully it be less frequent and less intense but if that need to continue some sort of acne treatment whether it be a topical acne treatment that you put on your skin or one that you take by mouth it takes 3 months to complete the treatment and in a moment I entails but about 80% of patients note at that 3 months after finishing the treatment that at least half of their acne is clear then by 6 months after the treatment has been completed around 90% of people know uh an improvement and clearance of their acne so it suggests that the benefits continue after you have completed the treatment like there what might you expect with this treatment well a current treatment protocol is to have patients come in once a month for a 30 minute treatment session for 3 months total at the time of the treatment you may notice right away the pimples get maybe a little red but overall that redness Fades away pretty quickly you experience any crusting blistering this treatment can however be painful um you are fine to go about your day go back to work there associated with this so that you need some sort of Maintenance treatment as it stands now that question that has not been answered how does this compare to some of the other typical acne treatments as it stands now there are no comparison trials comparing this treatment versus the standard of care treatments that we have whether it be topical retinoids topical antibiotics whether it be um the topical medication class Cerone brand named wi Ley um or whether it be an oral regimen with an oral antibiotic spironolactone isotretinoin isotretinoin is the acne treatment that has the potential to offer a cure however only 60% of patients experience that the rest of the patients will either fail and require another round um or you know after the second round they still don uh clearance in their acne and the groups of people who tend to be that way tend to fail troan typically are women who um you know maybe their acne is more favored by hormonal changes um like I said in my other videos all acne has a hormonal component to it but in adult women it big driving force um is that hormonal issue and so that lot of women fail isotretinoin that being said will a lot of adult women fail or require maintenance treatments with the avoc clear laser only time will tell up until this point in the video you thinking what is there to lose with this treatment sounds really good I mean worst case scenario my acne comes back well one big downside of this treatment is it Insurance each treatment session is going to run you about $1,000 out of pocket and then there accessibility not every der ologist is going to have this device in their office for a dermatologist or any practitioner acquiring a device is an investment so don find that your dermatologist maybe doesn because as it stands now there are no randomized control trials looking at this new device let alone comparing it to standard treatments so for a dermatologist to think about investing in this they also have to think about you know the cost of maintaining it is it going to offer something to their patients above and beyond what they already can offer them if their patients are not able to afford it then why would they go B you know what I don dermatologists out there who are waiting for more data before investing in it and investing in using it in their office but as it stands now it is looking really promising a really attractive option and a lot of P are getting excellent results because there are no randomized control trials with this device um you know there just a lot of unknowns in terms of long-term results and how it compares to standard treatments what with it being so costly and access issues combined with again the fact that there control trials with this device um what you American Academy of Dermatology published updated acne treatment guidelines where they review the literature behind all of our acne treatments and you know they discuss that and and and and the like and they they left out the um 1726 nanometer laser specifically because there are no randomized control trials to guide recommendations on whether or not it should be offered and to What patients it should be offered all in all though it acne treatment especially since it offers the potential to cure acne for some people doesn hyperpigmentation and another benefit of a light based device such as this is that there systemic side effect like risks you know with isotron or an antibiotic or even spironolactone all those medications are safe they do have side effects associated with them a lot of patients don potential side effects um this you know avoids exposing yourself systemically your body to a drug and it also avoids exposing your skin long term to certain topical medications that may either be drying or irritating or that may um interfere with your skin microbiome such as a topical antibiotic which we try and limit the duration of um now all that to say it open the door for you to never have to have another acne treatment medication topical prescription again but if it could cure your acne such that it doesn free you and long term probably would be a lot more cost effective anyway y that avoc clear laser really exciting development I look forward to there being more research down the road more long-term experience with this we will get hopefully answers to some of these unknowns that I post here in today video but I hope it was informative do let me know in the comments if you have tried this new treatment is this something that your doctor has offered you in terms of acne treatment what was your experience with it do share in the comments um you know the community in the comments is very valuable so hope you all enjoyed this video if so give it a thumbs up share it

The Best Supplement For PCOS And Acne | Myo-Inositol	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxO9-MM_hyQ	Dr Day	well hey guys in today going to talk about polycystic ovary syndrome this is the most common hormone disorder in women of reproductive age I know a lot of you all struggle with it and of course it has various skin findings associated with it skin problems that can be stubborn and difficult to tackle in this video we going to be talking about the underlying root causes of polycystic ovary syndrome why you have skin problems and hair problems and I conventional medications used to treat polycystic ovary syndrome it symptoms but I want you to watch to the end because we deep dive on a dietary supplement that actually has a lot of research to support its efficacy for addressing various problems in PCOS including acne all right PCOS polycystic ovary syndrome it is a hormone problem and it characterized by a few things first of all hyper and androgenisation menstrual irregularity abnormal periods and as a result of that they often and later on will have difficulty conceiving and many women with PCOS if you look at their ovaries they have these cysts hence the name polycystic ovary lots of cyst you don have to have all of these features to be diagnosed with PCOS you have to have two out of the three the root cause of PCOS is not one single thing it are most health problems and part of its root cause is actually disregulation of hormone release from a part of your brain called the hypothalamus with PCOS there is a problem with types of hormones called gatot tropins gonadotropin specifically a luteinizing hormone LH and a follicle stimulating hormone FSH so if you look at the ratio between LH and FSH it is abnormally high so there there the reason this is important is because those hormones like I said they talk to your ovaries LH tells certain cells in your ovaries called Thea cells to make something called andr diione which is an androgen hormone follicle stimulating hormone on the other hand it talks to cells in your ovary called granulosis cells and it tells those cells to convert the andrena diione to estrone and estrogen using an enzyme called aromatase but with PCOS you have high levels of LH which overstimulate those Thea cells in the ovary making excess andrena diione so it enhances Androgen production leading to elevation in androgens and that lot of the skin and hair findings associated with PCOS like acne oily skin hertis we already talked about hair growth in a male pattern it can affect the hair follicles on your scalp causing them to miniaturize turn into a baby hair and you get hair loss specifically androgenetic alopecia the problem with the elevated LH relative to FSH is that it um you know your ovary is trying to pick the best follicle to ovulate okay like an egg but because you have a disruption there in those hormone levels basically the follicle kind of gets stuck so that gives rise to the appearance of those cysts again not everyone who has PCOS will have these cysts but many do and this is why the imbalance in LH to FSH arrests the follicle development so you don normal ovulation that irregular periods and problems with fertility the other pressing hormonal issue with PCOS is a problem with the hormone insulin specifically the body does not respond to it while the cells of your body don and as a result you have insulin resistance diabetes many women not all with PCOS also struggle with weight management possibly related to this hormone imbalance with insulin um or some other background genetic tendency and being overweight having obesity also tips the scale in favor of insulin resistance diabetes and further problems with irregular menes and infertility and all these things together also exacerbate the skin findings acne oiliness heroism androgenetic alopecia just like not everyone with PCOS will have polycystic ovaries not everyone with PCOS actually has insulin resistance so just remember that PCOS looks different for everyone everyone has kind of a different makeup different factors going on that play a role in the symptoms that they deal with and so not everything is going to work for everyone in the same fashion which brings me to the next Point how do we treat these issues there are a few standard medications one is combined oral contraceptive pills combined oral contraceptive pills commonly refer to as birth control pills because well if you take them they you know prevent their contraceptives they because they have an estrogen component and they have a progestin component combine oral contraceptive pills are beneficial for PCOS because basically what they do is in in PCOS because you have that abnormality and the hormones coming from the brain to talk to the ovaries the brain is trying to put out those hormones in an effort to get the the ovaries to respond properly but it disregulated so the birth control pills come in and it feedback loop the birth control pills the hormones in them they say sh they quiet this down and as a result they can help to normalize the gatot tropen profile and improve ovulation and get your period back on track and they can help lower the levels of those Androgen hormones that are causing acne CA hair growth in a male pattern heroism and androgenetic alopecia even women with acne who do not have PCOS like they have no problem with fertility they don have cystic ovaries and they don other signs of Androgen excess in those women using birth control pill combined oral contraceptive pills also can help their acne as well because as I before all acne has a hormonal component but in PCOS the cards are stacked against you because you are in this hyper Androgen State and those androgens are what are telling the oil gland to make more oil driving the acne driving the oily skin the cbera I have a video as a side note on the best birth control for acne for the hormonal component of acne so check that out because I go more into detail about the different types of hormonal contraceptive pills that can address acne but if you know anything about birth control pills they right for everyone okay they do have some side effects um depending on other things that are going on in your life they may not be right for you they can increase the risk of blood clots um and they you know have side effects some people don they may cause some weight gain which in the setting of PCOS is not ideal if you struggle with your weight to begin with they also can cause Melasma a skin condition with hyperpigmentation while women with PCOS struggle to conceive it and many want to try so you have to come off the birth control pills in order to try and get pregnant now up into this point the skin and hair stuff I pointed out has largely been related to the Androgen excess but uh when you have the insulin resistance piece in there that more acne but it also causes a skin condition called acanthosis nigricans thickened velvety dark brown to grayish areas of the skin often on the sides of the neck under the arms sides of the face that is a manifestation of insulin resistance if you want to know more skin signs of insulin resistance diabetes check out my video on skin signs of insulin resistance I below well a medication that I about on here before is called spironolactone spironolactone is an anti-androgen so it helps with the Androgen piece of things but it also can help improve insulin uh responsiveness and it complements birth control pills so they can be used together having insulin resistance is not simply a matter of oh I have high blood sugar it it has a Cascade effect to a variety of metabolic parameters that can have consequences for your overall health for example you can have abnormal blood lipids cholesterol as a result of insulin resistance spironolactone works as an as an anti-androgen it it can complement the birth control pills um and it will help to improve acne it helps to improve heroism and it also helps to improve androgenetic alopecia as well as reduce oiliness these are all things that have to do with the Androgen excess and to a certain extent spironolactone helps with the insulin resistance and cardiometabolic abnormalities in PCOS spironolactone is generally well tolerated but it does have some side effects it can cause breast tenderness and menstrual irregularities probably the most common and with PCOS you already have problems with the menstrual cycle so that might not be acceptable for everyone depending on you know if you spironolactone again is not a good option for you because you can if you it main players for addressing the insulin resistance is metformin metformin is a medication that works to decrease um glucose output from the liver and it also helps improve uptake of glucose into cells so not only does metformin help with the insulin resistance but it also can improve ovulation and encourage more normal periods in a you know regular menstrual cycle so that is going to be helpful especially for women who want to conceive there there are side effects with metformin specifically it can cause some gastrointestinal upset you know upset stomach so again not every medication is right for every person and PCOS again does not look the same for everyone not all women have um insulin resistance some women have more difficulty conceiving compared to others a lot of women are not interested in taking birth control pills because of side effects a lot of women don like spironolactone is something they want to be on they with the side effects they develop them everyone again has their reasons for what they want to pursue with their own health what if I told you there is a dietary supplement that has quite a bit of research to support its efficacy in improving many of the signs symptoms health problems with PCOS including acne including heroism so much so it investigated in PCOS dating back to the late 90s so over 20 years of research showing benefit the supplement what is it called myo andosol there are actually nine different forms of anasl so the myoinositol is what I dietary supplement but it naturally abundant in many foods that you can get in your diet um myoinositol as it turns out is really really important for what happens inside the cells after insulin binds to the insulin receptor okay and it turns out that women with PCOS it appears as though they have a problem at the level of a nosl and how it um you know regulates cell responsiveness to insulin so getting in myoinositol can improve a lot of what is abnormal in PCOS including acne including heroism where do you get myoan aetl it beans corn and nuts so quite high in those Foods specifically but they also have myo andosol supplements that have been studied for PCOS and randomized control trials if you go into the endocrin ologic gynecologic literature you studies on myo andosol and PCOS now there in terms of the studies the doses that are used the outcomes that they measuring the characteristics of the patients in these studies but all of the studies do support beneficial outcomes for women with PCOS taking myosl not only can It improve glucose uptake but it can improve that hormone Al imbalance I myoan aetl supplement this video is only for educational purposes I tell you oh go take myosl I giving you the information so that you discuss with your doctor myoinositol it actually can improve the abnormal balance between LH and FSH that is you know a problem in PCS like we talked about it also can improve your metabolic profile so again women who have PCOS they often have a metabolic metabolic abnormalities problems with things like um not only their blood glucose but also uh the lipids triglycerides cholesterol it can improve the levels of LH which are typically elevated in uh PC it can improve that LH to FSH ratio it can lower andrena diione the Androgen hormone that is playing a role in the acne the heroism the pattern hair loss and it does improve acne it improves acne quite well in women with PCOS it can also improve the elevation in insulin which ultimately can be beneficial for the signs of high insulin as it impacts the skin namely that condition acanthosis nigricans women with PCOS given myo andol they show Improvement in their total cholesterol lowers they also get an improvement in uh HDL that raised many women with PCOS who take myo and oocl they also show improvements in their BMI which yes I know is not a perfect metric it has its flaws it has its issues but um when it comes to treating PCOS weight management for women who are overweight or have obesity is really important because it exacerbates all of the problems like uh menstrual irregularity and you know the metabolic problems are further you know worsened by the um by by the excess body any way um and it and it improve fertility the improvements in acne and heroism are pretty significant I will say comparable to at least what you can see with a birth control pill a combined oral contraceptive pill so for women who are not interested or a candidate for oral contraceptive pills they for spironolactone and they feeling like what else is there available you know we have other acne medications right can treat acne um isotretinoin a retinoid uh not safe in pregnancy right you have topical retinoids those aren you also have antibiotics they of a short-term fix clear things up uh not a long-term solution though they kind of you know they suppress the inflammation but they used in order to kind of get a head start so that the medications that really work to control acne like isotretinoin or spironolactone have time to start working right myo andosol appears to be a safe and effective alternative what do I mean by safe okay I to reiterate it whether it be this or any other dietary supplement out there dietary supplements they are not without the potential risks they risks of harm to human health people have this misconception that supplements are safe much better than a drug but supplements if they work they like a drug and they can definitely side effects just like any prescription medication um so what are the side effects with myo andosol uh appear to have no side effects no side effects reported in any of these trials not only that but we know it actually been used in some of the um GYN and endocrinology literature um looking at women with PCOS trying to conceive going through fertility treatments and showing success um with myo and ocl now that area of expertise so I tell you take this it fertility but it has been examined in studies in in women with PCOS trying to conceive as with anything it poison it have been used and that appear to be safe and effective typically 2 gam of myosl Taken twice a day so 4 G total 2 G in the morning 2 G in the evening again this video is for educational purposes only to make you aware of this option it you feeling defeated something that you can now go to your doctor and talk about hey is this an option for me I you to take it I information that this exists out there can you use it alongside other medications yes there are studies looking at um myo and ocl combined with say combined oral contraceptive pills and showing that people get women get better results with both together than either alone so say you of these treatments you results in terms of clearing acne um and cbera but not 100% there support adding myo and ocl to the regimen as a safe and effective way to get better results um can improve acne significantly Herm significantly no research on it though for androgenetic Alopecia there directly looking at cbera but patients who take this often do report an improvement in oiliness but it does improve insulin responsiveness that myosl a supplement that actually um can work actually has a good track record of safety and efficacy specifically for women with PCOS now what if you don have PCOS but you and you know you birth control pills spon lactone which are not exclusive to treating acne and women with PCOS because again all acne has that hormonal component and these are medications that we use in women to treat um the hormonal aspect of acne and help control it but what if you those things or again you want to get pregnant is this something that will be effective for you what I can tell you is there are no actual studies really looking at this supplement outside of pcus um however women who just have acne do appreciate an improvement in their acne when they take this but we just don recommending it outside of PCOS um what about men is this effective for acne and Men we don effective for acne and Men safe for men to take and research does suggest that in men who have um problems with sperm counts you know they conceive their partner uh because of sperm sperm problems in you know inadequate sperm counts or maybe a motility issue um the the research actually does support uh that myosl can be beneficial for improving that now that uh in terms of fertility so the research exists out there talk to your doctor about it there are treatments with good track records but not every treatment is going to be the right track for every person out there okay so that making this video because I know a lot of you guys ask what else is there what else is there I don I can spironolactone I can pills I want to get pregnant surely there your doctor about this because there good research for this it effective and for PCOS specifically it definitely has a long-standing track record showing efficacy now that being said the research has its limitations again there was a lot of heterogeneity out there so there could be groups of people with either PCOS and or just acne for which this does not work okay for which this just does not work more research is needed but definitely worth having a discussion with your doctor especially if you frustrated with the available treatments out there for things like acne heroism androgenetic alopecia although again it hasn Alopecia anyway y was helpful to you um if so give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe I [Music] bye no	Success
IS IT ACNE OR ROSACEA? ?? Dermatologist @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LEKd0Z5Uho	Dr Day	well hey guys how do you tell the difference between acne and rosacea in today you exactly how to do that now if you dealing with redness and painful pimples breakouts you might think you have acne but you could actually have rosacea they look very similar as I not everything that looks like acne is acne and rosacea is pretty darn common and the reason it the difference and know what you dealing with is because the approach to treating each condition is very different and in order to get good control of either condition you to know what it is you are dealing with when it comes to acne the signature skin lesion the spot that is very characteristic of acne is called a Comey Dome basically a plugged up pore now that comidone can have a black spot in it or it can present as a white bump these are commonly referred to as blackheads and whiteheads but the medical term for them is open and closed comedones but with acne you can also have Painful nodules and cysts and you can have red bombs that fill with pus as referred to as pustules in contrast with rosacea you can have red spots you can have pustules but there are no comedones no blackheads no white heads people with rosacea they can have very prominent pores but the pores are not clogged poor clogging is not a part of rosacea both acne and rosacea present with facial redness but where the redness is located is different in each condition with acne the redness tends to be confined around the breakouts whereas with rosacea the redness is more widespread covering the cheeks the nose the forehead the chin with rosacea the redness can come and go with acne the redness pretty much goes along with the breakout and it may last long after the breakout has healed that now I have a whole video explaining that and how to get rid of that so check that video out and in the beginning with rosacea the redness actually comes and goes but with time if the rosacea is not kept under good control that redness can persist and be there all the time fixed facial redness acne affects the skin rosacea affects the skin and it often can affect the eyes this can appear with bloodshot eyes crusty eyelids swollen eyelids dry eyes and The Sensation of like grittiness in the eyes that is a very important distinction over half of people who have rosacea have involvement of their eyes a trigger for acne is an increase in oil production and people who have acne often tend to have oily skin not 100 of them do but many of them do because the oiliness really feeds the little bacteria that live in the Skin Within the pore and that all leads to inflammation rosacea on the other hand is not necessarily an oily skin condition sure you may have a genetic tendency towards oiliness along with rosacea but the oiliness is not playing a role in rosacea so treatments that address oiliness will not improve the rosacea whereas treatments that address oiliness can help improve acne another distinguishing feature between acne and rosacea is what happens when you do nothing when you do nothing with acne the consequence Downstream is that it can heal with a scar there are a lot of different types of acne scars I have videos on this channel as to the different types of acne scars the different treatments for these scarves as a reminder you can have a raised SCAR or you can have a depressed scar acne can also heal with a dark mark or a red mark post acne redness post acne hyperpigmentation rosacea on the other hand left untreated left uncontrolled the consequence of that is that the individual can go on to experienced persistent facial redness that does not go away they also can develop prominent dilated blood vessels and in some cases although pretty rare it is also possible to develop skin thickening in the areas involved with the rosacea this is referred to as feminist change often can involve the nose but it can really affect anywhere on the face where you got rosacea flares chin forehead in contrast to acne climate as change is not a scar but as you can see it important to treat both conditions because there are consequences that are long-lasting when the conditions are not appropriately managed another distinguishing feature between acne and rosacea are the symptoms acne especially cystic acne can be very very painful but a lot of times acne can also itch rosacea on the other hand is a skin condition where one of the Hallmark findings is the fact that patients are exquisitely sensitive to things that come in contact with the skin whether that be makeup sunscreen perfume skin care products other Cosmetics they also exquisitely sensitive to the Sun as well as to wind and to just really anything coming in contact with the skin and this leads to symptoms of burning stinging sometimes itch sometimes discomfort sometimes a feeling of heat in the skin when you or is this rosacea pay attention to the location where you are breaking out acne tends to affect the forehead the cheeks the nose it can affect the neck the upper chest and the upper back as well as the shoulders whereas rosacea tends to affect the mid face like the cheeks over the nose it can also affect the forehead and the chin it can extend to involve the scalp and it also can involve the neck the upper chest and the upper back the people who get acne are a little different from the people who get rosacea although there is some overlap people who get acne most commonly are in their teens are tweens but truthfully you can develop acne at any age including in a newborn and adults as a side note recently I did a whole video on acne in your 40s and above so check that one out we explain why you are still breaking out breaking out for the first time as an adult acne affects all Races all skin tones rosacea on the other hand while it really could occur at any age generally speaking it impacts adults 30 years of age and above of course there are exceptions to that but it generally is a disease that first presents in adulthood all Races can be affected by rosacea it is generally taught that rosacea is a lot more common in people who have paler skin types I have always questioned this because I do think that and people who have a deeper skin tone it to miss a diagnosis of rosacea because the redness of rosacea can be very subtle in a deeper skin tone so getting a really good history for my patient with a deeper skin tone and always considering rosacea as a possibility is super important I think a lot of patients who have deeper skin tones might accidentally be misdiagnosed as having acne if you don and whiteheads and you also have symptoms of Exquisite sensitivity burning stinging if you feel as though your eyes are are being impacted you got bloodshot eyes crusty eyelids a feeling of like something in your eye you might actually have rosacea I want to interject why it distinguish the two accurately because the treatment for one could potentially worsen the other condition so that why an accurate diagnosis is King taking a step back let causes acne as opposed to what causes rosacea the causes are different both conditions likely have an underlying genetic component we can always blame our genetics oh officer I was going 10 miles over the speed limit because it my genetics it I digress all right when it comes to acne there are a few factors playing a role acne is a condition where the sebaceous oil gland plays a major role as I mentioned earlier with acne you have an increase in sebum output that is largely governed by genetics again as well as your hormones um whereas rosacea there is no issue going on with the sebaceous oil gland putting out more oil so there that takes that out of the equation with acne you also have a problem with the cells lining the pore not turning over efficiently they kind of get stuck together and that comedones blackheads and whiteheads with rosacea that with acne as a consequence of the plugging up of the pore and the increase in sebum you have another little Factor down there in your pore called cutie bacterium acne that is a part of everyone in an acne pore and within that comidone and with all that extra sea bomb it starts snacking on that breaks it down into something that triggers a lot of inflammation and that painful acne cysts think of rosacea on the other hand as a problem that is a neurosensory issue where you have little nerves that go through your skin and for whatever reason in rosacea the working idea is that the nerves in rosacea release inflammatory mediators apparently upon exposure to otherwise innocuous things that can lead to blood vessel dilation with rosacea there also some degree of local skin immune dysregulation now in acne I mentioned there everyone for some of the acne symptoms while that character cutie bacterium acnes is not playing a role in rosacea there is another Little Critter that likely plays a major role in a lot of people rosacea and that is Demodex mites Demodex are part of everyone skin biology but it people who have rosacea they have an abnormal inflammatory response to that little Mite or they have an overabundance of that little mind so you for rosacea actually specifically Target that part of rose Asia namely ivermecta and topical Ivermectin sold the brand name for that is cilantro so the root causes of acne and rosacea are much different and the things that trigger an acne flare are very different from the things that trigger a rosacea flare with acne you can get a flare from changes in your hormones this is especially the case when you have acne as an adult adult women with acne breakouts a lot of it can be influenced by changes in the hormones the Androgen hormones signal to the oil gland make more oil and that can lead to acne breakouts with acne you also have things that you put on your skin can potentially trigger acne flares if they are comedogenic now skin care products are not formulated to be comedogenic but sometimes sometimes patients find that certain products lead to worsening of acne aggravate their acne especially the kids with very heavy oily Cosmetics or heavy oily hair care products like oily pomades are known to trigger comedones on the forehead or the sides of the face face where the hair touches medications and supplements can trigger acne certain diets may play a role in someone acne I I have a video all about a clear skin diet and foods that researchers believe may play a role in acne but suffice it to say the full story on how our foods and diets impact an individual not fully elucidated and acne can have an interesting response to sun exposure some people find that their acne actually calms down a bit with sun exposure but it get a lot worse after sun exposure likely because exposure to the sun is immunosuppressive but you can get this rebound worsening of acne now rosacea on the other hand let there do hormones influence rosacea they probably do to a certain extent but there Androgen hormones driving oil production and leading to to flares that to acne not really it driving force although you may find that your skin is even more sensitive active with changes in hormones for example changes and hormone profiles around your menstrual cycle may make your skin overall more sensitive more prone to redness skin care products Cosmetics fragrances things that come in contact with the skin are notorious for triggering rosacea and I always get a lot of questions like what skin care products are off limits for rosacea a lot of it really is highly variable and very unique to the individual but in general things like Menthol fragrance ingredients that have cinnamon cinnamaldehyde these can actually trigger vasodilation and worsen redness now heavy moisturizers in rosacea actually can trigger a flare much different from how heavy greasy products might aggravate acne by potentially poor clogging with rosacea a really really heavy moisturizer may actually make you feel a little overheated because it might slow down the evaporate operation of sweat and as you start to feel overheated your body is going to be to flush and so it can trigger a flush a flare of rosacea with flushing and blushing which is a Hallmark symptom of rosacea upon exposure to things that are irritating to the skin rosacea definitely can be triggered by many different foods I have a video going into detail about different foods that trigger facial redness if you have rosacea you absolutely need to watch that video because there are some mechanisms there that I think will be very helpful for you to understand spicy foods tend to be a culprit likely through vasodilation a lot of people with rosacea are very sensitive to alcohol triggers a flush not everyone for whatever reason red wine seems to be more of a culprit for a lot of people but again it individualized so just pay attention to how your skin responds when you do consume alcohol and consider omitting it completely or perhaps it type of alcohol that for you you also have to be careful with consuming hot liquids like hot tea hot coffee drinking warm soups because that warmth can precipitate a flush of course again this is not true for everyone but it is a relatively common trigger in rosacea you definitely need to be very cognizant of your sun exposure because UV rays definitely are a notorious trigger for a rosacea flare in general people with rosacea are more sensitive to heat that can be from the environment or from sitting next to a heater once they start getting overheated and flush boom that can trigger trigger a flare of course harsh skin care products excessive cleansing definitely can aggravate rosacea something that is common to both acne and rosacea that a lot of people Miss is the fact that both conditions there is an underlying problem with the Skin Barrier and therefore moisturizing can be beneficial for minimizing symptoms and minimizing flare of both conditions it matter of choosing a moisturizer that works for your skin and doesn aggravate your skin so for acne if you find that certain moisturizers seem to aggravate breakouts then avoid those and go with something that is more lightweight likewise with rosacea pick a moisturizer that is more lightweight it it people with rosacea it products that are free of fragrance and and common irritants like certain essential oils for example because these ingredients they may actually worsen redness cause vasodilation and precipitate a flare so go really mild really boring really Bland now that you know a little bit about how these two differ hopefully these tips in this video arm you with the information that maybe you can begin to distinguish yourself why do we treat acne why do we treat rosacea it acne because regardless of acne severity it can go on to lead to permanent scarring which is what we trying to prevent and it also can lead to very stubborn hyperpigmentation and very stubborn redness around the acne breakouts that takes a long time to resolve the other reason to treat acne is because it has a huge impact on your quality of life and a lot of people with acne that is untreated they have a lot of mental health consequences as a result so treating your acne could potentially help with your mental health research it clearly shows that having acne is associated with more symptoms of depression and a lot of acne treatments once initiated and the acne improves there is an improvement in the mental health symptoms so that is another potential benefit and the other reason to treat acne is treating it early prevents further flares treating acne also can help give you some relief from the pain and possible itch of painful acne lesions why treat rosacea it important to treat rosacea because treating it especially early can prevent you going on to have fixed facial redness it can basically help in preventing it from getting worse can prevent you from going on to develop those prominent dilated blood vessels telangentasias and treating it early can help get you some relief from the most uncomfortable symptoms of flushing blushing burning stinging treating rosacea is also very beneficial for your overall quality of life and again your mental health both acne and rosacea untreated can impact your quality of life and mental health which in and of itself is definitely a reason to pursue treatment the other reason it important to evaluate and treat rosacea early on is to assess for comorbid eye involvement over half of patients with rosacea will have involvement of their eyes sometimes the eye involvement comes long before the skin symptoms and so untreated the eye involvement can lead to eye problems symptoms in the eyes include bloodshot eyes crusting of the eyelids swollen eyelids itchy dry eyes and if not those symptoms persist then that inflammation in the eye can have consequences for your eye health so evaluating rosacea early on in the course and looking for possible eye involvement and treating and addressing that appropriately through you know referral to referral to an ophthalmologist if necessary is really important now I encourage you to see a board-certified dermatologist for evaluation and management so that you can not only ensure that you have the right diagnosis but that you best treatment plan for you treating acne treating rosacea it cookbook approach everyone differs everyone what treatment for one person is simply not going to be right for another person it you don and say if rosacea then X Y and Z it not that algorithmic some things are going to be better options depending on overall symptoms skin lesions severity all sorts of the factors go into go into picking the best treatment for either acne or rosacea anyways guys I hope this video was helpful in laying out how to distinguish acne from rosacea how they differ hopefully gave you a clear understanding that the treatment approaches need to be much different and they both conditions now as I mentioned I have a video on foods that cause facial redness I end slate make sure you watch that if you are dealing with facial redness of any form including related to rosacea because you will identify potentially certain foods that may be aggravating it if you guys enjoyed this video though give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow bye thank you

Acne at 40? A Dermatologist Reveals The Hidden Triggers	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EKLkCW_gio	Dr Day	well hey guys in today talk about acne in your 40s as you all know I recently went to the American Academy of Dermatology meeting in New Orleans I attended a lot of lectures and one of them was related to acne in adults and it got me thinking I know a lot of you all struggle with this and it I happens in your adult years why you get it for the first time or why you still dealing with it I think understanding why things happen is really really empowering I hear so often people say you know doctors dermatologists they don root cause of issues all they do is prescribe medications but we really do get to the root cause of why certain things happen and our medications that we use to treat these things do address the root cause acne is a skin condition where there are a lot of different factors playing a role that all culminate in the root cause first of all you have a problem with the skin cells lining the pore they don appropriately they get very sticky and clog up the pore another problem is you have a lot of sebum being produced from the oil gland that is associated with it and as that sebum is being produced there down in the pore called ketobacterium acnes he feeds off of that sebum and breaks it down into inflammatory compounds that bring in a lot of inflammation lead to painful breakouts when we production and the sebaceous oil gland and its role in acne it influenced by our hormones this is one of the main reasons why people can continue to experience acne into their adult years especially women and especially around the time leading up to menopause and with menopause menopause is presented to women I think this is sort of vague concept but it as a point at which 12 months have elapsed after a woman the years leading up to menopause are referred to as perimenopause and you can have a lot of different symptoms related to changes in hormones leading up to menopause things like hot flashes night sweats irregular periods mood changes and acne I titled this video acne in your 40s because acne can really crop up during this time for women menopause usually it happens in your 50s but perimenopause usually starts around age 45. of course the age at which this happens varies from person to person and the duration of perimenopause and perimenopausal symptoms will vary a lot from person to person some people can deal with perimenopausal symptoms for 14 years when it comes to acne in adult women hormonal factors are a major driving component the reason for this is that with menopausal changes you have a decline in the estrogen hormones and a subsequent increase in the Androgen hormones those are the male hormones but both men and women have Androgen hormones it that drive oil production from the sebaceous oil gland you see those Androgen hormones stimulate sebicides which are the cells that make up the oil gland to proliferate and to make more sebum than cutie bacterium acnes down there in the poor Goes to Town snacking on that generating a lot of inflammatory mediators known as lipasas the changes in hormones with perimenopause and menopause also affect the scalp hairs you have a decrease in hair growth rate you have a decrease in the growing phase of the hair cycle and you also have a shift from terminal hairs which are the the hairs that you see on your head to fine velas baby hairs they miniaturize and that is part and parcel of what is referred to as androgenetic alopecia androgenetic because there of course is a genetic tendency towards developing this but it is obviously also influenced by those Androgen hormones you might ask yourself why is it that with perimenopause and menopause we start losing more hair on our head but it seems to grow everywhere else yes this is the great Paradox of hair loss and hair growth for whatever reason the scalp hairs respond to changes in hormones differently in comparison to the hair follicles on the rest of your body you see the Androgen hormones you have testosterone testosterone gets converted to something called dihydrotestosterone through an enzyme known as five Alpha reductase that dihydrotestosterone has greater affinity for the Androgen receptor that potent form is actually what is influencing the sebaceous oil gland leading to acne and and it hair cycle on your scalp and also oddly enough leads to increase in terminal hair growth in a male pattern hirsutism is hair growth in a male pattern the upper lip sides of the face the areola the upper thighs and the abdomen so skin and hair changes that can happen in perimenopause and menopause not only include acne but also hair loss and hirsutism now not everyone going through perimenopause and menopause developsies these changes that women can experience with perimenopause and menopause in terms of acne hair loss and hirsutism these are referred to as Androgen mediated cutaneous disorders so is it just part of normal aging for some people it absolutely is part of normal aging for many women to develop these types of skin and hair side effects however one thing you will hear over and over again for many women who are in perimenopause and menopause is that they really don being taken seriously by their health care team by their doctors you know they have a lot of concerns about the things that they they always feel as though their concerns are being addressed acknowledged often feel as though they oh this is just normal aging bye and in some cases having these Androgen mediated cutaneous disorders that mouthful things like acne hirsutism and a female pattern hair loss or androgenetic alopecia it just related to normal aging you definitely need to take these things seriously women who have these concerns they should at the very least get a very good history and physical exam a woman coming to their dermatologist in perimenopause or menopause saying hey I never had it before my acne I whole life why is it not going away it actually seems to be getting worse right there a very good history and physical exam are warranted yes it could be normal age related you know acne as as it relates to the hormonal changes around menopause but it also could be associated with some other things that acetate more of a work on so your doctor taking a really good history is very important things that they want to be asking you or like you know let periods throughout your life and that may seem odd to be talking to your dermatologist about your periods but it really does matter have you ever conceived or tried to conceive did you have difficulty conceiving have you ever been pregnant other things that are important to know are what is your family history do the women in your family did they struggle with heavy periods irregular periods do they struggle to get pregnant those are important questions that the doctors should be asking you the other thing I would ask them is as a side note do you do any sort of facial hair removal or body hair removal and that might seem like an odd question but if you think about it a lot of people remove facial and body hair they concern for acne and they may not realize hey I also have a lot of hair growth but that be elicited in the questioning because if you have a lot of new onset hair growth say on your upper lip in a male pattern hirsutism but you presenting that way because you removed it that the history to get out a physical exam is very important not only focusing on the acne but the patient overall where is the acne located is it on the face only or is it face chest and back buttocks those are important because that treatments might be offered for the acne but importantly are there other skin and hair signs that might suggest a more involved process Beyond normal age-related changes and acne triggered by hormonal changes as they relate to menopause for example what does the hair look like is there evidence of miniaturization of those hair follicles on a scalp exam are there any other physical exam findings that suggest underlying hormonal disorders that would overlap with hyperandrogenism for example is there acanthosis nigrocans that might suggest insulin resistance and support more of a diagnosis of PCOS or is there obesity because there are some other underlying problems that can present very similarly for example you can have what hyperandrogenism uh iatrogenic meaning like you a medication either by mouth or you injecting it or a supplement that is influencing your hormones this can be an anabolic steroid maybe you in sport and you supplement that has anabolic steroids in it that can lead to many of these Androgen dependent cutaneous disorders or maybe you are taking testosterone some women are prescribed testosterone for some of the symptoms of perimenopause like low libido and those can cause iatrogenic hyperandrogenism and impact your skin lead to acne and can lead to exacerbation of androgenetic alopecia trigger that for those who have a genetic tendency towards that and also can lead to hirsutism also certain medications can paint the picture of hyperandrogenism namely those known in the class of anti-epileptics now these are medications that are used to treat seizures but they to treat migraines for example the medication valproic acid otherwise known as Depakote that valproic acid can actually cause a PCOS like picture and I say like picture in that oh it the medication causing symptoms of PCOS by messing up the hormones a similar medication oxycarbazepine likewise can cause a similar disruption in the in the hormone levels leading to these types of things so you know changing the medications around lowering the dose working you know if you to treat migraines talking to the neurologist about a possible switch but you also can make it into your 40s and in 50s with undiagnosed PCOS this is not out of the realm of possibility it actually probably more common than you would think a lot of women deal with irregular menstrual cycles and difficult problems with conceiving a lot of women deal with diabetes insulin distance these are all things related to PCOS and they may go they while without being properly evaluated making it into their 40s and finally get a diagnosis again coming back to the physical exam some other findings that might suggest PCOS are you know like acanthosis Niger cans suggested or maybe some underlying insulin resistance there that goes hand in hand with PCOS where you also can have disruption and hyperandrogenism and acne pattern hair loss and hirsutism you also can make it into your 40s with undiagnosed congenital adrenal hyperplasia this is a disorder of the adrenal gland that can can likewise cause hyperandrogenism last but not least you can have a adrenal tumor or an ovarian tumor that secretes androgens that is a possibility so that is not just normal aging this is why seeing your doctor talking to them getting a doctor that you feel comfortable with that you feel as though you this is why your doctor-patient relationship is key you know if you don relationship now try and find one Foster it because during the perimenopause and menopause you need to have someone who you feel comfortable talking to and you feel as though they are going to listen and hear what you have to say and take your symptoms seriously and not just brush you off as oh this is just menopause because there are situations where it is more than just menopause and it want to talk about your symptoms why they is going to advocate for you and and be there when when you these things and there are also a whole other host of symptoms that women deal with during perimenopause and menopause that affect everyone differently the degree of these symptoms is different for each woman the duration with which you deal with them is different how you addressing them it terms of treatment options if you don have a doctor that has the time to address these things you need to find another doctor if you don is taking your symptoms as they relate to menopause seriously then how are you going to confide in this individual if you develop stomach pain down the road are you going to feel apprehensive that they don I mean it like it this should be this should really vet out who is going to be in your best interest I really would encourage you to approach developing a physician-patient relationship as a as a as a relationship where you are both on part of the same team you know it not one of these Where I Am the Doctor listen to everything I say it that buy you need to feel confident that the person guiding you through this medical decision making at this key time span in your life has the time for you if you don time if you feel as though they dismissing you they your phone calls um then you really need to find someone else I know you clicked into this video to hear about adult Act acne but I have to emphasize having a good physician relationship it difference for you as you get into your 60s 70s 80s and Beyond you really you know it that you really want to cultivate as early as possible it do so but as early as possible and again if you don being heard if not now then when why waste any more time with a physician who is just not able to give you the time that you need and deserve it it going to be likely making more medical decisions then you have say in years prior if you healthy getting into your 40s and 50s and experiencing the symptoms of that can come with menopause although again not everyone goes through the same symptoms the same severity but if you experiencing these things for the first time it can actually be a very strange place to be because you you know healthy your whole life and no going through perimenopause and menopause is not unhealthy but to have symptoms that negatively are impacting you I really feel like a lot of women can almost feel like uh like their symptoms are not are just all in their head that need someone who has a time to listen explain things and really listen to you when you feel like things are not right because if you life you have for over four decades there good chance you have some intuition that if you feel as though things are not right in your body you need someone who bring this to your attention in these cases where adult acne is more than adult acne yes it can be a perfectly normal thing but if you don though it changes very strongly new Sunset lots of hair you body that yeah these are not these are not just normal aging even if it is normal aging there are effective treatments out there for acne that work well in adulthood many of the same things that we use to treat acne and Adolescence pre-adolescence are used to treat acne in adults but with menopause you also have some other skin changes right your skin becomes drier tends it doesn as well so topical medications for acne which are drying to begin with they can be even more drying even more irritating uh so stuff that you can buy over the counter that is FDA approved for acne as an over-the-counter treatment those things can still work in an adult acne they can still help and they they may in some cases be enough for you salicylic acid can help exfoliate the pore and can help minimize breakouts benzoyl peroxide is anti-inflammatory targets that cutie bacterium acnes which is there and it also is anti-inflammatory it helps clear and prevent breakouts and then you also have a dapolin and FDA approved acne treatment which can likewise help control the turnover of those sticky skin cells in the pore further preventing breakouts but none of these over-the-counter treatments address the hormonal component of acne so don some other treatments that are prescription only and I have a lot of videos on this channel about prescription treatments like spironolactone as well as the newer topical and High Androgen when Levy but if you have an underlying endocrinologic disease like PCOS or you have congenital adrenal hyperplasia they more specific interventions that will be needed for you and if you have a tumor in the ovary or the adrenal gland that pumping out androgens well that to need treatment and all the benzoyl peroxide in the world is not going to tackle the acne so long as you have something like that all right you guys that video all about adult acne acne in your 40s now in this video I mentioned a dappling an over-the-counter acne treatment but I get a lot of questions like hey to what extent is this helpful for improving the signs of skin aging now on the insulate I have a video that talks all about that so watch that one next but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe I bye [Music] thank you [Music]	Success
BREAKOUT ON THE FACE *NOT ACNE * ?? DERMATOLOGIST @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfTmc2mXggo	Dr Day	I not everything that looks like acne is acne and in this video we talking about a breakout on the face that is not acne and why now more than ever it about this condition but before we get into it give this video a thumbs up make sure you skincare content from a board-certified dermatologist and you have your bell notifications turned on that way YouTube is going to let you know as soon as my videos go live if you acne or rosacea totally separate conditions seeing a dermatologist there oral antibiotic whether that be doxycycline Minocycline there are a whole host of other similar antibiotics that we use to treat these conditions why well while they are antibiotics meaning they help kill off bacteria they also have anti-inflammatory properties and when used for a limited time they can help clear up these skin conditions so that other medications that take a little bit more time to start working can kick in however a problem that can arise especially if there are inconsistencies gaps in care is that you can end up whether you have acne or rosacea being on these antibiotics for a long time there are risks that can occur one such risk is something called a gram-negative folliculitis it basically something that looks like acne but is not acne and why does this happen it actually starts with bacteria in your nose what there are bacteria that live in your nose and they serve a function they help keep your body healthy it normal to have bacteria in your nose however when you prolonged period of time this can actually affect the populations of bacteria in your nose and skew things in a Direction that there are types of bacteria called gram-positive bacteria and there are types of bacteria called gram-negative bacteria when you are on antibiotics for a very long time one thing that can happen is that the populations of bacteria in your nose they get messed up and all of a sudden you have way more gram-negative bacteria in the nose than you should have usually gram-negative bacteria constitute roughly one percent of the bacteria in your nose but in people who have been on prolonged courses of antibiotics this can get messed up so that you have about four percent gram-negative bacteria colonizing your nose and that is too much now in the majority of cases the skewing of the bacteria in the nose on prolonged courses of antibiotics it doesn antibiotics are stopped the bacteria in the nose they population and everything will go back hunky-dory however in a subset of patients what can happen is that those gram-negative bacteria they start to take over and spill into the skin on the face and they can colonize the pre-existing acne lesions or the pre-existing rosacea lesions and you can get a breakout that kind of looks like acne but is not acne it infection and it skin infection it as like your acne that was there to begin with it your rosacea basically what has happened is these bacteria have taken over a bit and gotten into your pores it gram-negative folliculitis so how long is too long be on a course of oral antibiotics for say acne or rosacea truthfully there is no defined window of time there where you would begin to put yourself at risk for this seemingly rare complication gram-negative folliculitis but we generally aim to keep people on oral antibiotic courses for really no longer than three months for say acne and the goal is to be tapering and transitioning them over to other medications that can be used long term safely to control their skin condition for example in the case of acne you guys have seen a lot of my videos here about different topical retinoids for the treatment of acne tretinoin tazeratine altrino check those out by the way if you rosacea likewise there are other treatments but the goal is never to keep people on these oral antibiotics indefinitely because not only can they result in this rare complication called gram-negative folliculitis but can interfere with your gut microbiome and it also can be a situation where the bacteria in your body become resistant and that mentioned this complication gram-negative folliculitis it thought to be pretty rare roughly four percent of acne patients who are on prolonged courses of antibiotics are thought to develop this condition however it why truthfully a lot of clinicians simply don be a tricky condition to to either recognize as well as appropriately diagnosed suffice it to say it something that a lot of people may actually be missing now at the beginning of the video I pointed out why now more than ever it is important for people to be aware of this condition there is a boom uh what are referred to as direct to Consumer Telehealth platforms largely centered around acne and while these can be great they can be fantastic this is a situation where I do think patients consumers of these direct to Consumer Telehealth platforms may be more at risk for being on oral antibiotics long term and not having this complication recognized as readily because again it looks like acne and it takes in astute clinician to recognize it and to realize that that unfortunately the way most people are accessing Health Care these days it longer The Glory Days of Norman Rockwell paintings comment below and if you know what I Rockwell paintings were you know in an Ideal World any patient with really stubborn acne they would see a dermatologist and they would follow with that exact same dermatologist consistently so that treatments like oral antibiotics could be appropriately monitored tapered other treatments you know added so as to not put the patient at risk for this and as a dermatologist we have the training expertise to recognize this complication but what happening now I mean it for a while is that there are significant gaps in care and inconsistencies and people are going long periods of time without getting any health care and they these different Avenues online so it problem with continuity of care and when you have this issue it is a prime scenario for the development of this type of complication because like I said you know it be missed and you can easily be given a prescription option for an oral antibiotic to calm down the acne but in reality you could be at risk for developing this seemingly rare complication gram-negative folliculitis that looks like acne but is totally different gram negative folliculitis it can look an awful lot like acne to the untrained eye what exactly does it look like there are two different types of ways it can present as a facial breakout the most common type is little pustules and they the cheeks the chin maybe even around the nose and pustules are skin lesions common to acne and they appearing where your acne is so to the untrained eye and I might just think oh their acne is flaring and you can see here why somebody might even restart you on antibiotics not the right path so you they lacking is one of the key lesions of acne it basically a white head or a blackhead very different from a pustule a comidone is just a plugged up pore the stuff within the pore and acne it the protein of your skin it just makes a little plug there with gram-negative folliculitis there are no comedones it not a comidonal process it infection within the pore so it totally different the other type of presentation of gram-negative folliculitis it happens in about 20 percent of cases it nodules instead much deeper and painful another key finding with gram-negative folliculitis is that it often has skin lesions under the nose because again this arises from the bacteria being messed up in your nose so you can have some pus bumps under the nose and then extending to the cheeks the chin area so not only can it look like acne it also can look like rosacea because rosacea has these pus bombs and many patients who have Rose Asia they get stuck on prolonged courses of oral antibiotics another skin condition that might be misdiagnosed in this situation is perioral dermatitis I this but it to rosacea where you get these little bumps around the mouth around the nose so that condition that may be misdiagnosed in the setting of gram-negative folliculitis when it comes to diagnosing gram-negative folliculitis for the clinician the history the patient history and their physical exam findings are key if you have a patient who has a history of being on antibiotics for a prolonged period of time and they what looks like acne but it getting better in fact any patient with acne in their late teens or adults who has really stubborn acne and has been on prolonged courses of oral antibiotics it is definitely prudent to consider gram-negative folliculitis and to do the appropriate tests for it once the diagnosis of gram-negative folliculitis is suspected from a patient and physical exam the doctor needs to take a culture of the pus bomb and here is pretty tricky because those little bacteria that are infecting your pore the gram-negative bacteria they as easy to culture they sensitive to being dried out they love being in a wet environment and that is why they love the oily pore they love that moist environment and so if you take a swab of the pus bomb and you let that swab sit around for too long but before it makes it to the laboratory well you may miss it the bacteria may just dry out and not be something that can be cultured on a plate for the lab to say yes this is gram-negative bacteria that we not be able to grow it out from the swab because the swab is sat out too long and things have dried out the treatment for this condition is actually isotretinoin otherwise known as Accutane commonly here so how the heck is isotretinoin a retinoid going to work to treat a bacterial skin infection it works because the bacteria that cause this infection like I said they susceptible to you being dried out and they love moist environments that they live in your nose where it the mucous membranes and that lit like to take over in those oily surfaces of the pores and the way isotret no one goes to work is it actually suppresses oil production it sibo suppressive so by reducing oiliness in the pore it effectively dries you up and the bacteria can no longer survive in the pore likewise it dries out the mucous membranes in your nose that if you your nose gets really dry well that going to work in your favor in the setting of gram-negative folliculitis where you bacteria in the nose and it your pores basically just works by drying you out not only does it get rid of the facial breakout the facial infection but it also gets rid of nasal Carriage of those gram-negative bacteria that are causative so it puts everything back on track and gets rid of them infection it does take some time but it three months what about for people who can contraindicated for you well there are some other antibiotics that could be tried and I know that sounds counterintuitive why would you treat a skin infection that was caused by antibiotics with more antibiotics it very tricky because you have to give the patient antibiotics that are specific for those gram-negative bacteria that are causing the problem so it ideal path but that is another option to treat the to prescribe a new antibiotic that bacteria for people who can isotreino but to be clear isotreinoin it we is a very effective treatment for acne it rosacea in some cases and in the case of gram-negative folliculitis isotradinoin Works quite well for that as well my goal with this video is not to alarm you and please whatever you do do not self-diagnose yourself with this and even if you could self-diagnose yourself with that importantly you can self-treat it there no cream there detox protocol trust me I somebody out there will try and sell you one but there of this the treatment is Accutane isotretinoin so you have to see a dermatologist and it a lot of times patients who have been dealing with this they have broken trust with the medical system and the idea that you have to see a dermatologist to make the diagnosis of this and to get the right treatment it something that is really not going to sit well with people who are coping with something like this but I want to bring it to your attention because I think it more of in the upcoming years I encourage everybody who has any kind of skin problem to see a board-certified dermatologist I know it people want to hear I know it can be very difficult to find one to get in to see to see one but seeking out alternative Paths of treatment online it can get you into a whole mess of trouble and so that is my recommendation if you are struggling with any kind of persistent facial eruption breakout don self-treat it can lead you down a path that is very problematic and can leave you scarred all right you guys I hope this video was informative comment below and if you things that are not acne but look like it because there are a couple others out there for sure but if you enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe talk

WINLEVI HORMONAL ACNE TREATMENT ?? DERMATOLOGIST @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh8WHK9JrDc	Dr Day	boy guys get excited because in this video we are going to be doing a deep dive look at the new acne treatment when levy is it worth it how does it compare to tretinoin and what are the side effects i that in this video but before we dive into the topic if you like skin care content from a board-certified dermatologist then hit the subscribe button also hit that little bell because that little bell is going to notify you as soon as my videos go live and definitely give me a follow over on tik-tok and instagram i consistent posting on those platforms as well acne is the eighth most prevalent disease worldwide and it affects over 640 million people globally while many people view it as a cosmetic issue it has profound impacts on one psychological and emotional health and it can lead to scarring the root causes of acne are threefold first is keratinocyte hyperproliferation that is a lot of medical jargon to basically say that the skin cells they confused and they that pores the second factor is androgen hormones these hormones testosterone and dihydrotestosterone they bind to receptors in the oil gland in your skin and they cause the oil gland to first make more oil and also to make a lot of inflammatory mediators so they inflammation the third factor is a little bacteria called cutie bacterium acnes that lives in the pore breaks down all this oil and causes a lot of ruckus and inflammation further driving breakouts we have a landscape of treatments available to us that address one or more of these different components retinoids tretinoin adaptolene zeratine and the oral retinoid isotretinoin address the skin stickiness issue and they address the inflammatory issue we have medications that target the hormonal issue oral contraceptive pills spironolactone there are oral and topical antibiotics that address cutie bacterium acnes and the inflammation in the skin but medications they are not always 100 perfect and of course they come with side effects not every medication is going to be right for every patient so it is imperative that we coming out with new therapeutics to address diseases especially one that is so common so here we have a new drug classic terror on one percent cream otherwise known as wind leaves this is a novel treatment and that is something that you apply to the skin that addresses that hormonal component the only other medications that we have that really target that are oral pills namely oral contraceptive pills otherwise known as birth control pills and the medication spironolactone both of these can be incredibly effective for addressing the hormonal component in women can men and some women don oral contraceptive pills they do have side effects and the medication spironolactone while very safe and low risk of side effects and some people it just may not be a good option so we need more treatments to reach a broader array of patients and to limit side effects so how does this new medication when levy work well we don in which it works but it is a topical anti-androgen throughout your skin you have androgen receptors the androgens specifically dihydrotestosterone bind to receptors on the cells that make up the oil gland and lead to more oil production and more inflammatory mediators the way this new drug is thought to work is that it competes with the potent androgen dihydrotestosterone for the androgen receptor and in doing so it inhibits the downstream consequences of dihydrotestosterone binding to that androgen receptor which is going to be an increase in oiliness and an increase in inflammation because it is rapidly metabolized in the skin the systemic effects meaning to your total body are significantly significantly diminished in comparison to taking an oral pill like spironolactone or an oral contraceptive pill to be clear those medications are perfectly safe but they do have side effects and as a reminder those treatments are not suitable for males this newer topical treatment addresses the hormonal component but is suitable for male patients and the side effect profile is much safer from a total body perspective in comparison to an oral contraceptive pill or spironolactone the other clear advantage of topical class keteron otherwise known as wind levy is that it has a very quick onset of action you have heard throughout the years on my channel about being very patient with acne treatments they take a while to start working this newer treatment is actually pretty quick and it the lesions of acne you can start to see improvement with this new treatment in as little as two weeks and the skin continues to improve outwards to eight weeks with ongoing use how effective is it clinical experience as well as clinical trials point to the efficacy of topical class keteron for reducing the number of inflammatory acne lesions when we from 44.8 percent to 46.9 percent improvement in the number of inflammatory acne lesions at 12 weeks this is in comparison to the vehicle alone and if you mean by vehicle alone well you have wind levy cream right it got classic taron in it for this trial they the the cream without the classical terrain that control because just the cream alone without the actual drug in it you still get some benefits anywhere from a 29.6 percent to 36.5 percent decrease in inflammatory acne lesions at 12 weeks i out because a it to have in trials and b it points to the fact that using a cream a moisturizer can benefit acne okay so always keep that in mind the control group did see benefit just using a moisturizing cream but it these studies that having the active that having the actual drug in there further improved their acne so it doing something beyond just the benefit of using a moisturizer at 12 weeks and we see that clinically as well in patients using this cream how does it compare to retinoid it actually is a little bit better at eight weeks in comparison to tretinoin when and when research investigators in these trials actually evaluated the patients of course they were blinded they didn know if they were getting tretinoin or when levy but overall their global assessment was slightly better for the win levy group in comparison to tretinoin but that was not statistically significant i will point out however these studies comparing tretinoin to when levy they only looked out to eight weeks tretinoin can take some time to really start yielding maximal improvement so that is something to keep in mind now speaking of tretinoin a lot of you guys know that tretinoin has many other skin benefits besides addressing acne now classical terrain is not going is not likely to have those benefits and by benefits i collagen production smoothing out wrinkles and fine lines removing sun damage and helping to treat and prevent hyperpigmentation classical terrorine it receptor inhibitor so it things so don to tretinoin globally we at eight weeks it was slightly better than tretinoin but again we look at a broader timeline and knowing that tretinoin has multiple other benefits behind it and a lot more data behind it as well the appeal of this creams presumably is going to have fewer risks fewer side effects classical terrorism is metabolized to something called cortex alone and in theory that cortex alone could suppress something called the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal access basically the communication points and hormone signaling between the brain and your adrenal glands in theory it could affect that and that downstream may lead to problems with things like blood pressure is that a reality in the clinical trials at the indicated dosage it does not appear to be a reality when it comes to toxicity and adverse side effects you heard me say over and over again it not the poison it and that amounts probably more likely to lead to adverse effects obviously but the other thing to bear in mind is the body surface area that it applied to shouldn your whole back in theory you may be getting too much in those areas actually recommended that you only apply about one gram of the drug twice a day to the affected area sparing around the eyes the mouth the mucous membranes and so using a small amount to the face is very unlikely to result in hpa axis suppression the other factor that can influence risk for hpa axis suppression is if you apply it under occlusion so if you you don applying your pimple patch over it you guys know i patches to help cut down on the risk of picking but in the case of this drug that could increase the risk of hp hpa axis suppression so that would not necessarily be a good idea the other thing is your age and very young children it would be a greater risk their skin you know absorbs to a greater extent when levy is fda approved for ages 12 years and older in theory the metabolite of this drug could lead to high levels of potassium uh there were some people whose potassium increased and that was five percent of people actually getting the drug as opposed to four percent of people getting just the cream so it doesn we don pregnancy we don it you know could lead to birth defects or anything like that so we don so to be clear when we risks to total body health very very very safe overall the things i pointing out here are incredibly rare events overall the incidence of adverse effects with topical classical terrain when levy is actually lower than with tretinoin 0.05 percent cream if you ever used tretinoin which many of you have on this channel you know it drying it cause a lot of peeling flaking people like to refer to it as the retinoid uglies that doesn occur with this drug but what does can happen in terms of effects to the skin that are negative it can be drying and it can cause some itch you can have some itch as a result and also some redness may happen but nothing that really seems to get in the way of complying with using it quite to the extent as the retinoid uglies can you apply a one gram which is a very small pea-sized amount to the affected areas on the face twice a day so in the morning and in the evening and you want to avoid getting it around the eyes because again absorption is going to be much greater there you don your mouth in your nose it approved for people 12 years of age and older but both men and women can use it and so the advantage here is that we have a new drug that addresses the hormonal component unlike prior drugs that address the hormonal component this one can be used in both men and women so this is an exciting new development in the treatment of acne in women who deal with a lot of hormonal acne and it also an exciting development for young males because they often have pretty severe acne with a major hormonal component that up into the development of this drug we had nothing to offer them that would tackle that young males tend to respond quite well to isotretinoin systemic medication by mouth that addresses the sticky skin cell thing and oiliness young males adolescent males tend to respond quite well to that but there that specifically addresses the androgen signaling part of things so having this new medication you know it really opens up some additional doors for them in terms of optimizing treatment i don as being a stand-alone acne treatment however because it doesn address all components of acne and i think it to be an add-on to our acne treatment for the most part for most patients so say for example you are on you something that can be used alongside accutane and or post accutane to control the hormonal component which accutane doesn around for very long so only time will tell i don replacement for topical retinoids limitations that i see with this drug are the fact that patients have to apply it twice a day twice a day application compliance tends to plummet i don to what extent it effective applied once a day and i would have concerns with long-term uninterrupted use of this especially to widespread areas uh in terms of hpa axis suppression given that you know that is something that has come up so just something that we need you know more information on to tease out how long you could safely use this and lastly the other limitation with this drug is that it is significantly more expensive than tretinoin now the cost is going to vary depending on your location pharmacies insurance coverage it for a tube of it so that is not inexpensive and insurance companies oftentimes are not so quick to approve it so your doctor may have to write a letter and even that doesn insurance company will cover it they often will want you to use other things first and prove that those fail so that is that is actually a big stumbling block when it comes to actually executing this as a treatment in your acne treatment plan a major benefit of this is that the onset is pretty quick two weeks uh nowadays delayed gratification is a thing of the past people want more instant results so two weeks is is a lot better than you know six weeks eight weeks uh that most acne treatments take to start working um and so you know that regard a lot of you guys have shared with me that you have been prescribed this so let us know in the comments only if you feel comfortable of course uh what your experience with that has been positive negative uh you know somewhere in between i hope this video was informative to you all um on the end slate i my video on uh building an oily skincare routine so if you skin definitely check that one out but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe i bye [Music] you	Success
ACNE SAFE SKINCARE PRODUCTS THAT WON'T CAUSE BREAKOUTS? ??DERMATOLOGIST @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaNiZxW1aKE	Dr Day	well hey guys in this video we to be talking all about the ever so burdensome task of finding skin care products that will not break you out i know a lot of you all deal with this we look for what to avoid and i be breaking down what the heck it means for a product to be non-comedogenic if you are new here welcome my name is andrea i dermatologist i post skin care content here on youtube pretty regularly if that is of interest to you definitely subscribe probably one of the most frequent concerns i hear is how do i find products that won the condition many people i assume are referring to is one that was described back in 1972 it it acne in that it tends to resolve a lot more quickly it doesn tends to affect women more so than men it kind of has this patchy distribution often on the cheeks the chin when acne cosmetica was first described back in the 70s the women in the report a lot of them had very large pores at baseline with acne cosmetica you these little closed white heads closed coming down but in contrast to full-blown acne they are a lot smaller and the attached oil gland tends to be less involved it condition in comparison to full-blown acne and it may or may not be influenced by hormones whereas full-blown acne definitely is influenced by your hormones so when you skin care products and you choose a product you to come across something called a non-comedogenic product what the heck does that even mean truth be told the terminology non-comedogenic honestly it doesn and it is a bit of a nebulous term non-comedogenic implies that the final product will not clog pores and lead to an acne-like eruption otherwise known as acne cosmetica but here truth there is no standardized or validated way to determine if a product is or is not comedogenic it is largely a marketing claim put forth by cosmetic brands that put effort into substantiating that claim the methods that are used to determine if a product or ingredient is in fact comedogenic definitely have a lot of limitations that make it so that we can information there misunderstanding that there list out there that actually will predict if an ingredient will clog your pores but the fda has no such approved list of comedogenic ingredients the fda does not have any definitions in place of comedogenic ingredients or what constitutes a comedogenic formulation brands can actually make that claim there are required to prove to substantiate it so it say that they don testing but the testing methods that they necessarily been validated for demonstrating comedogenicity nor are they considered the standard of care for determining if something is appropriate or not for someone with acne online you will come across lists of ingredients that are rated in terms of their comedogenicity and there are a lot of problems with the source of that data which i will get into later when we talk about how comedogenicity may be determined a given ingredient in terms of what has nothing to do with just the ingredient it boils down to the formulation of the product overall you have to take into account the amount of the ingredient is it a hundred percent strength concentration or is it diluted to less than one percent what is the consistency of the product overall is it very occlusive or is it something that more lightweight and evaporative these things really matter so just looking at a list of ingredients that have been rated in terms of their comedogenicity it doesn anything and if you take anything away from this video it ingredients to try and determine if they will or will not clog your pores there is no such ingredient list and doing this is a complete and utter waste of your time the fact that there is a lack of a standardized test out there to determine comedogenicity basically means that the label non-comedogenic is not a guarantee that the product will not cause an acne like eruption or acne cosmetica non-comedogenic implies that there will not be any visible or microscopic clogging of the pores the problem with just looking visually at the skin to determine if something is or is not poor clogging is that it doesn allow the observer to determine anything below the surface of the skin it really only is showing you the opening of the pore the pore extends down into the deeper layers of the skin and you able to visualize that it just relies on dilation of the pore not on the entire structure of the pore so you could be missing out on detecting poor clogging ingredients just by visually analyzing something the other problem is that visual dilation of the pore does not necessarily mean that a product is poor clogging it could actually represent an irritant reaction and subsequent extrusion of existing clogged pores such as what happens when you use a keratolytic ingredient a lot of people commonly refer to this as purging you guys if you purging what it is and what it isn check that out but a lot of times when you use an ingredient that increases the rate of skin cell turnover any micro comedones otherwise known as clogging of the pores deep down under the skin that you have at baseline that you may not be aware of well they the surface and in the beginning if you are experiencing that you might misconstrue that as the product or formula or ingredient is poor clogging but really the pore was clogged to begin with and its contents are just coming to the surface all at once and that is often presenting as a little white pus bump or a pustule or sometimes a closed comedone otherwise known as a white head so when we try and get more technical and go deep down inside we have two methods to determine poor clogging of an ingredient and that first one is an old antiquated model that dates back to the 50s and that is the rabbit ear model where they would use rabbit ears to test out if an ingredient was going to clog pores and then they would look under the microscope to see if there were clogged pores so it just at the surface level it but this test method is only relevant and useful if you are a rabbit who is really into an elaborate skin care routine on your ears otherwise it reliable for human use because the skin of a rabbit than the skin of humans so pores they like a tube it that a human pore will have one oil gland dumping into it whereas a rabbit pour actually has a few entry points for different oil glands they have multiple oil glands dumping into one pore that a huge difference rabbit skin will form comedones otherwise known as whiteheads or poor clogging much faster than human skin and the sebaceous oil gland which pumps oil into our pore and can play a role in poor clogging factors that govern oil production differ between us so unless you doing elaborate skincare on your ears this method just doesn doesn was just like a rabbit not a reliable way to look at things because it really only tells you about that ingredient in isolation at a certain concentration it doesn tell you about how the ingredient might behave in your product that you are using or considering purchasing fast forward to 1982 and herein we have a human skin test for poor clogging or comedogenicity what it entails is putting the ingredient on the back skin and covering it up that occlusion leaving it there for a month and then taking a cyano acrylic glue which is basically crazy glue or super glue and using the super glue to basically pull out the top part of the skin barrier the stratum corneum as well as the contents of the pore think of it kind of like those pore strips that are popular kind of the same principle and then they flip it over and they examine what is on that and they basically come up with a ratio to say is this a poor clogging ingredient or not but there are problems here and how this test is take is is carried out first of all it different from facial skin the skin on the back the the deeper layers much thicker the other issue is the length of time that the stuff is left on the skin a month who is putting on a moisturizer and not doing some kind of bathing in between the other issue is that it under occlusion meaning like under a bandage or something that does not represent real world use and definitely impacts the outcome because if you put an ingredient under occlusion it drives that ingredient into the skin making it more potent increasing the irritancy and making it much more likely that it opposed to putting products on facial skin where you method doesn level or the percentage of an ingredient in a product you could take an ingredient at a hundred percent and find that it is poor clogging but if you dilute it down to you know less than a percent or whatever fractions of that it be less problematic than in this very forced testing situation and again you don ingredients or the formula overall to factor in in this test either is it a alcohol-based gel vehicle that to evaporate very quickly or is it a more occlusive ointment that trap the ingredient closer to the skin the other thing that can influence comedogenicity that is not going to be captured in this test is the grade or purity of the ingredient now of course in cosmetics in skincare products you using cosmetic grade ingredients but when it comes to certain ingredients like plant derived oils there is going to be batch to batch variability in terms of the overall composition of the of the oil for example depending on where it is sourced from the distributor there can be a there can be batch to batch variation it though jojoba seed oil is necessarily a hundred percent reproducible from brand to brand and there differences it ingredient that just makes sense you not going to get identical batches of jojoba seed oil so any potential impurities in one batch as opposed to another could in theory influence the overall comedogenicity of a given product and that captured in these tests but overall this test has very low external validity it doesn terms of formula vehicle purity ingredient percentage formulation overall these are all things that play a role in how a given product is going to perform on skin so all that to say i have a very unsatisfactory answer for you all in terms of how to choose products that will not break you out it an ingredient or ingredient list that going to predict that people ask me all the time can you recommend a sunscreen that won recommend a moisturizer that won me out can you recommend an oil cleanser that won nothing objective about the ingredient lists of products or formulations it going to tell me that this product is going to not cause an acne and acne cosmetic for somebody there ingredients are a very high refinement and purity including petrolatum i a whole video talking about the myth behind mineral oil and i another video on the myth behind petrol autumn being poor clogging neither of which are the case and again it boils down to the formula overall so if you have acne prone skin or if you products that will not break you out here are some tips and some things to keep in mind as far as choosing your skin care and building your skincare routine and the first is irritation if a product is irritating to the skin it will be more likely to aggravate underlying acne and the reason is that acne is an inflammatory skin condition irritation brings about more inflammation in the skin that ultimately can lead to more flares of the acne when i do my skin care product reviews i often point out ingredients that can be irritating for some people so listen out for those ingredients so anything that causes irritation it doesn ingredient it can be a type of product like vitamin c serums they tend to be you know the ascorbic acid serums an acidic ph can be irritating to the skin a lot of people experience experience flares of acne or acne acne cosmetic with vitamin c serums probably has nothing to do with vitamin c or ascorbic acid it they irritating to some people the second is to avoid drying out your skin a lot of people especially those with oily acne prone skin they often gravitate towards trying to dry out the skin or say oh i moisturizers because those are going to break me out and clog my pores and it actually the opposite for people who have acne prone skin you can the skin barrier by abandoning moisturizers and attempting to dry out your skin if you have an impaired skin barrier you start losing more water out of the skin the skin becomes hyper irritable that irritation can drive more inflammation in the skin i explaining how low molecular weight alcohol in a product is not the devil it you who find it drying that little bit of extra drying effect maybe it to aggravate your skin the other thing is contact time i mean just look at the just look at the human assay the human test they many cases for a month uh i know you guys are not going about your day-to-day without washing your face at the end of the day or bathing to some extent but this is one of the reasons why we remind everyone to make sure to take off their makeup at the end of the day now with the boom of skin care in the internet you know we you need to take your makeup off at the end of the day but there were cases especially back in the 70s of these of women who would never take their makeup off they would just keep putting on pancake foundation going to bed like that and you know they might go to bed with a face of cold cream and kind of wipe it off and cold cream as a side note is a great first step in a double cleanse but they wouldn face and yeah i mean it didn cosmetica by not washing off so contact time duration of contact definitely plays a role a lot of times you people say something like you need to let your skin breathe i mean your skin does not exchange gases like your lungs do it doesn really underlies the fact that prolonged contact time with an ingredient increases its irritancy and likelihood of causing things like acne cosmetica then what about the other products that you one of these nine step skin care routines that kim kardashian is trying to sell you the more products that you have into your routine the greater the potential for irritancy especially nowadays the trend is to put niacinamide in everything and a lot of people at baseline find that niacinamide is irritating they discover that and it everything certain medications can make your skin a lot more sensitive and prone to irritation with products certain antibiotics for example so don always assume that everything is specific to the products that you are using in terms of your skin health it so much more than that and if you taking a medication that makes your skin a little more sensitive that definitely can feed into hyper irritability one thing that was clear back in the 70s and still holds true in terms of acne cosmetica is the role of friction to the skin and aggravating this one thing that they were trying to tease out in these early papers describing this condition is to what extent it was necessarily the products or really the people the women because that was primarily who were in these case reports touching their face they the people who describe this they observe that a lot of women will constantly be touching their chin covering up their face with their hands putting their hand like like this and they they postulated that it was that constant touching that further aggravated the acne cosmetica try and be mindful of these behaviors but also don exfoliate buff away this problem it not going to help and definitely the excess friction on the skin can aggravate any type of acne including acne cosmetica what about sunscreens that is one product type that so many people you know report that they have breakouts worsening of acne with and a lot of people actually just bail on sunscreen which i do not advocate for obviously i mean my whole tagline is sunscreen and subscribe sunscreen is so important for your skin if you acne it helping to minimize post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation as well as worsening of the acne because the uv rays from the sun they drive inflammation in the skin i mean you numerous times but to cut to the chase what is it about sunscreen that makes some people more likely to break out i honestly don something as simple as switching from mineral to chemical sunscreen i mean for some people it might but there per se that is generalizable at least to the population as a whole there nothing comedogenic about zinc about titanium dioxide about any of the chemical filters in sunscreen there really isn may be running into issues at least when it comes to sunscreen is that especially those that are water resistant perhaps it the day and they are getting some film formation prolonged duration of contact that subsequently is driving acne cosmetica that is a paper that does show less irritancy in removing water resistant sunscreen with an oil cleanser so i am a big advocate of the double cleanse i think it allows helps you more efficiently remove sunscreen in total so that could be one thing the other thing that i have started to wonder about and i don but i many sunscreens include different antioxidants and that already mentioned earlier in the video how a lot of people experience breakouts with vitamin c serums and i thought that ph of the vitamin c serums can be irritating but many sunscreens also are formulated with vitamin c or derivatives of vitamin c and or other antioxidants that i likewise question could be contributory to the irritation likewise a lot of sunscreens have hyaluronic acid which is a great ingredient there proof that it is poor clogging or causes problems but some people have just observed that when they use products with hyaluronic acid it does in fact aggravate their acne there is some logic there hyaluronic acid can enhance penetration of other things so perhaps it just makes things more irritating and if it sunscreen then that could make the sunscreen ingredients more irritating to your skin and drive acne cosmetica all right you guys i really wish there was like a clear-cut package that i could give you of products cleanser moisturizer sunscreen you know serum whatever it is you a tight little package that i could just hand you and say this won you out anyone who is telling you that is bs there family of sunscreens that are acne safe there are no family of sunscreens that are acne unsafe it very much is an individualized outcome as well as a product formulation specific outcome so i hope this video was helpful to you i know probably a little bit of a letdown if you were hoping for that package set don bio to send you to but if you guys like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen and subscribe i to you guys tomorrow bye [Music]

BEST ACNE SKIN CARE PRODUCTS OF 2021 @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHx-4Lgwbjc	Dr Day	well hey guys get excited in this video i acne skincare products from 2021. all right first of all i want to call your attention to these hydrocolloid patches from hero cosmetics now hydrocolloid patches otherwise known as pimple patches do they really do anything do they really get rid of a pimple yes and no if you have a pimple that has a little pustule i mean a little collection of white puffs some people call it a white hat although technically it whitehead a whitehead is a closed comido anyways if you using a hydrocolloid patch such as this can help extrude the inflammatory contents from within the pore helping to facilitate healing and recovery these are also a really good thing to use if you are prone to picking at your acne and they can help reduce frictional forces on the acne but they a cure for acne or anything like that they just you know they have a role in acne skin care they are helpful now many of these patches i years some of them are good others just do not stay on the skin or it whoa you got something stuck on your face the reason i call your attention to these ones from hero cosmetics is these are the best in my opinion not only do they stay on the skin really well they on at night before you go to bed take it off the following morning or you can wear it throughout the day i think they a lot of zoom calls you haven breakout that you camouflage or just try to not pick throughout the day these stay on really well they stay on well throughout working out i have tried them running on the treadmill running outside getting really really sweaty and they stay on really well whereas other products similar to this i of the years to kind of roll up and whatnot so yeah highly recommend these if you have a lot of acne breakouts especially if you are prone to picking okay one thing that i think is helpful for people who have acne especially if your skin is very oily is to use a clay mask clays can help absorb some excess sebum ako oil from the surface of the skin and from within the pore not only reducing shine but just kind of helping degrease the skin and reducing breakouts one of my favorite acne clay masks is from cetaphil it recommended it in many many videos but this year i tried out the isn real mugwort clay mask now it has artemisia in it which is mugwort that is a botanic extract that is anti-inflammatory and it may be helpful for healing and recovery but as far as the clays it got kaolin bentonite elite and canadian colloidal clay i don canadian colloidal clay to say how it differs from any of these other clays but i you know i would suspect that it is you know perhaps smaller allowing for better penetration into the pore to wick up excess oil from you know kind of the top part of the pore that though on my part uh it also has oak kernel extract willow bark extract these are anti-inflammatory ingredients and moisturizing it has beta glucan a humectant really enjoy this you can do this as tolerated daily you put it on the skin or you can just put it to the areas that are most prone to being shiny and oily like the t-zone leave it on for 10 to 15 minutes and then rinse it off so this one is definitely worth mentioning this year because clay masks you know they can be they can be helpful for people who have oily skin so it does a good job degreasing the skin without drying you out which is key some some of the clay masks they can just be too drying some of them have a bunch of irritating scented ingredients that you know end up possibly worsening your acne so you kind of have to be careful but that one i think was good in my opinion all right cerave came out with some new acne products this year and definitely one to not skip is their uh salicylic acid levon gel the cerave acne control gel it has two percent salicylic acid in it and it also has uh alpha hydroxy acid it and lactic acid the alpha hydroxy acids can help dissolve the glue between sticky skin cells helping to kind of exfoliate gently and then the salicylic acid also does that but it has a greater affinity for sort of the oily surfaces getting into the pore and doing that to help control breakouts and reduce kind of oiliness help improve the appearance of pores now a product like this can be drying of course it has ceramides which are helpful for the skin barrier reducing dryness and irritation i think this is a standout one if you somebody who finds that your acne does well with levon salicylic acid products definitely check this one out you going to hear a theme here of salicylic acid because this year there were a lot of good new salicylic acid formulations um it all you know a lot of people find irritating but honestly it is a good ingredient for not only redness and hyperpigmentation that can you know be left behind from healing acne but it good ingredient for perhaps reducing oiliness so i think it you know this formula overall it fragrance of course serbia you know did a good job with this of course all right so i i alluded to the fact that you know acne it does heal with post acne marks but for the longest time the skin care industry was just ignoring the post acne marks people especially people who have skin of color surveys show that they are often more bothered and more concerned about the post acne marks understandably a lot of times when they come to dermatology you know they worried about their active breakouts they want to talk more about i don want to have a po you know often referred to as a scar but really what they inflammatory hyperpigmentation basically a dark mark left behind and a lot of people also heal with redness uh you know is bothersome and those post acne marks they can be quite stubborn so i seeing a trend that i like in acne skin care products where they you know the acne treatment ingredients with other ingredients that can help address some of these post acne mark issues so cetaphil came out with i love this this is their gentle clear mattifying acne moisturizer this product is amazing it so it for dry sensitive acne prone skin if you have oily acne prone skin this will work as well it has 0.5 salicylic acid so that is much lower but can still be helpful for just kind of reducing um stickiness between the skin cells salicylic acid is also anti-inflammatory and it can help you know in reducing hyperpigmentation in addition to that though this has kojic acid and licorice root both of those ingredients are helpful for hyperpigmentation so if you have a deeper skin tone i would seriously suggest considering this if you acne because as a moisturizer because it can help keep the skin hydrated which is important in acne you don dry out the skin it acid which is anti-inflammatory and can impart some ongoing acne control throughout the day and dissolve the glue between those sticky skin cells and then it has ingredients that will help you know reduce the chances of hyperpigmentation so definitely consider this it is and it moisturizing it it too which is a polyhydroxy acid that kind of not only is anti-inflammatory but very very gently exfoliates as well this is a type of moisturizer that when used consistently is going to help even out skin texture and improve kind of skin tone through the anti-inflammatory effects of the salicylic acid the kojic acid and the licorice root also good for redness as well all right i get questions all the time please recommend acne care products that can be used in pregnancy and so this year i did a video specifically on that topic so if you are pregnant or contemplating pregnancy and you have acne or concerned about acne check that video out i below in the description box but from that video you this product from vichy it is their normaderm sos acne rescue spot corrector this is a sulfur treatment sulfur is anti-inflammatory it can help impart some acne control this can be used either as a spot treatment or to a more widespread area it is creamy it is kind of a creamy paste this can be used as a spot treatment or it can be used to a more widespread area for acne control the sulfur again it anti-inflammatory but in addition to the sulfur this also has resorcinol and glycolic acid both of those ingredients are going to help the sulfur get into the skin better the glycolic acid is going to help start dissolving the glue between sticky skin cells well i having a hard time getting that out and allow for smoother skin texture and kind of reducing the chances that the pores will become clogged it helpful for redness and can help reduce some oiliness so i really like this as a spot treatment for acne and pregnancy i mean you don consider using this especially if you have very sensitive skin you find you struggle with other acne spot treatments like salicylic acid or um or benzoyl peroxide then you might want to consider this the sulfur is anti-inflammatory some people you know they may have a little bit of an overlap between acne and rosacea they still actually get comedones and pimples but they also have sensitivity redness flushing and pustules this product i think you might consider all right speaking of benzoyl peroxide one of my favorite acne fighting ingredients it targets the bacteria that contribute to acne acute bacterium acnes it anti-inflammatory so it can help treat active breakouts and prevent breakouts in the future unfortunately benzoyl peroxide is super super drying now neutrogena came out with their their stubborn acne line this year i had a lot of great products in that line the textured skin cleanser i mentioned in my video on cleansers for oily skin so if you missed that make sure you check it out because a lot of you guys with acne also have oily skin anyways so there stubborn acne am treatment it is a benzoyl peroxide levon product 2.5 micronized benzoyl peroxide so this micronized benzoyl peroxide is less irritating smaller than you know non-micronized so less irritating and the 2.5 strength is an effective dose but less irritating than like 5 or 10 so if you percent levon levon benzoyl peroxide super drying maybe consider 2.5 still effective less irritating and i like this formulation it pretty moisturizing it comfortable to wear to a widespread area than other benzoyl peroxide levon products that i less drying like for example i love zaps it as a levon benzoyl peroxide it it can be super drying now a word of caught a cautionary word about any benzoyl peroxide levon product is that this will bleach fabrics and your hair it won bleach fabrics and hair so don know let it touch the hair and if you put it on let it dry fully and then when you go to bed at night if you use it at nighttime put like a old towel down on your pillow so that you don pillowcase or what have you so that is one you know kind of a nuisance thing about benzoyl peroxide in the case of active acne using a levon product as a spot treatment i would say benzoyl peroxide in my opinion is one of the most is the most effective acne spot treatment for getting clearance of an of a pimple fast nothing would say benzoyl peroxide is one of the fastest acne spot treatments some people find that salicylic acid works really well for them and that they can tolerate benzoyl peroxide it drying and irritating but for those who do try benzoyl peroxide and tolerate it well i think they find that it works faster so try this one out if you were a fan of benzoyl peroxide i think they did you know a good job with it very few ingredients no fragrance all right peach slices i tried out all their acne skincare this year loved every single product the cleanser the moisturizer and this exfoliating toner which bears mentioned in this video as a standout because in my opinion this is a great um dupe if you will for the polish choice bha liquid exfoliant like the polish choice product it is a liquid salicylic acid levon product it also has alpha hydroxy acids it and lactic so that exfoliate as well it which is anti-inflammatory very short ingredient list otherwise this brand is cruelty free and this product is vegan cvs um i feel like you can get at walmart you can get it at ulta as well peach slices so i mentioned a lot of levon salicylic acid products in this video i would say that it of personal preference this one from cerave with a two percent salicylic acid is a lot more moisturizing and you know you could use it to a widespread area of acne as like an acne levon treatment with moisturizer in it now this one is a lot more lightweight it is a liquid less moisturizing it have an easier time applying this it more of a matter of personal preference i would say though as far as the type of vehicle that you like and then the cetaphil is a lower percentage of salicylic acid this is a definitely a moisturizer you know this is a moisturizer you can use for daily use on the face all right you guys now you probably if you you acne video and not mentioning any form of topical vitamin a no retinol because honestly the best over-the-counter form of topical vitamin a for acne is going to be adapoline and that is not new this year but i want to mention it uh you know different gel has been out on the market over the counter for a while now and uh la roche posay has an adapalene many other brands do you can get the cvs generic version as well so if you have acne and you retinol retinoid adaptiline it approved for the treatment of acne and you can buy it over the counter and unlike tretinoin another fda approved treatment for acne by prescription only adaptiline which you can buy over the counter is a lot less irritating a lot less drying and it can be used with benzoyl peroxide so all right you guys so those are the standout acne skin care products from 2021 if you guys are dealing with breakouts i know it really frustrating i do encourage you to see a board certified dermatologist if you especially been struggling for a while because we do have a lot of newer treatments out than we before for acne so it revisiting i always think it is in your best interest if you have acne to see a board-certified dermatologist because acne can go on to scar if left untreated and you don if you have you know a deeper skin tone you acne dark marks they last for a really really long time so the you know the sooner the better that you can get effective treatment and oftentimes that you know requires seeing a board-certified dermatologist these things sold over the counter they are effective acne treatments but they not going to be enough or effective for all types of acne some people just have very inflammatory acne that to respond to over the counter topicals alone and many people especially adults have more of a hormonal component going on all acne is technically hormonal but in adulthood the hormonal component often is more of a driving factor the hormones signal to the oil gland to make more oil and in that case you know there are prescriptions that help really address that everything that you can buy over the counter it doesn that hormonal component at all not to say that these won beneficial for hormonal acne but they hormonal component so want to set your expectations that yes in many cases over-the-counter treatments over-the-counter acne products they actually can treat the acne and get it under decent control depending on the severity but in other cases prescription medications are needed so i do suggest if you are dealing with acne seeing a board certified dermatologist to make sure you are on the right path to reduce the risk of scarring and post acne marks anyways guys i hope this video was helpful to you all and that you having a great december if you liked it give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don sunscreen and subscribe i guys tomorrow bye [Music] you	Success
SKIN CARE ROUTINE for fading POST ACNE MARKS| Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w6EMIUIg8U	Dr Day	well hey guys in today it would be fun if we built a skincare routine together to help in clearing post acne redness dark marks just getting overall clear skin i know a lot of you guys deal with post acne blemishes and you to fade those it takes a long time but the ingredients and products i going to go over in this video can definitely help you all out all of these products you can find either in store or online from walmart today partnership with walmart you all know i love shopping at walmart and if you like shopping at walmart make sure you check out my walmart shop with me videos they here on youtube and if you welcome my name is andrea i certified dermatologist and i upload skin care and sometimes hair care related content here on youtube and so i subscribe and go ahead and give this video a thumbs up it really helps my channel out a lot all right i something that people just dismiss and don and that is starting your morning with a salicylic acid face wash this is going to help not only those of you who deal with acne related issues but also for anti-aging purposes for clearing up any other type of hyperpigmentation you may have even if it well salicylic acid it is a beta hydroxy acid and it helps with skin cell turnover it very gentle exfoliant it help put the breaks on some of the processes that lead to hyperpigmentation and staining of the skin the other nice thing about salicylic acid is that it gets into the oily surfaces of the skin very well as opposed to other chemical exfoliants namely alpha hydroxy acids which are water loving they don zone into the pore as well and so really the beta hydroxy acid it can seep down into the pore where a lot of skin issues arise from and exfoliate the pore and just improve overall skin clarity you can use it first thing in the morning actually go ahead and lather it to like the cheeks anywhere where you have discoloration you can use it actually all over the face but you want to make sure you spare getting it around the thin skin of the eyes around your mouth and sometimes it can actually be too drying for the neck but that an individual variable some people actually could tolerate it on the neck especially if you get acne on the neck anyways lather it there and let that lather sit on the skin for just a few minutes to really allow the salicylic acid to seep into your pores and go to work to exfoliate and then rinse the lather off people always are you know asking does this actually work can you actually derive benefit from salicylic acid using it this way you absolutely can some of it to do all these beneficial things but that short contact time actually minimizes the risk of irritation and if you do it on a daily basis it ends up being additive and you derive a lot of benefit many people use salicylic acid twice a day using it in the morning and in the evening time so that is another option but we morning and i would say go ahead and get your salicylic acid face wash now what salicylic acid face wash should you use if you have been here for if you know what i that is one of my favorites the zap zip bha facial cleanser i think it a two percent salicylic acid face wash really affordable free of fragrance and then um you want to use in the morning a sunscreen that important thing honestly i mean regardless of what you want in life wear your sunscreen every single day but when it comes to getting more even skin tone and clear skin this is so important for a variety of reasons i think a stumbling block people run into when it comes to sunscreen is like yeah we tell you obviously that it helps reduce skin cancer but that is such a delayed outcome that you people like something that bit more at least intermediate gratification as opposed to that delayed of gratification and when i say delay it i mean it takes decades and decades for skin cancer to actually show up anyways but sunscreen is so important because ultraviolet radiation from the sun it slows down healing tremendously and it generates a lot of inflammation in the skin that going to make that redness discoloration persist a lot longer it also chews up the collagen in our skin obviously that contributes to the formation of wrinkles and fine lines it also contributes to yellowing of the skin so as you get wiser you get more of a yellowed appearance especially around the thin skin of the eyelids such an important part of skin care i mean any skin issue you have it can get better quickly without protecting your skin from the sun now there are a ton of sunscreens out there i personal journey to find one that you like enough to use consistently but i have some uh that i love here for you guys one from cerave that seriously in my opinion is one of the best um you know drugstore if you will sunscreens on the market it tinted mineral sunscreen the sheer tint uh this is very hydrating and it doesn feel greasy on the skin it gives the skin a nice healthy glow and the tint helps to mask that white cast that you get with an all mineral sunscreen it dry skin or even combination skin because it helps address the needs of the moisture barrier but it greasy or heavy the tint is also nice because you get some protection against the pro pigmenting wavelengths of visible light what the heck is that well from the sun you have ultraviolet radiation that dangerous but the sun also emits visible light that that spectrum of visible light the hev is actually something that can affect your skin it can generate free radicals that slow down healing and it also can lead to early onset and more stubborn hyperpigmentation if you i strongly suggest a tinted sunscreen it definitely can help you out and that is a great one i highly recommend that some alternatives though that are also really good um is the acetaphil sheer mineral i been so impressed with this this is newer from them it is a all mineral sunscreen now this is not tinted and it does leave a bit of a white cast so just be aware of that but as far as an all mineral non-tinted sunscreen the cast on this is actually not too bad i reviewed it for you guys before i mean it just really looks great on the skin highly recommend it it kind of got a nice matte finish to it so it like that and you want to maybe put makeup on over it you certainly can do that it you live like i do in a humid environment you sweating it just ensures that it holds up a little bit better this is a great one and because it like the cerave one because they to be really good for people who have sensitive skin and they to apply around the thin delicate skin of the eyelids as opposed to chemical sunscreens which are more than fine and are excellent options but they often can sting and burn speaking of chemical sunscreen one that you should definitely check out is the acetaphil daily facial moisturizer this is their this is newer from them it is a chemical sunscreen so there cast with this so if you have a deep skin tone and you don spend your time trying to find a mineral sunscreen that lavender look just go for a chemical sunscreen they are effective it free of fragrance it it leave the skin greasy or shiny so all these are really good basic sunscreen options for daily use to really keep your skin healthy and protect it from those rays that make your skin discolored red irritated and aggravate any kind of skin condition that you may have eczema rosacea acne and of course cause wrinkles and fine lines and all those signs of photo aging that we happy with plus a lot of people don many medications that you might be on can make your skin more sensitive to the sun things like doxycycline even ibuprofen which you might take episodically for um for you know a headache or something that can make you sensitive to the sun so just being in the habit of protecting your skin from the sun on a daily basis is super important because i tangent but the rays that come in through window glass the uva rays those are the rays that you are more sensitive to as a result of medications it also those it the skin in that regard um all right so that is the daytime now let [Music] i suggest cleansing your skin obviously to remove dirt your sunscreen now why is that important well stuff left behind on the skin it can generate oxidative stress by creating free radicals and that actually ends up driving more inflammation and irritation in the skin that it journey so definitely wash your face at the end of the day take off your makeup if you wear makeup it is so important i recommend a gentle cleanser people like to use all these harsh cleansers and they really can end up stripping away your moisture barrier and that can actually lead to more dryness irritation even if you someone with oily skin and you i think i can handle it be careful i mean oiliness and the moisture barrier they separate entities and people often think that if they oily they don they can just go to town scrubbing their skin and that actually can end up getting you in a lot of trouble the cerave cleanser is awesome now if you wear a lot of makeup or you wear a um or you sunscreen you may find that cleansers they don that stuff off with just a cleanser i suggest using a little bit of a cleansing oil or a cleansing balm to the face first just to kind of break that up likewise on the body you can use these as well two super affordable options which you can get from walmart are the albileen um or the neutrogena body oil actually works quite well for this purpose you just rub it on the skin and then you go about cleansing your skin it just helps break up the water resistant sunscreen film as well as any makeup and then you just want to make sure you wash it off in total so that taking all that gunk off at the end of the day number two is to use a moisturizer now here get into the nitty-gritty of ingredients that can definitely help on your clear skin journey ingredients i and licorice root why well these ingredients they help to reduce free radicals because they have antioxidant properties so that inflammation and they reducing both redness as well as hyperpigmentation you don need a separate serum or anything like that you can just use a moisturizer that has these ingredients you already know i cerave pm facial moisturizing lotion this would be a great option to apply after cleansing at night time it really good it also has ceramides which help address that moisture barrier issue but if you aversion of this exact same ingredients very very good a few bucks less expensive so definitely would recommend that one but another option that those of you who have watched any of my rosacea content know about is the procure rosa care and you can get this at walmart now and this is great it root as well as niacinamide and it though neither is the syrupy one by the way but the cool thing about this is that it has a green tint to it and what that ends up doing is helping to camouflage the redness so it really helps to camouflage redness i love this i mean this i it in more stores because when it first launched it was really difficult to find it would sell out really quickly this brand um has a few other products that are also good by the way and i think this brand is cruelty free don certain they are so this would be another option now one thing i want to say um remember the morning skincare routine how we washed with the salicylic acid we rinsed the cleanser off and then i told you you need to put on sunscreen now some people like to use a moisturizing product in between that they find that sunscreen alone is not enough of a moisturizer they have more they have skin that tends to be dry you can bring these in at that point what i like about these is they a lightweight enough consistency that you apply them on let them dry set up fully and then you can put sunscreen on over without the issue of the sunscreen peeling p-i-l-l-i-n-g you know when it peeling means just kind of coming off in little balls like a sweater pills so yeah that won which is why which is why i really love them two bits all right but coming back to the nighttime routine i highly recommend incorporating a retinol or a dappling into your pm skincare routine if you are not on a prescription retinoid top these are forms of topical vitamin a which benefit the skin tremendously they help in skin cell turnover they help improve skin cell differentiation not only the skin but also the skin within the pore itself so they help keep your pores clear healthy reduce acne breakouts in the future and they definitely help in reducing the processes that lead to hyperpigmentation so they up dark spots faster and also when you use them long term consistently they can help in improving collagen production which will help with smoothing out skin texture and of course improving wrinkles and fine lines but in the journey to clear skin that more luminous look retinols are notorious for helping just the overall clarity of the skin for that reason now i mentioned you know obviously you can get prescription retinoids from your doctor dermatologist those are the most evidence-based especially tretinoin it the longest um especially for all the things that you know you but you have some good over-the-counter options obviously adapoline is a good one or different gel this is actually fda approved this is a retinoid and it acne so this is a good one uh for sure it it no nonsense but cerebe has one that definitely meets the needs of people looking for clearer skin it resurfacing retinol serum this has their retinol in it which takes a little bit longer to start working than a dappling but definitely is an option but it also has the ceramides which help address the moisture barrier it mentioned that can help reduce redness and irritation and this product also has licorice roots so you get those two beneficial ingredients in this as well they have another retinol their skin renewing retinol very similar to this except that product does not have licorice root so it difference but for those of you who have a lot of post acne redness this is a good one the retinol also for those of you dealing with redness retinol whether it be from a dappling or this product helps in improving that long term because it helps with the blood vessels that kind of get out of control in those areas of healing it definitely can help get that back on track to reduce that post acne redness all right so how do you use these after your moisturizer has dried which we mentioned earlier whether it be the cerave pm or the or the rosa care after it has dried fully then you just put a pea sized amount of either of these products to the entire face you don just a thin film and you want to make sure you don it around the eyes so one thing i like to do before i put this on is to put vaseline around my eyes to make sure it doesn to the thin skin of the eyelids because these will they turnover and the skin on the eyelids is very delicate and can you irritation around the eyelids people end up running into problems because they use a heaping glob of these which you do not need you just need a pea-sized amount to the entire face sparing the eyelids some people like to carry these down on the neck i caution you with that because the skin on the neck like the skin around the eyes is thin and more prone to irritation if you want to take it down onto your neck then i suggest doing so just a few nights a week because every day can be very irritating now if you retinols definitely check out my playlist on retinols because there to know about these and what i cover in today how to start them what to expect so definitely check those out but these are hero ingredients in your journey to clear skin last but certainly not least i know a lot of you guys deal with skin picking the compulsion to pick your skin especially if you have acne where you have more things that are available to pick it can be quite strong especially if you deal with a lot of anxiety this past year year and a half has been a very stressful time so you may even not even realize you doing it um picking will compromise healing for sure because you traumatizing the skin every time you pick it cannot heal you just will not heal with the picking and that is true so how do you stop yourself from picking check out my video on skin picking i give a lot of tips in that video but if you are a picker i definitely recommend the mighty patch these are just hydrocolloid pimple patches and they on an active pimple they kind of help because they um extrude some of the inflammatory milieu that you may note in like a pustule uh it kind of helps pull that out so the lesion can heal but if you are a picker these serve as a barrier and the reason i call these out is these are honestly my favorite of these they and you can really see them at all i mean if you look very carefully you can see the outline but otherwise you can because of that they to camouflage an active pimple so highly recommend these they are they are a great product if you have active acne that you are you know picking at even if it inadvertently the one i have here is the original but they also make this as a in a rectangular shape that like around the jawline and you can use these on the body everything i mentioned in this video by the way it have these issues like on your upper back or your upper chest then you definitely can use these the skin on the upper back as a side note though is so thick that a lot of these things they can work but you have to be even more patient because they to get down into into that thick skin as opposed to the skin on the face is a lot thinner so they can access where they need to be much more quickly so it takes patience but these things that i mentioned in today video definitely can help when do you use these i would say it got it notice that you pick more some people pick at night time before they go to bed they tend to get maybe a little bit stressed out maybe their face is itchy then go to bed with these on um or maybe it camouflage wear them during the day um so that to you you know you can fit it into your routine as you see fit and it doesn necessarily need to be an everyday thing just when you know maybe you out or you have more real estate to be picking if your acne is more more active if you will that guys wash with a salicylic acid face wash in the morning apply moisturizer if you want to ideally one with niacinamide licorice root definitely apply sunscreen regardless of what you pm routine wash your face oh one one question i might get is why can i not wash my face at nighttime with the salicylic acid cleanser you can but remember you don use it around the eyes because it can be very irritating there so i suggest using it just a gentle cleanser to actually wash your face of dirt oil cosmetics pollutants debris impurities all that so i do suggest a separate cleanser but yeah so that start with the washing your face then apply moisturizer ideally one with niacinamide and or licorice group allow it to dry fully and then put your retinol on if you need to use one of the pimple patches to act as a barrier between your pimple and your fingers so that they can heal check the d box everything will be listed and linked uh thank you walmart for sponsoring today thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don i

How to TREAT ACNE WHEN YOU HAVE DRY SKIN| Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pha_1yoevQk	Dr Day	hey guys in today be giving you my tips for how to treat your acne if you also have dry skin if you andrea i dermatologist i love it if you would subscribe to my youtube channel and hit the thumbs up it really helps my videos out a lot so many of you are dealing with acne right now maybe it with your period and adult acne is no fun to cope with it has to do with oil being put out through the pore that then clogs the pore as well as kind of a delay and impairment of skin cell turnover within the pore you have these sticky skin cells that clog the pore then you get a blackhead or a white head and then later on down the road you can get an inflamed cyst that it oily skin then you must not need to use moisturizers i oily skin does not equal moisturize skin they are not the same thing and in fact many people with oily acne prone skin actually have dry skin tooth because they have an impaired moisture barrier if you you know i cosmetics mighty patch i it in my video on how to stop picking your skin and my video on neck acne and they are actually sponsoring today video so that means i have a discount code for you guys if you click the link in my description box you can get 15 off plus free shipping on orders over 35 dollars which is a great deal think about your skin as a brick wall the skin cells are the bricks and then the ceramides cholesterol and lipids in between the skin cells that mortar the glue that keeps everything together the integrity of this brick and mortar structure is really important because it keeps moisture in the skin so the skin is firm plump hydrated and also keeps irritating things out when that integrity is compromised maybe from using too many irritating products maybe because you have a genetic tendency towards dry skin or just age-related change and lots of ceramides what ends up happening is that you irritation from things coming in contact with a scan but that doesn fact that you can still have oily skin because oiliness is governed by hormones and so you with the increased oil production that may flare around your period for example but you also have this barrier issue that you have to address and with the oiliness what ends up happening is that you can get plugging of the pores that leads to blackheads whiteheads and down the road from that is inflammatory painful acne lesions my number one tip is just stick to a very simple skincare routine that includes cleanser moisturizer and sunscreen it 30s and 40s years to try all these different products like toners and different serums and while those can be helpful if you cause a lot of irritation and that actually can compromise the integrity of your moisture barrier leading to more dryness more irritation worsening the acne down the road because of increased irritation you get more inflammation which leads to more oil production more clogging of the pores with sticky skin cells i mean it keep it very very simple basic skincare routines should just include a cleanser a moisturizer and a sunscreen sunscreen is not something to skip however because uh it of the acne ultraviolet radiation from the sun impairs healing so the skin barrier integrity is going to be compromised and it also breaks down the oils on your skin leading to more inflammation and more flares of acne so don sunscreen piece of things and don of things either that your skin barrier and reduce the dryness number two do not pick or manipulate your acne or your skin in any way it tempting to pick at your skin um i have a video all about skin picking disorder sometimes when people get stressed out they skin and if you those are prime real estate for the fingers to go with squeezing unfortunately when you manipulate your skin like that it drives a lot of inflammation into the skin that ultimately will worsen the acne and it also puts you at risk for skin infections it can be very challenging i suggest doing things with your hands like you know a craft project sitting on your hands i also strongly encourage you to check out the mighty patch these are hydrocolloid patches that are fantastic to not only help with the healing of a pimple but they serve as a barrier to prevent your fingers from accessing the pimple ultimately helping with healing as well how do these work well their medical grade hydrocolloid which is something that we use in medicine for treating wounds and what it does is it helps in absorbing the inflammatory exudate that occurs when pimples become inflamed it helps absorb that so that the new healthy skin cells can come in and heal the pimple properly when a pimple becomes inflamed the inflammatory cells they release different things cytokines and what ends up happening is everything that they release lends itself to the formation of a pustule that white material that you may notice from an inflamed pimple hydrocolloid patches help extrude that white plus material and that stands in the way of the new skin cells coming in to heal the pimple more expeditiously these patches are also really advantageous for those of you who have an impaired moisture barrier because really what they the brakes on trans epidermal water loss so that the skin surrounding the pimple doesn become even more dry irritated in flame it kind of almost acts like second skin so i pimple patches and why i continue to recommend the mighty patch is that it stays on and you can it on there it wrinkling of the edges you can that you even have it on and honestly you forget that you have it on you want to wear it for at least six hours to give it time for the hydro quality to wick up that exit day and so that during the day for example nobody gonna know that you have this on you can get them in a variety of different sizes and shapes too this one that i have here the mighty patch the original is a good size for a standard inflammatory pimple but they also make them in rectangular shapes which i happen to think are particularly good if you have kind of a clustering of cystic lesions along the jawline that is the perfect size and shape for those you guys know i i too this is great to address the dry skin issue and it really helps once the pimple has healed over and the skin is intact this is really helpful for expediting healing of that hyperpigmentation or the post acne redness that can occur it for improving the moisture content of the skin it humectant and it oligopeptides that may help in facilitating healing these products are pretty affordable and especially in comparison to many of the other you know exotic serums and whatnot that you may be attempting to try um however don forget check out the link in my description box because again you can get uh 15 off of orders 35 and over plus free shipping when you dealing with acne plus dry skin the last thing you want to do is go aggravating your moisture barrier further by picking and squeezing your skin that because they help not only improve healing but they also create a barrier to wandering hands as i touch my face so yeah highly encourage those those of you who have watched any of my videos you know i discourage using pore extractors or those awful poor vacuums especially in the case where you have dry skin because those are going to create a lot of irritation to the skin barrier you going to lose more water out of the skin and they generate a lot of just inflammation that can lead to scarring it poor extractors for example there something that we do actually use in dermatology but it use by yourself willy-nilly on random acne lesions because some are just not amenable and you can really cause a lot of scarring not to mention damage to your moisture barrier with more dryness and irritation the poor vacuums are problematic because they don contents of your pore and they can cause bruising and as they suction force on the skin you just sucking more moisture out of your skin leading to more dryness and irritation so don skin whatsoever number three you want to make sure that you active ingredients for acne using too many all at once introducing too many active ingredients it handle and it can lead to a lot of irritation i always suggest introducing one active at a time and by actives i mean things like salicylic acid benzoyl peroxide or retinol these are ingredients used to treat acne however they can be very drying they can create some irritation they exfoliate the skin which in and of itself is going to cause more water loss out of the skin so they take some time to get used to and for those side effects to subside so the last thing you want to do is go trying multiple ingredients all at once you can really end up getting very dry irritated inflamed skin irritant contact dermatitis that unfortunately ultimately will worsen the acne so one active ingredient at a time and the way to introduce one is to just start using it maybe a few days or nights a week seeing how you tolerate it and then increasing to daily uh for a few weeks and any active ingredient is going to take time to work give it at least six weeks of just using that before even entertaining the idea of introducing another ingredient and again if you get to a point where you do want to introduce another ingredient introduce it slowly and i suggest using it at a different time of the day like for example using one active ingredient at nighttime like retinol and then the other active ingredient in the morning like benzoyl peroxide that way you minimize the contact together that can lead to so much irritation that causes problems for you or you can alternate one active ingredient one day another active ingredient the next day not all active ingredients necessarily need to be used on a daily basis to benefit your acne so you might introduce them again slowly and then try alternating one day on the next day off with another with a different ingredient you have to moisturize get over the fear of moisturizing if you have oily skin and if you have acne it is it helps reduce water loss out of the skin and it helps clear your skin barrier into beginning to restore itself it helps you tolerate these active ingredients that i mentioned benzoyl peroxide retinol salicylic acid it helps you tolerate those better allowing them to work better allowing them to work faster so that you get clearance faster and they also help in because because moisturizers help reduce water loss out of the skin they make it so that your acne is less likely to heal with persistent redness or discoloration really a very important part of your skincare routine again as i said at the beginning you want to keep the routine consistent and simple and skipping a moisturizer is something that can lead to a lot of dryness and irritation especially if you have dry skin now certain times of the year you need maybe a heavier moisturizer don oily skin don to clog your pores or anything like that think of them as helping that moisture barrier for example in the winter time when the heater comes on you out of the skin or during certain times of your cycle your skin may be more sensitive and more prone to losing water and that might be a time where you seeing more flares of acne to you so don don effort to dry up the acne ingredients to look for in your moisturizer i already mentioned panthenol is a wonderful one for helping the moisture barrier also ceramides are a good ingredient they kind of help glue the moisture barrier into recovering you may choose moisturizers that have silicones in them to reduce water loss out of the skin the silicones they feel nice and lightweight they skin or heavy and they also help they also silicones like dimethicone for example and moisturizers they moisturizers that are labeled oil-free and they actually allow for the evaporation of sweat so they have an anti-shine property so they have acne you also might want to choose a moisturizer that has niacinamide in it niacinamide is not only anti-inflammatory it helps both oiliness and it helps the moisture barrier so it for people dealing with acne and dryness or both or either or great ingredient so check the description box i my favorite cleansers moisturizers and sunscreens that are really good for people with both oily skin as well as dry skin my final tip is when it comes to acne treatments consider using them as spot treatments now you can all acne treatments but some you can and doing it just to the pimple that treatment doing it just to the pimple reduces excessive dryness and irritation around other parts of your skin where you may not necessarily suffer from acne salicylic acid can be used as a spot treatment as can benzoyl peroxide and both of these ingredients notoriously are pretty drying and can be pretty irritating and they work well as a spot treatment the way to use them as a spot treatment is when you first feel the pimple coming you you know it you can kind of feel it under the skin that start spot treating right then and you want to spot treat all the way through till when the pimple appears and you want to spot treat for a week after it goes away continuing to spot treat will reduce the chances that it heals with hyperpigmentation or redness because you continue to get that anti-inflammatory effect on board however retinols or retinoids like adapalene or tretinoin they don work as spot treatments you can those as needed because they take some time to kind of build up and start working and you really want them to the entire face they provide a field effective control plus they also have some other benefits to the skin like improving skin cell turnover so those ingredients unfortunately don treatments but things like benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid that can be super drying they do work as spot treatments and that is one way to incorporate those ingredients into your routine without getting too dry or irritated from them all right guys those are my five tips for treating acne when you skin i hope this video was helpful to you all and again check the link in my description box to try out mighty patch get a discount they fantastic i cosmetics and so many videos over the years i partner with them on today and if you guys

BEST PREGNANCY SAFE ACNE PRODUCTS| Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7ouPkFEJ2A	Dr Day	hey guys in today be covering my top five ingredients for acne during pregnancy pregnancy is a time that can be very challenging when navigating skin care because certain ingredients are maybe not safe during pregnancy or basically we don during pregnancy so we tell you better to avoid it it can be very frustrating and pregnancy is a time where people acne often flares or maybe they even are experiencing acne for the first time it can be incredibly incredibly distressing there are some products over the counter ingredients over the counter that can help you out but i do encourage you to see a board certified for your acne there are prescription treatments that can be used during pregnancy that are helpful um and that because as a reminder acne if untreated can go on to form scars which is you know what we acne treatment is not only to clear it up but to prevent it from scarring number one ingredient is azelaic acid azolic acid is a compound that is more than safe during pregnancy it has bacteriostatic effects so it can help reduce the burden of cutie bacterium acne that contributes to acne asalic acid also helps reduce hyperpigmentation a lot of times during pregnancy not only are you dealing with acne but you prone to healing with a dark mark you may even be experiencing a condition called melasma azelaic acid can help both the acne as well as these issues of hyperpigmentation it prescribe for diseases of hyperpigmentation and it azoleic acid also helps reduce redness in the skin you know there the skin called perioral dermatitis it looks an awful lot like acne and it may be something that you during pregnancy and you sure if you or acne good news about azelaic acid it will benefit both conditions both acne and perioral dermatitis another condition rosacea can look like acne and may get worse during pregnancy good news azoleic acid is used to treat rosacea as well so it ingredient it and it it can be a little bit drying but otherwise not too bad it can be used twice a day now it is an ingredient that is best gotten by a prescription only at least here in the states because we can prescribe azolic acid in much higher concentrations than what is sold over the counter but if you can to see a dermatologist to get a prescription right away there are some over-the-counter adelaide acid options specifically the ordinary suspension is a great option for people coping with acne during pregnancy it is a much lower percentage than what you would get in a prescription but it is an option that can help with not only the acne but in just helping reduce that inflammation in the skin that will lend itself to hyperpigmentation and redness all right ingredient number two is actually a family of ingredients that are safe during pregnancy and that is alpha hydroxy acids these include glycolic lactic and mandelic alpha hydroxy acids help to smooth out the surface of the skin they exfoliate the skin um and they also can help lift up some hyperpigmentation as they exfoliate the skin they can kind of help in reducing clogging of the pores now they good as salicylic acid however they are safer in pregnancy now as a side note you may you may be wondering about certain ingredients if i because it comfortable recommending to a general audience it always best to talk to your treating healthcare provider you know salicylic acid may be okay for you but in some cases it may not be okay for you so i want you to talk to your doctor about any other ingredient but these are generally recognized as safe during pregnancy the ingredients that i in today back to alpha hydroxy acids glycolic lactic mandelic um these three that i mentioned they vary in their size glycolic is the smallest it penetrates the most deeply so it it and that irritation can worsen hyperpigmentation lactic acid is in between the two as far as size less likely to be irritating but not as robust as an exfoliant and then mandelic acid super gentle as far as an exfoliant but very very low likely to cause irritation all three of these alpha hydroxy acids they also can help improve the moisture barrier and the moisture content reducing dryness ultimately even though they can be drying i know that but they do help the barrier function of the skin and that acne if your skin is dry and the moisture barrier is impaired then you will lose more water out of the skin and that will cause more inflammation in the skin and that will aggravate the acne so these are these are a family of ingredients that are safe to use during pregnancy ingredient number three that i love during pregnancy is sulfur sulfur is a natural compound that is anti-inflammatory it unplug pores and it it rosacea and it so if you conditions you again they can look very similar sulfur is a good ingredient to use it safe like azoleic acid it is pretty well tolerated it smells like eggs and it can be a little drying but otherwise it is fine this product that i of it but i like it and i think it option for acne during pregnancy because not only does it have sulfur but it also has alpha hydroxy acids in it so you get both ingredients the alpha hydroxy acids will help the sulfur penetrate a little bit better now i that have these ingredients down below the products i video they there are others out there um it illustrative purposes um and i some alternatives down below all right ingredient number four is led therapy an led acne mask or wand uh this is a great option during pregnancy uh it combines red light and blue light red light is anti-inflammatory and blue light specifically targets that little bacterium cutie bacterium acnes that contributes to acne and it it treatment that you can do during pregnancy to help improve the skin overall now you can go to a dermatologist and have this done however you can also buy over-the-counter acne light masks that might be something that you want to invest in which is why i here they have masks and they have wands that you could use maybe you on the lower half of the face you don you can use the wand wands can also be used for like the back or the chest if you in those areas as a side note any ingredient i mentioning in this video can also be used to other body sites as well so yeah led therapy is definitely an option during pregnancy for acne you know you again you can see a dermatologist for it but if you can buy one of these devices over the counter and do it yourself how does it compare to what you will get in office they you will get in office is more robust and you will see results faster but you can get some good control uh with at-home devices for sure they are safe and they are an effective option so i do recommend that for people dealing with acne during pregnancy last but certainly not least from me you probably already know at this point and it is sunscreen sunscreen is so important for treating acne because ultraviolet radiation actually contributes to a lot of inflammation in the skin that drives acne further ultraviolet radiation also slows healing down and it contributes to hyperpigmentation which you trying to navigate uh because of pregnancy hormones but then to have sun on board i mean it safe in pregnancy there you need to find the sunscreen you need to find someone that you like and you will wear yeah that is it it doesn it mineral they are safe sunscreens are safe i don working group wants you to think sunscreens are safe they endocrine system of your child do not buy into the fear mongering around sunscreens they protect the skin from damaging rays that not only cause these issues of acne flaring but can set you up for a skin cancer risk and you know if you having a child uh go ahead and start getting in the habit of wearing sunscreen that way when they you putting on sunscreen and they learn to do it themselves and then you keep the you keep the habit going down generations so definitely want to be protecting your skin from the sun for sure when it comes to addressing acne during pregnancy or any time in your life all right those are my top five ingredients for acne and pregnancy that you can buy in the store but again i encourage you to see a board-certified dermatologist if you pregnancy because again there are medications that can be prescribed stronger forms of azelaic acid in office led that uh that you know you might be a candidate for uh so definitely you know i would always encourage you to see a board certified dermatologist but these things that you can buy over the counter certainly can help uh you know they can help quite a bit the extent to which they will help will depend on the severity of your acne and how consistent you are with using them uh some acne is just these things are not going to touch in which case you definitely want to see a board-certified dermatologist for your acne it can be a very challenging area to navigate you don yourself all right guys i hope you enjoyed this video i hope it was useful if so give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen and subscribe i [Music] you	Success
Best products to FADE POST ACNE RED MARKS (PIE)| Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_T_QgX2GeOE	Dr Day	hey guys in today be talking about post acne redness or post inflammatory erythema i did a video on this a while ago but i have some updates and you guys have been asking for a new video i know a lot of you all deal with this what is post-inflammatory erythema it persistent redness after your acne has healed and gone away and this can actually last a very long time it type of post acne mark post inflammatory hyperpigmentation which is when the acne heals with a dark mark instead with post-inflammatory erythema it heals with either a red or pink or purplish mark down in the deeper layers of the skin there is damage to the blood vessels and so there post inflammatory hyperpigmentation where you have pigment that kind of leaks out into the skin and creates that stain this is a little bit different both processes post-inflammatory erythema and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation are the result of the inflammation that acne generates in the skin so that processes heal very very very slowly with time and patience there are some things however that can aggravate post-inflammatory erythema make sure you stick around to the end of the video i definitely going to be sharing with you guys some good products for this condition a lot of people have a combination of post-inflammatory erythema and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and while they some of the ingredients that are used to help them resolve are shared so you know that good thing but if you can maybe your spa is kind of purplish dark you one way to tell if it just press on it and if it temporarily blanches fades uh then it post-inflammatory erythema as opposed to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation which shouldn you know pressing pressing on the on the spot the other thing that point out is that a lot of people have a combination of both post-inflammatory erythema and actual true scars and true scars they require procedures resurfacing lasers and things like that to actually flatten them out smooth them out and whatnot so if you been dealing with this for years and you no longer have active acne it may be that you actually have acne scars i recommend seeing a board certified dermatologist to discuss what treatments are going to be most appropriate to get you the results that you but post-inflammatory erythema by itself believe it or not it newly defined uh term it was first described in 2013 so there treatment for post-inflammatory erythema we don controlled trials and studies but it does fade slowly with time as those capillaries that are ruptured resolve are reabsorbed the inflammation dies down i mean it slow healing process so what can you do well you want to make sure that you protect your skin from the sun i know i harp on this in every video but it ultraviolet radiation slows down the healing process so that post-inflammatory erythema and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation last a long time so make sure that you wear a broad spectrum sunscreen every single day reapply it a few times a day while you or if you want to reapply it every two hours to make sure that you good protection and then you also want to make sure that you and not staying out in midday sun too long these are things that will help with the healing process the other thing that for healing of post acne marks regardless of the type is you do not want to pick your skin when you pick the skin it generates more inflammation that contributes to further you know breakage of those capillaries more redness more irritation more hyperpigmentation so no squeezing no picking no popping the other key aspect is that if you have any active acne so long as your acne is active you attempt to treat the post-inflammatory redness or hyperpigmentation it that so you want to make sure that you treating the acne but for a lot of you the acne is a thing of the past and it the redness or the hyperpigmentation that you still dealing with there are some wonderful ingredients that can help this condition niacinamide applied topically can be very helpful for redness the studies look maximum at five percent strength so there seek out a niacinamide product that is a higher percentage higher does not mean better but looking out for the ingredient niacinamide and skin care products that can help out your redness quite a bit and it also helps with hyperpigmentation another great ingredient for redness is licorice root it it helps put the breaks on any residual inflammation in the skin and it helps with redness quite a bit and then another ingredient that is based on something that we give by mouth for melasma tranexamic acid there lot of interest in applying tranexamic acid topically to the skin to treat diseases of hyperpigmentation but what we is that topically applied tranexamic acid while the data is still out as far as its efficacy for hyperpigmentation it actually seems to be helpful for improving redness especially the type of redness that you has healed because tranexamic acid it it interferes with blood clotting so that makes some sense that it would target the redness so that is definitely an ingredient to look out for i don that in my last video a few years ago on post acne redness but that is certainly an ingredient to consider incorporating into your skincare routine and i do have a video all about tranexamic acid if you curious about it another ingredient that we learn is very helpful for healing is going to be centella now we have data showing that it helpful for healing and improving the look of scars and so that logic would follow that would likely be helpful in this situation as well scentella is present in a lot of moisturizers and it some of which i will mention here so that and then of course there acid azolic acid is anti-inflammatory and can help fight off redness and irritation and if you with hyperpigmentation it helpful for that as well and retinol or retinoid now you guys know i have a ton of videos on retinols and retinoids and what the differences are but long story short they certainly can help with the redness when you continue when you use them continue to use them a lot of people use these to treat acne once the acne goes away you may have stopped them but continuing to use them can be beneficial for hastening the resolution of both post-inflammatory redness and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation for the redness um retinols and retinoids they can actually help boost up collagen production in the deeper layers of the skin which kind of helps fill in any of the defects and helps with resorption of those ruptured capillaries so that to keep on board for sure if so long as you tolerate it you guys know retinols can be can be drying and irritating so so long as you tolerate it keep using retinol or retinoid or what you know if you were using one to treat your acne keep using it and i video so don this does fade with time but as i said at the beginning of the video if you have true scars those are not going to fade with time and you want to see a board certified dermatologist to talk about what can be done there in the store there can you know mix up in your kitchen that will take away a true scar there are a lot of cosmetic procedures though that can really improve the look of post acne scars usually a combination of cosmetic procedures is required i do have videos on different types of treatments for acne scars lasers uh for just the plane for just post-inflammatory erythema that will slowly fade with time if you want it to go away faster you can see a board certified dermatologist for a laser treatment pulse dye laser is an effective treatment to hasten the clearance of post-inflammatory erythema so if it really bothering you you might want to invest in that that will help help it go away faster all right a product that i happen to think is good to consider for post inflammatory hyperpigmentation or redness is this newer product to me by good molecules i mentioned it in my review of the brand it discoloration correcting serum this has four percent niacinamide which can be helpful for calming down redness and again for treating any hyperpigmentation and it also has uh tranexamic acid in it as well remember i said that that has is showing a lot of promise for treating redness so consider this the way to use this is you can use it up to twice a day after cleansing the skin go ahead and apply it to the skin while the skin increase the penetration of the active ingredients in this and then just layer a moisturizer on top if it just go ahead and layer your sunscreen on on top that pretty moisturizing as well um it the skin very quickly so that one to consider now i mentioned the scentella it healing you guys this particular um soothing ampule cintella aqua soothing ampule from cosrx their entire scentella line actually is very very good but this in particular is very strong it asiatic extract in it but actually has the active compounds with from the centella uh the az the asiatic pennyward it called uh it actually has the bioactive compounds actually has the active compounds from that plant isolated extracted and included in the product plus it got chondrous crispus extract a marine extract it helps add hydration so that to help your moisture barrier as well so this is a very good product similar to how you would use a discoloration correcting serum you just want to apply it to the skin either while the skin is still damp after cleansing or you know you can apply it to dry skin but again to damp skin it increase the penetration and then apply a moisturizer on over it that centella will get in there and can really help in facilitating the healing process yeah i love costa rx it has some fantastic products and that one is definitely a good centella product to consider for hastening healing um all right licorice root is really good for redness it hyperpigmentation i i have been so impressed with the it skin li effector this serum is fantastic for calming down redness brightening up hyperpigmentation so many of you have tried it out since i talking about it now for a year actually it was a year ago because i went back to my instagram uh i was like oh my gosh i and talking about this for over a year now um yeah really good for calming down redness uh and similar to to the other two serums you just apply it to the skin up to twice a day um uh you know underneath your moisturizer or underneath your sunscreen it uh free of fragrance if i didn that already all these products i talking about in today of fragrance now polish choice azolic acid booster not only does this product have azelaic acid in it which can calm down redness and it but it and it has salicylic acid now salicylic acid is anti-inflammatory so that can help a little bit with redness and it also helps give some ongoing acne control so it that is in there as well um this product i find is effective similar to the other two the other serums i consider this a serum i mean they call it a booster because they want you to use it to like boost some of your you know the outcomes of some of your other products whatever to me i would just say you know i say use this you can use it again up to twice a day underneath a moisturizer or underneath your sunscreen consider it like a serum to me you know serum is like something that you put on underneath moisturizer to really like take advantage of a specific active ingredient that may be missing from your moisturizer so this long story short this is very good and i do recommend it but another um another product that i talked about in my last redness video but it procure aerosic hair this can be hard to find but it out if you were dealing with redness um or if you have rosacea too you know a lot of people have have acne and then they also have rosacea the acne they heal with redness definitely try this out um it niacinamide in it and it so it helps camouflage the redness this is very good super lightweight um it used actually by itself as a moisturizer but if you have really dry skin you probably going to want to layer another moisturizer on on top of it it not it as robust in terms of reducing what called trans epidermal water loss out of the skin but um yeah so you know depending on your needs you could use it just by itself as a moisturizer or you could use it as a serum underneath things again up to twice a day you can use it at night the green tint in this comes from the chromium oxides it doesn on things it foundation or anything like that so you don washing the green off like you know it words um it just offers that cosmetic camouflage benefit it very nice you really do see reduction in redness for me personally i use it a lot when i get a lot of redness and irritation around my mouth from the mask and it product for me in those situations but for those of you dealing with post acne redness definitely check it out okay i mentioned retinol at the beginning you know whatever retinoid you were using to treat your acne fine to continue using it um that will help the the post acne redness and just in terms of healings you know retinoids that can help they can help improve the healing process for you but one that i think is particularly relevant to those of you dealing with post acne marks is a favorite retinol of mine it resurfacing retinol serum this is this is made to address not only the needs of acne with the retinol but also to deal with to deal with the bystander injury as i call it the hyperpigmentation the redness and the dryness that comes with using retinols it ceramides in it which help the moisture barrier which ultimately is going to help facilitate the healing and recovery of the post acne redness this is a very good one to to also consider introducing into into your routine so that is that honorable mentions too you know that i redness relieving night moisturizer and day moisturizer are also fantastic they root in them and ceramides those are standalone moisturizers one is to be used in the daytime it has a little bit of spf in it and it the tint on that product doesn necessarily work though for people with medium to deep skin tones it better suited for people who are paler which you know incidentally tends to be people who suffer more with post acne redness but yeah i did want to mention that product i didn love it and it with redness who do deal with redness and then they have a nighttime version that lack you know doesn or the tint in it um you know you can use that at night time very good moisturizer for people with redness prone skin i and here on youtube saying thank you for recommending that to me it great moisturizer so yeah i definitely wanted to recommend it but these are some products that i think can really help you guys out who are dealing with post acne redness i know it having acne is super frustrating it can really impact your self-esteem and all that but like i feel as though sometimes we should you know we shouldn at the acne treatment and then you know think that we out there injury that needs to be addressed for the longest time products really just neglected that aspect of acne they really were just aimed at you know spot treatments and overnight treatments things that would get rid of a pimple fast type things that was the marketing and that designed really to you know to prevent breakouts and to clear breakouts but there wasn really anything for the longest time aimed at addressing post acne fallout or you know the the bystander injury of dry skin hyperpigmentation and post acne redness these are things that you guys are are really struggling with so i hope these products and tips are really helpful and again if this is something that you have been you know dealing with for like over a year then definitely see a board-certified dermatologist and say hey is this just post-acne redness do i need to be a little bit more patient with this give it some more time or do i have some scarring here that we could you know consider treating all right guys i tips for post-inflammatory erythema or post acne red marks i hope this video was helpful to you guys if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen and subscribe i guys tomorrow bye [Music] you	Success
Best BIRTH CONTROL for HORMONAL ACNE| Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaSvljrwRfY	Dr Day	hey guys in today telling you everything you need to know about taking birth control pills for acne if you name is andrea i dermatologist i would love it if you would subscribe to my youtube channel and hit the thumbs up it really helps my videos out a lot birth control pills are frequently prescribed for acne and women especially women whose acne flares with their period oral contraceptive pills as they called are birth control pills combine two types of hormones estrogen and progesterone how do they work well they influence the normal cycles of hormone fluctuations in our body that govern the menstrual cycle suppressing ovulation so that work to prevent pregnancy as contraceptives they block the ovulation step so how the heck do they work to treat acne well when women profiles fluctuate they change from a more female predominant pattern of estrogens and progesterones to a more male predominant pattern of androgens or testosterone and androgens influence the skin quite a bit and cause the oil glands to make more oil and they cause the skin to become a little bit thicker and the skin cells to become stickier so you clogging of the pores excessive oiliness and that of acne around the period the menstrual cycle hormonal acne for whatever reason hormonal acne seems to often affect the jawline the chin the neck but it really can happen anywhere any type of acne however really can be influenced by these changes in hormones the pills need to be the type that are combined oral contraceptive pills there are a variety of other contraceptives on the market that just use one type of hormone progesterone like the progesterone only pill and also there are some implant implantable contraceptives that release progesterone these actually can worsen acne so a lot of people say why did my acne get so horrible when i went on birth control well it may have been that you were not on a combined oral contraceptive pill that combined estrogen and progesterone you may have been on a method that was progesterone only and in that case yes the acne can get worse so in order for the acne to see benefit from taking a birth control pill it needs to be one that combines both estrogen and progesterone there are actually three brands of oral contraceptive pills on the market that are fda approved for the treatment of acne in women these include ortho tricyclin estrostep and yaz so these are the three brands that get the fda seal of approval for the treatment of acne and women however any combined oral contraceptive pill will also benefit acne by the same mechanism it doesn these three so your physician may prescribe another brand what fda approved but they know it help anyway who is a good candidate for combined oral contraceptive pills to treat acne well women whose acne flares with the menstrual cycle but truthfully any female who has acne can benefit from having a conversation about whether or not oral birth control pills are right for them because while your acne may not necessarily flare with your periods there is always an underlying hormonal component governing oiliness skin cell stickiness that may benefit from a combined oral contraceptive pill there called polycystic ovary syndrome i know a lot of you guys deal with that and in that disease those women suffer from acne and also hirsutism these are skin signs that can benefit from the use of oral contraceptive pills for sure you absolutely want to discuss this with your treating healthcare provider your family medicine doctor or internist gynecologist or your dermatologist have a conversation if birth control pills are going to be right for you for the treatment of your acne who should not be prescribed birth control pills for their acne if you have a history of blood clots it contraindicated because the estrogen in birth control pills does increase the risk of clotting and for people with a history of clotting or some sort of underlying blood clotting disorder then it is contraindicated if you don have a history of blood clots the risk is very very very very low and we encourage people to um you know if you trip and sedentary that it up and move around just as a general precaution that a good measure to reduce the risk of clotting a sign of a blood clot would be a sudden one-sided swelling of either your arm or your leg redness warmth discomfort that would be those are clues that you might have a blood clot and in that situation immediately call your health care provider and you know tell them about it and and if you can you know you might actually even want to consider going to the urgent care or emergency room because blood clot is nothing to to to mess around with but in people who are otherwise healthy and don history of clot blood clots you know it risk issue the other group of people who birth control pills are contraindicated for because of the risk of blood clotting is people who smoke so if you smoke it not you know good to be on birth control it is too risky with the blood clot thing if you smoke as a side note please please please please please do everything in your power to try and stop smoking also if you have a history of migraines birth control is not going to be a good option for you as well so those are the you know kind of absolute contra indications definitely talk about it with your with your doctor how long does it take to see results when you start taking birth control for your acne as with anything in the skin nothing happens overnight some people say they see an improvement in one month so you know some patients report that or at any rate they notice that their skin is less greasy however for the most part it takes at least three months six months typically for you to really start seeing results so you have to be on it for a good while before you really start to appreciate the skin benefit of the reduced oiliness reduce pore clogging and overall improvement in the acne what are the side effects of birth control pill most commonly you can expect to experience some nausea bloating and breast tenderness this is these are very common side effects the good news is they typically for the most part go away after three months so the first three months can be the most uncomfortable um but then those side effects typically subside if you taking birth control pills a tip is to take the pills in the early evening and then make sure you have breakfast the following morning that can help quite a bit with the nausea some people have issues with headaches and one thing that can actually help is some birth control pill packs they have a hormone free week and that week you know you you you not taking anything for a week and that what you know as a period um but a way if you sometimes we tell patients to skip that that placebo week and just move on to the next pack of pills um so that would can reduce the headache symptoms um birth control pills that has have drospirone in them like yeahs those birth control pills address prone has a bit of a diuretic effect and that can actually end up helping mitigate symptoms of bloating and breast tenderness other side effects that are pretty common are changes in mood some people claim they don like themselves they some people feel as though their mood is improved some people report a change in their libido there actually a study that looked at this and about 64 of people on birth control pill say there had an increase in libido and 15 had a decrease in their libido and you know that can be something that people just you know are not okay with obviously and that might be a reason why you end up not wanting to stay on birth control but that is another symptom that sometimes resolves on its own another potential side effect that you guys might be worried about because this is a skincare channel is melasma melasma is classically referred to as the mask of pregnancy dark brown patches on cheeks foreheads really anywhere on this on the skin and we call it the mask of pregnancy because it shows up during pregnancy but any hormones that you take that have estrogen in them can trigger melasma it going to happen it you take that you take birth control pills you but if you have melasma it certainly can worsen that and if you might start seeing some hyperpigmentation there was a study done in the 60s 70s that showed that it happened with about 29 but if you actually look at that study back then they were using uh combined pills with a much higher dosage of estrogen so it commonly used anymore so it is a potential side effect the melasma does go away albeit slowly when you stop the birth control pill in a way to reduce that the risk of the melasma of course is to protect your skin using a broad spectrum sunscreen spf 30 or higher every single day including when you indoors because the uv that comes through window glass remember can drive melasma and there are studies showing that sunscreens with iron oxides can be preventative and helpful for people with melasma because they block out visible light that likewise can contribute to you to melasma so use a tinted mineral sunscreen for example that can be a great option for at least reducing that risk all right but probably one of the most pressing questions that i get is do i have to be on birth control forever to maintain good control of my acne you don that birth control pills they address the hormonal component of acne and that when you stop the birth control pills you absolutely can see a return of your baseline acne however we don prescribe birth control pills i mean we don that for acne for anybody it birth control pills and be like hey see you later there needs to be other treatments started ideally at the same time topicals that take time to work but by the time you get to a point where things have improved you know you may be able to transition to just topicals and not worry about the acne returning when you stop the birth control pills for example the topical that pretty much every acne patient should be on in my opinion or benefits from most acne patients do is going to be a topical retinoid uh you know that might be prescription uh tretinoin or over-the-counter adaptolene not only do retinoids help in reducing oiliness but they also help improve the skin cell turnover within the pore kind of helping with that stickiness issue reducing pore clogging and they can help reduce flares of acne down the road so you know it wouldn like you control pills there would be something something else and then of course the lifestyle factors really play a major role in acne we have learned so much more about acne as a disease and the lifestyle factors are increasingly more obvious that they play a role in disease severity managing your stress is really important when you are stressed out that raises cortisol levels which influence oiliness and skin cell stickiness as well so coping with stress and finding out ways to cope with stress and mitigating your stress is actually really important in your journey to improving your hormonal acne or any type of acne getting good sleep is imperative seven to nine hours is really what adults need to have their skin properly heal and for good immune health i mean it just very very important also when you hormones they get kicked up that further aggravates acne and then your diet we have learned uh over the past few years that diet really does as it turns out play a major role in the severity of acne or at least it seems to specifically diets that are high glycemic diets uh you know diets that are center around processed sugary foods um and you know don and vegetables and for some people it there is definitely a connection between dairy and acne specifically milk consumption and acne so really you know reducing the burden of inflammatory foods in your diet favoring fruits vegetables whole food things that aren and are you know have a lower glycemic burden if you will can definitely help i have a video all about acne and diet and i have a video about sugars and skin i want you guys to check that out to inform yourself about the types of foods that really can actually benefit your skin and kind of help in your acne journey now eating this way isn but it can help in reducing total body inflammation helping you with blood sugar control and helping with the acne long term exercise is also super important because exercise helps uh in reducing total body inflammation that contributes to acne and it also helps us handle sugars better in terms of our our blood sugar and response to that and insulin hormones that affect the oil gland as well and um exercise also releases stress and stress again will worsen acne so it you know there are multiple benefits of exercise so getting in some exercise daily is also really important practicing gentle skin care not using her scrubs overly drying cleansers it you are going to be on birth control pills for the rest of your life regardless of what your plans are for for pregnancy down the road you may want to want to conceive at some point so obviously you uh you know or you may who knows decide that you don control pills anymore people you know they have mixed feelings about taking them people don there is a good chance that you will not be on it forever do you have to worry about your acne flaring when when you stop yes that is a potential problem that you will encounter when you stop but having other treatments on board topicals and addressing the lifestyle factors they really reduce the risk that this is going to happen for you when you stop last but not least definitely see a board-certified dermatologist you guys i know i emphasize that all the time but now more than ever you know if you have been a bit you know feeling a little bit disenfranchised with dermatology for your acne definitely give it a second thought because we now for the first time have more acne medications at our disposal than we have ever had before newer treatments specifically uh treatments that can help with hormonal acne for a while now we dapsone aka axone which is proving itself to be beneficial for women with hormonal acne we also of course have another hormonal medication we for years and used to treat acne spironolactone that likewise can help by addressing the hormonal fluctuations that contribute to acne but now we armamentarium a new topical i became available this year it is a topical medication called classicaterone uh aka winleby that um actually is a topical anti-androgen so instead of having to take a birth control pill or a hormonal pill this addresses that hormonal issue just within the skin so you don the systemic side effects it very very new medication so i don that it but that another reason to revisit the dermatologist to see if you might be a candidate for this there minocycline as you guys know from my videos is an oral antibiotic we don antibiotics for a prolonged period of time there are risks but this is nice and that you know you don systemically it anti-inflammatory properties and might be a good option for you and we retinoids at our disposal these days too we have altrina lotion and we have a cleaf i much less irritating or seeming to be much less irritating than older older retinoids that we typically prescribe for for acne so definitely see a board-certified dermatologist even if you did find that the treatments were helpful we do have newer treatments on the horizon these days that you know might make a difference especially in the case of hormonal acne for a lot of people contraceptive pills are simply not an option because they don against their uh culture or religion for having birth control pills there definitely can help the hormonal acne beyond birth control pills um so you know don hormonal acne this is your only option but it can definitely help it cure and it first-line treatment we wouldn prescribe anybody we wouldn pills i hope this video was helpful to you guys if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it

How to GET RID OF NECK ACNE| Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi2QizkPY6I	Dr Day	well hey guys in today to be talking about how to get rid of acne on your neck if you welcome my name is andrea i certified dermatologist i would love it if you would subscribe to my youtube channel and hit the thumbs up it really helps my video out a lot make sure you stay tuned to the end of the video because i sharing with you some of the best skin care products for getting rid of acne on your neck acne on the neck is really common it harder to cover up and it gets in the way of everyday life things like shaving you know you have to navigate that and with your clothing it can cause a lot of irritation what causes acne on the neck at the root of it it is related to basically overproduction of oil and the oil glands that clog up the pores and cause bumps painful cysts nodules the other factor that goes into play is irritation around the hair follicle this can come from removing hair through shaving or plucking causes a lot of follicle irritation that drives inflammation in the skin and acne flares frictional forces on the skin of the neck are contributing factor like from rough fabrics using too many products and not washing them off properly whether that be makeup especially or you know a lot of heavy serums and different skin care products that aren up happening is that those products they mix with your sweat like when you work out and the combination of the sweat and the broken down skin care or cosmetic products can really cause a lot of irritation around the pore one potential culprit may be your hair care products especially if you me and you have long hair maybe you wear it down a lot if you use products like pomades mousses gels these can transfer to the skin of the neck and aggravate the pores and cause flares of acne when it comes to cleansing sometimes we forget about our neck and improper cleansing and not removing cosmetics can contribute of course stress plays a major role stress increases cortisol which is stress hormone and that downstream downstream effects of that lead to more oil production in the skin and worsening acne unfortunately there is not a pill or a cream for stress and the other thing that plays a role that people often neglect to consider in their skin is their diet certain foods drive a lot of inflammation in the body and elevate what insulin-like growth factor and that can contribute to acne flares i have a video about how sugar affects the skin and i talk about the types of foods that might be impacting your skin in that video so i will link that down below in the description box but diet definitely plays a role in any type of skin issue actually but in particular acne when it comes to treating acne on the neck you have to understand that the skin of the neck is actually pretty delicate it thinner than the skin of the face and even though you condition that has to do with too much oil production remember there aren there are on the face why is this important for you to understand well products that you use to treat acne on your face or like on your back areas where you have thicker skin may be too irritating and too drying for the thin delicate skin of the neck so be very mindful about that going in you may have to use products for acne on your neck less frequently so that you don excessive irritation what you want to look for when it comes to products to treat your acne are the acne fighting ingredients benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid these are some of the best over-the-counter treatments for acne not only on the face but on the body including the neck there are a variety of washes gels levon products these products will help in reducing inflammation in the skin and they also help in reducing that little acne causing bacteria cutie bacterium acnes who likewise plays a role in getting acne breakouts on the neck what about retinoids i always talk about the wonders of retinoids for acne control can they be used on the neck that is a situation where you definitely want to be really really conservative but a retinoid that you can buy over the counter here in the states is a dappling i typically tell people to you know be very careful with this and in general i say avoid it on the neck but in some cases when you have hormonal breakouts consistently on your neck using a tiny amount of adaptiline a few times a week like once or twice a week to the neck can potentially help in reducing those breakouts for you and so long as you excessively irritated from it you don irritating then it and it may help but be very mindful that it could cause too much irritation there so if you start developing excessive irritation on the neck from a retinoid like adaptiline which is what you can buy over the counter then back off on it another great ingredient to incorporate into treatment yourself is sulfur sulfur is an ingredient that very gentle sulfur helps to calm down inflammation and it also kind of helps dry up some of the excess oiliness when it comes to getting rid of acne on the neck as i said these active acne ingredients they are very drying so do not fear the use of a moisturizer moisturizers are a really important piece of an acne skin care routine regardless of the body size they help with the skin barrier so that it doesn lose too much water and make you more prone to irritation and dryness sunscreen a lot of people with acne are really fearful that sunscreens will break them out but sunscreen is super important because it helps protect you from the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation from the sun that not only age your neck but certainly can worsen your acne because they are those uv rays are inflammatory when it comes to your laundry you want to be very critical of the detergent that you are using choose detergents laundry detergents that are free of fragrance and dyes these are ingredients that frequently can cause skin irritation so that going on along your neckline when you coping with neck acne in the description box i will list down below some wonderful laundry detergents that are free of fragrance and dyes washing your bed linens frequently sheets pillowcases comforters because they trap your body oils they trap dead skin cells harbor bacteria and that actually can definitely end up contributing to worsening acne on any body site location especially the neck consider laser hair removal why well laser hair removal removes the need to remove the hair as frequently and shaving plucking waxing that all can drive a lot of irritation around the hair follicle that aggravates acne you neck for ingrown hairs and ingrown hairs further worsen the acne landscape and they deal with and so laser hair removal is a way to to kind of treat that cure that and get rid of that that issue i know it consider it if you are coping with a lot of painful acne on the neck seriously consider seeing a board-certified dermatologist and having laser hair removal it can make a huge difference for your neck acne at home led devices for acne are useful in your armamentarium of options for dealing with the neck acne because they combine blue light which reduces the burden of that little bacteria cutie bacterium acnes that causes acne and they also have red light in them which reduces inflammation they going to cure the acne overnight but they certainly can help especially if you use them consistently um they can certainly help i am a fan of the light sim wand uh for the body it it like on your neck your chest your back and of course for the face they make a variety of masks but the light sim is going to be you know a good option for your neck so i will list that down below in the description box it not inexpensive so you know try many of these other more affordable things first before committing to something like that the key with investing in any device as a side note is if you don do it and you you know you you think very critically about yourself if you it as directed then you know definitely consider it but if you like i don i mean be really be realistic are you going to stick with it if not don don to see results you drawer somewhere you may use them episodically and that not going to be enough so if you can do it as directed and commit to it you know because of your schedule or you know maybe just would rather do other things with your time then do not invest in devices see a board-certified dermatologist you know there are a variety of prescription treatments that really can help hormonal acne and neck acne breakouts there are things like spironolactone for women i have a video explaining spironolactone but that really can make a huge difference in hormonal acne breakouts there hormonal acne that could be used in both men and women uh called classical terrain uh this is very very new so you know i don your hopes up too much i don haven since it is so new but that is a medication that showing promise for treatment of hormonal the hormonal component of acne and can be used in both men and women as opposed to spironolactone the pill can only be used in women and we also have a new topical medication called minocycline foam that for the treatment of acne and unlike taking minocycline by mouth an antibiotic you side effects of gi upset of stomach upset and all the other side effects that can come with minocycline i have a video on minocycline too so check that out if you prescribed it and you it uh but we now have it in a foam version for acne so that might be an option for you adapt zone i about topical dapstone it wonderful prescription medication that helps hormonal acne quite a bit and then last but not least we have a new topical retinoid called triferatine goes by the brand name act leaf i have a video on it i know i a lot of videos here but i do have videos on all of these specific medications um ack leaf anyways is a new retinoid that that is fda approved actually for truncal acne in contrast to the other retinoids on the market this one is seems to be far less irritating because it receptor in the skin than the other one so it comes it seems to come with less risk of irritation and so that might actually be an option for you too that your derm could prescribe but those those are all going to be by prescription only you can over the counter and they may not be right for you so see a board certified dermatologist to find out if those are going to be a good fit for you all right you made it this far what products are good for acne on the neck i mentioned sunscreen of course is very important for protecting the skin of the neck one product i really like for the body including the neck because it is so fast absorbing is the la roche-posay on thilos melton sunscreen milk this is a chemical sunscreen so you cast with this although it is a little shiny but i like this it absorbs really quickly it doesn residue it doesn and it stays on the skin really well make sure though before you put this on that you go ahead and put your shirt on first because if you put this on and then you put your shirt on over you gonna remove some of the sunscreen so this is a really good sunscreen that you can use actually anywhere face body and i find that people with acne prone skin tend to get along pretty well with us sunscreen however is a journey you know what works for some people is not gonna work for everybody so if this doesn give up on finding a sunscreen that you like but this one tends to go over pretty well for those with acne prone skin i mentioned that cleansing is really important sometimes though when you workout you get really sweaty you may not always have the opportunity to get into the shower right away to wash the sweat off of your skin what can you do in the meantime a product i highly recommend considering um i videos before but it antimicrobial hypochlorous acid spray um you can get this on amazon if they out of the facial cleanser one they have a variety of others it basically all they products so you don the one that says facial cleanser but anyways this is a really good product because it helps reduce the burden of bacteria on the skin they break down sweat cause a lot of irritation it and you can just spray it on the skin you don stay on the skin it you can spray this on your face it safe to even use around your eyes and of course in this case you to be using on your neck and you can use it on the body it in cutting down on body odor i really like this product a lot and it in your gym bag if you work out and get very sweaty or you live somewhere that super humid you be bathing non-stop this is helpful to just spritz on throughout the day i mentioned salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide as good treatment options they can be drying but so be careful but a product that you can use to the neck uh conservatively you know maybe every other day as tolerated is the laroche posse eff eclair duo now what i like about this is it combines the benzoyl peroxide and it combines it with a modified version of salicylic acid that is much less irritating it lha and that you know is a proprietary compound by l in the lorish pose products but this is really good you can use it on the neck just be careful you know if you find it too drying or too irritating back down on frequency it can still be effective using it less frequently you just have to be consistent so this is a great one to consider if you deal with really painful neck acne i also mentioned sulfur and this product i marketed for people with rosacea but you you know it it for people with rosacea but it it on the neck allow it to absorb fully and dry you can use it up to twice a day if you find it too drying you know back down on the frequency but it helps reduce the inflammation and irritation that drive acne further so this is a good one to use as well something that can be helpful for pimples on the neck is to protect them with one of these uh hydrocolloid patches now these you know you see all over instagram people put them on and you know they act like they just like soak up the pimple or whatever you know don that outcome but what they do is they kind of help protect the pimple from friction irritation and that really helpful on the neck where you got like your neck you know your collar and things rubbing on the side of the neck to put one of these on if you like a pimple that especially if it open oozy this can help absorb the excess oiliness and protect it from those frictional forces it also offers a little bit of uv protection from uh you know for the healing pimple i fan of these by mighty patch just because they adhere really well they also make them in a larger rectangular size it the neck and they you know they than some of the others on the market they down below as well as everything else here and i also mentioned the importance of moisturizing a moisturizer that you should definitely consider if you think it wanted to give it a shout out here something that you know you might want to consider for your neck is the aveeno oat gel moisturizer from their new calm newer calm and restore line this is perfect it absorbs very quickly and isn and what i like about it too is it provides a nice lubricating surface on the sk you know lubricates the skin to reduce those frictional forces that can drive irritation into the skin those are my recommendations for products i will list all this down below in the description box you guys um i know acne on the neck is super frustrating to deal with i hope this video was helpful to you if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen and subscribe i guys tomorrow bye [Music]

Doxycycline for ACNE| Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdmfvtKuJuQ	Dr Day	well hey guys in today to be talking about doxycycline for acne i of requests to talk about doxycycline because it medication that we commonly use to treat acne what is doxycycline it family of antibiotics called tetracyclines it a variety of different bacterial diseases and acne and it works for acne by doing a few things acne is a disease of a few different factors first of all you have bacteria in the pore called cutie bacterium acnes you also have a lot of oiliness that directly feeds that bacteria and you have inflammation doxycycline and antibiotic works to treat acne by lowering the amount of cutie bacterium acnes and suppressing the levels of inflammation doxycycline works by reducing the recruitment of inflammatory cells and inflammatory mediators to the skin doxycycline is not going to be a treatment for all types of acne we only use doxycycline or any antibiotic to treat acne when it is moderate to severe what does that mean well it see a lot of redness patient has discomfort a lot of cysts those types of lesions if untreated will go on to form scars so antibiotics are great because they calm down that inflammation and reduce the bacteria leading to clearance of those inflammatory acne lesions and preventing scarring however antibiotics are not appropriate for acne that is mild not inflammatory if you have acne that is mostly blackheads whiteheads the medical term for those are open and closed comedones antibiotics are not appropriate for that um so we we don everyone only right for certain patients now doxycycline is not the only antibiotic that we use to treat acne we also use another antibiotic in the tetracycline class called minocycline and if you can do a separate video on minocycline for acne but doxycycline is one that we use and it is very effective but it understand that it is not a long-term treatment because it antibiotic there are risks associated with using it namely bacterial resistance and what i mean by that is that cutie bacterium acne is a little bacteria on your skin it can become resistant to it also other bacteria on your skin and your gut can develop resistance to that antibiotics we don indefinitely we try and restrict use of oral antibiotics for no more than three to four months at a time and so you should be aware of that the reason we use it is to clear up the inflammatory stuff that you have more quickly to prevent scarring but the goal is that other topicals which take a long time to start working can be started maybe at the same time and those are going to take over and be what control the acne long term because doxycycline works to reduce both the bacteria on the skin as well as inflammation it works pretty fast and pretty effectively to reduce those inflammatory painful acne lesions and then subsequently prevent scarring doxycycline is available by prescription only so you need to go to your dermatologist and discuss if this is right for your acne if you have the right type of acne that would be amenable to to treatment with doxycycline and worth it and the dosage varies a little bit everybody prescribes kind of a different dose for different patients anywhere from 50 to 100 milligrams either once a day or twice a day and the duration is usually six to eight weeks but again it may extend out to three to four months because there is a risk of bacterial resistance with using oral antibiotics i always instruct my patients to use a topical medication or over-the-counter product that has benzoyl peroxide in it while they doxycycline or any other oral antibiotic benzoyl peroxide is antibacterial and anti-inflammatory and using it in conjunction with oral antibiotics reduces the risk of bacterial resistance unfortunately benzoyl peroxide can be very drying and irritating but even at low percentage strengths 2.5 for example you can get reduction in bacteria reduction and inflammation and you can get reduction in the risk of bacterial resistance to the oral antibiotics and you can get that in a wash form so a wash form at a lower percentage strength tends to be less irritating than those higher percentage strengths that you leave on the skin so that many dermatologists do as well what are the side effects of doxycycline probably the most common side effect is nausea i always tell patients to make sure that they take the medication with a full glass of water some people who are really sensitive you know maybe have a really sensitive stomach they may even have vomiting and the other major gastrointestinal risk with doxycycline is that it can cause a pretty bad heartburn actually something called pill esophagitis basically the pill can be very very irritating to the lining of your esophagus so i always advise patients to make sure that they take the medication and remain upright for at least 30 minutes but ideally an hour you don then lie down because the pill can can you know reflux and get stuck in your esophagus and cause a really really really bad heartburn so you always want to make sure that you drink it you take it with a full glass of water and remain upright beyond the gastrointestinal side effects nausea rarely vomiting and then the risk of esophagitis the other risk with uh doxycycline is that it more sensitive to the sun so you have to be very very careful to protect your skin from the sun wearing sunscreen and not staying out too long wearing hats etc you on doxycycline and you should be protecting your skin from the sun anyway but it you antibiotics can disrupt our natural microbiome or natural gut flora we can become more disposed to yeast infections as a result so uh vaginal yeast infections or thrush are are more likely when you antibiotics and then lastly doxycycline is not safe in pregnancy or breastfeeding so it situations either if you have been prescribed doxycycline you know it is very safe and effective for the treatment of acne we using it for decades and side effects are very rare actually the most common being the nausea but also remember that doxycycline is not going to cure your acne or be a long-term solution it there and clean up those inflammatory lesions that could go on to scar and there medication that you likely will be on more long term that will control the acne as with anything in the skin it can take a little bit of time for the doxycycline to start working so don one pill and you know magically have clear skin the day the next day can take a few weeks but generally speaking oral antibiotics work very quickly to reduce the redness the painful cystic acne and to clear clear everything up but remember this is not a long-term solution for your acne it only meant to clear up those existing inflammatory lesions that would otherwise go on to form scars it prevent scarring in the meantime you be started on something else that is going to be used long term to control the acne and will be safer without the risks of bacterial resistance so that about doxycycline for the treatment of moderate to severe acne and uh it stay tuned i will be doing another video on minocycline a similar antibiotic for the treatment of acne but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen and subscribe i guys tomorrow bye [Music] you	Success
Natural Eczema Relief That Actually Works Fast	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEcPpjO7ivg	Dr Day	Today we simple, coste effective atome natural remedy for facial eczem. I know what you one of those AI doppelgangers? Where Dr. Dre? Where natural remedies? Hey, if you go searching on my channel, you find videos of me talking about effective at home natural remedies, like those that can be used for toenail fungus. I came across this recently and I was like, on this. actually asking over the years about doing this very thing and that is what happens when you brew tea and put it on your face. Well, if you have facial eczema, turns out it might help. A study in the Journal of Dermatologic Therapy suggests that topical black tea compresses might just be a gamecher for flare-ups of facial dermatitis, facial eczema, and itch. The health benefits of tea, that have known for quite some time that tea is loaded with various beneficial compounds that are associated with various health benefits. Black tea, aside from water, is one of the most widely consumed beverages worldwide. It has these compounds known as tannins which have a natural astringent property that can soothe and minimize redness. Black tea also contains various polyphenols, antioxidants, anti-inflammatory compounds such as epigalocaticanan galate, theoplavins, theorubagens, and the amino acid eltheanine. Oh, and did I mention one of my favorite compounds in a beverage? Topical caffeine alone is compelling for an anti-inflammatory, anti- redness effect. I topical caffeine for hair growth. And topical caffeine may even be helpful for reducing under eye puffiness and improving the appearance of the under eye area. A lot going on in tea. So German researchers actually have been recommending black tea compresses to their patients with eczemas for I guess a while now. And they finally decided, hey, we that this works. So they showed a significant reduction in eczema severity and itch with black tea compresses. The decrease in eczema severity was rapid in onset and pretty dramatic. The eczema severity scores dropped from 12 to 31% within their original value in just the first 3 days of the study. And there was a significant decrease in itch, which if you have attopic dermatitis, facial eczema, you know, got to scratch my face as I say this. Itch is debilitating. It is the worst aspect of any skin condition. If you have itch, it just so debilitating. I I can emphasize that enough. So, this study took 22 patients, 18 of which had attopic dermatitis and the other four had contact dermatitis, another type of eczema. Remember, eczema is just an umbrella term for a couple of different skin conditions. They took a non-flavored black tea and used it to prep compresses, applied them to the skin for 20 minutes. Then after they applied them to the skin, they put a moisturizer on a a German cold cream that contained what did it have in it? Peanut oil, water, subtle palmitate, and yellow wax. This was repeated five times a day for 6 days. So kind of intense. All right, that that intense, but they got they got improvement in the skin. Now each day of the treatment, they brewed a fresh batch of tea infusion to be used. And they use that fresh batch for making the compresses for each of the five treatments for that day. And then the next day, they would brew a fresh batch. So in other words, don batch and leave it in the refrigerator and use the same thing all week because we don potential beneficial compounds in tea are when kept in the refrigerator that long, ideally fresh. And don don protocol on how to do this according to the study. Debbie Downer here, I to point out several limitations. First of all, it shows that it provided some benefit to these patients. The major issue with this study is that there There because essentially what they are doing is a wet dressing followed by a moisturizer. Wet dressings are known to reduce epidermal inflammation. and moisturizers are a mainstay for getting control and managing eczemas on the face as well as the rest of the body. So, are these just patients who are in a research setting and are now more intensively caring for their skin in a way that aligns with eczema management or is it actually the black tea? It great to do a controlled study where you at least had um a water control. Like is is the black tea in the in the compress doing anything above and beyond what just plain water would do? The other possible concern is black tea is actually pretty high in nickel. So if you are nickel sensitive, which many people, especially those with eczema, are this may not be right for you. That being said, in this particular study, five of the uh patients were nickel sensitive and had no issue doing this. So, the researchers assume that well, the nickel must be low enough in the final brewed batch. It and not enough to aggravate the skin. But just be aware of that black tea can have quite a bit of nickel in it. Overall though, this was very well tolerated. No adverse effects from doing this. If you remember that this alone, if you have a facial eczema, is not likely to be enough. It might be, I guess, but I wouldn dermatologist has prescribed and decide, oh, I while. It might be prudent to do this along with that, you know. Um, so talk to them first because it, depending on what you have going on, this alone may be just supportive care and not actually what you need. Here doing this. Obtain unflavored, it has to be unflavored black tea. So, don getting the peach black tea. Just get unflavored black tea in the bags. Brew one tea bag in one cup of boiling water for 10 minutes. Then, you either drink the tea or dispose of it. You the same tea bag using again one cup of boiling water for 10 minutes. Then, you You and you refrigerator and let it cool. Then you cloth, or what I like to do in these cases is if you go on Amazon, they sell these little singleuse sheet masks that you could use for your own DIY mask. You can get those little masks and soak them in the tea and put them on. It cuz they have the holes for the eyes. So, that little bit, you know, extra, but that what I would do if I were going to be doing these. Then you the compress and leave it on for 20 minutes. After you take it off, you going to apply a moisturizer. The moisturizer is a key part of this because it that hydration and reduce facial dryness. You four to five times a day for 6 days. That done in the study. That protocol. So, I would suggest following what they did. And my understanding is this is something that a lot of German dermatologists are already doing before the study even came out. So that must be what they do. Now, if you don go through all the rigor of boiling the tea, you might just try doing this with water because the concept of wet wrap therapy soaking the skin and applying a moisturizer can be super helpful for attopic dermatitis, eczema, because the soak gets the stratum corneium really hydrated with water and then the moisturizer really helps to essentially lock in hydration. And that actually a really common way to go about addressing attopic dermatitis is wet wrap therapy. And that is essentially what is being done here. Um whether or not, like I said, the tea is making a huge difference. It if you don going to be of benefit to you? It might. I mean, it you find that it to perhaps some of the polyphenolic compounds, the caffeine, all of those things. May maybe it does offer something of benefit. Topical caffeine has actually been shown in some small lab-based mostly studies to reduce overall sun damage. So, it that you get those benefits there. Now, the cosmetic chemists are going, right. Yeah, right. There those compounds are going to be just getting in the skin stable enough. It going to be so dilute by the time you put it on there. It know, you might as well do water. They they might say that. So, do you need the black tea? Do you not? More research is needed. Definitely, we need larger studies to say for sure how well this this works. But at any rate, as dermatologists, we know that wet wrap therapy for eczema can be really beneficial. That being done here. The tea might add a little something extra, though. The tea might add a little something extra. We need a good placebo control trial to say for sure. Anyways guys, don never talk about natural home remedies cuz I do. I do. I do. I do. Let me know in the comments if you on your face. Now, if you don brewing black tea. What else is there that is tea that is already prepared that I can put on my skin? Oh, don worry. Don little head about a thing. There is a ton of skin care out there that utilizes tea. And as a matter of fact, Pian Kong Ule, a Korean brand I love, has a black tea line and a black tea facial moisturizer that is amazing. I hope it still being made. I reviewed it a couple of years ago. Um, it moisturizing. So, on the endsite, I put my review of that video, but that would be an option. you could get those benefits potentially a black tea and a a formulation that maybe gives you a little bit better chance of reaping the benefits of those but without having to go through the rigomearroll of making the tea and sitting there for 20 minutes five times a day. Now, if you are in the midst of a facial eczema flare up, then the story is a little different. You got to be a lot more conservative with what types of moisturizers you choose, especially in the midst of a flare up because they can irritate the skin. That one great option for you. But if you allergic to something in that, then it be a bad option for you. But for people out there who benefits of black tea, yeah, you could do this or you could just buy a cream with black tea in it and it might offer you the same benefit with less hassle. More money, but less hassle. So, weigh your options. But, um, I video on the end slate if you want more details about it. See what it looks like, how it performs. It cream. Anyways, guys, I hope this video was informative. If you liked it, give it a thumbs up, share it with your friends, and as always, don sunscreen and subscribe. I you guys tomorrow. Bye.

How To Heal Itchy Bump Disease (Grover's Disease)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAWVHmr64Wo	Dr Day	picture this you sudden you get these itchy bumps on your chest your back your upper arms guess what it into the Right video we talking about itchy red bump disease otherwise known as Grover transient acanthotic dermatosis this is a skin condition that typically affects white men over the age of 50 who have had a lot of sun exposure throughout their lifetime usually not very common in women or people who have skin color or young children adolescence why the heck does this happen well you get these crops out of nowhere often on the chest the upper back and many times the upper arms as well localize over the hair follicle and you may think looking at them from a distance if you watch some of my videos oh got it got it I got it Grandpa over here has fungal acne otherwise known as ppum foliculitis no no no no no cuz again not every bump one blister whatever that pops up on the skin is the same thing you have a differential I look like malesia foliculitis pterosin foliculitis AKA fungal acne it it monomorphic right look the same but but if you take a biopsy Brewing below the surface is not overgrowth of malesia with an inflammatory response to the follicle but rather a Canalis kind of this breaking down if you will of the follicle wall and it because it comes and lasts usually a couple of weeks and then often times clears up only to resurface again at a later date while this tends to happen in men who have gotten a lot of sun exposure throughout their lifetime it is frequently triggered again the recurrences that is by sun exposure maybe it gets presented in the follicle and your immune system is like oh my gosh let destroy this and make these little itch bumps very very uncomfortable these little itchy bumps are also triggered by sweat and occlusion kind of similar to another thing that you might have been thinking about you might have been thinking about is this heat rash if you were thinking that way congratulations you are on the path to basically being a dermatologist cuz you are building a differential diagnosis here of itchy bumps that are folicular Centric on the trunk and yeah it is kind of similar in appearance and history of what triggered it heat sweat occlusion as heat rash but in contrast to heat rash this isn caused by plugging up of the sweat gland but rather again this kind of inflammatory response that basically causes the follicle kind of get a little dilapidated itchy red bumps disease also can be triggered by a high fever like right now it season we have seen in a long time A lot of people are getting sick high fever can trigger this kind of similar to heat rash as well just being sick in general if you happen to be laid up in bed for a while under the covers bundled up maybe you were in the hospital lying on your back for a long time that occlusion of being in bed all the time and having covers and not great air circulation over the surface of the skin can bring this out sometimes itchy red bump disease is brought out by having an underlying cancer as well speaking of which there are certain Cancer Treatments that can bring this out and we talked about fever and being sick there is an itchy bump variant of Grovers if you will that is characteristically seen in the high fever of having Co um so that something that a lot of people might observe in themselves if they get sick with Co now the itchy red bumps they all kind of look pretty similar they might kind of get a little blistery and you might even get a little crusty flaky stuff on top especially like right before they clear up and go away how do you get rid of this is there anything that can be done to cure itchy bump disease unfortunately not like this is one of those dermatologic conditions that dermatologists struggle to really help their patients get it under control and resolve and hopefully go away a lot of it for example making sure you always wear loose fitting breathable clothing breathable Fabrics that you keep the skin cool you allow for good air circulation over the skin surface you don getting a lot of sun exposure because again that might trigger this when you situation we of sweat a lot of heat you need to really be mindful of keeping yourself Cool sweat is intended to cool the body as it evaporates it lowers temperature and that you doesn sweat well you don evaporative cooling effect guess what your body tries to make more sweat in order to compensate for that and that compensatory mechanism of put putting out a lot of sweat having it uded really irritates the skin sweat that is irritating to the skin including down in the follicle so that is kind of a scenario where you might expect to get a flare up if you don precautions to keep yourself cool and allow for good air circulation over the surface of the skin cool compresses not only can alleviate the itch by distracting the little itch singling nerves but also can help keep the skin cool so that you don up last as long Also I suggest getting yourself a lightweight hydrating moisturiz lotion putting it in the refrigerator and applying it to this rash chilled the cold temperature game Cher plus the moisturizer just kind of helps to soothe the skin look for moisturizers that have the ingredient promox promox is an anesthetic that can be very helpful for itch also there are anti-itch lotions out there that have Menthol and Menthol has a nice cooling effect as well as a side note if you watching this video and you entirely sure what it is you have going on but you plan to see your doctor right right this is not a video intended to replace medical advice or as a substitute for the advice of your treating healthc care provider but you you playlist on itchy skin there content in there that can really help you out because itchy skin is a nightmare all right it you concept of how debilitating it can be so if your partner husband spouse whatever is dealing with this in silence do know that they are really uncomfortable and it likely is disrupting their Sleep Quality even if they appear to be asleep that constant arousal of scratching Behavior with this itchy bump disease is compromising the quality of their sleep which can jeopardize their health overall so it this figured out now if you see a dermatologist what might they do to get rid of it it can undergo phototherapy which involves select wavelengths of ultraviolet radiation to the skin to calm down the inflammation silence the itch and sort of toughen up the skin so to speak now ultraviolet radiation is what comes from the Sun and damages the skin and can actually trigger this so it may seem like what is she even talking about phototherapy but it can be helpful in this case because it it calculated dose and select wavelength is utilized it actually can be quite helpful but phototherapy is a bit involved unless your dermatologist is able to get you a unit at home but it does involve a time commitment there also topical steroids to calm down the inflammation that is driving the itch in addition to topical steroids your dermatologist might use cryotherapy that liquid nitrogen freezing spray to just freeze these bumps just destroy the cells that are breaking down and silence the itch but it do cryotherapy super extensively all over the chest or the back I suggest getting yourself a fan anytime you feel like you that fan and cool the surface of the skin definitely can be a GameChanger your dermatologist might put steroid into a syringe and inject it directly into the bump trium calone is an example of one such medication combine that with a numbing medication lidocaine that can really just soothe things although it is a temporary fix but it might be enough to get you over the hump of clearing up a flare and then when you implement the habits that I suggest keeping the skin cool avoiding exacerbating factors well that can really make a huge difference my other lifestyle tip is to be really conscientious of your alcoholic beverage consumption alcoholic beverage consumption in excess too much wine too much beer too many cocktails it gets in the way of effective body cooling mechanisms making you at greater risk for overheating especially in your older years we don environment as efficiently as we once did making us at greater risk for overheating and this is one such manifestation of problems that can arise as a result talked about this in other videos before but once you get up there in years over the age of 50 because the body is not as like super efficient at cooling itself regulating temperature you are at greater risk for heat related illnesses as a side note I have a whole video all about heat stroke and sun poisoning you want to check that out but uh just keep that in mind you know you don skin cool as efficiently you risk for overheating and you risk for not realizing that that is happening because your body just doesn respond in the same way alcohol on top of that really really exacerbates the problem further due to the issues that excessive alcohol consumption can have on our body drinking alcohol in excess is another risk factor for heat related issues skin issues heat rash so be really mindful if you recommend for example overindulging in alcoholic beverages out on a boat in the sun it definitely can aggravate it Grover dermatosis it condition because there and when you flare up it miserable hopefully these tips and tricks that I video help you out in preventing flare ups in the future if you are married to and a relationship with someone who has this problem hopefully this video provides you some insight into what they might be going through and how you can support them when they do have a flare up let me know in the comments have you ever heard of this I know some of you have because I make a video on Grover video on Grover weren discovering it whatever you do don self- diagnose don because again could be any other of the little monomorphic itchy red bumps that can happen on the chest and back okay um but I hope this one was helpful informative educational check out the itchy skin playlist because itch is a well put a be in front of it I like to keep this channel G-rated uh anyways guys I hope you enjoyed today going to put my

How To Heal Hand Eczema Fast	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OloLmBFGXQ	Dr Day	it of dis hydratic hand eczema in today video I rundown of tips and tricks that will help you get this under control clear it up so you can get back to regularly scheduled programming of your life dis hydratic hand eczema is a chronic condition there comes and goes understanding your triggers is key for managing symptoms preventing flareups and controlling situations that could lead to a flare up now dis hydratic hand eczema often starts with these firm deep-seated hard little water blisters look like tapioca beads on the sides of the fingers especially they usually last about 3 weeks they rupture open and ooze this clear fluid and once that happens the itch seems to go berserk very very very uncomfortable while the water blisters are a common feature not everyone with hand eczema with dis hydratic hand eczema experiences the water blister so if you still deal with flareups of an itchy hand rash you might still have dis hydratic hand eczema after that weepy Oozy phase then the skin becomes very dry and Flaky if you have a deeper skin tone the skin can heal with dark discoloration if you continue to scratch because let not to if you you know it calling from deep within your soul and this scratch is the most pleasurable experience but as you continue to scratch that hand eczema it becomes dark discolored thickened leathery in appearance a lot of people who have dis hydratic hand eczema will eventually go on to have problems with the fingernails of the affected hand most people it both hands but a lot of times it might just be one hand the nail folds become inflamed as it relates to the hand eczema flare ups and that can compromise nail plate growth you can get these little Pits on the nail and you can get ridges this video is about hand eczema but this condition can also happen on the feet like I said understanding your triggers are key for a lot of people the trigger is exposure to or contact with Metals especially nickel or Cobalt and these metals are in a lot of things jewelry cell phones things that you touch and handle for your occupation and work but also nickel is abundant in foods and some people are so exquisitly sensitive to Nickel that they have to go on a low nickel diet to try and get some control over their symptoms hand eczema can also be triggered by contact with your personal care products if you are sensitive or allergic to an ingredient in a product like a certain preservative or fragrance that can aggravate the hand eczema probably one of the most common triggers though for dis hydratic hand eczema is actually sweat and of often times this comes along with warmer temperatures for a lot of people their dis hydratic hand eczema has to do with their occupation for example people who work in healthcare and frequently have to wash their hands a lot as part of their job and wear gloves they frequently exposed to that rewetting from handwashing water on the skin plus cleanser residue can end up being very disruptive to the Integrity of Your Skin Barrier then you put on gloves moisture trapped up under the glove can generate a lot of friction and that can aggate ate your dis hydratic hand eczema another group that is especially at risk are hairdressers they have their hands in a lot of stuff that can be harmful and irritating to the Skin Barrier mechanics cement workers people who work with Metals again common trigger so it might be related to your occupation for a lot of people smoking is a trigger now I mentioned contact with personal care products like your skin care your beauty products what have you but one category particular which kind of relates back to what I was talking about with hairdressers being an at risk group is actually shampoo shampoo can be a trigger because pour it into our hand and we use it to lather to our scalp so for a lot of people who deal with dis hydratic hand eczema they might benefit from having someone else shampoo their hair at least while they of a flare up but not everyone can do that one tip I suggest is to get yourself one of those shampoo brushes put the shampoo on the brush and use the brush to shampoo your hair that way you don hand and it it can really help you out in the long run just cuts down on that exposure to the surfactants in the shampoo which can aggravate hand eczema for some people then I want to talk about one other trigger that you may not be aware of and that is actually having um foot fungus a fungus fungal infection of your feet or your toenails some people their immune system is like very very particular about having that fungus on the skin and it reacts in a certain way that can actually lead to flare-ups of dis hydrosis in these cases treating the fungal infection is key to getting rid of the dis hydratic hand eczema not only have I treated patients with hand eczema but I also deal with it myself I have dis hydratic hand eczema and it a nu sense one of the main things you need to do and you may need the help of your dermatologist to do this is to figure out what your Trigger or triggers plural is or are is it a metal is it a particular allergen is it something you it sweat for me it is definitely sweat and I think to a certain extent nickel and jewelry can also be a trigger for me and if you think about it like I said sweat is another trigger you have the sweat plus the nickel together under occlusion under the watch pan it really does create an environment that will set off a flare of hand eczema so avoiding your triggers is key and that might involve wearing gloves in your occupation to protect the skin of your hands from exposure to irtin to things that set you off it may may include completely eliminating metal jewelry if you don eliminating metal jewelry if you like to lift weights consider wearing gloves to protect your hands from the metal of the weights if you work in an occupation that requires you to frequently wash your hands every time you wash your hands make sure make sure you rinse the cleanser residue off thoroughly and you completely dry the hands this isn of the reasons actually why frequent hand washing can set off a flare of dis hydratic hand eczema is that there water residue trapped on the skin that ends up being irritating and enhancing penetration of irritant plus people will then go on to put on gloves as part of their occupation like in health care you got water trapped up under a glove it can really be a recipe for kicking off a flare so make sure you dry your hands completely I always suggest taking off your rings whenever you your hands because water and cleanser residue will get trapped up under the ring and serve as a nidus for flaring up your hand eczema so after you completely draw your hands especially the spaces in between your fingers apply a moisturizer now I this can be a game Cher for preventing uh irritance from getting into the skin and from reducing water loss but admittedly it instead elect to use like a dimethicone based skin protectant that is what is in the Neutrogena Norwegian formula hand cream L Ro POS also makes a very similar hand cream uh this type of formula does limit penetration of irritants in the skin does help with retaining moisture in the skin but um is not as Grey greasy after all the blisters have kind of closed up healed up the Skin weepy or Oozy but now all of a sudden it does feel like brown paper stuck on your hand or something at that period at that point I just keep with that little petroleum jelly stick I just keep rubbing it on there and it really does help and it has helped cut down on flareups now let are in the midst of a flare up if you someone who gets those little water blisters on the sides of the fingers they look wet as they maybe it actually a scenario where as much as I advise using petroleum jelly I find in this particular setting during this period of time when it Oozy the petroleum jelly is actually not very helpful and as you it on there it seems as though the itch gets actually much worse and I think it might actually just have something to do with the petroleum jelly trapping whatever that irritating fluid is that coming out of the Skin So in that situation you actually might want to consider pursuing sort of the reverse type approach and rather than locking in hydration and moisturizing you might want to try ingredients products Pursuits that dry that up one product that I often recommend to dry up things that buros it that you buy in these little packets you reconstitute it in water you can soak your hand in that it it helps kind of dry up that fluid while also soothing the skin alternatively you can soak like some gauze in that and do a compress after you them make sure you dry the hands thoroughly like I said though sweat is a trigger for a lot of people things that work to reduce sweat can be tremendously helpful so whether that therapy like a medication known as oxybutinin which uh Works to reduce outflow of sweat that can be helpful iontophoresis a treatment where you put your hands in this um Basin and this current goes by and it sort of stuns the gland and can reduce sweat out output I hyperhydrosis that can really be helpful but it other thing if you see a dermatologist you might discuss with them Botox injections and if the dis hydratic hand ezema has gotten to a point where it is impacting your performance at work your ability to do your job your day-to-day um quality of life you might actually find that insurance in some cases even covers the Botox treatment and I say tox but really I just mean neurotoxin neurom modulator in general can cut down on sweat this is something that is recommended for patients who have flareups related to sweat is to use an anti-perspirant on the hands antiperspirants have aluminum salts which help to reduce the outflow of sweat so I use a product this is not sponsored I bought it myself called sweat Block it can be used on the hand also can be used on the feet and you put it on and let me tell tell you it really really can help quite a bit especially when you are right at the beginning stages of those blisters just starting to like ooze and weep it really can help cut down on that sweaty fluid that seems to aggravate the itch another strategy that can be helpful to both calm down the itch help limit penetration of irritants and also can help uh prevent you from scratching which intensifies the itch even though it feels really good it intensifies the itch and thickens the skin is to actually get hydrocolloid bandages um or patches and put them on especially put them on over the blisters it really can help because the hydrocol kind of absorbs some of that fluid like the larger ones I the sides of my fingers and it really can help now you don pimple patch Brands because that can be pretty expensive they do sell hydroc colid bandages that you can try using like on the sides of the fingers and that really can help quite a bit again limit penetration of irritants and allergens into the skin and help provide a barrier against your fingers when the hand gets really really itchy especially when it and put it on the hand quetes the itch down and you can go about your life now you may feel like you look a little weird but you know the desperation all right you know the desperation I suggest like a cotton glove that help reduce the chances that you get overheated under there you sweat and then that sweat aggravates it but that can really help speaking of cotton gloves um when you are not in the midst of the uzy weepy stage one thing that can be very helpful for keeping your barrier happy and preventing flare ups is to treat the hands at night with my favorite petroleum jelly but you could also use a dimethicone based skin protectant hand cream put it on and then cover with gloves that can really change the game for you as far as um getting that leathery skin to go away and helping with the barrier to prevent flare ups down the road now in addition to the tipss and tricks I in today be a tremendous asset in helping you to not only reduce flareups but to get you some relief when you are in the midst of a flare up for example intr lesional steroid injections as terrifying as that sounds oh my gosh can provide so much relief because it just silences that inflammatory infiltrate also there are of course topical steroid ointments that could be prescribed for a flare up to get it to silence to go away and for your skin to clear up that can be very helpful there are also a class of medications known as calcin neurin Inhibitors that can be applied to the skin very very helpful as well and then there are medications U there are a class of medications known as biologics a medication known as dupilumab which addresses a specific arm of the immune system that is abnormal AB arent in eczema flabs so that medication therapy that can really get you similar relief the other thing that can be very very useful for treating hand eczemas is something called Pua Pua utilizes UVA which yes I know I cautioning against UVA from the Sun is aging and raging and everything uh one of the reasons why it it suppresses the immune system but remember it you get a dangerous dose from the Sun but we can actually harness that UVA um and use it specific doses that we Monitor and measure to suppress the immune response to our favor to help clear diseases it you called sorin first which makes the skin uh more responsive to that UVA therapy and definitely clear it up another tip for you guys when you the flare up and all you want to do is scratch is to get yourself some ice wrap it up in a washcloth and put it on there that cold compress it can help distract that itch feels really good it soothing it helps to alleviate the itch it do want to try and do things to silence the itch so that you don because scratching traumatizes the barrier further so it basically opens up the floodgates for that hand eczema to be a lot more stubborn to persist longer and also you carry bacteria on your nails and things that can be introduced into the eczema and cause secondary skin infection known as impetigo which you don all right guys I really hope this video was helpful let me know in the comments if you hydratic hand EX if so I really hope this video gave you some tips and tricks to help get things under control if you enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don I [Music] a [Music]	Success
How To Stop Itchy Skin After Shower | Dermatologist Tips	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9odD5Um1eE	Dr Day	why is my skin so itchy when I get out of the shower in today going to find out itch is debilitating it can really mess up your quality of life an overall sleep wake cycle itch after a shower can be the result of a variety of different things one of the more common reasons is simply related to your showering habits taking long hot showers is disruptive to Skin outermost moisture barrier leading to more water loss from the skin and subsequent enhanced penetration of irritating things that will Trigger Itch hot water leads to dilation of blood vessels that for through the skin and endu so you get enhanced delivery of little mediators of itch now let it some of us like to take out our aggression on our Skin Barrier using a washcloth a loofah or maybe you even use a dry brush before you get into the shower to really scrub and buff the skin not only is this unnecessary but it really can aggravate the symptoms of itch by impairing the moisture barrier and leading to the release of histamine from mass cells that qu through the skin a common showering error is using way too much body wash or overusing your cleansing bar this can be unnecessary hard on the Skin Barrier and furthermore it can lead to well Left Behind residue especially trapped in skin folds that later breaks down the Skin Barrier and serves as a nidus for more widespread post shower itch when you get out of the shower if you really rub your skin dry with that towel you could be aggravating not only your Skin Barrier but the symptoms of itch because you are causing the release of histamine from mass cells take all of these bathing habits together with the fact that many of us myself included prefer to shower at night in fact I recommend showering at night to remove dirt oil pollutants from the skin surface that well actually could make you itchy to begin with but one of the things about our skin is it follows a circadian rhythm at night time as we sleep we have more water loss from the skin so we that with the fact that there blood flow to the skin delivering those little itch mediators all of these things together is one reason why you may be going to bed or really really itchy and like I said at the beginning of the video itch can really mess up your sleep cycle to a point that you not even aware of because you get these low-level arousals you kind of half wake up to scratch your skin it really can be messing up your sleep what you want to do when it comes to bathing is keep your showers short and stick to lukewarm to Cool Water never hot choose a mild body wash or soap ideally free of fragrance simply because fragrance is a common allergen but if it doesn skin then it sure importantly you much and also make sure you are rinsing it off thoroughly don cleanser behind in your skin folds it will mess up your barrier when you get out of the shower pat dry your skin with a towel of any visible water that way you moisture barrier then make sure you apply a moisturizer right away moisturizers help to reduce water loss and improve barrier function ultimately helping to cut down on sensation of itch if you live in a dry climate and your bedroom air is dry consider using a humidifier in the bedroom at night that will also help to reduce transepidermal water loss keeping your skin hydrated and ultimately reducing the symptoms of itch outside of bathing practices though there are a few medical conditions that can lead to to itchy skin related to showering and one that you may have heard of is called aquagenic parius partis is just the medical term for itch and aquagenic as it sounds means caused by water and aquagenic partis can lead to symptoms of itch within seconds of contact with not just shower water but also bath water rain water ocean water lakes pool water your own tears and your own sweat it men but anyone can get it often manifests for the first time around the age of 40 but again anybody any age anytime can develop aquagenic partis it really debilitating because we need to bathe we need to come in contact with water if you have this condition what can you do well there are a variety of medical therapies that can be offered such as antihistamines to help control the itch as well as a medication known as nxone nxone is something is actually used for patients who struggle with opioid use disorder there whole system of opioid signaling in our skin that plays a huge role in the sensation of itch so nrex Zone can be particularly helpful one thing that was observed many many years ago for patients with aquagenic partis who elect to bathe is if they add a little bit of baking soda not too much but a little bit of baking soda to the bath water it can really help cut down on aquagenic partis it pH of baking soda it may help slow down the release of itch signals be careful though baking soda is quite custic and can ultimately end up being irritating to your Skin also find that topical capsacin can be particularly helpful now you encounter topical capsacin not in the skin care section of your store but rather the pain relief section of the drugstore topical capsacin is often used as a muscle ache rub but the capsacin when you apply it to the skin if you ever used it you know it burns quite a bit well that because it basically leads to the depletion of the little signals from the nerves that C through the skin kind of leaving them a bit wiped out and buying you some relief from the symptoms of itch you might also choose a moisturizer that contains an anti-itch ingredient like promox an anesthetic that soothes the symptoms of itch there Menthol which provided you allergic to can be Cooling and help alleviate itch as well it to bathe in cool water than warm water if you have aquagenic parius not that the cool water won it water and then lastly this may come as a surprise to you if you encountered this ingredient and that is supplementation with something called beta alanine a non-essential amino acid that you can commonly find in different bodybuilding type supplement beta alanine if you have ever taken it causes for a lot of people this very uncomfortable sensation and often leaves you feeling very itchy but for people with aquagenic partis anecdotally it appears to really be quite helpful why it to take and so you may find that to be helpful let me know in the comments if you energy drink that has beta alanine in it how did that go for you I accidentally had it once I wanted to claw my eyeballs out the sensation was was unbearable and it seemed to take forever to go away yeah it but if you have aquagenic rtis it might just be the ticket to getting you some relief now one really important thing about aquagenic rtis that might just save your life is that it actually can be an early warning sign of a type of cancer of the cells of the blood different blood cancers often will present with this sort of itch triggered upon exposure to water a lot of patients will come in saying I get so unbearably itchy in and after my shower what is going on could be an early warning sign of a cancer of the blood such as polycythemia vera non hodkin lymphoma and the itch can start years and years and years before the cancer actually comes to a head and starts to develop why well it inflammatory response of your body immune system and an effort to kill off those early problematic cells could be revving up the itch um as it relates to exposure to water so any patient who has aquagenic partis it should be followed annually with u blood work lab test to monitor blood counts to make sure they evidence of any type of cancer I don say this to alarm you but as you can imagine it might just save your life and then last but not least you might be itchy after a shower because well you might just have hives medical term for hives is ticaria there are so many different types of hives out there I talked about many on this channel before and I even have a video on how to get rid of hives fast hives are these raised itchy WS um that come out and they are aggravated by rubbing and warm temperatures when it comes comes to hives triggered by water exposure there are actually a few different variants first of all is aquagenic ticaria hives triggered by exposure to water cold water warm water uh it doesn fresh water lake water any type of water triggers hives as you can imagine this needs to be distinguished from aquagenic parius which we just talked about aquagenic parius you don hives there coleric ticaria where you get little hives um often times around the hair follicle mostly on the uh trunk so like your chest your abdomen your back upon exposure to warm temperatures if you have cold energic ticara you might also get hives when you work out you get warm sweaty it may trigger little hives then you have cold ticaria cold ticaria you exposure to cold water as well as other things that are cold such as ice ice cream a popsicle if it comes in contact with the skin a cold metal object all can trigger hives now one thing about hives like other forms of itchy skin issues they really really get get much much worse the more you rub the skin the hives come out even more if you deal with hives of any variant but here we talking about those triggered by water exposure be really mindful that you do not uh scratch or rub the skin apply a cool compress can alleviate the discomfort cause the hives to calm down we treat hives with scheduled meaning take them daily antihistamines often times it requires many different antihistamines and at a higher dose than what you might take say for just seasonal allergies so don if your dermatologist recommends that it is a go-to for a lot of people hives initially are brought out and and and run their course for a period of anywhere from several months to several years and sometimes they come out after you have maybe been exposed to a cold or flu virus that sort of like leaves your immune system a bit stymied and confused and you deal with hives some people have hives as it relates to an underlying medical condition there whole big work up when it comes to hives cool compresses can help unless of course you have cold Eric areia then they might aggravate it applying a moisturizer can help cut down on flares of ticaria and help them to clear up a bit after you have experienced a flare applying moisturizers to the skin chilled provided you don ticaria can also help them to go away faster so what are some good moisturizers to use if you get itchy skin after a shower whether it be just related to your bathing practices or whether it be aquagenic partis or some variant of hives triggered by water exposure well I suggest choosing plain fragrance-free moisturizers as fragrance is a common irritant allergen might aggravate things for you choose a moisturizer that has petrol lotum and or dimethicone in it these help to reduce transepidermal water loss and really can help get things back on track and alleviate the symptoms of itch make sure you apply moisturizers to the skin while it the shower this will really help improve hydration moisture content in the skin and your barrier function will be much better alternatively uh a moisturizer that has menthol or promox like I said can really help distract those little itch nerd for example cavey has an itch relief moisturizer there which has menthol there variant of sarna that has peroxin these ingredients can be particularly helpful for distracting those little itch signals and buying you some relief I will list all of these in the description box along with some other body moisturizers

6 Causes Of Itchy Feet & How To Get Relief	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gHMlXdrEmo	Dr Day	why the heck are my feet so insanely itchy we out in today some people deal with bounce of itch from head to toe whereas it can be localized including to well primarily your feet regardless it is not fun so what are the reasons well there are actually a ton of reasons but today we relatively common possible reasons and importantly I some suggestions of things that you can try out preventions to get yourself some relief number one is a condition called dis hydrosis otherwise known as pomx this is a type of eczema and I about it in other videos on hand eczema because it can affect your hands commonly but it also can feet and what happens is you get these little firm clear water-filled blisters that are almost look like tapioca pearls or caviar some people describe them oh my goodness they are so itchy they often crop up on like the size of your feet and then all of a sudden they kind of erupt and leak out this clearish fluid that dries down and the skin becomes very scaly flaky red and inflamed and is just very very itchy so how do you get rid of this well there of people are going to deal with bouts of this from here on out but there are things that you should be aware of that can definitely trigger flares of it and one really common trigger is actually sweat on the skin surface so do your best to keep your feet cool dry allow for good air circulation use powders to absorb excess moisture in your shoes and socks make sure you are wearing moisture wicking socks make sure your Footwear is well fitted and provides good support to cut down on friction and just provide overall better support for your feet ultimately that can help your Skin Barrier out a lot and reduce the risk of flares the other big trigger though is actually nickel so maybe avoid any kind of metal Footwear like buckles and things of that sort that might set this off for you I also suggest at night time after you thick layer of well one of my favorite things plain petroleum jelly Vaseline to your feet cover them with socks hang out that way for at least an hour if not sleep that way it really can help cut down on flares of this it is not fun next is tinia petus what the heck is that athletes foot athletes foot can itch like none other it can look a few different ways but primarily you going to have these red sort of raised areas along the sides of the feet it going to be very scaly for the most part although honestly ringworm athletes foot these are fungal skin infections they sneaky and they can look like many other things you the sides of the feet the bottoms of the feet also between the toes and your toen nails may be impacted as well which is you know fungal nail infection similar to dis hydrosis or pomx excessive sweating is a risk factor for athletes foot or any kind of fungal skin infection those types of organisms really love a moist humid environment so again do your best to keep your feet cool dry I suggest using powders to cut down on moisture now as far as things that may help get rid of the ringworm I suggest a over-the-counter called Lamisil otherwise known as tropine cream applied to the feet between the toes under the toenails can defin help to clear this up although it doesn work because there are sneakier strains of athletes foot out there but that certainly can help a lot of people have found relief doing it uh soaking their feet in Listerine mouthwash also some people find relief soaking their feet in a dilute solution of white vinegar uh it does have some antifungal properties but when in doubt definitely see a board certified dermatologist as I suggested athletes foot or tin aedus it look like a lot of other skin conditions can look like psoriasis some of the other things we in this video can be hard to distinguish from athletes foot and in order to rule it out you know your dermatologist may need to take a biopsy um ideally they would do a simple uh scraping of the flaky skin and look at it in the office under the microscope although certain regulatory issues seem to make that even more challenging than it needs to be these days but yeah your dermatologist should be able to figure that one out out and get you on the right path to treatment the other reason for intensely itchy feet which I personally deal with is you can be allergic to things in your Footwear in your shoes and your socks you know I allergic contact dermatitis as far as things like fragrance and skincare products but you can develop an allergic contact dermatitis to pretty much anything that comes in contact with your skin on a regular basis including your clothing your jewelry your shoes your watches hair products you name it and when it comes to Footwear all right you tops of your feet the bottoms of your feet wherever there is pressure in the shoe depending of course on what it is you get into some possible allergens in a moment however it often will not impact the insoles in addition to itch you going to have sort of a flaky red raised rash you can have some blisters oozing so again it can look like athletes foot it can look like dis hydrosis so a lot of these things you know starts to blur the lines of what am I dealing with that important because it honestly can be pretty tricky to figure out what so the way a dermatologist is going to figure out if this is what is going on is they patch testing and that figure out what you are allergic to and then you to avoid so what are some possible relatively common allergens that lead to allergic contact dermatitis rashes and itching on the feet well there are ingredients called rubber accelerator that are used in the rubber processing so any rubber component of your Footwear that may be coming in contact with your feet will definitely be a contributing issue also if you wear leather shoes you can become allergic to something called uh potassium di chromate which is used in the leather tanning process as well as falahi in leather tanning I already mentioned nickel but a lot of people are also allergic to Cobalt and both of those things can be found in shoes Footwear for example metal buckles paraphenylene diamine now I about this allergen in videos it is actually an allergen found in hair dyes but it the rubber making process and that might be something that you are allergic to some people are allergic to neoprene which is what is like in wet suits goggles but also can be a component of the insoles of shoes the allergen and neoprene is something called dial thura you might even be allergic to the glues in your shoes the adhesives common allergen and adhesives is something called colophony one really sneaky allergen that actually can affect your Footwear is something called dimethyl fumerate now dimethyl fumerate is what is in those little mold sashet that come in things if it your new shoes you get them you put them on it could have transferred that allergen to your shoes from the little mold sachche and give you a foot dermatitis you may notice that you you also get a dermatitis when you sit on a couch because dimethyl fumerate may be in your couch cushions when it comes to allergic contact dermatitis the name of the game is avoiding the allergen and if you able to see a dermatologist but you suspect that you are allergic to something in your Footwear what else can you do well try and change up your shoes your Footwear see if there particular type of shoe that seems to be causing this also you might try wearing two pairs of socks although that can be miserable in the summer along those lines while wearing two pairs of socks can help protect against potentially the allergens transferring to your skin it may create a scenario where you are sweating more and if you are sweating a lot in your Footwear and your shoes of course it could aggravate any of the other foot itch issues that we already have talked about but with allergic contact dermatitis when you have sweat it allows for leeching of more of that allergen into the skin and makes things much worse so again try and keep your feet cool dry moisture wicking is the name of the game so you might try wearing flipflops although if you allergic to something in the rubber in the flipflop it could be Bad News Bears for you as well yeah allergic contact dermatitis can be quite tough patch testing though can really nail down what it is you are allergic to number four is something called chill blades also called pero I actually have a whole video dedicated to this Condition it very interesting people develop these red itchy bumps on like their toes their feet when they are exposed to cold non-freezing is key cold non-freezing and damp weather temperatures it thought to be some sort of abnormal blood vessel response but it can be very itchy and the way to avoid this is to take measures to actually warm the skin in advance of being exposed to the cold damp conditions and also to maybe wear little warming packs you know people get this on their hands you tell them to hold those little warm packs or to have gloves the key is to keep your feet warm dry if you time during the year in a place where it below freezing it you have to go outside a lot maybe you commute by foot or you work Outdoors a a thing that can really be a game Cher is actually warming up your feet and your hands in advance of going Outdoors um in the olden times people would like warm up their socks on the radiator in advance of going Outdoors that actually can make make a difference um if you do develop this um ibuprofen can help alleviate the discomfort number five is actually this could be hives there specific type of Hive called delayed pressure ticaria ticaria is just a medical term for hives delayed pressure ticaria is just what it sounds like you develop hives with the delay after you have had a lot of pressure on a given area of the skin and the feet you know they so if you have done some prolonged standing jumping running Outdoors or you where you putting a lot of weight and and stress on your feet sometimes right away but usually as a name implies with a delay about 3 to 4 hours you will develop raised red welts on the feet and it may not be as obvious to you once they developing if you shoes but it uncomfortable now the thing about hives any type of hives is there made much worse by rubbing the Skin So as you go to scratch you actually make the problem worse the other thing that can bring these out in people is wearing very tight shoes so when you have a flare up of hives um I suggest being really gentle with your skin use cool compresses to alleviate the discomfort scratching of course makes it worse so you should lean into those cool compresses to keep yourself from scratching because scratching is just a behav havior that is very hard to control as far as things that can help this to keep from coming back as with any type of ticaria hives and trust me there are so many different variants of ticaria I could go on and on but a lot of people will develop bouns of this off and on and off and on and off and on for years and years and years and the only way to control it is to take antihistamines nonsedating antihistamines the types of antihistamines that don sleepy take them every day in a scheduled fashion and most patients when they hear the anti-histamine regimen they have to take they alarmed because it sounds it medicine to take and that bothers people but we kind of keep taking it keep adding it it sort of creates a situation where the cells that are causing the problem in your body the mass cells they kind of chill out a bit after all that anti-histamine is you know there is it kind of like uh and it can go away some people will eventually spontaneously go away what causes is this type of thing to occur in the first place some people develop ticaria types of hives whether it be delayed pressure ticaria or any other type after they have maybe had a cold or flu virus even if you didn physically feel ill viruses can pass through your body your immune system May recognize them very quickly and take care of them but that doesn don kind of leave your immune system a bit frazzled and you dealing with hives some people the hives might be triggered by stress hormonal change check out my video on how to get rid of hives fast because I go into detail in that video with regards to different tips and tricks for controlling ticaria hives but they definitely can appear on your feet you may not even realize that that going on try and wear shoes Footwear that isn because again tight clothing tight Footwear friction all aggravate hives all right and the last thing I want to talk about that might be affecting your feet leading to itch is actually peripheral Al neuropathy the little sea fibers that Gorge through the skin can become damaged as a result of neuropathy and of course if you deal with periperal neuropathy you may have some numbness some pins and needle sight like sensation but you also can have bouts of very itchy feed this is especially true in patients who have diabetes patients with diabetes are very prone to going on to develop peripheral neuropathy and so they really can struggle with itchy feet and in diabetics they also have dry skin the skin doesn so it subsequent bouts of itch that being said diabetics are also at risk for tinia petus athletes foot so you definitely want to make sure that you know what you also be one of these other things that I have talked about but peripheral neuropathy you rash per se but you will experience bouts of itch not always some people have more of like this burning sensation it medications that can help soothe those little you know sort of frazzled damaged nerves like um Gabapentin pregabalin there a variety of others um that can help soothe that and get you some relief topical uh capsacin can provide some relief from this type of nerve related itch and you can find capsacin creams in like the drugstore they treat like aches and pains so they they won but rather over like where they sell you know ice packs and things for sore muscles so that can be helpful as can um like topical Menthol can likewise be helpful it just kind of helps to distract those little nerves and sort of Silence those itch signals all right guys so those are six possible reasons why your feet are so itchy but again there are a ton a ton of other possible reasons primary skin conditions different types of infections which I did not cover in this video so it is by no means a comprehensive list just kind of a starting point of things that you might think about maybe try and eliminate exposure to that might help you out but definitely try and see your healthc care provider they can if needed refer you to a board certified dermatologist to really clarify what exactly is going on with your feet why you something that you want to wait around and try and hope that it just goes away because it can be very disruptive to your quality of life especially to your sleep and it kind of then creates this vicious cycle where you get poor sleep and once you have you know a couple of nights of bad sleep your nervous system is a lot more you know sort of revved up and so is your immune system in the sense that itch tends to be even worse than had you gotten good rest so it creates a vicious cycle of stress poor quality of life you definitely want to have it addressed sooner rather than later it have to deal with itch is um very very similar in fact to pain so if you have chronic pain which I know a lot of you do you know maybe you can empathize a bit with anybody who has chronic itch because it likewise can be very debilitating to deal with these kind of symptoms that really just wipe you out speaking of itchy skin do you ever deal with bouts of an itchy arm well if you do you video on itchy arm that I put out was at last week it slate which will be the next slide once I disappear there will be a slide with a thumbnail from that video if you just click on it it will take you to that video and you can watch that next if that is of interest to you but I hope you guys enjoyed this one if so give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don

How To Relieve Itchy Arms | Brachioradial Pruritus	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI9Lir2h2cw	Dr Day	why are my arms so itchy if you asking yourself this question you the right video we are going to get into it today you are not alone many people deal with episodes that come and go of intense itch often over like the elbow but it can extend up the arm to involve the shoulder the neck the chest and the back this type of itch can involve one arm but often times involves both arms what the heck is it well it bracho radial partis parius is just the medical term for itch this starts out as itch there over time as a result of scratching because let it is impossible to resist the urge often times to not scratch but over time that scratching leads to secondary skin changes you can develop well first of all signs of scratching right those lines where your nails dragged across the surface of your skin you also can get a type of skin thickening as a result of the chronic rubbing that called lyen ification The Skin appears kind of dark thick you may notice that it is rough and dry you also can develop hyper or hypopigmentation as a result of the inflammation from the scratching behavior and sometimes the skin can thicken into a nodule that parigo nodule or parigo nodularis which as a side note I have a whole video on parigo naela so definitely check that out if you are dealing with that as well sometimes the scratching can lead to scarring it can lead to bruising so you will eventually start to see some skin changes but it why are you so itchy in these particular locations well this type of itch is called neurogenic itch basically it related to the little nerves that course Through Your Skin they fibers and the Sea fibers release itch signals now because it is neurogenic in ideology meaning underlying cause it involving the little nerves in addition to it many people although not always have other signs and symptoms related to kind of inflam little nerves and that includes intense burning stinging sensation you can have some tingling you may have altered sensation in the affected areas you may also notice that there is a reduction in sweat to these areas as a result of problems with the nerve conduction to these locations of the skin a Telltale sign that you are dealing with bracho radial partis is called the ice pack sign and it is just what it sounds like if you are in the throws of a flare up of itch you apply an ice pack it instantly takes it away that is a clue that this is well brachio radial Prius this happens in men and women although it may be more common in women it tends to appear for the first time in middle age but honestly it can happen at any age including you know young kids teenagers so how exactly do you get rid of this I mean whose channel are you watching you guessed it sunscreen I know what you this woman this woman everything with her is the sunscreen And subscribe I promise you sunscreen and sun protection from many cases a bracho radial parius can be a GameChanger why bracho radial parius is actually thought to be due to sun damage yes that radiation not only of course destroys of collagen in our skin leading to wrinkles but it can damage those little sea fibers and lead to bouts of intense itch and patients often report that their itch gets worse during the sunnier months or times of the year where they are spending more time Outdoors oftentimes patients who have this have a history of enjoying the outdoors and importantly it does improve with wearing sunscreen and sun protection so you also can wear of course Sun protective sleeves like UPF sleeves are just a long sleeve shirt but sunscreen when you are not wearing long sleeves it definitely can help but sun damage is not the only potential cause many patients who have bracho radial partis actually have some kind of problem going on in their neck the spine in the neck can have different problems that can impact the nerves that come out of the spine coarse down your arm and of course Branch off into those little sea fibers for example some people can have cervical spine the cervical spine is a spine here in your neck cervical spinal stenosis or you may have a cervical discernation or it possible you have some kind of impingement of the little nerves coming out there that is definitely a contributing and causitive issue for many patients above and beyond sun damage very rarely someone might have a cancer that sends a metastasis to that area and causes the symptoms or they may have some sort of tumor there but really anything going on in the neck could potentially trigger this why is it important to address bracho radial partis if you you question because you miserable if you have never experienced itch before let me tell you it is debilitating it will mess up your sleep and really has intense psychological complications if it goes un addressed initially of course this is a problem with the little nerves that Co through the skin of your arms but if you itchy and you your sleep is disrupted and you constantly scratching eventually you can just kind of get like your immune system and skin sort of revved up in such a way that you do end up getting itch all over all types of itch tend to get much worse at night makes sense because our skin you know it follows this circadian rhythm and when we sleep at night we have increased blood flow to the skin we also have an increase in what transepidermal water loss so there are a lot of things going on that can exacerbate any underlying itge and if you are scratching in your sleep even if you you don disrupting your sleep because you have these low-level arousals for the scratching behavior and it cycle because once you become sleep deprived well it creates a situation where those nerves are even more on edge and flaring up even more so it definitely something that needs to be addressed so how exactly do you get rid of this sunscreen and sun protection can picture what about those people who have stuff going on in their neck and it not really sun damage if there is something going on in the neck that needs to be evaluated bracho radial partis is diagnosed for the most part by history and physical exam but in patients who say you know this doesn really seem to follow any sort of seasonal variation that leans more towards this might be something going on with the neck and so getting Imaging of your spine in the neck is really important like an x-ray or a CT to see if you have something going on there like a herniated disc of course as I mention ice packs can definitely help relieve the symptoms but you can your life with an ice pack glued to your arm that is not practical and honestly the ice pack over time is going to end up being a bit much for your skin as I are not really the best thing for our skin um so what else is there to to consider to offer well if you have something going on with your cervical spine the spine and your neck uh addressing that is important so things like Physical Therapy can end up making a huge difference also there are different uh interventions that an Interventional radiologist they called can do in the neck to alleviate some of what might be going on causing the downstream effects on the little nerves for example they can use a CT scan and go in there with the CT scan looking there and introduce either some numbing medicine or a steroid shot to calm down inflammation or to to numb up the nerve so you don of itch and it can make a huge difference a huge difference I you what really doesn that is antihistamines Benadryl Claritin algra Benadryl will kind of help in that it will sedate you so it may help you to fall asleep but it waking up it option A lot of patients who have this are older adults and giving them something that is sedating can be a lot more dangerous problematic for them um because they are at Baseline more at risk for Falls if you give them something that is very sedating all that something that would you would want to avoid but all in all antihistamines aren maybe making you a little bit sleepy so you ignore the misery medications that Target inflamed nerves can be really helpful and a lot of these medications might be used to treat pain as well and I want to let you guys know that itch and pain are very very similar in many regards and so often times some of the same medications are used to treat both so I low dose it can be very soothing to the nerves however it is a bit sedating so a low dose may be okay but again in an older adult maybe they don there particularly helpful for these symptoms um but one topical remedy that I find to be very effective if you tolerate is topical capson so capin is what is in Chili Peppers when you put it on the skin you get this intense burning sensation because it binds to receptors on the little nerves but it kind of exhaust them and leaves them sort of like okay I get some relief of the symptoms of itch you drugstore over the counter they to treat um paint pain right like muscle pain muscle aches uh things like asper cream for example can really be quite helpful uh for pain and discomfort but also can end up be being helpful to address neurogenic itch which is what exactly what this is speaking of neurogenic itch who remembers my video on itchy back called notalgia paresthetica related to shearing of the little nerves that course through the muscles in the back um can be very uncomfortable persistent itch that itch and so as you can see the little nerves that course through our skin can be a big source of well itchy skin topical anesthetics like lidocaine can also be helpful temporarily topical Menthol can also be pretty helpful for alleviating the symptoms of itch it sort of distracts those little itch nerve fibers and gives you some relief what are the things might be going on well another thing that is just common in general in older adults is their skin is more prone to dryness and itch a lot of patients develop eczema for the first time as older adults so it could be that it also could be a type of itch related to a sensitivity to a medication that you more sensitive to the Sun and our arm is exposed territory so you may be developing itch inflammation rash there related to a medication that you are taking but this is a pretty common condition overall and it probably is a lot more common than we even realize because a lot of people just suffer in silence they never have the opportunity to see a dermatologist to find out what scratching all through the night developing skin thickening those little paryo nodules and then they have the paryo nodules those thick bumps and they get rid of these I have this where did these come from so it becomes very very all consuming for for someone so my hope in making this video is that if you are struggling with this you have some understanding of what it is what causes it hopefully the tips and strategies that I provided you in today something that you could try yourself and execute and see if it provides you some relief but again always see a dermatologist to find out exactly what is going on with you but again I hope this video is helpful now speaking of neuro enic itch on the endslate I going to link my video about notalgia parastica itchy back so the endslate is the final slide which will come up next once I go away and you thumbnail to that video if you just tap on that thumbnail it video so you can watch that next if that is of interest to you but if you like this one give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen And subscribe I to you guys tomorrow bye [Music]	Success
Itchy Bumps On The Skin | Prurigo Nodularis Explained	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgWIh95ZdQw	Dr Day	well hey guys in today going to talk all about paryo nelas I know a lot of you all deal with this I about paryo nodularis in this video I going to explain what it is what causes it I that can be offered and make sure you stay tuned to the end of the video because I practical skincare tips that you can put into effect yourself at home that can really really help so first of all what is parigo nodular it inflammatory skin condition basically inflammation in the skin where you get these itchy nodules bumps that are raised up and they are well super itchy paryo is a skin condition in general where you have itchy skin and paricon nodularis is like the most severe end of that condition starts out as just chronic itch chronic scratching and over time you can get thickening of the skin to the point where where you form these nodules bumps they sides of the body they can happen anywhere your face your arms your legs scratching is a nearly impossible Behavior to stop when you are dealing with itch it will disrupt your sleep you will scratch in your sleep and you won even realize you action itself is disruptive you become sleep deprived guess what when you sleep deprived you stressed out stress sleep deprivation they heighten the symptoms of itch cause you to scratch more the scratching Behavior pulls out more inflammation in the skin leading to further thickening of the skin and the little nerves there become really just way too big for their britches so to speak and release these little itch signals and it just makes the process all the more worse all the more stubborn to get rid of and a really harmful pattern starts to emerge where you have itch all the time it you really uncomfortable very irritable you scratching is making things worse pron nodularis is not something you can just go to the store buy cream put it on and boom it up with your dermatologist a treatment plan we oneandone thing here often times multiple different treatment options are needed to get not just symptomatic relief to calm down the itch and help you sleep but to actually get those bumps to start to regress and go away anyone can get it people who are prone to developing this are people who have skin conditions that are itchy like atopic dermatitis there are a variety of underlying medical conditions that make the skin itchy cancers are notorious especially cancers of the blood diabetes liver disease chronic kidney disease thyroid disorders patients who have HIV also can be very itchy one place where paryo nodules will pop up is if somebody gets a lot of bug bites bug bites are itchy you scratch them speaking of bites scabies is a condition caused by a m it seven-year itch because you can get scabies you can have the scabies treated so that it goes away but it leaves you very itchy for a long time so that definitely a situation where you can develop these bumps when you look at the sign behind Parago nodularis what you going to find out is that there are quite a few things going on you have thickening of the nerves your body will produce compounds in the skin in an effort to attack things to keep you protected but sometimes it this case you get these different neuropeptides being released that bind receptors on the nerves cause itch it basically some sort of disregulation with the nerves they their job properly they are they are policing things unnecessarily and making your life miserable the action of scratching rubbing chronic friction it thickens the skin becomes dark discolored we call that lyen ification you have any kind of chronic eczema paricon nodule though doesn this big bump out of nowhere all of a sudden usually it starts out as you know just scratching the skin thickens you get these little bumps in that are small you know maybe 3 to 8 mm and then with time they get dark and discolored around the perimeter and with a constant scratching they really start to thicken up and turn into a full-on nodule they can take on a very warty appearance almost you know look like a wart they can have a lot of dry heaped up skin cells on top of them giving that you know kind of flaky scaly appearance the scratching behavior is traumatizing to the skin they can ulcerate mean you can get a sore on top of them the scratching behavior is not something that can totally be controlled by your own will because again a lot of people will scratch and pick it their skin in their sleep if you before it does tend to get significantly worse at night part of this may have to do with the natural circadian rhythm in the skin our skin loses more water when we sleep there warmth that warmth and blood flow can bring in more of those little neuropeptides that signal to the nerves to make you itchy as you again not a behavior you really can control well then you can introduce bacteria into those nodules and get a secondary infection like intigo for example and they can Scar from all the trauma of scratching if you have a deeper skin tone especially these can leave behind a dark spot or they can take your natural skin color away leaving behind a light spot hyper or hypopigmentation how do you know if you have paron nodularis well as a dermatologist you know of course a skin exam history but a skin biopsy can be very helpful because there actually some other skin conditions um many other skin conditions actually that can look exactly like this so a skin biopsy is something that should be done um there are other itchy skin conditions that are different than this that have similar appearing bumps also you know it might be prudent to undergo patch testing because if you are becoming exposed to something that is coming in contact with your skin that is driving a dermatitis a contact dermatitis um the the itch the scratching none of that can go away so long as you are being exposed to whatever that allergen is so patch testing is often prudent then um blood work as I mentioned there are underlying medical conditions that lead to itch and itch sometimes is the Pres presenting sign of these underlying medical conditions and so checking blood work for certain things may be indicated like for example thyroid disorder okay how is this treated anytime you have itch itch leads to an impaired skin barrier can cause more water loss out of the skin enhan penetration of irritance these two things water loss and penetration of irritance gets what they do they enhance the symptoms of itch they aggravate it they make it worse so the best thing to do to kind of get ahead of that is to consistently moisturize your skin especially after bathing after bathing while the skin is still a bit damp that moisturizer as far as treatments that are offered by your dermatologist okay Ultra potent really strong steroid topicals can be pretty helpful especially if they are applied under occlusion basically underneath like tape for example there is a prescription called called cordran tape which is basically a strong steroid impregnated into a tape and it only does it allow for enhanced penetration of the medicine into that thick bump which getting medicine into the the skin when it form a nodule is you know even more challenging um so it can be helpful in that regard plus it can act as a barrier against your fingers preventing scratching but that alone is often you know not sufficient injecting steroid medicine directly into the bumps can be a GameChanger not going to cure it necessarily but it does a few things it it really silences the itch both immediately and then kind of long term immediately because often we with some numbing medicine obviously the numbing medicine itself you know is going to quiet the itch but the numbing medicine wears off but the steroid is going to help get rid of and wipe out wash out those inflammatory mediators and then the other thing about the steroid they actually you know an adverse effect of them normally if used inappropriately is that they can thin the skin they can cause atrophy well that of helpful when the skin is heaped up in a nodule they can soften it topical capsacin you will find this over in the um over the- counter pain medication section in your drugstore because when you apply it to the skin it burns caps what causes those little nerves that are like not behaving to release everything that they depleted so it really can help the symptoms of itch quite a bit I fan of phototherapy for Pyon nodularis it can really really help it doses of UV I know I against UV but remember it poison it ultraviolet radiation control doses of it to the skin actually can melt away certain inflammatory skin conditions because remember UV rays they suppress the immune system in the Skin So if you use just the right dose you can harness that to your advantage to get rid of certain skin problems but of course if you go in a tanning bed or you go out in the sun and don skin that going to have a lot of bad side effects like DNA damage and skin cancer risk remember at its root a lot of this has to do with nerves in the skin that are misbehaving so medications that tackle the nerves can be quite helpful Gabapentin or pregabalin um these are medications that are used to treat neuropathic pain pain and itch they a lot of the same stuff that causes pain as far as the science behind it likewise itch okay so there medications that are used to treat both so pregabalin gabapin definitely can help quiet those little nerves believe it or not the medication called nxone This is a medication that actually blocks opioid receptors and it actually to treat people who have a opioid use disorder to block the receptor but guess what you have opioids that are naturally produced in your skin opioids in your skin binder receptors on nerves in your skin cause them to release itch itch signals okay so now Trex Zone can be super beneficial because the scratching Behavior puts you at risk for secondary skin infection especially if the nodules have become open sores a topical antibiotic may be indicated M mup purin for example I had success in my career treating paron nodularis just you know kind of in a a short-term type fashion just giving giv patients a bit of relief using a liquid nitrogen freezing spray um because it really can um help calm down the itch and it also can help to get rid of some of that inflammation in those spots a newer medication it um it to be actually pretty effective for paron nodularis it to treat at topic dermatitis and both adults and children it dupilumab or dupic the way this drug works is it targets a very specific aspect of the inflammatory response in the immune system that is upregulated when you have chronic itch and inflammation in the skin you have a lot of this going on so this drug comes in and you know blocks that and it can really be quite transformative for patients with itchy skin conditions like paron nodularis you know there of inflammation in the skin that making those nerve sens sensitive so they immune system and definitely can help again it so it Methotrexate cyclosporin and something called aprint otherwise known as Iman these are immunosuppressants we give out a lower dose can help control this this next medication is going to shock you I mean you because this medication has gotten so much bad press but hear meow theide the lamide if you that it got off to a very Rocky start tarnished its reputation initially people are terrified of this drug why well it is um very bad if given to a pregnant woman it causes severe birth effects and initially they were giving it to pregnant women for like morning sickness um and and so yeah I mean it just terrifying but here it inflammatory skin conditions obviously not going to give it to women of childbearing age who are contemplating pregnancy but um you know it is actually a really useful drug for treating many types of inflammatory skin conditions and I quite a few patients with bomide um it it to lower something called tnf Alpha in in the body which is an inflammatory thing um and you know a lot of the more modern uh anti-inflammatory medications that we give to treat certain autoimmune conditions Target tnf Alpha the lamide is an old drug that that definitely helps the other nice thing about the lamide is that it it helps relax you a bit and can help with sleep as well which is really important for healing the itch cuzz poor sleep feeds into feeds into the itch but it actually addresses the inflammatory aspect as well all right but what can you do at home to get yourself some relief I already mentioned this but moisturize moisturize moisturize I list some Down Below in the description box that I think are particularly good and then cover them up cover the spots up less access for your fingers hydrocolloid bandages can be really great kind of expensive but they really are nice and hydrating and then they serve as a barrier to keep your fingers from accessing uh so those can be really helpful try and do things to occupy your mind and your hands uh because you know one one scenario where you may find yourself scratching picking is when you are stressed out being mindful of those stressful triggers and then once you are in those situations or you find yourself like uh starting to feel the urge to itch apply chilled moisturizer to this skin that can definitely help distract those little itch nerves the cool temperature um cover it up with a bandage so you don then do something to occupy your hands and occupy your mind like get a little stress ball and squeeze it and consider reading a book or something because if you can distract your mind even though the scratching is not something that most people people are always you know consciously actively doing if you are able to distract your mind it does kind of help distract against the itch uh it it definitely can help so do that or do a craft do something with your hands it can help obviously that when you are asleep at night you know you can a stress ball wear gloves to sleep it can keep you from scratching the thing about paryo nodular is too that makes it even harder to stop scratching is that you have something now that is raised on the skin so you feel it more and you you your body you know wanting to to pick at it it on you almost so it difficult to resist the scratching get yourself some cool compresses these can really help a lot you can buy them at the Dollar Tree keep them in your freezer your refrigerator the cold temperature can get rid of that itch when you feel it coming on apply a cool compress when you sleep at night keep your room as cool as possible don on a bunch of heavy blankets certainly nothing itchy avoid wool for whatever reason this particular fabric is a nemesis to itchy skin um but you don want to get too warm in your sleep because what happens is that warmth brings in blood flow and heightens itch symptoms don point where it can sure that there cool air and that you it with the blankets I colloidal oatmeal baths they also can really be very soothing very hydrating all right y it cope with I really hope this video was informative maybe opened your eyes to some potential therapeutic options out there reach out

How To Get Rid Of Jock Itch FAST | Dermatologist Tips	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gnlDU__8fI	Dr Day	well hey guys today we about how to get rid of jockage medical term for this is tinia curus it is a fungal skin infection also commonly referred to as a ringworm it is contagious and it also can spread to other body sides making treating it as soon as possible and imperative not only to get rid of it but to keep you from spreading it to other places on your body and to keep you from spreading it to someone else either someone you cohabitate with or someone you work out with jocket typically starts out on one side of the groin but it can eventually spread to involve both sides it can extend to involve the inner thighs the buttocks it can go up onto your stomach typically spares the vulva the penis and the scrotum however very flaky often very itchy depending on your background skin tone it can be pinkish red to Brown almost gray in appearance it has a border to it that is uh expanding and often times raised and very flaky now the fungus that causes is jocket loves a moist humid environment anyone can develop jockage but these things make you at greater risk if you live in a tropical humid climate if it where you live if you sweat a lot people who participate and contact Sports again it is contagious likewise people who cohabitate with someone who has jockage more likely to get it especially if you are sharing things like towels if you wear tight restrictive clothing that not breathable that lends itself to chaing fungus loves that friction moisture people who are overweight have obesity are a lot more likely to develop fungal skin infections also if you have diabetes no matter the type uh you are at a greater risk for fungal skin infections treatment is a must it going to just go away spontaneously you have to treat it the risks of not treating it as I said include it spreading to other body sides where it at in the groin it will continue to spread outwards unfortunately due to the frictional things it also can trickle down a hair follicle and you can get a really deep fungal infection you also of course risk spreading it to other people and it of people although not always treating it will help get rid of the itch as well so those are the reasons to be motivated to treat this to get it to go away one thing I want you to be aware of which may sound boring is that there are a lot of things that can happen in the groin area that look like ringworm and are not it psoriasis commonly can occur in the groin area it other skin infections that can hang out include something called irith rasma this actually a bacterial skin infection and honestly a lot of people who have jockage uh because you have breakdown of the Skin Barrier from the inflammation you can get a secondary infection with aasma on top of it so you may have a two for one going on a lot of people also develop a yeast infection in the groin area uh called candada candidal inner Trigo sebc dermatitis you may have heard of it as dandr for those flaky patches on the eyebrow I but you always have to remember it it can pretty much affect anywhere on the skin where you have hair follicles and it actually loves to pop up in the groin area flaky scaly red itchy patches so that this very uncommon rare hereditary condition which for academic purposes I of for a brief moment it Haley disease basically these people have a problem with a calcium channel in the GGI apparatus and as a result they together particularly well in the skin folds so they get these kind of red uh rashes that are flaky scaly and prone to secondary infections moving on to the reason you clicked into this video how to get rid of jocket okay there are a few strategies approaches and what works for one person doesn another but by and large the good news is this is a skin condition that often times although not always can be treated cured gotten rid of with a simple over-the-counter antifungal cream not just any anti-fungal cream however you want to look for a specific anti-fungal active ingredient it all right when you go to the drugstore the pharmacy there are a ton of fungal cream some of them even specifically say jocket jockage jockage Don any any jockage cream out there because some of them have anti-fungal ingredients that are just not going to cut it you want to specifically look for Turbine the brand name here in the states of tropine cream is a Lamisil but you do not need to buy a brand named Lamisil cream if the drugstore has their store version just look for Turbine 1% cream like I said in most cases this cream will treat this infection however however one thing you really have to understand about these fungal skin infections is that sometimes they are resistant to these therapies it is a growing widespread problem actually fungal skin rashes the fungus has become resistant to our standard medications um several months ago I did a dedicated video on this very problem um so just be aware that this cream it may not be enough um but I pointers on using it and make sure you use it right that it may not work some people give up on it too quickly they don correctly so how exactly do you use tropine 1% cream to treat your jock Edge first of all wash your hands okay second of all make sure that you wash and fully dry the groin area the area you to be treating where you have the rash again this fungus loves moisture so don off fully then you don amount if you will um just enough of the cream to form a thin film you don to Heap on big Globs but depending on how extensive it is you know you may you may need a little bit more like if it extending down your inner thighs more to the buttock area you may need more okay but just enough to create a thin film so you that yourself depending on this the extent after you apply the cream wash your hands again anytime you touch this wash your hands because it can spread to other body sides including your hand tinia monum in that case which you don want you for 2 weeks now this is important this is where you can go wrong this rash once you start treating it with this cream it very well likely will clear up improve look a heck of a lot better in several days of using it do not abandon the cream until you have used it twice a day for 2 weeks bailing on the cream prematurely is a reason why that fungus can come back okay so make sure you treat the fungal rash for 2 weeks now if you given you a Pres description for a fungal treatment use as directed okay that that that you use the treatment as long as necessary as long as the instructions say to don if it it feels like it the beginning still stick with it okay everyone so just write it out do the two weeks of treating and again make sure you washing your hands before and after applying it if this does not go away doing this then definitely follow up with a dermatologist because there like I said there are resistant organisms out there that don you know make sure that you have the right diagnosis again there are other conditions that look like jockage and are not jockage stay away from steroid creams in the drugstores hydrocortisone creams with sold over the counter great for certain issues but can actually be a problematic ingredient when treating fungal rashes kind of depends okay kind of depends some people their rash actually benefits from using a little steroid cream in conjunction with the antifungal um however you can run into problems uh not only favoring resistance of the fungus to the antifungal cream and the presence of the steroid but you also can cause what Incognito basically the steroid cream suppresses your body immune response against the fungus allowing it to Thrive the rash looks and feels better but that fungus is thriving and ding so just make sure that you treating it with the turbine cream and that you steroid cream plus steroid creams in the groin area they can have side effects U more likely because of the nature of the skin there like skin thinning and the development of stretch marks very unlikely with the weak 1% hydrocortisone you lot of you guys actually live in India um hello um from my demographics tab on YouTube I can see that and I know y um my understanding is you have access to more different types of steroid creams over the counter and a lot of my colleagues in India have talked about how they believe that you know this is what is favoring actually the emergence of these resistant uh fungal skin infections is the fact that people self- treat incorrectly with strong steroids um and that has tipped things in favor of actually very resistant uh fungal infection so be careful with the fun be careful with the steroid creams all right I have to change my battery because I didn I didn into talk talking about jocket and I not even prepared with the battery all right I that will help this not only go away faster but ensure that you don it to other people or that it doesn come back number one make sure again to reiterate use the treatment as long as has been recommended one reason why it comes back why treatment fails is that people abandon the treatment prematurely always wash your hands anytime you touch the fungal infection keep your nails trimmed short both your fingernails and your toenails make sure you are disinfecting the nail clippers after each use the reason I encourage you to keep your nails CLI short is that fungus loves Nails okay you don fungal infection and the less territory there is for the fungus to hang on to the better keep the nails trimmed short keep area clean and dry all right so anytime you get out of the shower make sure you towel dry the water off fully and importantly do not use that same towel to dry the rest of your body because you don all over okay just use one towel to dry that area wash the towel after each time you laundry all right just it is what it is cuz the fungal spores they hearty they to make sure you wash towels after every use don one that you use to dry the area and the one that you use to dry the rest of your body remember use two different ones wash them after every use change out of clothing regularly okay don same jeans multiple days in a row wash your clothes after each wear if you start to get hot sweaty don to change your outfit again fungus loves a moist humid environment and so giv it what it needs allows it to thrive Jive spread wash those clothes after each use in hot soapy water don clothing towels washcloths lofas this is going to spread it to other people when you work out and you get really sweaty take a shower after you to wash away the sweat and then keep the area dry the name of the game here is clean and dry get rid of the loofah okay like I said the fungus loves lofas do not use a lofa to bathe if you have an active fungal skin infection like jocket ringworm athletes foot tinum monum don use aofa because the fungus will just you know hang out in there and you inoculating yourself with more each time you use it so get rid of the loofah use a washcloth wash the washcloth after ever use so you want to be using body wash in the groin area helps cut down on bacteria and microbes things um but I would suggest in the setting of a fungal rash in the groin area consider using a salicylic acid body wash because salicylic acid can help cut down on kind of excess dry heaped up skin cells it it anti-inflammatory fungus loves that dry flaky skin so salicylic acid can kind of help exfoliate that um may help the fungal treatments penetrate into the skin a little bit better this I cannot emphasize enough all right there there a chance that if you fungus is already somewhere else a lot of people will already have athletes foot when they their underwear on and as they pull their underwear up well they bring that fungal infection from the feet up to the groin so if you have a fungal infection on your feet and hasn to your groin make sure that when you get out of the shower tow dry the feet with a one type of towel towel dry the rest of your body again with another towel so you don around with a tail put your socks on before your underwear to avoid transferring the fungus from your feet up to your groin but if you have an active fungal infection elsewhere treat it at the same time most cases of fungal rashes on the body can be treated with that turine cream that I mentioned same way applied twice a day as I said when it comes to jacket clean and dry is the name of the game anything you can do to cut down on unnecessary moisture sweat building up in the groin area do it there called Zorb it for absorbing excess moisture make sure you loose fitting clothing this is not the time to be wearing tight jeans spandex bike shorts you want to wear a lightweight breathable Fabrics avoid the shapew wear too um you know it it scenario and disinfect stuff that comes in contact with the area you know if you hair down there make sure you disinfect those tools with alcohol um because the fungus it will it will stay around on stuff like that like razors Clippers also speaking of working out and athletic things when you go to the gym to prevent getting fungal infections and if you have one you know to prevent spreading it to other people make sure you down the gym equipment after each use so Jack itch often itches not always but it can be really itchy I mean most many fungal infections can be very itchy um you don however I know that like telling somebody who has any type of itch not to scratch is just like very useless advice but what you should try and do when you feel very itchy apply a cool compros once you start using the trab benine cream it should help that itch go away cuz the reason you have itch is because basically the immune system is coming in trying to rebel against the fungus to get it out like I said this typically starts to look and feel better within a couple of days of using that cream but you with it don prematurely last but certainly not least is keep your follow-up appointments with your doctor with your dermatologist because like I said some cases you know you can do everything like I said to a te and it still not go away could be either that a you don have one of the other things I mentioned or B the fungal infection is just not responding to to typical over the counter treatments you may need something else all right y my tips and strategies towards jocket not pleasant to deal with comment below and if you fungal skin rash as a side note I not only have a video on this channel all about ringworm in general with more tips and tricks but I also have that video regarding the emergence of resistant ringworm and you know kind of some of the things that have contributed to that so I make sure you watch it uh to give you the full picture of you know where steroids can lead things as stray arai but if you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs

Get Rid Of Dry Itchy Scalp FAST!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn7yXUcaQ-Q	Dr Day	winter is here dry skincare season is in full effect well hey guys in today video we how to go about getting rid of a dry scalp fast I have a lot of videos on this channel all about winter skincare tips how to address dry skin the best products for dry skin but let forget the misery that is having a dry itchy scalp now to be clear there are many causes of a dry scalp it could be at topic dermatitis it could be a contact dermatitis it could be honestly any number of things and as always the best way to go about solving any skin problem is to see a board-certified dermatologist to get an accurate diagnosis and get on the best path of treatment for you however today I practical inexpensive if not free yeah all these things I think are free they cost you no money tips that regardless of what is causing the dry scalp these things are going to help you out they going to support either Improvement or avoid exacerbation of they simple things that you can Implement and the first one is to eliminate unnecessary products that you are using whether it be for styling purposes grooming your hair so if you use a lot of styling products pomades gels mouses they may have ingredients in them that have become irritating to your scalp you may have an underlying scalp condition going on that is subsequently being aggravated by the products that you are using so try and dial down not only the number of products that you are using but just you know really stick to the Bare Essentials shampoo the scalp at a frequency with which your hair type tolerates at least once a week for good scalp health and a conditioner to neutralize the charge of the hair after shampoo shampooing to help keep the hair manageable try and really focus on what is the Bare Bones that I need here what are the Bare Essentials and I using any hair care products that have ingredients in them that are commonly irritating to the skin like fragrance for example even ingredients that can be beneficial for the scalp can end up being irritating like salicylic acid maybe you some sort of Lon scalp detox type product and it has ingredients that are actually you know worsening the irritation then of course when it comes to shampoos especially a preservative family that people frequently become sensitized to It isothiazolinones Long complicated name methyl chloro isolone or methyl isolone they allergens in shampoos so maybe you using something with that and you might want to swap out to a different shampoo without that just for a trial period it do that um may help it out hair dyes hair dyes are another culprate allergen the um ingredient paraphenylene diamine in hair D very common allergen and it often not only is going to aggravate your scalp and cause dryness and irritation but you can develop rashes um along the hairline behind the ears the neck so be mindful of that um maybe maybe a good time to try a period of you know letting your hair go natural if you actually posted around this time last year on doing a skincare reset but if you might consider doing a hair care product reset where you just eliminate anything unnecessary that could be aggravating your dry scalp condition number two kind of Falls in line with analyzing the products that you shampoo check what type of shampoo you shampoo while great for their intended function can be very drying to the scalp if used too frequently especially for example shampoo type which I have lots of videos on is called a clarifying shampoo clarifying shampoos are excellent for removing product buildup product residue from the scalp and from the hair strand especially up close to the roots clarifying shampoos because that formulated in such a way to be a bit uh I won strong detergent action and and if you use a clarifying shampoo too frequently those strong detergents strong surfactants they can disrupt your Skin moisture barrier aggravating dryness clarifying shampoos are really only intended to be used like once a week so check your shampoo you know it just buy shampoos I buy shampoos because the packaging the scent the marketing um but you may not realize that the shampoo you meant to clarify or you may not even know what clarifying means honestly the marketing around shampoo is pretty nebulous in addition to clarifying shampoos the other family of shampoos that can be a culprit are medicated shampoos which by and large are those shampoos that are marketed for dandruff now they are excellent but if used too frequently they definitely can be drying to the scalp and to the hair strands anti-dandruff shampoo ingredients uh include ketoconazol and antifungal selenium sulf ified salicylic acid zinc Python and also um colar although that is less frequently encountered all of these if used too frequently can definitely be drying to the scalp now some anti- dander shampoos especially these days have been tweaked around formulated in such a way to be more moisturizing have more moisturizing ingredients and cut down on that dryness and irritation but look at the instructions for use for the particular anti- dander shampoo you are using often times uh you know it anti-dandruff shampoo a couple of times a week as maintenance um but if you end up using it on a daily basis it can it can be drying depending on you know what you have going on and your hair type uh especially selenium sulfide uh selenium sulfide definitely can be very drying and actually nerol shampoo the ketoconazol anti-and shampoo it can be very drying you know you may need to tweak around what anti dandruff shampoo you are using um and in either the the brand the formulation or switch to another anti-dandruff ingredient zinc python tends to be less drying but again it all kind of boils down to the formulation of the shampoo itself number three is one I have mentioned numerous times on here before but if you dealing with a dry scalp you really should um be very mindful of how much shampoo volume you using you don to use too much shampoo volume it does not cleanse your scalp any better to use more shampoo it just Wast it and that excess surfactant exposure disrupts skins moisture barrier even further aggravating dryness and irritation uh not to mention using too much shampoo you run into the issue where it becomes increasingly more difficult requires more time in the shower to rinse out so that scalp and you know either you end up with residue or you have to stay in there way too long and that ends up making you even more prone to dryness cuz long hot showers we know dry out the skin including the scalp you only need about a quarter sized amount to adequately cleanse the scalp and I often see comments like my hair is too thick for that there honestly it strands remember it you should be able to work in a quarter sized amount into the scalp uh and if you have a really really thick hair type and you know you kind of have to part the hair to get the shampoo to the scalp it more shampoo on is not the answer because pouring more shampoo onto your scalp it it any easier for it to distribute and if anything if you have a hair type where it becomes challenging to get that shampoo on the scalp um using more you have to remember it more difficult to remove it uh so don don bottles they don very easy on us often times they will just pour out very quickly shampooing the scalp is a pleasurable relaxing experience but um you can still have that that pleasurable experience using less shampoo volume it important if you scalp and the benefit uh you know as I said at the beginning of this video these tips they cost you nothing and in this case it cuz you end up going through the the shampoo less often speaking of staying in there too long to try and rinse out the shampoo the other thing you want to be careful of is the temperature of the water I love a hot shower as much as the next person I mean who who wants to take a cold shower although actually I know that circles right now but by and large um you know a cold shower is not the most enticing thing right but when it comes to dry skin body scalp you name it hot water is the dry skin Nemesis it to make it worse because the hot water really creates a force for more water loss out of the skin and further disruption of Skin that lukewarm to Cool Water you can kind of have your cake and eat it too if you careful in the shower um you know I don if you want to enjoy a warmer shower um and you not your the skin on your body isn go ahead and enjoy that just keep your scalp out and then when it comes time to shampoo to rinse dial the dial the temperature back it can make a huge difference especially if you midst of dry scalp along the lines of the volume of shampoo you use and the water temperature we have to have a conversation about the hard water issue which a lot of people deal with a lot of people have hard water hard water has a high mineral content and the minerals in hard water they can um disrupt Skin moisture barrier we know that this leads to aggravation of atopic dermatitis type of eczema which actually could be what going on with your scalp we don because you got to see a dermatologist to figure that out and you know it can cause irritation because of that that further worsens dryness and a lot of people will be like well should I get a water softener either you know you can buy those that just go right on the shower head if you live in an apartment like me or you can invest in a whole system system for your home truthfully the research that we have does not actually show at least in the case of a topic dermatitis that a water softener makes much of a difference now it doesn in that and give it a try by all means but what can make a big difference uh in for those of you who have hard water is being mindful of some of these things I the minerals in the hard water they interact with the surfactants and the shampoo and that the scalp to really disrupt the Skin Barrier and aggravate dryness so again coming back to my other tip on making sure you don the water temperature in the shower that can exacerbate heighten a further aggravate the negative effects of hard water on the scalp my next tip and kind of what I have hard water rather than focusing on trying to get a water softener just be mindful of how much time you are in the shower how much contact your skin is having with that hard water reducing the duration of time you are in there can actually make more of a difference um than you know buying some fancy water softener and that can be hard you know people enjoy their long showers when it comes to your scalp care when you are in the process of lathering the shampoo to your scalp just turn the water off less contact with the water less negative impact of hard water on your scalp less contact with the surfactant and the shampoo with the hard water that could form a film all in all mitigates the damaging effects of hard water on your skin so that to imple implement the next tip kind of Falls in line with what I recommended up until this point and that is make sure you are rinsing that shampoo out completely you don leave any residue on the scalp cuz that those surfactants the detergents in a shampoo they are a dry skin Nemesis more so than the type of shampoo you are using bearing of course those shampoos I already mentioned that can be extra drying but you know people will be like well what scalp it itself but rather how you are using it and the conditions in the shower that you can optimize to mitigate the negative effects of shampoos on the scalp cuz shampoo it okay there dry scalp here you go some are gentler than others probably but it it into a randomized control trial to to Really to really test that out now when we if it tendency to want to scrub um and there are a ton of scalp scrubs out there either mechanical or um chemical meaning they have ingredients in them that dissolve the glue between sticky skin cells you want to avoid those in the situation where you dry scalp especially if you don the cause exfoliating dry skin can make the dryness even worse because at its root you have an issue there with problems with the Skin Barrier you losing more water out of the Skin So exfoliating away that barrier even further at least in the acute scenario of dry skin of dry scalp skin especially uh it just leads to more water loss so back away from the scrubs back away from any kind of you know product meant for removing buildup that can actually worsen the dry scalp issue for you it a delicate balance though because some of these types of products you know they may actually with consistent use depending on how they improve barrier function in the long run like for example Alpha hydroxy acids in a lot of you know exfoliating type products including those for the scalp they can improve moisture retention so that can be a good thing but when you don scalp is really dry it it seems to be flared up I would not go down on the path of of using any kind of scalp scrub it kind of gets back to the first point of reducing the number of products cutting out anything that is unnecessary my final suggestion to try at least to prevent the worsening of dry scalp is your heat styling practices um minimize those cut out any unnecessary heat styling especially hot tools that you are holding close to your scalp uh that can definitely aggravate a dry scalp if you choose to blow dry your hair dial down on the temperature use a cooler setting make sure you hold that blow dryer at least 15 cm away from your scalp and move it around continuously not only is this going to help the dry skin at least at least you know keep it from getting you know too flared up but it that cuts down on heat damage all right y you can Implement if you are in the midst of dry scalp this winter season especially when dry skin conditions tend to flare tend to get worse or appear for the first time again see a board-certified dermatologist to know what it is you are dealing with specific medications treatments um may be indicated depending on what it is you are coping with but these little tips tweaks um ways that you can adjust your shower routine they definitely can make a huge difference regardless of what the underlying cause of your dry scalp issue is I hope this video was helpful to you guys on endslate I recent video all about my winter skincare tips you definitely want to check that one out next but if you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don I [Music] bye [Music]	Success
HOW TO STOP ITCHING ON THE BACK | Notalgia Paresthetica	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRDjC4wOcP8	Dr Day	why guys in today share with you how to stop itchy back I know a lot of you guys deal with this unbearable itch between your shoulder blades it can be tough to reach and once you start scratching feels so good but the itch never goes away believe it or not this isn problem but rather it is a problem with your nerves the medical term for this is Nostalgia parasthetica unbearable itch between the shoulder blades usually starting kind of more so on one side of your spinal column on the back but it can eventually spread to involve a wider area including extending beyond your shoulder blades to your upper back when I say the itch of this condition is unbearable I poet shell Silverstein has an entire poem dedicated to Nostalgia parasitica it your breath and scratch and pray only just an inch away that captures Nostalgia parasitica to a t why the heck does this happen the nerves that course through the skin on your back are actually very susceptible to getting squeezed and stretched and when that happens they become inflamed and they release little chemicals that lead to the sensation of itch this is not a skin problem per se and that you don rash that then is itchy but rather it is an itch that leads you to scratch now with scratching and rubbing the skin to alleviate the symptom of edge you can actually develop secondary skin changes like scratch marks even scars thickening of the skin hyperpigmentation hypopigmentation meaning loss of color you can get secondary little skin infections from scratching and digging the nerves that Supply sensation to the skin of the back they come out of the spinal cord and they course through a very long route through the thick muscles of the back and they come out at a right angle to innervate the skin and that right angle makes them very vulnerable to stretching and compression Nostalgia parasthetica is a nerve problem it come after any type of injury to the back it have a herniated disc or a slip disc let me know in the comments if you have ever experienced the misery that is shingles shingles is a very uncomfortable blistering rash caused by a virus and it can involve the skin of the back and it as it heals and goes away the nerves can be left frazzled and that can trigger symptoms related to Nostalgia parasitica people can develop Nostalgia parasitica after a really bad sunburn to the back because the skin there gets injured it gets inflamed as a result of the UV damage and that little innocent bystander cutaneous nerve gets inflamed and that can set off Nostalgia parasitica some people develop a type of spinal cord injury related to compression it that too is associated with the development of nostalgia parasthetica and some people have a condition called small fiber neuropathy now it can likewise leave those little cutaneous nerves in the back vulnerable to getting excited and releasing those itch signals it paresthetica to start after intense exercise that leaves your muscles in your back sore maybe you haven sedentary for a long time and this is the first time you have worked out in a while you go too hard you over exert yourself you actually might inflame those little nerves and lead to this problem for some people the itch sensation is intermittent whereas for other people it is continuous you there the sensation of itch is not actually relieved by scratching or rubbing the skin however scratching and rubbing leads to immense pleasure and so people scratch they rub but it really actually does not alleviate the itch in fact it makes the itch worse anytime you have itch whether it be on your back or elsewhere scratching is never the answer but it second nature and it what scratching does is disrupt the Skin Barrier and agitate those nerves further making them even more likely to persistently be employed aimed in releasing those itch signals it really can cause persistent Edge to scratch it want to feed that cycle this usually starts just in a small spot on one side of the spine in between the shoulders but as it persists the surrounding skin becomes involved it can spread to involve both shoulders and the upper back a lot of people have more than just issues with itch they also develop other sensory changes it can be accompanied by a burning sensation or the feeling of hot or cold tingling almost like something is crawling on your skin unbelievable itch that may come and go and often gets worse at night but you also have the sensation of something crawling on your back feel like there tingling can you imagine how miserable that is Natalia parasitica can be accompanied by this Sensation that there is something on your back there like a foreign body sensation it really can have a lot of different symptoms that can be very stressful to cope with any skin condition where there is itch guess what it you go to sleep we don why this happens maybe because water loss out of the skin is greater at night maybe because cutaneous blood flow increases at night bringing in more warmth and release of itch signals but itch gets much worse at night for the majority of people and it disrupts your sleep that is probably one of the most serious aspects of itch and something that is not taken seriously enough I don there realize how debilitating itch is the same nerve types that signal pain signal itch what happens with itch is that person is aroused from sleep to scratch as your Sleep Quality suffers the next day you are a lot more stressed out and guess what also feeds itch stress poor sleep and the stress make you more likely to scratch that also further intensifies the itch sensation and makes it last longer so this is actually a very vicious cycle when it comes to any type of skin condition where there is itch all feeds back to itch and intensifies the itch long term the nerve problem causes a symptom in the skin and the behavior which you can can lead to skin problems hyperpigmentation eczema skin thickening hypopigmentation scars skin infections and for a lot of people who rob and scratch the skin enough they can develop a skin condition known as macular amyloidosis basically these skin cells get so inflamed it kind of leaks stuff out into the skin you get these patches of dark thickened skin that on side angle have almost a rippled appearance it people who have no talgia parasitica they end up developing macular amyloidosis on top especially if you someone who reaches for a back scratcher or you take your towel and you do like this to scratch the back of something that a lot of people in The Talented parasitic I will end up doing but it actually not only feeds the itch Pathway to persist but then it can lead to changes in the skin where you have thickening discoloration so how do you figure out that this is what is going on it cases that the patient is dealing with Nostalgia parasthetica people who have a history of back injury spinal symptoms depending on what other symptoms you having your doctor May order some Imaging tests like an x-ray a CT scan an MRI to look for things like a slip disc or degeneration in the vertebrae the bones that make up your spine but that isn right now that you understand this condition you understand that at its root the root cause is not necessarily a skin problem but rather a nerve problem how the heck do you get this to go away it understand the scratching Behavior feeds it you have to do your best to not scratch but how do you get rid of that debilitating itch sensation one way and you may need to approach it in a multimodal fashion but one way that can get people some relief is to use a cream that has the ingredient capsaicin capsaicin comes from Chili Peppers the white capsaicin works is to deplete the little nerve endings in the skin of their chemicals that would otherwise be released and aggravate itch but a word of warning capsaicin burns when you put it on it the skin to get very red because it triggers vasodilation once all of the neurochemicals are released then you get a period of time of relief however you have to keep applying this to the skin in order to kind of maintain the control and the symptoms often recur so this is not a cure it some symptomatic relief and hopefully Aid in Breaking that itch scratch cycle another approach is to get lotions that are marketed as cooling lotions cooling lotions typically have Menthol now in a lot of my videos I say oh you should avoid menthol all its fragrance and it a common allergen but this is a case for Menthol because it definitely can provide some symptomatic relief it has a cooling effect on the skin and it can help to distract those itch nerves I recommend applying these cooling lotions to the skin chill so put them in your refrigerator let them get chilled and apply them to the skin cold that really likewise can amplify the cooling effect on the skin and get you some better more sustained relief they and creams that you can buy from the store that have anesthetics in them some of them have lidocaine others have an anesthetic called promoxin it can help to give you some relief from the itch there are also topical steroids I fan of prescribing a steroid ointment to people who have a lot of itch especially if they have developed the signs of skin damage from the scratching like if they have an overlying eczema or maybe they macular amyloidosis a steroid ointment that is prescription only can definitely help silence those itch signals calm down the inflammation in the skin and help the patient get some relief and help with healing speaking of prescription another type of medication that can be helpful for people who quality of life has been seriously negatively impacted by this like it disrupting your sleep to a point where you need some something more intense there amitriptyline that has a sedating property it makes you sleepy and helps you sleep amitriptyline taken at night is not only helpful for sleep but it also addresses the neuropathic component of nostalgia parasitica it soothes the nerves and helps with the neuropathic component of itch you know a lot of patients as a side note who have certain chronic pain conditions are prescribed amitriptyline the same little nerves that contribute to those types of pain because pain is very complex those same types of nerves are also applying a role in itch but it may not be right for everyone there are side effects it is sedating so I have to be careful in certain vulnerable populations there also medications like Gabapentin or pregabalin these likewise soothe the nerves but they do have some side effects that need to be monitored so that might be right for you it prescription only or it may not be right for you something that your doctor may discuss further transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation TENS unit can help soothe those nerves as well a lot of derms try Botox botulinum toxin injections everyone thinks of botox for wrinkles but it for a lot of other stuff a lot of medical conditions including this some people do get relief with botox injections for Nostalgia parasitica double-blind trials however suggest it not effective so it in my opinion it can you know for the patient it can be very expensive depending on you know where you live and that sort of thing so I mean to me in my experience I don more effective than some of the other things that we have already mentioned here now if you have a slip disc problem in your spine Surgical decompression to address that can end up getting the patient symptomatic relief from The Nostalgia parasthetica so those are all kind of medications or creams and lotions and things that are largely going to address the itch but the other thing that you need to try and do get some physical therapy in with the upper back because if you think about it the muscles around the back they as long as they continue to compress those little nerves or put undue traction on them it are some very simple and effective stretching exercises that you can do on a daily basis to loosen up the muscles of the back that will ultimately support Improvement of this condition that in conjunction with the other things that we talked about that help you to break the itch scratch cycle the physical therapy can really help a lot crossing your arms and just like bending forward to get a good stretch of the upper back or holding your hands by this by your sides lifting your shoulders and kind of rotating them forward and backward also just simply rotating your upper body from left to right you can get some good stretching in the upper back and then the other thing that you can do in addition to these exercises is massage massage of the back loosening up the muscles helping them to relax it can really pay off small steps to getting you relief that combined with the exercises combined with these topicals that we talked about to break the itch scratch cycle and if necessary the prescription medications to help you sleep and help soothe those nerves those those things all together can really put you on a path to Healing this condition can improve but if left unaddressed untreated it can get much much worse and you can develop skin changes on top so that we soon as possible the longer it persists the more difficult it is to get it to go away that related to the nerves whether it be a pain condition or an itch condition the longer it persists untreated unaddressed the harder it relief so let point hopefully you video early enough in your in your journey with backage Nostalgia parasthetica that these tips can really really help you out long

Itchy Down There? HOW TO STOP GENITAL ITCH *Dermatologist* @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6xIU9HLn5U	Dr Day	well hey guys in today going to talk about something that really needs talking about something nobody wants to talk about but it real problem that I bet a lot of you deal with and that is genital itching yes we in particular in women it common problem probably more common than we even realize because a lot of people it talk about they don with their doctor they may not even remember when they are at the doctor that they they don problem even worthy of discussing but seriously it can impact one quality of life I mean just imagine how miserable it is to have itch at all but genital itching is even more socially awkward it your knee when it itches it little bit more well intimate keep watching because not only are we going to be talking all about the causes and reasons behind vulvar itching but I going to give you some practical tips that you can Implement to minimize the symptoms of itch we talk a lot on this channel about an impaired skin barrier and habits in your skincare routine that can lead to an impaired barrier but the skin on your vulva is a lot more vulnerable to Skin Barrier disruption and subsequently the end result is that more water exits the skin and more irritating things can enter including things that trigger the symptoms of itch genital skin is a lot more reactive in comparison to skin on other areas of the Body for example you could take an ingredient and put it on your forearm under occlusion meaning like underneath a bandage and it a while but do the same exact thing to the skin of the vulva you get a lot more irritation much more quickly than you would on the forearm it trapping of sweat up against the skin and if you guys recall from my videos sweat left on the skin is pretty irritating it leads to more water loss from the skin and further disrupts the Skin Barrier you also may have residue from urine bodily fluids then you have the friction from your clothing any kind of personal care product that you might be using directly there or indirectly may be coming in contact like your body washes or your laundry detergent and of course you have you have hormonal influences decline in the level of estrogen around menopause with breastfeeding postpartum and as a result of certain medications can impact the vulvar epithelium estrogen is pretty important for maintaining the structural Integrity of the vulvar vaginal space and it Barrier function you know in general with age and with the decline in estrogen that occurs in women you do experience a lot more dry skin but that definitely impacts the vulvar area speaking of menopause as estrogen levels decline you get thinning of the epidermis the top part of the skin and you have an increase in skin pH both of these things lead to a Skin Barrier that is a lot more vulnerable to water loss and for irritating things to come in you also have a decline in the hydration of the stratum cornea in the top layer of the epidermis with that comes an impairment in Skin Barrier function making the individual more susceptible to itch there are a variety of primary skin conditions like atopic dermatitis lichen planus psoriasis that can lead to genital itching in both men and women you also can get genital itching as a result of certain skin infection questions the list goes on and on well beyond what is practical to cover in today issue that can lead to General itching and that is contact dermatitis things that come in contact with the genitalia can lead to barrier disruption and itch if you contact dermatitis you have two different types allergic contact dermatitis meaning your body and your immune system have decided that a certain ingredient compound chemical is no longer acceptable and you mount an immune response to that ingredient whenever you come in contact with it it may be something that you previously tolerated just fine but you have become sensitized to it and you are now allergic to it the other type of contact dermatitis is actually a lot more common and that is irritant contact dermatitis your immune system isn directly involved in that there deciding an ingredient is bad or good it formulation overall is very disruptive to the skin Skin Barrier and again because vulvar skin is a lot more sensitive than say the skin on your arm well it becomes more of an issue in these areas Boulevard allergic contact dermatitis what types of ingredients are common allergens in this region fragrance fragrance is actually one of the most common causes of allergic contact dermatitis leading to ovulvar itch fragrances they can be found in a wide array of personal care products body washes lotions deodorants feminine hygiene sprays feminine washes but also in feminine hygiene products like sanitary napkins scented tampons bubble bath you also have fragrance and laundry detergents fabric softeners another common family of allergens is preservatives preservatives are really important for keeping our skin care and personal care products safe and free of microbial contaminants but sometimes these can lead to an allergy your body can mount an immune response against them and you can become allergic to them methyl chloro isothiazolinone and methylisothiazolanone quaternium 15 parabens or phenoxyethanol as a reminder you can develop an allergy to anything what I more commonly identified allergens that lead to vulvar allergic contact dermatitis then you have ingredients in medicated products specifically topical anesthetics ingredients that are anesthetics can be identified on ingredient labels by the ending cane c-a-i-n-e benzocaine tetracane procaine for example these are actually commonly found in Vagisil and Preparation H hemorrhoid creams then you have topical antibiotic medications most commonly going to be neomyosin and Bacitracin I always point this out when I go into the drugstore with you guys but Neosporin actually is a really common cause of allergic contact dermatitis rarer instances unfortunately people can actually become allergic to the topical steroid medications they may have been prescribed to treat the vulvar itching it should be suspected if the condition is worsening despite using a prescribed or over-the-counter steroid cream steroid creams include things like hydrocortisone triamcinolone you can develop an allergy either to the active drug like the steroid molecule in the topical preparation or you can develop an allergy to one of the inactive ingredients and then another class is going to be the topical anti-fungals that are used in this area you can actually develop an allergy to those medications clotrimazole and miconazole these medications are commonly found in over-the-counter treatments for yeast infection like Monistat for example you may be using that thinking that you are treating a yeast infection because you have itch down there but in reality you are you actually can develop an allergy to the anti-fungal drug that ends up making the itch much worse so those are just some common causes of allergy in this area you can also just develop irritation from products that you use whether it be a body wash bubble bath is a common irritant in the genital area because it fragrance that can end up being left behind on the skin and getting trapped there in the skin folds it in this area because of the skin folds and the skin on skin contact for things like body washes and bubble bath to leave a residue that gets trapped in those skin folds and not and for to not be rinsed out in total also water left on the skin can lead to a lot of irritation water and or sweat and so whenever you bathe make sure that you adequately dry in the skin folds with a clean towel to prevent irritation and further breakdown of the Skin Barrier that would otherwise lead to itch genital itch can affect both men and women the external genitalia if you are dealing with this definitely bring it to the attention of your health care provider don a lot of people are really embarrassed to bring things like this to the attention of their doctor but I have to tell you in medicine we become very quickly desensitized to any thing that you might find embarrassing it it really does not it really does not impact us and our thinking that way whatsoever the aim of your health care provider is to help you and we see all sorts of things and in that area and it embarrassed about it issue so don up and you know the things that we talking about in this video are one thing but there are a lot of other more urgent things that might need to be addressed that can cause itching so don to your doctor it scenario where somebody has a skin problem that affects the skin on their body and the skin in and around their genitals and when they come to the dermatologist they point out the skin rash like say for example on their arms or their body but they are really closed off and maybe don there general area and unless the dermatologist specifically asks about symptoms there or specifically asked to examine that area then it can go Miss and you can really end up missing a much bigger picture issue and if you have developed an allergy to something you can be referred to a dermatologist who can do patch testing to figure out what if any of these ingredients that we talked about today you might actually be allergic to that way moving forward you know okay I have to avoid these things because they can you do in the meantime when it comes to caring for the vulva I think women are very easily misled by the marketing of feminine hygiene products I suggest avoiding any kind of feminine hygiene wash douche anything of that sort because these things that actually cause a lot more harm than good The Vagina does not actually need to be cleaned with anything other than warm water to clean out the folds and everything you don area it actually cannot handle soaps or detergents even those quote unquote formulated for this area can end up being incredibly irritating and disrupt not only the Skin Barrier but the Flora of the skin and the vaginal mucosa and put you at risk for skin infections a lot of the disposable wipes can also be a cause of contact dermatitis not only maybe because of the fragrances or the preservatives make sure that when you are finding that you get sweaty whether it be after exercise or from walking a lot that you change into clean dry clothing thing stick to breathable Fabrics when it comes to underwear avoid synthetic fabrics that can be moisture trapping and instead stick to 100 cotton it cotton because a lot of the dyes in underwear fabric can actually be pretty irritating avoid thong underwear the thing about thong underwear although nobody wants to talk about is that it actually just the motion of the thong go a little bit back and forth and it can introduce bacteria and things from the anal area closer to the vagina and that can actually cause itch avoid rayon or acetate synthetic fabrics they don breathe particularly well and can trap moisture and sweat stick to fragrance free body washes and fragrance free laundry detergents as well I suggest not using fabric softeners these can leave behind a residue on Fabrics it can end up being pretty irritating to the skin and when it comes to washing your underwear try to uh not overdo it with a laundry detergent just use it as uh the detergent recommends don because you can end up leaving behind some of the detergent in the fabric that can then be transferred to your skin and cause irritation and to be conservative do a second rinse to really ensure that you get all of the laundry detergent out so that you of that detergent residue then transferred to your skin if you you may elect to use tampons instead of sanitary napkins and pads sanitary napkins and pads they can end up trapping a lot of moisture and irritating bodily fluids up close to the skin make sure that you are not getting the ones that have fragrance in them a lot of them are scented if you do have a lot of dryness and irritation on the vulva the actual skin part it use plain petrolatum ointment like vaseline as a skin protectant it the situation where you do have a lot of irritation and inflammation going on because a lot of other petrolatum ointments like Aquaphor or CeraVe healing ointment they do have other ingredients which in this case could potentially be allergens and just plain petrolatum is actually one of the safest options now when it comes to dryness of the vaginal mucosa that can certainly happen around and with menopause or plunge it that area it of fact YouTube has this new feature I where if you tap on the little shopping bag some of these things that I talking about should pop up so check that out there you can also use zinc oxide diaper rash cream to cut down on friction from clothing and to cut down on irritating things getting into the skin just a plain zinc oxide diaper rash cream try and avoid wearing tight clothing trying to stick to breathable items of clothing tight jeans and leggings and bike shorts they your friend in this situation because again they trap moisture and sweat they breathable depending on the material and so it can actually really end up aggravating the issue for you a lot when you do get sweaty again change into clean dry clothing clean dry underwear if you go for a long walk for example and you find that you work up a little bit of a sweat chances are pretty sweaty down there consider swapping out to clean underwear it can help cut down on this Edge all right y video was informative I want to start this discussion with you guys simply because I know it you deal with and it you about with your doctor but I want to encourage you to have that conversation and not feel embarrassed because it really can have a devastating impact on your overall quality of life and again this can be a symptom of a much larger issue and it care of it don think that it up because it certainly is and never feel like you are inconveniencing a health care provider by having them go ahead and examine that area I know sometimes in this current climate where appointment visits are very rushed and kept to a short window like one problem or whatever but trust me like it taking care of patients is to examine them and look in these areas when there are problems to make sure that you not missing something much bigger barely even scratch the surface on the vast array of things that can cause itch in this area some of them a lot scarier than we we got into in today don doctor with your health care provider it hope this video was informative if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen And subscribe I to you guys tomorrow bye foreign [Music]	Success
SCALP ECZEMA & ITCHY SCALP Q&A WITH DERMATOLOGIST DR DRAY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUAqG6lNyh4	Dr Day	well hey guys happy Friday but the Q&A today I about eczema on the scalp eczema is a common chronic skin condition in which you have rashes on the body that are red itchy sometimes dry but also sometimes booze and wheat this kind of clear discharge that then crusts over and the rashes become kind of scabby eczema is incredibly itchy and with scratching the eczema rashes they can become thick and discolored and dark eczema can happen on any location in the body but frequently happens on the extremities like your arms legs hands feet and wrists it also can affect your face particularly around the eyelids where the skin is very thin but many people with eczema don realize that their scalp can be involved as well and it scalp involvement with eczema many people who have itchy rashes of eczema in their scalp may just think oh this is really something that is caused by my shampoo or conditioner or hair dyes and I kind of just have to live with it because I while those things can definitely play a role in the symptoms and rashes of eczema and the scowl exim on the scalp is more than just skin care products that you eczema is a common name for a medical condition called atopic dermatitis atopic dermatitis is actually an inherited or genetic condition in which the skin is just not as hearty at staying hydrated and moisturized and therefore throughout that throughout that individual rely more heavily on the use of moisturizing products and they have to be very conscientious that their skincare practices are not overly drying out or irritating their skin because this can precipitate a flare of their skin condition eczema the reason for this is their skin just doesn to moisture and as the skin begins to lose water it becomes dry and the skin barrier starts to suffer people with eczema have a tendency towards an impaired skin barrier they just don keep bacterial pathogens allergens and irritants out of the skin and therefore they are more susceptible to irritation and sensitivity from products but also changes in the environmental moisture like when the winter comes and the heaters come on and the humidity drops so these are all major factors in eczema including eczema on the scalp and it flares so atopic dermatitis is a type of dermatitis and you may be wondering how does this differ from other types of dermatitis dermatitis is a term a catch-all term that really just means inflammation in the skin and there are many many different types of dermatitis in the skin atopic dermatitis is just one of them another type of dermatitis is seborrhoeic dermatitis or dandruff and if you have eczema on your scalp you may actually think that it when in fact it seborrheic dermatitis is a type of inflammatory skin condition of the scalp and which you have flaky scaly and often itchy patches throughout the scalp but it because products geared towards improving dandruff or seborrhoeic dermatitis actually can worsen eczema on the scalp quite a bit they can be very drying and irritating depending on the active ingredients they actually can worsen your your ex mind your scalp and make things worse not to mention picking or scratching at the eczema lifeWise makes it much much worse whenever you scratch the skin it responds by releasing more itching chemicals and more inflammatory mediators that prevent your skin from healing it though and telling somebody with eczema don blowing in someone them not to blink and can be incredibly uncomfortable and itchy and the compulsion to scratch is very very strong but unfortunately it scratching behavior that really is the gas pedal on eczema particularly in the scalp scratching the scalp can definitely worsen the eczema symptoms so I already alluded to the fact that atopic dermatitis or eczema on your scalp can trick you into thinking that it is another type of dermatitis seborrhoeic dermatitis or dandruff but it distinguish those two things however people with atopic dermatitis including rashes on their scalp are at an increased risk for developing another type of dermatitis called a contact dermatitis and this is where your haircare and scalp care products come into play contact dermatitis is a type of rash due to something that comes in contact with the skin people with atopic dermatitis are more likely to develop this because of their genetic tendency towards dry skin and their inherited defect in their skin barrier they don keep those contact irritants and contact allergens out of the skin as well and therefore they developing contact dermatitis in other words it is not uncommon to have both conditions atopic dermatitis or eczema which you are born with the tendency towards and contact dermatitis which has been caused by things in the environment that come into contact with the skin so it however it you have both or one or the other because the treatment for contact dermatitis relies on avoiding whatever the ingredient or product is that comes in contact with your skin and causes irritation or that you are allergic to that you have become sensitized to you and subsequently allergic to and the way to tease all of these things out is to see your dermatologist to evaluate your scalp dermatitis and figure out exactly which scalp dermatitis you have do you in fact have maxima or is it something else maybe you already have a diagnosis of eczema or atopic dermatitis so you suspicious that your scalp rash is your eczema still important to see your dermatologist to rule out that uh not that you haven contact dermatitis which you are at risk for and in order for your scalp eczema to improve that important part of getting better and and moving forward there are some common things that you may be coming into contact with though that could be aggravating your eczema on your scalp either through irritation or something that you have become sensitized to and allergic to you one of the most common ingredients are combination of ingredients that people become irritated by or sensitized you whether they have eczema or atopic dermatitis or not is fragrance fragrance is pervasive in skin care products I always feel a strong compulsion to point that out to you guys and encourage everyone to make every effort to avoid using it in personal care products and for people with eczema it definitely can be a be a real problem and fragrance goes by a lot of names it doesn the ingredient list there are many different compounds which the immune system recognizes as fragrance and causes and you know does not like so I gonna list those down below in the description box for you guys I listed them in other videos but I always think it put that down below so don the label free of synthetic fragrance that doesn fragrance free and that not even a relevant statement unless you prefer natural fragrance in terms of what you you if you have eczema if you to avoid fragrance it doesn it common set of ingredients or a common set of ingredients is going to be preservatives preservatives are really important ingredients in skin care and hair care products because they prevent the product from becoming contaminated with mold and with bacteria like Pseudomonas that could cause a lot of problems for you but some preservatives are particularly more likely to be irritating or sensitizing one of the most common preservatives to cause problems for people is one called methyl isothiocyanate Lauro isöthe isin alone i will list this down below in the description box but in terms of the scalp it because this ingredient is frequently present in a lot of shampoos and conditioners another ingredient that is commonly present in many many conditioners is coca metal propyl betaine this is another ingredient that people can be be bothered by and also a class of ingredients called alkyl glucosides that are frequently in a lot of shampoos and conditioners they go by the names Dessel glucoside for example those two can cause problems outside of shampoos and conditioners you your hair dyes to worry about hair dyes have something called para phenylenediamine and not many hair dyes do and they can they are definitely a common common source of scalp eczema is in people scalp dermatitis contact dermatitis - para phenylenediamine also you have the harsh surfactants and poses and conditioners they can just dry out your scalp and cause irritation most notably sodium lauryl sulfate is very drying and can cause a lot of irritation again in your personal and your shampoos and conditioners be aware of not only fragrance but essential oils which are basically fragrance but are added because they may have some potential beneficial properties but carry a huge risk and one of the most common that I see in shampoos and conditioners is tea tree oil tea tree oil is out of oftentimes for kind of a natural antibacterial effect or for improving scalene as use a shampoo or conditioner that has tea tree oil in it when did back that can be worsening your skin your scalp dermatitis and another common ingredient in shampoos and conditioners is menthol menthol is added to a tingling sensation make you you know kind of think that the product is doing something but it irritating to the scalp the people with eczema or atopic dermatitis likewise another tingling agent it peppermint so you have to be conscientious of your shampoos conditioners and hair care products and the best products for people going through this you still need to shampoo their hair and condition their hair and maintain their hair are in my opinion the vanity cream brand they make a fragrance free shampoo a fragrance free conditioner product like a shampoo that is free of common allergens and irritants so that recommend people to start in Canada you guys have cleaner but always ask your treating dermatologist or your health care provider what brands they would recommend because they are going to be more familiar with what is available in your countries in your areas and your towns what have you you know I can really always give you the most global skin care product recommendations you know I available here in the States but ask your dermatologist or your health care provider they can appropriately advise but do you know that hair care products are common allergens and irritants for the scalp and then what are you doing to your hair are you somebody who blow dries or heats tells your hair if you go to the have your hair colored are they putting you under that blow drying helmet thing they can really dry out your scalp quite a bit and exacerbate scalp eczemas and the symptoms of itch and discomfort your bathing practices are really important not only for scalp eczema but for the rest of the skin of your body 4x and off if you take long hot showers this the hot water can strip your natural oils deprive your skin of even more moisture and can lead to loss of water from the skin and excessive dryness and flares of eczema if you in there too long the exposure the long exposure to water can also dry out the skin dilute out your natural moisturizing factor and precipitate flares so keep the showers short no more than 10 minutes and use lukewarm water which is not the most appealing thing I realize in the winter months but it is it is the best choice for your for your eczema and then also are you somebody who scrubs a lot in the scalp in an attempt to mechanically exfoliate your scalp that actually could be aggravating an underlying eczema so back off on the aggressive scrubbing and maybe you shampoo too frequently as well with the drying shampoo that could be exacerbating your your eczema mice personally I shampoo my hair daily but that doesn many people with eczema that can actually worsen your scalp dermatitis and so it makes more sense to try and space out your shampooing to every other night or maybe even a few nights a week some people just don their hair as frequently and it helps their X not to not do so so those are kind of the tips and tricks about atopic dermatitis or eczema on the scalp but number one tip is don scalp dermatitis is one thing or that your scalp itch is due to one thing it could be a couple of things so always start by seeing a dermatologist there is a differential diagnosis for itchy scaly red and blamed patches on the scalp and by differential diagnosis I mean there is a list things that this could be number one we talked about atopic dermatitis also number two contact dermatitis which we talked about number three separate dermatitis or dandruff which we talked about but also tinny at what on the scalp can cause scalp dermatitis and itching and head lice I have a video on head lice by the way but just be head lice can happen in adults it restricted to school children and it definitely can be incredibly itchy if you have head lice so you know there there going on really important to get the right diagnosis so you get on the path to treatment and getting better I hope this video is helpful to you guys check the description box I will list some of my favorite fragrance free shampoos conditioners hair care products for you all but do you know there list of products because if you are allergic to something the key is avoiding that allergen or irritant so I can we all meet your needs but it starting point and I encourage you to see your dermatologist to understand really what video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen and subscribe I guys tomorrow [Music]	Success

compounds that are soothing may help ward off oxidative stress it has niacinamide which you all know I love um it is a B vitamin that redness dark spots it has anti-aging benefits it barrier it may help in warding off skin yellowing as it relates to photo damage and it also is just very soothing if you have irritation prone skin as the name implies it has centella in it which is a botanic ingredient extracts from that are very anti-inflam flammatory soothing May support barrier recovery beta glue can super hydrating allantoin is very soothing it has die potassium gariz which comes from Licorice and is also an ingredient that is good for redness dark spots is anti-inflammatory may help soothe eczema prone skin overall I really don anything bad to say about this moving on to a product I have been using every single day in my morning skincare routine for the past month rather enjoying is in tre Chestnut aha 8% clear Essence so this is an exfoliating liquid with Alpha hydroxy acids specifically glycolic and lactic acid now I have been using this in my morning routine lately I have been doing a moisturizing mask that I just put on first thing in the morning leave on and then rinse off those of you who watch the Vlogs know what I that off with just plain water um I pat dry my skin a bit and two damp skin I apply just one pump of this and I kind of paint it on with my finger it is a liquid so the alpha hydroxy acids help to exfoliate dry rough skin texture they can help hasten the clearance of dark spots really good ingredients to consider incorporating into your routine if you have keratosis pilaris on the face as a matter of fact I think this is a great product for that condition if you cheeks and it just improving the look of sun damage to perhaps incorporate an alpha hydroxy acid product into your routine after I apply it in my morning routine well I put on a hydrating serum on over it and of course sunscreen you definitely want to be protecting your skin from the Sun as I pointed out in my recent video on mistakes you are making with your glycolic acid skin care a mistake is not protecting your skin from the Sun glycolic acid does make your skin a bit more sensitive to UV rays you are more predisposed to getting a sunburn while you using it you know to improve dark spots sun damage the last thing you want to do is make that worse by slacking on your sunscreen as far as the exfoliating that you get from this it is not it is not wimpy um on my face never experienced any irritation with it I have felt like my skin is a bit smoother I using it on my neck from time to time and as I pointed out and I pointed out in my glycolic acid video you know next skin is delicate it is a lot more prone to irritation with exfoliants and I definitely did experience a little bit of dryness on the neck when introducing it into my routine on a daily basis to my neck also a bit of dryness um around my ears cuz a little bit got you know back here so it definitely is an exfoliant for sure but I was able to you know get rid of that dryness right away with just moisturizing the neck um and it wasn problems but be be conscientious of introducing it slowly that kind of outcome will vary from person to person quite a bit in addition to the benefits that I already explained around Alpha hydroxy acids another benefit behind them is that they are hygroscopic so they may also help in improving the moisture content in your skin so it itself can exfoliate on its own better it extract which are anti-inflammatory um and it has masso side which comes from cantella also an antioxidant that may help ward off um oxidative stress that is damaging to lipid membrane so you know when you go out and we are exposed to all the pollution especially those of you like myself who live in a city there then it anti-inflammatory good for redness and dark spots and it also has panthenol which is moisturizing I have rather enjoyed this and I would definitely um repurchase it like I said in my video on uh glycolic acid mistakes not everyone necessarily needs to make glycolic acid a permanent fixture in their routine and for me personally I do find that um it kind of thing where it makes an appearance in my routine when I want to try out a product to review for you guys um or I want to see how it is but it necessarily something that is a must for me but that being said if you are looking to pursue an alpha hydroxy acid this is a great product overall I don have any problem with it just follow my tips in my recent video so you don make any glycolic acid mistakes uh and hopefully you know that video helps you out I the next one I neutral on so far it biome complex this is an ampule so it of a thinner consisten compared to like a moisturizer I have been using this every night in my nighttime skincare routine throughout January so when I get out of the shower you know I my face or whatever I get out of the shower pat dry but my skin is still damp I apply a full dropper Worth to my entire face neck so this has ferments now ferments in theory enrich for via the fermentation process enrich for anti-inflammatory compounds and and may also in some cases improve the bioavailability of certain ingredients that outcome is highly variable so don put too much stock in it but this has bifida ferment lysate basically probiotics um bifida ferment filtrate sacchromyces ferment and lactococcus ferment late these things may also potentially Aid in improving barrier recovery now in addition to those ingredients this also has niacinamide again egcg which is an antioxidant that comes from green tea definitely has some evidence to support its inclusion in skin care for warding off oxidative stress that damages your skin and contributes to inflammation as well as you know premature skin aging copper peptide in it which you know copper peptides they may offer some anti-inflammatory benefit they may potentially stimulate collagen synthesis but the devil is in the details a lot of gaps and knowledge around Copper peptides and it argireline is that peptide that allegedly acts like botox I have a whole video on this but you know the the likelihood that it actually gets into your skin to localize to the neuromuscular Junction is very unlikely at any rate it is an ingredient that helps with moisture content in the skin so far I just find that it liquid I suppose you could say that layers under my moisturizer just fine I fermented skinc care product I have ever used no um is it bad is it good I mean it I have received feedback from some of you who watch my Vlogs that you didn start seeing any kind of you know major difference with this product until two bottles in so um I and consider going forward with another bottle definitely not something I would call a favorite Holy Grail and certainly not a fail now this next product I actually have not used at all in January I was using this behind the scenes primarily I want to say throughout the end of October November and and December maybe November and December a good amount of time I use this I stopped using it um prior to using this mono bifida product I just talked about and it is from M Love Now M love uh as you guys know I love their fadeaway brightening serum so I was really excited to see they came out with a peptide serum peptide Squad collagen renewal serum uh this has matrial 3000 those are two peptides that in theory help with um improving collagen production I say in theory because these are largely industry-based claims we need more research to prove that it also has copper peptides which again may help in building new collagen may have anti-inflammatory properties now rice peptides so rice peptides um contain enzymes in them that in theory inhibit collagen degradation um so it that so those are sort of the peptides in this and then it also has argireline as well and that peptide that you know allegedly acts like botox and then in addition to those peptides it has niacinamide again panthinol which is hydrating it has hyaluronic acid which is also hydrating ceramides good for the Skin Barrier hoba oil an Amant alant toin anti-inflammatory and green tea to ward off oxidative stress I rather enjoyed this product I found it was very hydrating very soothing felt like my skin looked a little brighter while I was using it however I did not find for me personally that the outcomes that I obtained with this were that significant to Warrant me repurchasing in this I rather enjoyed it I did find that it was beneficial but not to the extent that would lead me to repurchase it and actually I found that it was very similar to my experience with the ordinaries multi peptide serum the ordinary multi peptide serum also is a copper peptide serum in contrast to this it has a few differences in the ingredients but overall like the experience using it um and the outcomes very similar the ordinary one is a little less expensive so for me the serum that I like and we from M love is their Fade Away brightening serum as opposed to this you know I get a little bit more in terms of brightening with the fadea away but if you copper peptides work for you in your routine you can attest to the fact that it is a good product and you know it didn any problems now that it out there now last but not least is a product that I actually purchased a long time ago sometime in 2023 we off and on for months and months and months um and I through it I amount of it enough to really tell you about it at length it is a brand that you know is kind of notorious for their sunscreens uh Ela MD cleanser now this is a product that you would use to remove makeup water resistant sunscreen kind of like an oil cleanser or a cleansing balm but just as the name implies it comes out as a thick Rich clear colorless gel kind of feels a little bit like that product from Johnson and Johnson their baby oil gel if you know what I talking about sort of like that um as you rub it over the surface of your skin Works nicely over the eyelid area I will say as well to Glide over your eyelash Es as you do that um your makeup starts to break up it starts to you know melt into almost this oily consistency and it really does you know what it breaks up the film of cosmetic residue when you add water there is a little bit of creaminess to the product but not as much emulsification as I typically note with a cleansing oil like one of the Japanese or Korean cleansing oils I always raving about or one of the cleansing balms I but it does get a little creamy um rinsed off fine in the shower and then of course I do a double cleanse so I actually wash my face after after that oil cleanse step um and in this case you know I would wash my face and never had raccoon eyes with this which is kind of my lipus test as to how good any type of makeup removal approach is is does it leave me with raccoon eyes like is their mascara residue under my eyes that I then have to come in with some other method to try and remove this did not so it works um it has lactobacillus pumpkin ferment again Theory May enrich for anti-inflammatory compounds it has turmeric root extract which may also be anti-inflammatory it does what it best product I removal no but it like I said it does what it to do I think for the price though I going to stick with a cleansing oil or a cleansing balm but if you are curious about this want to know what it what it looks like how it acts how it performs there you go it product everything I this video is you know good nice middle of the road not you know an extreme up oh my God yes or oh my God stay away right so I think moving forward I really like doing this style of video for you all instead of you know a favorites fails let me know what you think if you like this as well just giving me an opportunity to share with you a lot more of what I actually do try out because over the years I have tried out many things and then I sit there thinking to myself well how am I going to share this with the audience am I going to do a video all about the ingredient or am I going to do a collection of different products similar to this and compare and contrast and sometimes I just have anal analysis par is and I never end up talking about the product and it dang I mean you know I went through all that testing for nothing so this kind of allows me to just say what I want to say about the product get it to you guys in a video form and move on let me know if that sounds good to you I hope you enjoyed this video and I hope you have a fantastic February and that your 2024 oh my gosh uh is going well if you like this video give it a thumbs up up share it with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen And subscribe I to you guys tomorrow [Music] bye	Success
Skincare Product Reviews Of The Month | February 2024	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j78Ecq8y4v8	Dr Day	well hey guys happy March 1st today I going to be sharing with you some skin care some beauty product reviews of things I February which went by at a rapid Pace now I used to do monthly favorites and fails videos but if you missed last month year to basically just have an opportunity to share with you all reviews of various products that I test out and maybe never have an opportunity to chat with you about and a dedicated video first of all a new moisturizer that I have seen in the drugstore It Is by luer so luer is a brand that I frequently get asked about what do you think of luer I know them to be good moisturizers but personally I really used one and so I decided to try their new advanced therapy lotion and I really like it as a basic body moisturizer it has Oak kernel oil in it and I love any moisturizing product any skin care product for that matter with any type of ingredient from oats whether it be colloidal oatmeal oat kernel oil I just find that my skin really appreciates oats they have a variety of beneficial compounds in them for barrier recovery for soothing dry itchy skin they hydrating I mean really an underrated family of ingredients from oat so I like that aspect of it it has mineral oil which is a amazing ingredient in a body moisturizer it also has glycerin which is very hydrating free of fragrance it does have a bit of an aroma to it it does what it moisturizes the skin it is a heavier consistency and it builds itself as being fast absorbing but I have found in my experience using it um as a body moisturizer that it does take a bit of time to absorb it stays white on the skin for a while which I don importantly the following morning cuz I moisturize at night after getting out of the shower the following morning I don have a filmy residue of moisturizer all over the place so it truly does absorb into the skin and provide a nice hydrating protective film to reduce water loss but it doesn waxy residue on the skin surface because it is a heavier consistency a thicker richer formula it know that everyone is going to enjoy trying it on the face some people might but I always point out you know it worth trying a moisturizer for the body on the face because if it ends up working out for you great because this one is heavier I suspect it may be uncomfortable for some of you especially if you have Oiler skin or you have rosacea May precipitate flush heavier moisturizers can be aggravating for some people but by and large I really like it I like the price point and I like the pump I complained about this to you all before but some pump packaging or honestly some packaging in general is just not it just doesn and it may not meet your needs some some pumps are too slow to release and it takes all day to get the moisturizer amount that you need as I said I moisturize from head to toe one thing I need for my body moisturizer is the ability to efficiently dispense product so that I can get the moisturizer on my body in a in a timely manner I don want have to sit there and wait for the pump to release in a slow fashion it take forever and I want a good amount of product I always complain on the flip side that some products put out too much product but when it a lot more surface area that we targeting I need it to give me give me a good good amount out so all in all I really liked it a lot moving on a sunscreen from userin I with you all in my Vlogs off and on I been trying it out they have a new line yes the immersive hydration Line This is their daily lotion SPF 30 it moisturizer with hyaluronic acid hyaluronic acid is is great for improving the moisture content and Skin helping to support barrier function and with consistent use and improved water retention and Skin better water content allows for the enzymes there to function better so that you have better cell turnover plus this is a sunscreen so it skin from the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation it is nice and moisturizing it is an organic AK chemical sunscreen so there cast to this I did not experience any burning or stinging around my it is not water resistant so it as an everyday facial moisturizer if you sport working up a sweat outside I suggest choosing a water resistant formula and this is good nothing wrong with it but a product that has really been wowing me is the lar Ro POS cop plast gel now I have been a longtime fan of their cop plast balm as a skin protection it bur if you have a lot of peeling flaking irritation from a new topical or from getting a cosmetic peel it Barrier cream great skin protectant excellent for reducing chafing but they came out with a gel and so I decided to try the gel form and at first putting it just on my skin I was like I don need to go back to the I need to go back to the bomb I Barrier cream vibes from this it doesn really I to reduce chafing as well as as well as the the seea plast balm because you have to understand caast balm is almost like a diaper rash cream for adults to use on their face um yes you can use diaper rash cream on your face if you want to but it this is the the coplas balm has dimethicone in it so it absorbing but the gel isn giving that here been blowing my mind all right I using this Lor B copl gel around my eyes for a couple couple of weeks now and I have really seen a visible Improvement and just the overall look of Fine Lines around my eyes as well as I feel like my under eyes are a little bit tighter and brighter and smoother more radiant it a glycerin based skin protectant which is you know glycerin is really hydrating but I just put a little tiny bit there and you know rub it in what I like about it is it also creates this lightweight film on the skin surface that really helps protect eyelids from any kind of irritant getting on there and further like drying out your eyes I impressed with this not sponsored this is fragrance free it skin protectant like for dry irritated hands or chapped lips chapped skin it not as good as their seea plast balm but as an eye cream it it on my lips a few times it is nice and hydrating but I an eye cream and I don I just use my regular moisturizer around my face but this as an eye cream I been impressed it has made a huge difference in the appearance of the skin around my eyes well by huge I mean like I see a difference there difference in that the my under eye area looks smoother brighter and the little Fine Lines around my eyes are a lot less obvious this formula has glycerin it has p anol it has dimethicone in it a skin protectant it also has hyaluronic acid and what I like about it around the eyes is that it feel heavy it just feels like a nice hydrating protective film and it doesn run around my eyes and feel oily I also tried putting this on the lips that sweet taste from the glycerin whatever I mean don it is safe to use on your lips if you want to I prefer to use petroleum jelly cavey healing oil on my lips to this but yes you certainly could use it that way product number four is another one that has kind of blown my mind quite a bit it is a hair care product it is the L ever pure Simply Clean I think it called elastic fiber hair mask I mean I just can mask is the Simply Clean elastic fiber mask uh look how Rich the formula is it really does a number on your hair strands if you you not regret this decision wow wow my hair has gotten long again using this hair mask it looks my hair when I use the mask it silky it the mirror especially you know out of the side eye and pour lighting I did I get some kind of keratin hair treatment you know Biolage has a great hair mask this from L Biolage you know if you go back some of my older videos hair care products I loving always would talk about Biolage this new one from L the biage it and I love the consistency of this product elastic fiber it kind of like snail M that you get this stringy stuff but it really envelops all of the string my one gripe but I mean it a jar which I find to be a little challenging to use in the shower you know I turn the water off of course when I it tightly the jar lid tightly enough so that the water from the shower doesn make its way in there but all in all highly recommend trying this out if you have long hair I think if you have short hair it would be kind of useless I don feel as though people who have really short hair unless you have curly hair you know condition conditioner may not be necessary for you I use conditioner to cut down on Tangles frizz and to improve manageability but when I is Superfluous for my routine it may be for you it is a really thick really rich and it does not have a scent to it it does have rosemary leaf oil so if you allergic to fragrance you might have a problem with that but otherwise um there really been amazing the last product I want to share with you guys is in the realm of makeup it products I have this now elaborate mascara routine that I shared with you all in the Vlogs couple of Vlogs ago so I got these mascaras from winky loocks I wanted to try winky Lux I I have to admit the packaging rope me in have beautiful packaging um you know the flowers on the boxes pretty shiny so I decided to try their mascaras not disappointed the mascara primer goes on pink dries down clear and colorless it does a good job of creating a base that the mascara will adhere to better but it also lengthens your lashes so it it creates a base to build off of for lash lengthening then on the top I come in with their mascara and that mascara gives full and long okay but not clumpy so I like that then they have this little tiny mascara called detail oriented if you want to elongate each individual bottom lash this is the this is the tool this is the product that you need to try because I have tried mascaras that have this fine that offer this fine applicator for bottom lashes and I here in past videos this one really beats though you can actively see your lash L getting long you can see you can you can see lashes that you didn before you know there little teeny tiny baby lashes here that are practically invisible pull this down over it and all of a sudden There like long it really it really does a good job wear it throughout the day I don doesn so taking it off I you I was using the um Ela m D Oil and gel cleanser as a cleansing balm I reviewed that in the last monthly video by the way I finished that I albolene myeller cleansing milk as a first step that product I other videos before but that has been dissolving all of this all all of all of these three different mascaras all right y throughout February my opinions on them hope this video was helpful to you all make sure you come back on April 1st April Fool installment because I out products as well that I entertained including in this video but I want to just keep it to five products or five categories since

Skincare We Need To Discuss | Axis-Y, pH-In, Isntree, Prequel, Bullfrog	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atOM-8P_Vmo	Dr Day	well hey guys happy April 1st promise I jokes on you all but today as promised I month in review basically this is a new series I first of the month I share with you guys five skinc care products that I trying out just quick little mini reviews first of all isn their sunscreens I I finally got my hands on I purchased it from Stana it is their onion new pair sunscreen purple in color yall know I love is in tree sunscreens it is a technically a hybrid sunscreen so it has organic commonly referred to as chemical sunscreen active ingredients and it also has titanium dioxide which is an inorganic otherwise known as mineral active sunscreen ingredient the purple color helps neutralize discoloration now it does have titanium dioxide so there a little hint of a white cast with this it also has niacinamide which is good for redness hyperpigmentation it anti-inflammatory helpful for the moisture barrier and it has onion bulb extract which actually is the ingredient in maderma that scar gel there is a small bit of research I suggesting this ingredient may be helpful for scars it it definitely not greasy however it is a bit on the shiny side which I don I find that as I wear it that dries down and I really really like it a lot but it is a little more shiny in comparison to the hyaluronic acid watery sunel it fragrance-free easy to tolerate around the eyes for me didn that regard doesn purple color while it neutralizing dis coloration I think it might also appeal to teens twins children who are you know kind of on the fence maybe about wearing sunscreen that might appeal to them and motivate them to want to use it because it fun this next sunscreen is an oldie an oldie but a goodie and that it actually a sunscreen I wore back in the and I came across it on Amazon and the company still exists is still making the sunscreen now it does have fragrance keep in mind I was not aware that you know fragrance might be a potential allergen or irtin um so I didn didn remember being blown away by it back in the 9s when I was wearing it it brand bullfrog it gel this is an organic suncreen otherwise commonly known as chemical it is an amazing texture it really really is a quick gel it lightweight and it doesn whatsoever water resistant 80 minutes so this is this is a sunscreen for people who are Outdoors sweating and cannot be bothered cannot stand sunscreen won for hair bearing areas as you put it on the skin it sinks in almost instantaneously now it does have alcohol in it which a lot of people worry about because it in some cases can be drying but it it a really fast absorbing non- greasy formula honestly if you doing Sport and stuff and you don the feel of sunscreen I wish it were fragrance free but otherwise I I think that back in the this came out in back in the and you would think that we would have more Innovation but honestly I I rarely encounter sunscreens like this for the body the other one that is kind of like this but thicker in gel consistency is copper tone has this cooling gel sunscreen that I also recommend it too has fragrance in it you know we spring now but summer will be here before you know it if you to the beach or whatever consider giving this a try and it the scent is like like a light Citrus Aroma number three is a brand that this actually came in PR so this was sent to me it is from a brand called phin um which if you while you know I brand indeed Labs they company you can buy them at Ulta though I which I have purchased in the past um like their hyon amazing um but they started this brand uh that is a three-step skin care routine marketed to people with acne prun skin but honestly I think this line would be fine for pretty much anyone out there um cuz it it hydrating moisturizer but what I want to talk about specifically today is the mask now the mask in my opinion is just a heavier thicker consistency moisturizer um that they instruct you to use a couple of times a week at nighttime and it moisturizer because it has ingredients in it that are helpful for soothing your skin and helping with barrier recovery but it moisturizer and not really a mask in the sense of the word and that you actually going to rinse it off with a short contact when I think of mask mask I think of short contact therapy but these days a lot of things are build as masks that are really like moisturizers or glorified lip balms so what exactly is in this it ingredient list San and aoan glycerin which is very hydrating they call attention to Cinnamon bark extract which may be anti-inflammatory but really what has struck me about this particular product of the three is the consistency is really interesting it of a consistency to it that would make you think that you the skin like it viscous it spreads very slowly on the skin it not the kind of thing that you would want to put on in the morning as a morning moisturizer you won able to put sunscreen on over it shortly after using it um and it cause peeling of like makeup if you wore makeup I think it you have a lot of irritation and the nice thing about this is it is meant basically to help with barrier support and maintaining the acid mantle when that gets disrupted the pH of your acid mantle the enzymes in the skin don prone to irritation which is an issue people deal with as they topical acne treatments in particular that can be drying and irritating um but the formulation overall it leans away from oilier textures and consistencies now they sent it to me I using the whole line and the whole line is fine but I specifically want to talk talk about this mask it which I think is expensive the cleanser while nice I think is a little too expensive I want to say it was like $35 on Amazon I can moisturizer is so of the three to me the mask is like the most unique I to you know I something that is similar to the moisturizing mask which in my opinion is just a moisturizer and I really can of a similar texture so I just wanted to talk about it because I have found to be a really nice product overall I know a lot of you all are in Canada so if you have access to this line definitely give it a try like I have nothing bad to say about it other than the price point is a little steep but I will say that this mask in particular is something pretty unique okay now number four is a cleanser so I purchased all of the skincare products from prequel this is a brand that I get a lot of ads for over on Instagram and Tik Tok and I seen a lot of comments asking me to review it so I did so check out the full brand review or if you are interested there are time stamps in that video so if you particular product then you know you can skip around but one product from the line in particular that I continue to use a lot I mean on a daily basis and rather enjoy is the Ganser this is their Gel Cleanser now I have a tendency to really prefer gel cleansers just I find the sensory experience of them to be rather enjoyable so I like the texture of this I like the ingredients it has glycerin which is hydrating it has oat which also is hydrating and has a mild cleansing ability to it and it has this oligosaccharide inulin which is delivered to the skin via liposomes and this can help after you rinse the cleanser off it can help with sustain hydration of skin outermost layer so I that I can use it by itself without necessarily needing to use an oil cleanser first to remove water resistant sunscreen or makeup like it passes the mascara test I have found for me and the type of makeup that I wear currently I primarily wear cream Shadows Cream Blush from Meritt and I also am wearing the mascaras that I shared in last month monthly reviews from winky Lux and this takes all of that off and and this is also a body wash so I in the shower and it mean I have atopic dermatitis so I try and be real conservative with body wash how much I use um I body wash I don feel filmy this is great um it it rinses off the skin easily and leaves the skin feeling hydrated so of everything from the line and they have a lot of of great products objectively but this is one that I have really really continued to enjoy last but not least is a product that I got in one of the Korean Advent calendars from the brand axis Y axis y peel it is a polyhydroxy acid that is good for gently exfoliating but also helping with hydration and then it has some fruit extracts which you know I have some reservations with especially papaya fruit extract um it can help soften dry flaky builtup skin and help with exfoliating but can also be irritating so there also in that Peter Thomas Roth thing so I thought why not give this a try like the Peter Thomas Roth thing that I didn cucumber in it which can be hydrating um this has centella in it which is a botanic ingredient that has compounds which are anti-inflammatory and have been shown to be helpful for healing this product so far has been okay um not mind-blowingly amazing but not bad either uh I don like the packaging because it a pain to pump out enough product out of that little pump like the the the aperture of the stem of the pump is so small that you get little tiny Squirts and you have to pump pump pump to get enough to go all over your face um so it strange it has a very chemical Aroma to it there not care for that at all it or anything but it smell so good but once you put it on the skin uh you don only leave it on for you know 10 roughly 10 minutes at the most and then you rinse it off so I have continued to use that I through the product so I feel comfortable sharing my experience with you guys about it at this point um it it is like I said is mind-blowing this type of product ordinarily might be suited to someone who wants to utilize a polyhydroxy acid um in a short contact approach my preference in terms of products like this however is from aino they have a calm and restore polyhydroxy acid exfoliator that is in a more creamy formula as opposed to a gel like this but is a similar short contact therapy approach that product has no fragrance or weird fruit extracts so I would recommend that over this but this is not bad and I will use it up but that where we stand with that product for those of you who watch me do the Korean advent calendar unboxings if you wanted an update there you have it all right y of March April is here I hope you guys had a fantastic March a fantastic Easter this past weekend if you celebrate anyway y in the comments what skin care you have been trying out over the past you know few months weeks whatever that you have enjoyed I hope you guys like this video if so give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow [Music] bye	Success
Affordable Skincare Product Reviews | Dermatologist Tested	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fi98b3w_FFM	Dr Day	a new month is here yet again today I going to share with you my five skincare products of the month things I tried out over the month of April and what I think about them in no particular order I gave Dove body wash a new chance if you have been watching any of my Vlogs over the years you know I a little about Dove body washes I much prefer their shampoos and conditioners in my experience a lot of their body washes kind of end up just feeling filmy I just it really care for them so I saw this eczema prone skincare body cleanser with one of my favorite ingredients colloidal oatmeal I thought I have to give this a try because one of my go-to body wash recommendations is the aino fragrance free colloidal oatmeal body wash it great and I want to see how does this stack up all right so like I said it has colloidal oatmeal in it which is really good for eczema it soothing and anti-inflammatory compounds it actually has some natural detergent action to it so it and it forms this hydrating film on the skin surface that helps with barrier function it comes out and feels more like a cream or lotion it does lather pretty well there whatsoever and it I put conditioner on my body did I put lotion on my body is this a body wash but you do get some lather with it it very creamy I primarily use body wash to the skin folds and I do like that this rinses off of the skin pretty easily it doesn and it really does leave the skin feeling hydrated yet clean there strip feeling with it I think if you have eczema prone skin this is a great option but it consistency texture and the way it performs is unique to say the least just in how it doesn like a body wash but if you are dealing with irritation sensitivity on the body you have a tendency towards dry skin or maybe you have very mature skin you know with age our Skin moisture and defend against irritants declines with declining barrier function especially in women around you know per menopause and postmenopausal skin states with the decline in estrogen are a lot more vulnerable to irritation so I think this would be a good option in that regard right now you can get it at Walmart for I believe $11 which it the least expensive and it most expensive kind of somewhere in the middle of the road so I like it I like it I like it much better than the traditional Dove body wash and so yeah I would use it again probably one of the reasons why I like it so much is the colloidal oatmeal I find my skin just really gets along well with it okay I have two products here to chat with you guys about from EOS uh which stands for evolution of smooth I just learned that this second in time so this is a brand that is notorious for their lip balms a few years ago several people developed an irritant or allergic contact dermatitis from their lip balms which is not uncommon with lip balm in general but they kind of got called out for it even though honestly this is a problem like I said that can happen with pretty much any lip care product but but they other body care products none of which I have ever tried so first thing I noticed um because it was on iata a rebate app I used suggested um I buy this it shea butter 24-hour moisture body lotion fragrance free with seven nourishing oils and butters this is a fragrance-free body moisturizer I also comfortably use this on the face it pretty No Nonsense it has shea butter and petrol lotum and mineral oil all of which are great at reducing water loss from the skin um and that pretty much about it as far as ingredients of note it does not have niacinamide so if you niacinamide it burns or stings you might consider giving this a try these days it find nide free skin care nide fantastic ingredient as a side note I love it I adore it I incorporate it but for those of you who don it can be quite difficult to to get away from from him a minor inconvenience I do not quite care for this pump head it little too stubby and makes getting the product out efficiently quite challenging I do like this little um aesthetic divot here for picking up the bottle I don of nice to have a little something something there to grab on to I would definitely repurchase this again I like it it I really enjoy it now what was it a few months ago I shared with you guys how I have been trying out Lu therapy lotion and um I like that product I finished it as a side note but one of the things you talked about it is um I didn care so much for how it kind of went on a little streaky and was slow to absorb those things about it didn enough to say oh I don would never use this again cuz otherwise I really like it and thought it was a fair price an effective moisturizer well I decided to try their daily moisture lotion just to see how does it compare is it basically the same thing just a different color label and it actually is pretty similar in terms of performance but I prefer the consistency of this above and beyond the advanced therapy it is much more uh luxurious lightweight it does not do that streaky thing it not waxy like the other one I prefer this one it has shea butter and it has oat kernel oil I think one thing about the other one um is that it has titanium dioxide in it which is fine it whitening ingredient um and this does not and I think that is what made all the difference in my personal liking of this over the other one when I walk into the drugstore again seeking to buy another lubm lotion I this one probably not the advanced therapy one unless they that would be my second choice they both great they both get the job done they fragrance free I just like the Aesthetics of how this applies a little bit better but otherwise fantastic so I wanted to update you guys on that because um lubm is a brand that I haven wanted to start trying some other brands of things that you guys ask about hence the EOS choice speaking of EOS now you know I absolutely adore the tree hut shave oil I I mean that was a 2023 skin care favorite um the scents on those are wonderful but not headache inducing they don overall formulation of that product for shaving is wonderful and I had never encountered a product quite like that until until I Bata suggested to me the e OS cashmere bikini shave oil serum this is in my opinion just as good as the tree hut one it product similar consistency and performs in all of the favorable attributes of the tree hut shave oil this has a really nice Amber scent to it and I am real picky about Amber sometimes it can give me a headache other times I can enough of it so I really like the scent of this it it scent like the tree hut ones this does not linger on the skin so what is it about these shave oils that I personally like so much and why I think they fantastic in comparison to a shaved gel a shaved cream a shave lotion it really all in how they perform they easy to spread on the skin surface while you are in the shower trying to do your shaving and all your other body care needs in there with the water beaten down on you or trying to turn the water off and shave and rinse out the razor blade you know the choreography that shaving your legs in the shower trying to not Nick your ankles but you want to get out of there and get on with your life um all of that acrobatics aside the thing about these shave oils that I like so much is that they don a mess all over your shower you put them on the skin and they stay in place through the again choreography that is attempting to shave your legs in the shower they don shower wall but when it the shave residue off they come off nicely and importantly they leave the skin soft smooth sometimes I find certain shave Foams shav creams can almost be a little drying leave behind a film this is not the case with these shave oils whether it be tree hut or this one from EOS they are a much more sophisticated moisturizing shave experience in comparison in my opinion to a traditional shaving foam shaving cream shaving gel or shaving lotion the other thing I like about them is that I find they are better at reducing shave irritation um and I also like that in contrast to like a shaving cream these go on clear and colorless so you can see the hair that you need to cut a minor little difference in the different types of products but why that makes a difference for me especially is that it helps me see visually where I have already shaved and I don shaving the mult the same area multiple times which is a major contributing factor to shave irritation and ingrown hairs going over the same area multiple times is not doing you any favors but it doing this shower calisthenics with the shave Foams creams or whatever trying to you know not have it all go all over the place trying to not waste water but all you know you know the de deal you know the deal I would love to see a brand do a fragrance-free one of these because I think they could do it really nicely make it a nice experience for people and I think for people who are seeking to avoid fragrance they would really appreciate it because there there are really not many fragrance-free shav products out there they exist but there are few and far between and if you don there swoop in and one up what already exists and I really think this is an opportunity for a brand to do this and I hut coming out with fragrance-free anything people go to tree hut for their fragrances and they they come away from tree hut pleasantly surprised by the performance but EOS with this body lotion has established themselves as wanting to dip their toes in the fragrance-free Market maybe because of their history with getting so much negative attention around their lip balms maybe they see um you know they can perhaps bolster their image a bit by having some more fragrance-free options available to people with sensitive skin so EOS if you are watching this which I doubt um come out with a fragrance free version of this in this line you know the blue packaging and put oat kernel oil in it just trust me just trust me and it for me to have a stuff I video without sharing with you guys some sort of sunscreen that I have tried out because I sunscreens um running the gamut from drugstore all the way through Sephora we need to talk about what Coppertone has done here with their sport mineral 50 SPF 50 100% naturally sorbs zinc oxide this is a waterresistant zinc oxide sunscreen okay the naturally sourced thing is a bit of a out there thing zinc oxide is you know not something that skincare Brands my understanding I formulator but what I you know it there mining the zinc a lot of this is synthetic um so I naturally sourced claim If copper tone is in touch with a zinc mine somewhere I would love to hear about that um but as far as I know that seems a bit of a lofty claim and you I of people turn to zinc oxide or titanium dioxide because they have been Mis misled into thinking that these are natural and anything else is chemical and man-made in a lab somewhere and must be deadly when in reality none of these ingredients in Sun screens are deadly and the majority of them are man-made all that yammering aside this one there is definitely a white cast not as bad as some out there um that I used but it noticeable on my skin it makes me look gray and it gives kind of this Ashen dull look so if you have a deeper skin tone in my opinion it look worse um now if you have a very pale skin type you may be okay with this you may already be someone who say you and zinc oxide all mineral sunscreens is what you use and you don you might give this a try cuz it I said it run-of-the-mill average not not as bad as as many others and it is water resistant so that means it well under humid hot sweaty conditions of course you do need to reapply every 2 hours while you are outside participating in outdoor activ activities if you get in the water and go swimming once you get out tow dry the skin and reapply even if it is water resistant you still need to reapply and when you get in the water you need to reapply even sooner um because it does come off now one thing I will point out a lot of people are seeking a sunscreen that will not burn or sting around the eyes and I do often suggest in these cases especially for American sunscreens choose a zinc oxide Sun sunscreen for around the eyes if you have sensitivities to other sunscreens because the chemical sunscreens we have here more appropriately T termed organic they often burn sting cause your eyes to water um I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that we have fewer UV filters for our chemical sunscreens here so they end up putting you know I don know I the complete formulation uh explanation behind that but it is something that a lot of people deal with for the longest time for me I was attributed to oxybenzone but that being said oxybenzone has been removed from many sunscreens and occasionally I do still experience that myself so all that to say try a mineral sunscreen now if you non US Chemical sunscreen I shouldn say never but to my knowledge I can recall at least recently trying any non-american chemical sunscreen and having it burn or sing my skin let alone around my eyes causing blurry vision I Japan Korea Canada um Europe you know different countries in Europe and um I run into that issue as far as I can remember definitely not recently so keep that in mind because when I give out the the recommendation try a mineral sunscreen around the eyes it say that you have to use them there um it especially here in the US with what sunscreens we have they tend to be less likely to burn or sting it is on The Dewy side um okay that that I know a lot of people don for and it stays dewy it stays kind of shiny and dewy uh and so to what extent you sure I did not get it need peeling with this you know where the sunscreen rolls up off the surface of the skin and Peels and lifts up looks like peeling of a sweater I didn able to put makeup on over it although I was not able to camouflage or Rectify that grayish Hue um as a side note don mix stuff into mineral sunscreens in an effort to get rid of the white cast you will mess up the protection of the overall formula all right those are the Fast Five of the month uh no no I nonetheless let me know have you seen any of these at the grocery store drugstore um were you curious about them this has been my experience nothing here is so bad that I won of everything I about stuff I would repurchase I would repurchase the US shave oil for sure um I would especially if they they come out with other scents and especially if they come out with a fragrance free one um I would repurchase the dove eczema skin care um body wash I would repurchase the Lubriderm daily moisture lotion probably won repurchase the Coppertone sport mineral because personally I prefer a sport chemical sunscreen you know that preference I I I like them better I find that it a quick dry formula I love that bullfrog one I shared with you guys last month I would repurchase the EOS 24-hour moisture body lotion as well um you know it reach for it again is it my Holy Grail no but there hope this was informative to you guys and that you are having a great first day of the month or whenever you watching this I hope you day night whatever life are going swimmingly um if you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe I bye [Music]	Success
*NEW* EltaMD UV Clear & Daily Deep Tints | May 2024 Skincare	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gos-NBGd2Cg	Dr Day	well hey guys tomorrow is June 1st and so in today with you my skincare of the month monthly reviews of just some random products that I purchased and tried out throughout the month of May starting out is from elmd now if you following me for a while you know especially at the beginning of my channel I wore lmd sunscreens a lot I kind of drifted away from them over the past couple of years not because I don like them but there options nowadays in the drugstore and always new things coming out for me to try so I honestly don sunscreens that often anymore but I saw they came out with deep tinted versions of two really popular sunscreens that I UV clear and the UV daily now if you not familiar with these These are everyday sunscreens that are not water resistant so this isn product you you to the Beach or doing some kind of outdoor sport if that mind and you want an ltmd sunscreen go with their UV sport it all-time favorites now these are hybrid sunscreens they have zinc an inorganic sunscreen active ingredient okay mineral and they have uh octinoxate a chemical like a organic UV filter and I this before in my videos when it comes to a non- tinted sunscreens hybrid formulas kind of offer a little bit of the best to both worlds and that yes they have a mineral ingredient zinc but the cast tends to be a little bit easier to tolerate in comparison to an all mineral formula yes they have chemical active ingredients but they typically don sensitive skin who are usually sensitive to chemical sunscreens so they in that regard I have always recommended UV CLE and UV daily because they look really nice on the skin and in my opinion these are the quintessential matte formulas there is no shine with these sunscreens they lotion formula though so they moisturizing they don denaturant like many gel sunscreens that I recommend for oily skin types but in contrast to a lot of lotion cream formulas they are very Matt so much so that the UV clear in particular sometimes I find to be a bit too matte for my liking they pretty much look the same uh there much difference between the way either of these products looks on the skin whether it be the tinted ones or the non-tinted one uh UV clear and UV daily they look pretty similar the main difference that I think you guys would want to know about is that UV clear has niacinamide which is a wonderful ingredient for redness dark spots um the moisture barrier but some people are sensitive to it they don you UV daily on the other hand does not have niacinamide so that might help you out right there in terms of choosing between the two so the Deep tints I purchased these knowing full and well they probably were not going to truly work out for me and they necessarily going to look right on me but I wanted to give them a try anyway so we could see for ourselves what they really look like and they are quite a deep tint I will say this there difference in terms of how they look the clear and the daily are the same tint they look the same on the skin it deep tint um and they did a good job with the components that lead to the tint so the tint comes from Iron oxides and if you you know a lot of tinted sunscreens miss the mark and end up being orangey or too yellowish they just don natural um this ends up having I think it black Iron oxides and just the right amount of yellow so that it doesn out too orangey and I think it ends up giving a very natural um tint a very natural skin colored tint it ends up making me look like I have a sunless tanner on it just gives me a little bit of a tan look but I think if you have more of a medium skin tone I think it might actually work out for you now when it comes to the tint a point I want to make is that choosing a tinted sunscreen screen is a great idea if you are trying to fade hyperpigmentation you to hyperpigmentation because the tint comes from those iron oxides and we have come to learn that the iron oxides may be offering some protection against visible light which we have come to learn plays a big role in more stubborn hyperpigmentation in people with deeper skin tones right now on my face I have the UV clear on so this is what it looks like I have a little fake light on here here natural sunlight so like I said I kind of think for me personally it just looks like I have a little bit of like sunless tanner or bronzer on um and that being said if you and you want to have that on your face or to match you might try this I mean it does kind of on pal skin it does end up looking like you have some sort of sunless tanning product on speaking of sunscreens this month I also tried out I for longer than this past month but I reviewed it this month it bright reveal broadspectrum spf50 daily UV lotion I wanted to mention this again in today review this is a chemical sunscreen AKA organic so there this um but it is I really like it I think it feel for oily skin but man is it shiny I mean this is really shiny it like tin oxide micia in it that gives this shimmery look kind of a Radiance so it sunscreens I just chatted with you guys about no shine I mean I have one of them on right now whereas when I this my face is a lot shinier this has alcohol denat in it which makes it not greasy now because it has that alcohol denat in it some people may find it on the drying end I I didn find that to be the case this didn cause me any burning or stinging around my eyes it like the ltmd ones is not water resistant it though if you discoloration hyperpigmentation uneven skin tone you want to protect your skin and just brighten up overall skin tone I think you will perhaps enjoy this I also reviewed in that video the bright reveal one I talking points but if you were interested in their serum check that video out because it could save you some money watching that video next thing I want to talk to you guys about is a replacement option for those of you who liked the now discontinued vanny cream Zar this is a zp bar for zinc python from Burke Therapeutics fragrance-free mild cleansing bar with zinc pyone just like the vanny cream z bar um this is mild and gentle enough to use on your face as well as for the body and I have found this to be great um I have used it regularly now for a few weeks it has not been drying on my face um I haven really used it much on my body but it does produce a nice lather it rinses off the skin easily and like I said it overly drying this is a great option for people who deal with flaky red patches related to CC dermatitis that often occur in the eyebrows your forehead around your nose and it for um the face the neck the body if you rashes related to malesia yeast called Tina versacolor and Tina versacolor is a skin condition that tends to rear its head this time of year when it humid you really thrives in oily sweaty humid environment so tends to rear its head in this time of year also related to that yeast some people deal with little itchy bumps called poosum foliculitis a lot of people like to call this fungal acne the proper terminology is pitos foliculitis basically that yeast gets too comfortable trickles down in the hair follicle and causes these little bumps kind of looks like acne but in contrast to acne there are no comedones so there whitee heads just little bumps that tend to all be uniform in appearance sometimes on the forehead the chest it can be red they can itch they often itch um and zinc python can help calm down inflammation and also sort of help to clear up that yeast a bit to make the condition go away now unfortunately once you clear it up it often comes right back it that but a maintenance regimen using either a zinc pyone shampoo or in this case a cleansing bar can help control it so I wanted to bring that to your attention cuz I know a lot of you like myself are super duper disappointed that the vany cream z bar has been discontinued speaking of vany cream discontinued products this is not new to me this month but I wanted to remind you guys that since vany cream also discontinued their fragrance-free anti-perspirant um which is a huge bummer um I have been using these certain dry anti-perspirant and I really like this it fragrance-free and fun fact about antiperspirant is you know you put them on at night that that before you go to bed not in the morning that way they have the best chance of working for you to reduce sweat but you regularly for a few nights in a row after about a week or so you actually don daily anymore because you have residual effect of the ingredient down in the F down in the in the acine sweat gland reducing sweat output so for me personally I only end up using my anti-perspirant two maybe three times a week at most um because there to continue reapplying it works down in the sweat gland so it there so there it you give it a you know use it consistently and then see if you can back off once you get reduction and sweat to a point that you and remember it that you ultimately reduce body odor CU it breakdown of the sweat that leads to body odor so I am a huge fan of skin one4 skin 1004 I think it one4 and y Madagascar centella hiy Alo seea Sun serum their serum however I adore I adore I adore I adore when I use that consistently I find that it improves uh just the overall Luminosity Radiance smoothness texture of my skin it is a hydrating lightweight Serum with polyglutamic acid I mean I have raved about that up and down sideways it been a while since I came across um their hyalu seea sleeping pack and the reason I wanted to give this a try is because in contrast to the serum this has melatonin and I have a video all about the skin benefits of topical melatonin it antioxidant it may help also in calming down inflammation and the thing is it super popular skincare ingredient like you don not really prominently called out on the label but this has melatonin in it so I was like oh I need to try it it also has niacinamide which is good for spots redness U moisture barrier anti-aging all those things provided you tolerate it it has polyglutamic acid which I love and I think that the serum so much is the polyglutamic acid really helps to improve hydration as well as Skin elasticity it ingredient I really really favor personally for myself so um like this serum this is fragrance-free uh like the serum and the sunscreen this is essential oil free it does have rose water in it so you have that Rose aroma so if you are if you are allergic to fragrance it some cross reaction I I actually really liked it I it it is a thicker consistency it of a gel it is fine by itself actually as a lightweight nighttime facial moisturizer so you know this time of year with it being hotter more humid you may not be enjoying a heavier moisturizer at night um you might want to lean into a gel it builds itself as a sleeping pack um but you know in my mind that this is a great lightweight moisturizer for summer I do find that like the serum it smoothness I I personally though prefer the serum I like the serum better I feel like I get a little bit more out of the serum in comparison to this um a little bit more in terms of just the overall Luminosity of my skin all right and then last but not least I want to talk to you guys about a mascara I purchased and have been trying out um it is a tubing mascara from tarte it is their tartlet tubing mascara now if you are new here I really enjoy tubing mascaras I think they coat your lashes with a tube of mascara and often give a nice lengthening effect um and then at night when you go to take them off they come off like little tubes usually um so a while ago tar came out with this and a lot of you guys asked me oh are you going to try it out so I finally did and it I haven lengthening and lifting effect I actually gotten some compliments a lot over on Tik Tock actually about my lashes when I that you know some some people are finding that they like the way my lashes look with this I like it but I haven been blown away and I probably would not repurchase it especially since I find it to be very similar in performance to the um Milani tubing mascara which I really like it the price point I would just go back to the um Milani tubing mascara or honestly like I shared with you guys in the past couple of months ago I was really enjoying and just had to retire because it met its expiration time that you know the trio of the winky loocks lash primer their mascara and then the detail oriented one I really really enjoyed that Trio and that is one I would love to go back to as well it is more pricey when you instead of one so that factor in all right y quick and dirty review of some of the stuff that I tried out over the past couple of weeks throughout May man May is wrapping up to be quite a sketchy month here with the weather what with the tornado that was catastrophic and then the other day we had yet another power outage that lasted a really long time so I hope everyone who lives in the Houston area cuz it is a really big spread out City if you weren hope wherever you live in the city you are okay you are safe and that your home has not been damaged um and fingers crossed the next couple of months are not as scary um only time will tell but anyways guys I hope you and that you enjoyed this video if so give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow bye

Skincare Flops You Need To Avoid	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZe7g7H5Gg	Dr Day	happy July 1st today is going to be the Fast Five Five skincare products that I first of all you guys know I fan of penoxal their benzo peroxide washes are amazing great for acne on the face the body also great for body odor washing under your arms your feet Etc well they came out with an oil control moisturizer broadspectrum SPF 30 mineral sunscreen I was really intrigued to try this out because pretty much just go to penoxal for benzo peroxide so this is kind of new territory for them a facial moisturizer obviously their brand markets towards people with acne prone Skin So this product claims to be an oil control moisturizer now to be clear oil control is a bit of a misleading claim because oil production is governed by hormones genetics can be influenced by medications but things that you put on your skin can influence oil production but what they can do is absorb excess oil kind of mattify uh greasiness on the skin surface this is a zinc oxide facial moisturizer so it does leave a white cast but honestly after it has been Blended in it looks pretty good for a zinc oxide sunscreen like you not going to get a zinc oxide sunscreen that is castree like I think we should stop playing this dance this one is one that I can wear and it not be super noticeable but I that if you have a medium to deep skin tone this is not going to be chalky it sheer in the sense that you can see your skin underneath but it still leaves a bit of a residue I like that this is of course fragrance-free you know Common allergen and irtin it also has caffeine in it an antioxidant that can be helpful for combating oxidative stress it may also be helpful for those of you who deal with things like post acne redness and hyperpigment it and it does dry down with a semi matte finish not cloyingly Matt to the point where it feels like you have a layer of chalk on your skin but definitely not oily or greasy cannot put this on to anything other than a completely bar dry face if you have a serum on if you have a lotion on a moisturizer it doesn matter how many minutes ago you put it on this will pill it won away it to work and it will drive you berserk I mean aggressive pilling pilling to the point also where you end up getting like the little white balls all the way up in your hairline into your scalp looks like you have some kind of industrial gray dandruff going on for that reason buy or be wear but if you up in the morning and just puts sunscreen on and you might really love this it it but if you have any sort of am skincare routine that involves serum or anything this just does not play well with other products for me most mornings I just get up I do my omnilux Contour mask many mornings and then I will often just put on the um Ubbi quinon the Q10 serum from Timeless and then follow with a sunscreen uh this works fine if I if I skip the Timeless serum step and just go in with this it serum which is super lightweight and often very compatible with other things I do get intense peeling so keep that in mind if you are considering this one all right so again it it changed up the series okay moving on um I tried out some products that I purchased from karx um over several months ago and then kind of leading up into this month as well and one of them is a really nice peptide serum which I reviewed in yesterday their hyaluronic acid 3 um amino acids plus camide NP serum so hyaluronic acid serums they can complement your moisturizing routine they are applied as the first step in your morning skincare routine or evening skincare routine to damp skin ideally after after cleansing um if you pair it with other hydrating toners serums Etc you might want to apply thinner liquids on first and then go on over with this particular product because its consistency is a lot more viscous like there substance to it in comparison to the peptide booster I just talked about hyaluronic acid can help improve the water content of Skin and when that is optimized you get a fine line smoothing effect you also get more efficient barrier maintenance and skin cell turnover so less inclined moving forward to have the buildup of dry rough skin provided you continue to use this and or a moisturizer it has ceramides which are good for the moisture barrier I ended up really really liking this quite a bit it does not have niacinamide and I that to your attention because kerx has a few options for you guys if you want hydrating serums I already just mentioned the peptide one if you looking to lean into peptides the peptide one has niacinamide if you sensitive to niacinamide you might try their snail mucin Essence if you are disturbed by snail mucin Essence and you want a similar hydrating effect try this hyaluronic acid serum under your moisturizer it is I this the amino acids are hydrating as well part of Skin factors so all of that together really helps with barrier turnover is this a must have is this a holy grail for me absolutely not I will finish it up and I may repurchase it in the future but it not something that I would say I have to have in my routine was it this month or last month time flies so quickly I lose track I reviewed remedy skin remedy skin remedy skin care their body lotion for rough and bumpy skin and two of their serums shortly after reviewing the products I received from the brand remedy for dry lips if you recall from the video this was the one product I had not tried so I daily I a day to really give it a good test try is it worth it is a good thing for dry lips in short yes it is a good product it is good for dry lips it has ceramides which are good for the moisture barrier squala and imoan it has peptides which are hydrating and it has petrolatum which helps to reduce water loss one thing about this product it goes on almost a bit more like you lotion on your lips if you Polish Choice ha lip booster the consistency of that product is very similar to this so it ointment it absorbs pretty quickly into the skin of the lips and I did find that it helped my lips stay soft moisturized hydrated and overall it free of fragrance and flavorant which which are important to note because those in lip balms are common causes of lip irritation lip dryness and uh common allergens in lip balms this is a good option for keeping the lips hydrated smooth Supple okay you guys know I huge fan of Vy cream except I find it frustrating that they can maintain their supply chain I know that end up discontinuing many of my all alltime favorites like their anti-perspirant and their SPF lip balm and they discontinued a sunscreen that they used to have that I adored as well well I saw they came out with a new facial cleanser and I absolutely love their facial cleanser it popular product on Amazon as well like it people are buying it and loving it okay and no surprise it is a great cleanser so I saw oh look they came out with a foaming cleanser marketed for babies head to toe I was elated because if you guys have been watching my channel for any number of years you know I absolutely adore the hadalabo foaming cleanser and I thought oh maybe this will be like it even when I first pumped it out onto my hand I got really excited thinking oh my gosh this is going to be a VY cream version of that this product is smoke and mirrors it is smoke and mirrors yes when you are bathing a baby you want to use a very mild cleanser sure but this is like where where there you get this puff of foam but when you put it on your skin it cleanse your skin than this does it feels like there is zero substance to it nothing in it is removing anything and I tried washing my face with this at the end of the day um by itself as well as an oil cleanser and it does not work particularly well for removing anything off of the surface of the skin now you guys know I also really like to use facial cleansers as a hand wash I you know maybe it but I did not feel like this even was good enough to wash my hands with um because there really was no lather to it at all that this exuberant foam but you get zero lather um and it feels like you you put nothing on the skin it mirrors this was a fail I am not happy with this I do not recommend it um stick to their daily facial cleanser it amazing they also have a body wash that think there are better baby washes on the market that get the job done but are also super gentle for baby skin all right speaking of products that that failed my eyes are starting to get watery because I trying out a sunscreen that I will be reviewing for you guys uh shortly and uh note to self it is starting to cause my eyes to water so yeah uh my eyes are starting to water a bit um so good thing I following in my Vlogs I have complained about this you guys in the videos but Fenty skin um they sent me they sent me PR and I rarely ever talk about it because the majority of it has fragrance and it don necessarily interested in it but this has been sitting in my little PR stash and it guys know I love moisturizers it butter draw shimmering whipped oil body cream um and I love to you know I need to use moisturizers because I have atopic dermatitis I try and avoid frag but from time to time I really enjoy a scented lotion scented cream and I have to say the experience of applying this to the skin is very luxurious it is a truly well formulated moisturizer the scent smells exactly like Ginger Snap cookies very relaxing to smell they did you know if you you offensive at all I mean unless you hate the smell of Ginger Snap cookies this is amazing okay and I love the texture of this it Glides on the skin easily it glossy it dries down so it doesn greasy residue however buyer beware okay because when they say what do they call it shimmering they are not they are not lying to you when you put it on the skin and you you don like e whatever that some marketing jargon however about an hour later you look down at your skin and it happened on my arm okay like disco ball on my knee it is Shimmer Shimmer City but the Shimmer comes from some fine particulate gold glitter in this product that you again you don well when you that fine particulate glitter fine particle glitter it doesn staying on your skin in total it ends up going all over your clothing you going to have glitter all over the place like I know this is a little TMI but like you go to the bathroom you why is there glitter in my underwear this it falls all over the place and it just yeah it so like I think they should lose that I think they should leave that out the Shimmer I mean I their brand you know everybody wants to have glossy glowy radiant skin and adding Glitters to things kind of creates that illusion but like let go of that this is a nice this would be a nice formula otherwise because it does give your skin a nice hydrated glow by itself like it doesn annoying glitter I can only imagine these GS who do like a lot of sunless tanning and want to use a product like this their bed sheets must be a mess between the glitter and the sunless tanner rubbing off all over the place yeah you better have some good laundry detergent anyways y of the five skincare products of the month some hits some misses nothing is a Holy Grail from this video um I would say of the of all

Skincare We Need To Discuss - This Month Was Wild!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_zizozW-HA	Dr Day	August is here that means July is over in case you have been missing my videos July has been a very interesting month interesting if not completely catastrophic for many if you aren aware we had a huge hurricane here that wiped out power throughout the city for many people and yours truly happen to be in the middle of a move during all this so yeah I was really really really pushing my echine glands to their limits as well well as challenging hygiene standards due to lack of running water for a period of time but we made it we made it out and there this month that we really really need to talk about so per usual on the first of the month that about the products that I tried out tested out what they were like so I want to talk about a body wash from different differ Acne Clearing body wash it basically a 2% salicylic acid body wash it also has glycolic acid so that salicylic acid helps to exfoliate the pore helping to clear up blackheads and white heads it post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation it also really helpful if you deal with rough and bumpy skin so even though you may not have acne and you may not even think of a different branded product is something that you might want to try out if you have rough and bumpy skin salicylic acid in acne skin care products body care products can really be helpful um and this product is one that you might consider if you know about that now it also has glycolic acid in it which is an alpha hydroxy acid that is hydrating and exfoliating there make a big deal of the blue tany extract now blue tany essential oil allegedly has anti-inflammatory compounds in it but you guys know essential oils they can be a contact allergen for a lot of people extract is always this kind of nebulous category of like what exactly did they extract from the oil I don know or from the plant who knows um but that is in there and it may have anti-inflammatory properties but when I tell you guys that this product does not perform in the way in which it is marketed my experience using it if you are in the shower and you go to put this in your washcloth your loofah or in your hand to lather to your body good luck there is absolutely no lather with this whatsoever I think they need to call it something else because I think a lot of people are going to buy this product try it out that way and find it spread on the skin in the shower on like a washcloth or something of that sort now to be fair in the directions for use for how to use the product they don really mention lathering it to the body okay but most people see something marketed as a body wash and they going to default do that the way I found this product works really really really well is actually to put it on the skin almost like you would put on a lotion or a cream before you actually get in the shower what I end up doing is getting undress to get in the shower but before I get in the shower I put it all over to the areas like on my thighs my upper arms my chest my back then I do my oil cleansing step you know I rub the cleansing oil all over my face um and then I get in the shower I start washing my hair and then in contrast if you try and use it like a a traditional body wash lather it it it doesn it ends up being very difficult in the shower to spread on your skin without it going all over your shower floor cuz it lotion on your skin now that being said this does need to be rinsed off the skin it is not intended to be left on the skin you know overnight or anything of the sort because it does have Coco mle probal beain a mild surf fact down which you wouldn I kind of consider it almost like an exfoliating body mask where you get that short contact therapy from the ingredients and then in the shower they are rinsed off and it has left my skin softer smoother so I think it great product especially for people who have drier skin and may want to incorporate this I keratosis pyloris people CU it is keratosis pyloris is a dry skin condition I I think using it this way is really helpful I consistent using it and I find that my skin is a lot softer smoother with this and I think it product now speaking of salicylic acid as a body care product a wash that actually performs like a body wash if that to go through this whole mask thing that I that is not new to me I in many videos but I currently using it as well cuz I wanted to directly compare the two you know side by side how they perform because it one is the Neutrogena stubborn body acne cleanser and exfoliator it does lather really easily in your washcloth it spreads on the skin in the shower no problem rinses off the skin really well it has 1% salicylic acid it also has gluconolactone a polyhydroxy acid which polyhydroxy acids are kind of underrated in the exfoliating game because they really gentle they they with sensitive skin so this particular formula I also think is a great option for people who have sensitive skin dry skin dry acne prone skin on the body I think these products in particular are a good option for you not to say if you don choose something else but I think the formulas are really nice and hydrating moisturizing gentle mild and effective both are free of fragrance which I also love all right moving on to some things that are a little bit more Jazzy besides just fragrance-free medicated body wash now I tried out these brightening eye patches from Dermatology so Dermatology is a brand I have a lot of respect for because honestly I have not really ever tried a bad product from them I had the opportunity few years ago at this point to actually go and tour their facility check that video out if you interested one thing about me that you may not know if you really really enjoy those hydrogel under eye patches and I like them because I find they are actually a really effective way to brighten up the under eye area and reduce morning under eye puffiness just make you suddenly look awake and a lot of it boils down to the fact that they are cooling and applying something cool to the the delicate under eye skin can help reduce puffiness so I really enjoy using them I find them effective and if you followed me over the years you know I to any one particular one I I I out many recommended many the pan kongu black tea ones I was using last year or 2023 favorite so I when I saw one of my favorite Brands Dermatology had their own version I absolutely had to try them out and they have not disappointed in the least they are they are really really good fre of fragrance they have um niacinamide which is good for redness dark spots inflammation they also have compound a compound from licorice root which is anti-inflammatory good for dark spots and redness it had these have some peptides in them one of which allegedly is going to be helpful for collagen and the other is also allegedly helpful for improving under eye puffiness and actually has been examined around the eye area in a clinical study on human volunteers of note these have caffeine now caffeine for a subset of people can really um be a GameChanger for reducing under eye puffiness not everyone responds to it um there looked at caffeine for under eye puffiness in comparison to a just a plain cool gel without caffeine there really wasn reduction and under eye puffiness except for a subset of people seem to do better with caffeine under the eye for reducing that under eye puffiness so some people May respond better to it in comparison to others caffeine is an antioxidant so there is that you know you may be getting some anti-inflammatory properties from from that also a variety of marine extracts condous Crispus for example very very hydrating these I love they they next one is a product from the brand minimalist which I good things about this is the first product from them I tried I purchased it myself um and it is their tranexamic acid 3% serum now I did a video this month about topical tranexamic acid like does it actually do anything okay um a lot of people just assume that it going to be good for hyperpigmentation because the oral medication tranexamic acid that you take by mouth is very effective for melasma a hyperpigmentation condition but putting it on the skin does it help hyperpigmentation at all it that it is effective for hyperpigmentation but it does have some evidence behind it for improving redness so this serum in particular I think it would be really good if you who is doing dealing with not necessarily post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation but rather post-inflammatory aemma persistent facial redness maybe from healing acne or um related to rosacea perhaps I think this can help not only does it actively help reduce the redness but it also the ingredient tranexamic acid also can improve uh the moisture barrier so ultimately helping reduce dryness irritation now this particular Serum is fragrance-free you only need two to three drops to a clean face you know after you you can put this on um you can use it one to two times a day as tolerated 0.3% salicylic acid as well as 3% mandelic acid now salicylic acid and the mandelic acid in this may gently exfoliate as well as hydrate and allow for more even penetration of the tranexamic acid into the skin one note about this that I think will be appealing to many of you is that it does not have any niacinamide now niacinamide is a wonderful ingredient pretty much always makes sense to have in a product however a subset of people are sensitive to it find it irritating and are just like please no more with the niacinamide and in the case of looking for products to Target redness hyperpigmentation because niacinamide is so widespread again it makes sense to have it in there it becomes very challenging to find products without niacinamide this does not have niacinamide so it would definitely be a great option to try out if you are looking for a serum to improve complexion post acne dark marks redness and you want to especially give tranexamic acid a try now tranexamic acid like I said it topically is most compelling for redness and the moisture barrier not so much hyperpigmentation though it may it may end up helping the hyperpigmentation as well if you want to learn more about topical tranexamic acid definitely check out my video from this month I go into a lot more details about mechanistically how it works and how we use it in dermatology topically to treat uh steroid rosacea and persistent facial redness so check that out so I mentioned at the beginning of the video that we had a hurricane well no sooner did that leave but the mosquitoes were biting and and and they haven so this month in particular my skin care has focused of course around sun protection as it always does does but the the the insect game I had to be on top of so what has been getting me through uh the how to not get eaten alive season because mosquitoes Harbor serious you know can Harbor serious diseases that we don get um so what have I been doing well I have been pretty diligent about deting myself about using DEET which helps a lot it helps a lot so I spray that on after I put on my sunscreen if I plan to go outside check out my video on insect repellents I go into all the different types which ones are effective for what just as with sunscreen when you are approaching your insect repellent game you don repellants you also want to reain in like protective clothing um but I end up getting bit because I like to wear shorts and it is what it is shorts skirts dresses so my lower legs are exposed and they they and they uh so I lower legs a lot but inevitably you open the door to check the mail or whatever and two or three mosquitoes come in there was there was a span of 3 or 4 days where you could not open the door without like seven mosquitoes coming in landing on the wall this little bug zapper amazing because it very easy to zap the mosquitoes with this little device and zapping those little zika zika Devils is so Zen I don one and [Laughter] watch here one he didn crackle it zap skers with this thing it charges with the USB you can flip it to mash flush up against the wall just don when it can do it like this um this works really well like once you see a mosquito it pretty easy to just go up to the wall and and trap them in there and zap them as opposed to like a fly swatter those things I mean that you and inevitably I mean the mosquitoes here are are way too way too advanced for a fly swatter very satisfying otherwise once they come in well then you to bite you it doesn you find they find you and they so you got to get rid of them if they come in the house for sure bites are not fun to deal with they itch and again if you scratch them then you can introduce bacteria that leads to a secondary skin infection and mosquitoes carry all sorts of horrible diseases anyway y is a wrap up of the July skin care August is here this is this is round two of our most intense weather months tends to be the most extreme heat and then the you know hurricanes so fingers crossed that this month goes by smoothly without any chaos but I hope July was a wonderful month for all of you if you are in the area I hope you are okay and all recovered from the disaster uh but anyways guys if you enjoyed this monthly wrap up give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe I bye [Music]	Success
Skincare We Need To Discuss - August 2024	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ35DVCdx8w	Dr Day	August 2024 see you wouldn you September is sailing on in I excited and in today to share with you the Fast Five quick and dirty reviews of five Beauty SL skincare products that I used over the month of August 2024 I bring you up to Snuff with one product in particular that we talked about in the past speaking of which caer X hyaluronic acid 3 serum I just finished it up while I reviewed this a couple of months ago I have continued to use it and enjoy it and love it they really did an excellent job with this formula so hyaluronic acid and serums moisturizing products toners whatever it is that you are putting on your face even cleansers can certainly be beneficial in improving the water content in your stratum corium and this is very helpful in fact I would argue that a lot of the benefits that we derive from using skincare products come from this very thing simply improving water content in stratum corneum and reducing water loss through the use of humectants namely in this case hyaluronic acid have you ever heard of glycerin though glycerin is another htin and a lot of people go back and forth which one is better hyaluronic acid glycerin if you find yourself asking this question you need to watch my video hyaluronic acid versus glycerin I compare and contrast the two and I basically tell you what you need to know in order to decide moving forward which one might be right for you the serum has 3% sodium hyaluronic that hyaluronic acid and the form in which you different skin care products this also has a variety of amino acids which are actually natural moisturizing Factor factors are naturally present in Your Skin Barrier and they play a key role in maintaining water content and applying them topically can certainly help improve barrier function through water retaining abilities when the water content in our skin drops as occurs with age underlying skin conditions menopause you know we start to lose the ability to retain water in Skin as as readily well a lot of things ensue first of all you dryness irritation and you also get a slowing down of the natural exfoliation processes leading to a buildup of dry rough coarse skin texture a lot of what our skinc care products do for us is basically kind of get that back on track a bit and this is a great option in addition to the hyaluronic acid and the am amino acid it also has ceramides which are lipids naturally found in Your Skin Barrier production of those declines with age in certain underlying conditions ceramides are deficient applying them topically can kind of help get barrier function back on track and actually encourage your skin to make its own ceramides improving barrier function this particular serum has a nice viscosity it the skin well but it watery so it really has some good slip some good Glide it fragrance-free formula I was able to use this not just on my face but on my neck as well as to the skin around my eyes and this really helps to plump up the outermost layer of the skin with hydration smoothing out those little pesky Fine Lines which nobody wants my one gripe with this product though which I didn reviewed it initially but I should have because I it so this particular type of bottle for a serum needs to go the pipet stem is very short and the base of the bottle is much broader than what the pipet stem can access so once you get down to the last like 16th of the product which is money that you have spent let want to use that it to get that out you can get it out but it to the side and kind of fish around in there and try and get the stem angle just so to suck up the very last drag bottles not see-through so you really can challenging you can contents of the bottle over into your palm because of the sort of oneway valve it has which is a good thing you know if you drop the bottle you wouldn your product to spill out of the top it just tip it upside down and get the last EGS out so that that particular style of bottle I really wish Brands would abandon that I remember I reviewed um some products from the Korean brand some by me a few years ago and that was a major complaint I had was that particular packaging style I just kind of forgot about it only until now when I was finishing the last of that serum I was like this is a pain all right number two is a very utilitarian product underrated flies into the radar and it even be aware of I YouTube talked about it before but it it needs to it needs to be something that people consider it necessarily A skincare brand but from Monistat which makes the uh clotrimazol products for treating yeast infections but Monistat has a chafing relief powder gel which I have heard Whispers of from the beauty Community specifically as being great actually as a makeup primer it excellent so it active ingredient is dimethicone dimethicone is a skin protectant it helps really reduce water loss from the skin allowing barri the barrier to heal if you have an impaired skin barrier but it also provides slip and glide to reduce frictional forces that further jeopardize your Skin Barrier and cause irritation which is particularly an issue under the arms between the thighs anywhere where you have skin on skin contact these are areas where the skin is actually under a lot of stress and vulnerable to breakdown not only the friction but trapping of moisture or sweat sweat itself is very challenging on your skin and can lead to barrier breakdown so I really like this product as a skin protectant for the skin folds that now I protectants skin protectants are basically barrier creams barrier balms um like diaper rash cream or petroleum jelly Vaseline petroleum jelly I talked about L Ro POS caast balm another dimethicone skin protectant but what is unique about this is the finish it does provide really a really nice amount of Glide and slip but it does not feel the least bit oily greasy at all not sticky it really does have this powdery finish to it almost as if your skin is soft moisturized but has well a powdery finish so I really can see how this product one might be interested in dabbling in as a makeup primer now I don to speak to if it actually works well as a as a makeup primer but I will say I have used it on my face a fair amount and it again not very greasy I around my eyes too because I pointed this out eyelid skin is vulnerable to irritant getting there the nature of how the muscles around our eyes contract kind of sucks up irritating stuff and then the Skin can make you vulnerable to dry eyelids very easily not just skincare products it might settle there cleanser residue that might get trapped there but also pollin aeroallergens if you cook and you get you know the steam coming up and then residues settling eyelids can be an area Bakers for example flowers air saliz might land there actually can be pretty irritating to the Skin So a skin protectant around the eyelids can be very useful um some skin protectants because they are not comfortable necessarily to wear around the eyes this really stays in place well and has that powdery finish so I really enjoy it I suspect this is one you come wintertime as a skin protectant against windburn it is really really good definitely give it a try number three is a Tik Tok made me try it so you don okay that little rhyme so who watched my video on the viral biod Dan collagen mask that was a ton of fun to try the video was a lot of fun to make but if you missed it this this is basically a popular Korean skincare product it sheet mask but it is a bit more involved it and wait 5 or 10 minutes take it off and voila this is an investment in your time it on and then wear it in your sleep and I really put it to the test to see if it would hold up I actually did it during the day which you can if you if you want to to do that but anyway this particular mask is very interesting because it split so you have a a part for the top of your face and a part for the bottom put it on but with time as the serum or ampule that into your skin The Mask dries down into this clear film and that sleep in it and I really put that to the test like if you toss and turn in your sleep it will not budge it took about 3 hours I want to say give or take for it to fully dry down so I through the test cuz if you actually want to wear it overnight that important to know it some time to get it to a point where it is set up so it around in your sleep what the heck is this supposed to accomplish well basically it can help improve water content in your skin by uding it in there I mean you have this film water is not going anywhere it also has a variety of soothing anti-inflammatory ingredients ferments which are rich in hydrating compounds and anti-inflammatory compounds it has niacinamide which is good for red hyperpigmentation the moisture barrier it does have rose water but otherwise it doesn water is notable when you put it on but after it dries down you don smell that if you fragrance though rose water could cause problems for you now this mask was a lot of fun for me to do and I definitely felt like when I took it off my skin looked a little bit brighter if I being honest I definitely felt like the skin surface was smoother hydrated I would caution against using this if you have any underlying skin condition like OAA acne eczema because that inclusion you know in theory it water loss and may enhance penetration of those beneficial compounds but it also can be super irritating to have occlusive things on the skin especially sleeping with it overnight I wore the mask for what a total of 5 hours total I think that video took me to film um from applying it all the way to closing out the video and taking it off so I didn have any irritation I found it to be beneficial but people are sleeping with it I mean that getting your 7 9 hours of sleep with this thing on your face it could actually end up being quite a bit of of occlusion on there some skin types it going to aggravate your skin but that that was an experience fun to try let me know in the comments have you tried this viral Korean mask did you find that it was useless just a gimmick or did you think it actually did something for you number four is not a skincare product but a makeup product it NYX it that brow care products for me I low maintenance when it comes to the makeup you know I I don to train myself in how to use it okay I don YouTube makeup tutorials to figure out how to use something I invested I especially when it comes to my eyebrows this actually has good staying power it actually does allow you to sculpt the brows and for them to stay that way but it doesn crunchy perm look you know with way too much hairspray from the 8S yeah it doesn it have enjoyed that quite a bit free of fragrance I think they make it with color to it as well I just got the clear one all right the last product is my toothpaste I am team oral hygiene and if you I toothpaste uh why well kids toothpaste provided it has fluoride is fine for adults to use kids toothpaste tend to have much more unique flavors that importantly are a lot more sensitive skin friendly and also more friendly for people who are dealing with any kind of sores in their mouth oral conditions you know in dermatology we have a lot of conditions that affect the skin and the mouth like lyan planus and so harsh toothpaste can really be aggravating for those conditions so I often will suggest a kids toothpaste provided it has fluoride for cavity prevention because the strawberry the bubblegum the watermelon those fruity fun kids flavors tend to not be as irritating whereas cinnamon mint peppermint winter green these flavors can be very harsh on the mouth if you have those sores it can really aggravate them canker sores any kind of oral sore these flavorants and toothpaste are also thought to potentially be a trigger for perioral dermatitis those little stingy bumps that happen around the mouth uh yeah so in that case it kid aggressive flavors all that backstory aside I for a while well Amazon showed me this toothpaste called EOL sucked me right in because of the pretty packaging I saw it had fluoride in it which is like my only requirement from a toothpaste and I was sold I didn in my head I thought it was going to be bubble gum flavored because hello pink toothpaste comes out this really really satisfying bright vibrant pink too I just love the packaging of this it Korean toothpaste however this is the most painful toothpaste it green flavor it is so strong and I that sensitive like I know I just went on this backstory about me using the kids ones but that I was this is so strong my tongue is on fire every night it continue to use it because I have three tubes of it it came in a three pack but if you were eyeing it if Amazon showed you this toothpaste bu or beware because while it looks pretty it is it got a bite to it all right y a Fast Five stuff that I tried out in the realm of skin care Beauty Oral Care I hope you have had an excellent August and that you are sailing into September cool uh looking forward to the fall months if you enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don

Skincare WE NEED TO DISCUSS | September Mini-Review	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__EnVAeu7vw	Dr Day	it guys today is October 1st you know what that means it Five skin care products I testing out this past month little short quick mini reviews buckle up uh I been doing this in replacement of my previous skincare monthly favorites because I try things out and not everything ends up necessarily being a Holy Grail favorite and then it of like do I include this but I want to talk about it I don to do a whole video on it so I think this is better a month two months ago at this point I reviewed L Ro POS micil the serum and their sunscreen with melil but I didn cleanser until this past month I finally got my hands on the Mela B3 Gel Cleanser they sent this to me um and I they did because I wanted to try it out anyway it has niacinamide which is good for dark spots and redness micil is L Ro Po signature ingredient or L say uh in these products and it thought to work by disrupting some of the precursors for melanin pigment synthesis it we don like we do with you know hydroquinone or oral tranexamic acid for hyperpigmentation but it does show promise for hyperpigmentation at any rate we know that niacinamide can be helpful yes these ingredients can still be beneficial in a cleanser that you lather up and then rinse off the skin through a process known as coaster active ingredients in cleansers can be deposited behind on the skin surface and do what they need to do now the other thing about this it kind of builds itself as micro peeling it also has gluconolactone a polyhydroxy acid that hydrating and very gently exfoliates this cleanser is a good option for people with dark spots hyperpigmentation that they appearance of and also just for smoothing out the skin surface it for washing the face to remove dirt oil and sebum it of a gel-like consistency it does have fragrance however like the other products in this line the fragrance is not headache inducing super strong it doesn you know what I mean like a really strongly scented cleanser as you washing your face sometimes it seems like you that that fragrance is somehow populating your mouth you don with this it actually a very pleasant scent this isn necessarily repurchase it I think if you want to use a micil I I suggest using micil um the sunscreen because you going to need sunscreen anyway and the sunscreen facial moisturizer or if you already have a sunscreen that you like use the serum um I don necessarily need to use the cleanser as well speaking of cleansers I recently finished up the beauty of Jos uh cleansing balm that I love so much and who remembers uh Last Christmas I went through the Korean beauty Advent calendars in one of those calendars which were gifted to me I got um the panu Deep clear cleansing balm I using this and I rather like it it has a bunch of different forms of hyaluronic acid in it which can be hydrating it also has licorice root extract which is anti-inflammatory soothing good for redness maybe good for dark spots as well and it has sunflower seed oil and emollient it does have fragrance uh the fragrance is kind of pleasant actually it reminds me of something that might be atomized in a very high-end like department store or office it Pleasant sophisticated scent not headache inducing overpowering cheap anything of that sort it very nice sophisticated sent which I must say when it comes to Korean skincare if it does have fragrance I do find that a lot of the fragrance profiles are very nice like a lot of the Korean shampoos really have a nice scent very dainty sophisticated you can see how quickly it melts into the skin and I think see what I sweeping it across my eyelashes to dissolve that mascara when I get in the shower as soon as my face hits the water the emulsifier in this is going to take all of that off and yes I do fall with a gentle cleanser but if I came in with like a myel water a makeup remover wipe or an eye makeup remover to get this off it requires some effort some rubbing of the lashes and I think those types of products for me I think compromise lash strength in my eyebrows it helps with the brow glue the Nyx brow glue I currently using helps dissolve that so I brand minimalist and you recently finished up their tranic samic acid serum I really liked it it helpful I think for people dealing with redness and just looking to improve skin texture it also is very hydrating and moisturizing so I purchased one of their moisturizers this is seacom 3% moisturizer seacom is kind of a trademark name they have given to basically amino acids and some minerals now amino acids are part of Skin natural moisturizing factors so they can be beneficial in hydrating the skin this also has oat extract which you guys know I products skincare in general they compounds in them that are soothing anti-inflammatory oats are very hydrating moisturizing and they can protect the Skin Barrier depending on the overall formulation now this also has a squala and a molent which I have come to rather enjoy it has more of a lightweight feel on the skin but Smooths out the skin surface this has one of my favorite ingredients that I think is just underrated polyglutamic acid it very hydrating ingredient but it almost has this like cloaking effect on the skin to improve skin elasticity and this has shea butter which is a great moisturizing ingredient free of fragrance I like this it it gets the job done I took it with me on my recent trip to the Los Angeles area um so it was great for travel it not the best moisturizer I however like I would gladly use it but I don it mind it dramatically making a difference in the appearance of my skin uh but it is good it road nothing nothing extreme about it uh not bad not not amazing but right there where you need it to be does what it supposed to do end of story it affordable too like this brand in general their products are pretty reasonably priced if you didn partner with cedil on sponsored content mostly over on like Instagram and Tik Tok occasionally here on YouTube but mostly there and several months ago I partnered with them um to talk about their newer gentle exfoliating essay lotion I had the opportunity to use this for um I would say several months before agreeing to do the sponsorship it really good I I really think this is one of cedap Phil moisturizers I would say cuz they have some great options don but this um I think it might fly under the radar what is it about it that I liked so much so it exfoliating saay line salicylic acid is great for rough and bumpy skin it great for acne prone skin and it great for smoothing the skin surface it also has a polyhydroxy acid gluconolactone and it has an alpha hydroxy acid mandelic acid which is large in size very very gentle and it exfoliating properties and improves hydration so I quite some time now and I really really notice the skin on my forearms really tells the story of how good this is because they just feel baby soft and smooth and my elbows I to see Market difference in elbow smoothness I don rough dry elbows and knees but I have been using this for a while now and I really really really just noticing my elbows feel like super slick and smooth they feel much younger okay they feel a lot younger like baby soft so that it self is grade however the other thing about this that I think is underrated is it can be used on the face I using this on my face as a facial moisturizer it smoothing it texture it into this issue when it comes to using salad silc acid on my face if it creeps on over to my eyelid area I get dry eyelids I have not had that issue with this salicylic acid lotion on my face um even when I try it without putting like an ointment or a balm around my eyelids to protect them I don it sensation of increased sensitivity which can happen with exfoliating ingredients as they surface your skin may be more vulnerable to redness I really really really enjoy this I have to say like Cetaphil really sneaks on in there with salicylic acid formulas that are something special like you discovered they came out with salicylic acid products for acne they have this excellent 0.5% salicylic acid mattifying facial moisturizer that is amazing this is a different in texture and feel and consistency but it it moisturize and you know gently exfoliate the face now I okay um it can be used one to two times a day sometimes I put this on in the morning now that being said if I put it on in the morning there are certain sunscreens that if I apply over this I get pilling okay so there using it at night at least it great on my face love it love it I really really really like this a lot um it moisturizers as far as improving skin smoothness texture hydration leading to a market Improvement and skin appearance feel and quality next up in the realm of moisturizing you many moisturizing products do you test out well I use a lot of moisturizer I moisturize from head to toe liberally and when it comes to my feet my ankles my lower legs I like to use an ointment Vaseline cavey healing ointment I also like to use aquafor from time to time although aquafor isn favorite of the ointments it one anyway so I recently finished up a bunch of Vaseline um as you guys know from my recent skincare empties videos I finished up a smaller thing of Vaseline I was like I need a new ointment like I ordered s guys know I love great formula this has never happened to me before but for whatever reason I ordered it off of Amazon for whatever reason the mail like lost it I know right fortunately Amazon just refunded my money but that is most bizarre thing like I I checked on my account cuz I was supposed to get it like Amazon Prime within 2 days and two days passed and I was like oh wait did did my healing ointment not come and I went back into my account and it said this has been lost lost in the sauce so I just hit Reef on and I was like well I guess that is a sign that I should try out some other type of ointment y know I store versions of branded products um so I decided why not see what Amazon is offering in their Amazon Basics line they have an advanced healing ointment that is very similar I mean the same ingredient profile as aquafor healing ointment which I just told you I but isn might as well try it if you for a while you know I the up and up version of Aqua 4 healing ointment I think I version of it I want to say I couple of store store versions and they all are pretty much like blindfold me and I don this on the other hand I actually like a little bit better than Aqua for it subtle difference but I the ointment Whisperer okay blindfold me and line up a bunch of different ointments and I think I might have a reasonable shot at guessing which one is which if you many people are loyal to in my experience it has a bit of an aroma to it in contrast to plain petroleum jelly this on the other hand does not have that Aroma this is a little bit silkier in texture and it the way it feels on the skin but it great option and it sarasin wax it has lanoline alcohol in it as well so lanoline is a potential allergen some people they find that their skin is getting worse when they use aquafor and it may be because of the lanoline if you switch to plain petroleum jelly Vaseline issue goes away it could be a lanoline a problem with lanoline this also has Bol which is anti-inflammatory it has glycerin which is hydrating pet lotum which seals in all the moisture and mineral oil I liked this a lot but here thing that I noticed um preparing for this video because I assumed that the Amazon version of Aqua 4 was going to be less expensive than Aqua 4 so it definitely is a savings in comparison to aquafor healing ointment it bucks aquafor healing ointment has gotten expensive since I last purchased it um is it just me I mean everything has gotten expensive but I have noticed that the price of Aqua for is variable depending on the retailer so if you are team aquafor healing oen shop around because some retailers have upped the price significantly more in comparison to other retailers all right guys that is a wrap up the Fast Five of stuff that I tried out over the month of September I hope this was informative to you guys if you missed my empties videos I going to put one on the end slight so you can check that one out next but if you guys like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe I bye [Music]	Success
Moisturizers We Need To Discuss | Skincare Reviews 2024	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-axILkb7QNY	Dr Day	and just like that October dunzo November here we are you know what that means today I you the Fast Five Five skincare products that I have been dabbling with at least over the past month if not more the name of the game for today to be a moisturizers because y me I head to toe and headed into the colder months moisturizers become something that a lot of people gravitate more towards because our skin is just a lot more vulnerable to dryness as the ambient humidity drops I love Gold Bond moisturizers I especially love like their retinol wand their eczema one I saw they came out with this new age renew tight and firm body and face lotion I think all of their moisturizers actually now that I think about it it has Ura in it now Ura is a great ingredient I think is underrated by and large it skin it improve water retention this is great because when the water content in your skin is optimized then the natural turnover processes ensue a lot more efficiently because the enzymes that conduct those things require water and when the water content drops then that all slows down and that dry dull rough skin and the barrier Integrity is compromised Ura is also really helpful for softening and gently exfoliating buildup of dry rough skin it keratosis pilaris it has dimethicone and petrolatum these are great ingredients for reducing transepidermal water loss which ultimately will optimize water content in your skin when there is less of it evaporating out as readily one thing that Drew me to this product in particular not only because it I love Gold Bond but it has ubiquinone otherwise known as co-enzyme Q10 an antioxidant that when applied topically as a decent fighting chance of getting into your skin and helping with the whole burden of oxidative stress as we go throughout our day and are exposed to environmental aggressors it also has Magnesium escorial phosphate that stable form of vitamin C and antioxidant now whether or not once it it converts to ascorbic acid a question mark but at any rate it helpful for reducing oxidative stress in the skin helping to defend against those damaging free radicals that not only prematurely age our skin but can really compromise barrier Integrity exacerbate hyperpigmentation so both the UB quinone and the magnesium and scorel phosphate not only are going to be helpful for sort of supporting the needs of the barrier as you go throughout your day but also defending against perhaps hyperpigment and allowing that to clear up a little bit faster it fragrance-free lotion it can be used on both the body and the face which is something about Gold Bond I really appreciate they go ahead and market their products that way youall know I a big fan of the efficiency of having a face and body moisturizer so that wonderful this is free of fragrance it not as thick as say their eczema relief with colloidal oatmeal it as the age renew retinol which is a huge favorite of mine so for those of you who like something a little bit more lightweight in consistency you might enjoy this it does have a nice hydrating effect and Smooths out the appearance of dry doll Ru skin I like that it absorbs quickly into the skin so you put it on ideally after you get out of the shower or bath that moisturize once you put on your pajamas or whatever it clothing is sticking to you it sinks down pretty efficiently with age our epidermis atrophies it gets thinner our skin becomes more vulnerable to water loss as a result the skin can take on the sort of crepy finely wrinkled appearance and of course a big part of that is related to loss of collagen elasticity and the deeper layers of the skin but moisturizers can help improve the appearance of that albeit temporarily simply by improving the water content and having a firming effect on the topmost outermost layer of the skin this isn lost volume in the skin per se it going to lift prominent sagging say you you have some laxity some loose skin this of course is not going to lift that up but when we crepey appearance this definitely can improve the appearance of that I really enjoyed this and if you were wondering is this any good it it is good I honestly Gold Bond they they really do a good job with the moisturizers I you know they powder right people who know about Gold Bond moisturizers they SV has a few newer Renditions of some of their moisturizers with sunscreen which I reviewed for you guys guys this past month they came out with some new tints of their mineral sunscreen and they also are now offering an AM facial lotion with a bumped up SPF 50 versus SPF 30 and I really have enjoyed this so it hybrid sunscreen it chemical filters it does leave a bit of a white cast but I when it comes to sunscreen cast an all mineral and inorganic sunscreen that does not have any organic AKA chemical active ingredients tends to be the ciest and organic AKA chemical sunscreen typically does not have any cast a hybrid has a little bit of a cast but it sunscreen is in my experience and this Falls in line with that the base is a really good daily facial moisturizer ceramides which are lipids naturally found in Skin hyaluronic acid which is hydrating it has niacinamide an antioxidant that good for redness dark spots the moisture barrier easy to tolerate around the eyes and I want to draw your attention to this because you do still need to be wearing sunscreen in the colder months even if it radiation you know it still has access to your skin but you spending as much time Outdoors you not getting sweaty you going swimming so the need for like a water resistant sunscreen not quite there you you really need something that is not only going to protect from ultraviolet radiation but also is going to be moisturizing and they did they did a good job on this I I really enjoy this no peeling it peel up off the surface of the skin I had great luck with applying this using it I really have enjoyed it we talked a little bit about UB quinone of course niacinamide Magnesium scorel phosphate these are antioxidants but then there also glutathione glutathione is an antioxidant of interest for hyperpigmentation in particular I have a whole video about topical glutathione as well as oral glutathione you need to check that out because I go into detail with regards to the studies behind oral glutathione for hyperpigmentation but I glutathione in them and you guys recommended this aplb this is a Korean brand aplb and so I decided to try their glutathione nicomide body lotion and I have to say this is almost like an antioxidant serum it lightweight fragrance-free lotion I have comfortably use this on my face although it way not only does it have glutathione but it also has niacinamide so these are good for defending against oxidated stress helping ward off the stressors that exacerbate hyperpigmentation help support the needs of the moisture barrier and defend against those free radicals that would prematurely age the skin it has sacy ferment which is hydrating and contains anti-inflammatory compounds it also has a variety of compounds from centella specifically mancic acid Asiatic acide and Asiatic acid these show promise for not only warding off against oxidative stress but for helping support the needs of healing Pathways I happen to think that this particular lotion is a really good value especially if you lean into it as more of an antioxidant serum it little heavier than like a typically marketed serum would be that being said I think it looking for something a little bit more affordable a larger size I have really enjoyed that one I look forward to trying more from this brand this line in particular I recently ordered their sunscreen so stay tuned I will be chatting with you guys about that some point in the future before the end of the year speaking of Korean skincare earlier this year I started using this rice probiotics overnight mask barrier jelly from abib and I reintroduced it into my routine so this is a clear colorless jellylike texture thick very thick it really does what it kind of markets itself is doing it is great For Your Skin Barrier fragrance-free it has rice ferment sacchromyces ferment no niacinamide I highly recommend this if you are going through a bout of sensitivity redness peeling irritation because it is so soothing so supportive of the needs of the barrier it to your skin it is a little sticky I would say in terms of the texture takes a long time for it to really dry down and absorb as you almost looks like you have this thin sheet of cellophane on your face it like really good at reducing water loss what I like about this and how I would recommend considering using it is in the retinoid sandwich as the top coat so retinoid sandwich if you a way to moisturize the skin while using a topical retinoid to reduce dryness and irritation you put a moisturizer on then you put your retinoid on then you put another layer of moisturizer on I don suggest putting this one on first because it is a thick barrier jelly so you might not get adequate penetration of your retinoid but as a top coat once your retinoid has dried down and absorbed in the skin applying this over it really does dampen down transepidermal water loss and reduce that stinging that burning sensation that you might experience especially on the cheeks there are a lot of blood vessels here it where people are more prone to experiencing burning stinging sensitivity flushing blushing you don need very much a little bit goes a long way I haven I my face arguably one of the best products I have tried this year all right and then last but not least I recently talked about this in a vlog it recommended across several videos and I recently repurchased it and have been using it here and there I mostly have been using it as like a hand cream it is the e45 cream so this is great if you have eczema sensitive skin kind of the epitome of a bland moisturizer it has white soft paraffin and liquid paraffin both of these are are great for reducing water loss I wanted to buy this and start using it again and talking about it because I believe it people in different countries throughout Europe I know most of what I recommend is either us-based or you know Korean Japanese but if you are looking for a moisturizer to get you through winter in the colder months this year especially if you have at topic dermatitis consider this one it cream great for a topic dermatitis now it does have lanoline lanoline is moisturizing it is a potential allergen it once thought it allergen in people who have something called stasis dermatitis with the lower legs but you can develop allergy to it so just be aware of that it pretty heavy I tried it on my face I found it a bit uncomfortable on the face but as a body moisturizer it option especially for dry rough elbows and knees really does a good job lubricating the skin surface to reduce friction I ankle an Les my ankles get really dry because I run the sweat and the friction and all of that dries out the skin there leads to just discoloration so this is great to lubricate hydrate reduce water loss all right so that regards to what I this past month I hope this video was informative to you guys who are maybe curious about different moisturizers maybe were just curious about these products in particular so hopefully this was helpful to you all make sure you check out my recent video reviewing the cavey sunscreens because I show the different tints and everything as a matter of fact I video on the end slate so if you interested in watching it tap on the ends slate thumbnail and it right to that video but I hope you guys are having a great first day of November if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe I bye [Music]	Success
Products I Tried That Did NOT Disappoint	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEbPLd9akXQ	Dr Day	it today dirty reviews of various things I been testing out behind the scenes I wanted to update you guys with regards to the Dr Dana nail renewal system this was sent to me in PR several months ago and I products weekly and I update you guys with regards to my final thoughts and opinions these products are meant to improve the look of the nail and overall health of the nail plate if you manicures artificial nails you remove them and you are super paper thin how do I get them back on track that are meant for or maybe you who deals with what brittle nail syndrome which is a condition where you have brittle nails with vertical nail ridges as a side note check out my video all about why you have vertical nail ridges I go into more details there first is the glycolic prep for nails so glycolic acid is an alpha hydroxy acid Alpha hydroxy acids are actually very helpful for the nail plate to help improve moisture content in the nail and strengthen the nail whether it be glycolic acid such as what is in this or lactic acid the way you use this is you paint it on the nails and run it underneath the nail as well once a week it has a nice brush applicator it can be a little challenging to get the right amount of product out aside from the glycolic acid which is an evidence-based ingredient for helping with nail Health nail strength and improving the look of the nails this also has a variety of ingredients that are well fragrance which actually took me by surprise because I was using this regularly had it not been for me looking at the ingredients I would not have known that because there is no Aroma or smell to this whatsoever like you paint it on the nails and it detect any smell with this I that out because fragrance is a possible allergen and allergic contact dermatitis around the nail folds can disrupt healthy nail growth so keep keep that in mind if you would avoid this I honestly don why they added fragrance like I said it doesn product I have definitely seen an improvement in my nails since incorporating this I don nails I haven nails but I have noted that my nails are seeming to be a lot stronger since since incorporating this into my routine I haven my hands more frequently cuz if you remember back to my videos on how to grow strong nail Nails I talk about you know maybe trying to do nail tapping because that improves circulation to the nail and actually can help with nail growth albe it it love not really any major change for me other than incorporating this and objectively within about a week and a half of starting to use it I really did see an improvement in the strength of my nails so this product is objectively good I would recommend it provided you moving on to the other product from Dr Dana is the Deep hydrating formula so this is basically a moisturizing product that you put to The Nail plate and to The Nail folds and that helpful for helping to retain moisture in the nail remember when the nail gets dehydrated it breakage to snagging on things if the skin around the nails becomes dry inflamed irritated it actually can impact nail growth now this product is interesting it consistency if you while you know there caby that I have recommended off and on in videos here and there the skin renewing Gel Oil that this reminds me of it colorless it feels kind of like a hybrid between a gel and an oil it has a variety of well oils apricot kernel oil coconut oil for example but like the glycolic prep this also has fragrance so again potential concern there because if you are allergic and you get an allergic contact dermatitis around the nails that in your healthy nail growth Journey this is fine I think this is helpful you could use it daily just paint it on there it when it comes to my tips for healthy nail growth in addition to lactic acid glycolic acid Ura for like active nail ingredients that can help I straight up just recommend to get plain petroleum jelly Vaseline and put it around the nail folds to The Nail plate it can really help to protect the skin around on the nails and prevent moisture from getting up under the nail folds back behind the nail and disrupting healthy nail growth I actually think petroleum jelly is superior to this because this is mostly oils oils are not as good as an ointment for moisturizing the skin they help with softening but they don really lock in hydration maximally like a petroleum jelly ointment would this has an interesting applicator it the little brush on there kind of a little challenging to get out 0.1 1 7 oz but this is handy I will say to throw in your bag paint on there on the go it not as greasy as petroleum jelly it does dry absorb into the skin around the nail pretty quickly so it might be something you want to keep in your bag the third product I want to talk about is this file so this is the priming wand now this has three different sides to it now nail files are super helpful because they help to well file the rough corners of the nail that can get snagged on things so a tip I have for people who are trying to grow out their nails trying to improve nail Health nail strength seems counterintuitive but it really can help and that keep the nails trimmed pretty short see as the nail grows out long once it becomes long it becoming dehydrated and then becoming brittle it also gets snagged on things and bangs up against things and that can lead to ridging and slower nail growth overall so I actually recommend trimming your nails short but when you cut your nail Nails you might have little sharp edges the corners so filing those can help cut down on those getting snagged on things which ultimately likewise can you know be disruptive to healthy nail growth so I like this gray side so the other side you have this green part which kind of helps to smooth out the nail surface and then you have this white part which essentially Buffs the nail and makes it look really shiny this is very gratifying to use because after you use it your nails look really shiny really pretty smooth but keep in mind using something like this buffing the nails actually can be somewhat disruptive to healthy nail growth in the long run because it to The Nail itself to be buffing in it one of those aggressive manicure practices that can backfire in the long run so of these three I would say the glycolic acid prep is like really the most impressive the one that does a lot of the heavy lifting the nail file is good but you can get something like this at Sally Beauty Supply for significant L less or really anywhere that sells a nail care supplies Target Walmart this isn but you know it can get all three of these in the kit which is what was sent to me honestly it looking at it from a distance you might be like oh that these are not bad products I think they you don sanding all right moving away from the nail renewal products to a product I reviewed this past month maybe you missed the review it is the new road barrier butter this also was sent to me in PR but I have tried um all of Rad skincare and I have honestly been pretty impressed with it especially since it a celebrity brand and usually those are all smok and mirrors and then when you use the product it just pay for but Road Skin Care in my experience has actually been really good and this barrier butter honestly is no exception so it is like a balm and bombs can be super helpful for really helping to jump start the barrier repair process they option if you have patches of irritation patches of very dry inflamed skin if you get chapped skin windburn especially in the cold winter months balms are also a good option if you to dabble in the slugging Arts but you don jelly cuz it to try something else balms are kind of an option for example L Ro POS seea plast balm is a classic example of a balm and this is kind of a similar consistency but what I have really liked about this is it has one of my favorite hard toin ingredients polyglutamic acid polyglutamic acid is not only hydrating but it almost provides this what feels like a protective thin barrier to water loss so it really helps with hydration and it helps with skin elasticity this also has a few different forms of hyaluronic acid likewise hydrated and hyaluronic acid Works similar to polyglutamic acid as far as improving moisture retention they kind of complement each other and this has cides which when appli to the skin helps your skin to perhaps make cides more readily to help get the barrier back on track so I really enjoyed this and since my video reviewing it I and I find that the way I enjoying using it is to areas on my body um that are more vulnerable to dryness like my elbows my knees um I like putting it on my forearms and I like to put it on after I put on like a more lightweight lotion almost like stacking moisturizer um I really find that it kind of helps lock in the hydration and give the skin a nice glowy dewy radiant Jud it following day cuz I use products like this at night the following day I don have like a greasy film on my skin if I scratch my skin I don moisturiz or Gunk up under my nails and my skin feels soft smooth hydrated moisturize throughout the day so it really has good staying power as far as the moisturizing effect that it imparts I have not been disappointed all right and then last but not least it to come as a surprise to many of you some of you already know because I been talking about this in various videos it wear perfume even though I cautioning about fragrance allergy I really enjoy perfume like that want my fragrance I want my fragrance in actual perfume or for my shampoo I don want it in like a face cream I do wear perfume from time to time and I easily give me a headache be offensive there popular that almost like make me crabby when I smell them a little cranky and I just have to like walk away because I know perfume is you know very individualized and people have like strong emotional connections to certain scents well those of you who here for a while you know last year I discovered that Billy eyelish perfume Love it love it love it love it but I found a more affordable dupe of it that I think I actually like even better because I believe this dup has better lasting power so the scent profile is like a chocy waffle cone chocolate cake you know like when you make chocolate cake and then you have the batter in the bowl and you want like want to lick the spoon that like honestly it when I bought it it was a bit impulsive and I thought this is probably not going to have good lasting power or it to you know be a DT or maybe it to have some kind of funk to it and give me a headache wow was I ever shocked surprised at how good this actually is I also was apprehensive because after I ordered it I started reading reviews from this brand and the brand as a whole it could glean this perfume is so good I definitely not mad at myself for just blind buying it because it has really delivered bird as far as a perfume I get a lot of compliments on it and I just love the way it smells uh and it stays all day like I spray it on in the morning when I getting ready and when I towards the end of the day when I go for a run it not headache inducing I also think it the kind of perfume that you could also pair with other perfumes if you like to layer different scents like if you have a vanilla scent that you want to pair with it or maybe a fruer scent I think that the two together would be pretty nice actually let me know if you have tried this cuz I did see some comments from you guys cuz I recommended it in my gift guide and a lot of you were like I got that after you recommended it and oh my gosh I love it if you don gourman scents pass like I said fragrance is very in individualized as far as what people like and don but if you like you know sweet stuff this isn my opinion like it bopper just walked past you who sprayed too much perfume on at the Macy counter you know what I mean um no it not like that it choco musk all right guys that Fast Five hope you all had a wonderful Thanksgiving holiday those of you in the US this past weekend and December before you know it we 2025 um anyways guys I hope you enjoyed this video if so give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don I [Music]	Success
Skincare We Need To Discuss | December 2024 Mini-Reviews	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxiolsoPvqs	Dr Day	December is over we know what that means it with you guys my monthly Fast Five this is a series I year now maybe over a year I can remember where I essentially just give a quick and dirty rundown of five products that I month or maybe a little bit longer than a month so those of you who watch my Vlog I need to update you with regards to the medic Cube collagen wrapping mask remember I got really excited when I found out that I got this in the Advent calendars I was this was like one of the first things I wanted to try out this is a mask that claims to offer deep hydration and it meaning you put it on as like the last step of your nighttime skincare routine definitely the last step I should say it it minimize transepidermal water loss what does it have in it it niacinamide camide these are moisturizing ingredients that support the needs of a Skin Barrier great it also has collagen extract in it which is hydrating fragrance-free although it does have Rose flow extract but there to this here put two and two together together when I first got this and put it on is that this is a peel off mask so it interesting right because um I remembered seeing this on Tik Tok of people just like peeling off what look essentially like Saran Wrap I swear I look more and more like a crazy person on this app every single day this is why I WRA my face in collagen okay you guys it is the next morning and as you can see the mask stayed on really well except for it lifted a little bit around my nose which is fine I show you guys how my skin looks underneath this I don of satisfying but it it and nide which is kind of cool okay so here is what my skin looks like after the sleeping mask is off this is why I product once I realized that I thought huh maybe I didn right because I kind of balling up peeling so I tried putting it on thicker it does it does peel off but I could never get the dramatic peel off effect that I people on Tik Tok do I don they just used a lot of the product because if you put it on thicker it is easier to peel off the following day now it does say that you can wash it off to cut to the chase don it is just very high maintenance to peel this off it doesn get it to come off in one nice sheet it just was like these little balls that I had to constantly be picking off of my face never that nice sheet I get sheets but but not like one whole sheet kind of irritating to peel off the stuff did not really find that my skin was like glowy bouncy dewy hydrated I was just mostly annoyed and like just when I thought I got everything off there little rolly balls up in my hairline this product is for special effects and that results it social media content creating product I think because I pointed this out one of my Vlogs but peel off masks are not anything new they you know Freeman is the one who I always always comes to my mind when I think of peel off masks Freeman has been doing that for years and it kind of is more focused around hydration but when you it the barrier so I think it can be a little irritating for some people and maybe you know contribute more so to dryness than hydration did not work out well for me when you put it on it goes on really sticky it almost feels like you does dry down into a film that is not going to stick to your pillowcase or anything but a few times when I tried this I noticed by the time I woke up it was already peeling off in areas but in other areas really stubborn to get off the skin so in summary no this is a pass I do not recommend it there are much better hydrating overnight masks out there specifically the abib rice mask highly recommend that very thick very rich deeply hydrating that my go-to all right the next one to surprise you it Nivea fresh Blends apricot mango plus rice oh my gosh you guys this body wash is so good the scent that is is amazing it apricot Aroma now fragrance I don in rinse off products if you obviously you have to avoid this body wash though is not drying it easy to rinse off the skin it does have rice extract which is a moisturizing ingredient the surfactants in this include sodium lth sulfate cocal propyl betane and cural glucoside as well as some other I believe alkal glucosides in the formula the scent of this is so delicious it smells like real apricot real mango you almost want to drink it be careful around your children because they might just want to lap this up it kind of reminds me of mango Lassie looks like it smells like it amazing amazing amazing amazing I think it option if you have dry skin although body wash is one of those things you kind of have to be careful with if you have dry skin because it can dry out your skin even further if you too much or if you don off if it gets trapped in the skin fults it really can residue left behind but overall I think this is a pretty decent body wash the smell is really the reason to buy it provided you fragrance it amazing SC all right y watched the Vlogs at least that for longer than a month now probably two months at this point I been using skin 104 halfway finished with it and I say it does what it a cleansing oil right you all know I like to use a cleansing oil or a cleansing balm as the first up before I get in the shower basically to break up the film of makeup I think cleansing oils and balms work really well for removing mascara and since I implemented this technique I really feel as though it has helped my lashes not break as readily and they maybe a little bit longer now the thing about this particular cleansing oil it really is light the consistency is much thinner than say a h aabo rest in peace cleansing oil cuz it was discontinued or like the DHC cleansing oil the coose sofo those have a little bit of grip to them there thick in those this is very thin very lightweight as a result I think I end up using more of it so I don for it as much as some of the others just purely from an experience perspective I don luxurious gliding oil massage across my face with this pretty lightweight now it does work you know to break up the makeup I just find that I in for a second pump which I almost I rarely ever do that with cleansing oils and it does have fragrance so it bergamont oil which is a citrus oil historically could cause a phyto photodermatitis but in skincare products the problematic ingredient the furo cumerin uh presumably has been removed plus you got cantella asiatica extract those uh botanic extracts from cantella extracts from centella are anti-inflammatory antioxidant um it which is frequently found actually in a lot of cleansing oils hoba seed oil and sunflower seed oil it really lightweight not my favorite cleansing oil not bad works well not horrible and I was enjoying it in the beginning but just over time I of been like you know this is not really my favorite cleansing oil um maybe I being a little bit too picky but with so many great options out there it think this is not going to be one I would repurchase all right I return to my roots of gold bom that is and I repurchased One um what I would consider my goldbond Gateway moisturizer the Gold Bond healing overnight lotion this is just as lovely as I remember so I wanted to bring it up again because I actually almost finished with this bottle I go through a lot of moisturizer if you didn almost finished with this one this is one of the few Gold Bond moisturizers that has a scent that has fragrance it has lavender I haven face although it is marketed to be safe for the face but it are actually looking for a scented body lotion that works as far as helping to hydrate the skin and improve dry skin but smells nice it scent like it doesn it hits you in the face from across the room it nice scent this moisturizer like most Gold Bond moisturizers has Ura and part of Skin that the skin and maintain uh moisture content in Skin also has gluconolactone it polyhydroxy acid that is both hydrating and gently exfoliates dry rough skin but one of the reasons why I went back to this is it has melatonin which I think is the reason I originally bought it melatonin is an antioxidant that is not as common as other antioxidants and can help offset oxidative stress in the skin now this also has niacinamide which is commonly found in moisturizers it vitamin good for the moisture barrier as well as warding off against oxidative stress and is helpful for hyperpigmentation and for redness love this love it love it love it I would buy it if it were fragrance-free probably more often cuz I don use scented leave on products that much but this one I was like H I use it again because from what I remember it was good and I heard Rumblings that maybe it had been reformulated it been it can moisturizers like they for their powder right their foot powder but the lotions are really where it and they call themselves lotions but they like more like a cream but that being said they have this almost like whipped texture to them and it really is an overnight product that the following morning you much better the dryness has been tackled I needs highly recommend any Gold Bond moisturizer but this one but if you don Gold Bond healing um sensitive and they have the gold bom pure those are fre free of fragrance the Gold Bond retinol one that I love is free of fragrance the tight and renew I recently finished up um a while ago is fragrance free I mean they got an eczema relief one with colloidal oatmeal highly recommend that if you have eczema atopic dermatitis love gold BN check out my video though on my top Gold Bond moisturizers because I break it down there so if you want to know more about the different ingredients in them definitely watch that video all right and then last but not least is from e.l.f it acne calming water cream I reviewed this a couple of months ago and I I reviewed this whole line actually but I finished this up and wanted to update you guys I have to tell you this moisturizer it flies under the radar if you are on a budget check this out because the price point is so good the formula is really nice it has 4% niacinamide 1% salicylic acid and tranexamic acid so this is a great leave on lightweight hydrating moisturizer that is great for people who have acne and if your acne heals with redness or dark mark this is a great option because tranexamic acid and niacinamide they help with those things tranexamic acid more so redness and the moisture Bearer nicomide moisture Bearer redness dark spots these ingredients work for dark spots by kind of getting in the way of pigment transfer from meanyes to neighboring keratinocytes so really good in that regard and the 1% salicylic acid can help offer some control for little breakouts Chone formation because it really gets down in the pore and exfoliates it breaks up like it of stug together skin cells lining the pore that under comeone formation and can really help in that regard plus salicylic acid is also really good for lightning hyperpigmentation this moisturizer is fragrance-free it has a greenish tint to it which is really helpful for offering a little bit of color correction for facial redness it lightweight enough that you can use it underneath things so it that day because you can put sunscreen on over this no problem this is much better than the triple acid serum they have in this this line that acid Serum is fine but this one is really good and you know some might argue this is a serum cuz it is really lightweight but it moisturizing hydrating enough on its own that it can serve as a standalone facial moisturizer too and again if you using it during the day you can put sunscreen on over it and sunscreen is a moisturizer you know so you kind of get a little bit of extra richness if you will if that you need that this alone is not enough at night you can put it on and put put on a richer night cream or one thing I have really enjoyed doing a lot and how I I over that I jelly I you can use this alongside a topical retinoid be aware though that using salicylic acid along with a topical retinoid if you topical retinoid that can enhance irritation make irritation worse for you but if you accustomed to your topical retinoid then yeah you definitely can use salicylic acid along with it u in most cases you know it test out for yourself um I really really like this and the price point is so good I mean skincare has gotten really expensive like a lot of the drugstore brands are

Skincare We Need To Discuss (Haruharu, Tirtir, Tocobo, E.l.f.) | January 2025	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQIIbo4hnZo	Dr Day	the longest month of the year is over congratulations and we are in the shortest month of the year and you know what that means it is time you guys and I know those of you who know you already you already you already clued the boss in to what time it is it Fast Five Five skincare products that I tried out over the month of January my quick and dirty reviews now the bulk of this is going to come from the amazing Korean Advent calendars that were gifted to me that I opened throughout the month of December number one is from the brand tier tier now this is a brand that really popular right now for their makeup but they also have some popular skincare products let milk skin toner niacinamide of course right I mean it you already know that though good for redness dark spots the moisture barrier anti-aging all of that it also has a variety of antioxidants copper tripeptide one for example speaking of peptides it has argireline which everybody likes to pretend is Botox in a bottle man let me tell you I mentioned this in my 2024 trends that need to die stop pretending things are Botox whether it be peptides Foods inanimate objects the list goes on and on uh regardless are juring a peptide there is some research that applied around the eyes can smooth out plump up and diminish the appearance of lines around the wrinkles wrinkles lines around the wrinkles wrinkles around the eyes now is that all due to hydration who knows also o has licorice root another ingredient that great for redness and the hyperpigmentation now it lightweight thin hydrating but also has a bit of an emolient slip to it it has rice brand extract and oat kernel extract which are very moisturizing extracts along with beta glue can now when you I put this on as the first step in my morning skin care routine and the first step in my evening skincare routine to damp skin after cleansing it is a thin flu fluid you don spread on the surface of the skin all over the face you can use it around the eyelids if you want you can take it down the neck as well it toner though it has a bit of an oily texture to it it heavy there like oiliness to it just be aware of that it doesn honestly when you put stuff on over it whether it be a gel or cream it doesn conflict meaning you don peeling it does have peppermint leaf extract not full-blown foot cream peppermint leaf extract where you open the bottle and you Circa 97 going to the mall sniffing the coffee beans in little shot glass in between whiffs and smears it that but when you you earthy SCH Smurfy I it linger but it certainly is not fragrance-free and it peppermint leaf extract so just be aware of that because for those of you who have rosacea That Could That Could Jack you up uh peppermint in skin care is not a friend to rosacea tends to aggravate redness can precipitate a flush Burns and stings I would stay away from this toner actually if you have rosacea not to say that everyone with rosacea is going to have problems with this if you got rosacea and this is my Holy Grail milky toner all right great but I saying like for people who are on the fence like should I buy this if you got rosacea just stay away stay away there are so many other hydrating moisturizing toners out there you don need to be dabbling in the peppermint Arts okay you do not need candy cane face so I started towards the end of December throughout January rather enjoying it no problems with it it moisturizing I don be frank I go right back to it would I go out of my way to purchase it a fulls siiz bottle no really glad that I got the travel bottle because that enough more than enough if you want to try it out see if you can hands on the Travel size mine came in a box set with a travel size of their cleansing balm which I look forward to trying out next stay tuned for the Fast Five come March 1st because maybe that isn ever used no next is going to be the Haru Haru Wonder cantella 4% tranexamic acid dark spot Goa away serum 4% nide reasonable percentage okay if you sensitive to niacinamide 4% is great because above 5 % it what are we looking for here um you not going to get more anti- redness more help with dark spots more moisture barrier more antioxidant necessarily with higher you might just get more irritated so 4% is perfect it also has 4% tranexamic acid which is an ingredient that I have actually been using consistently now for close to 8 months in various products as you guys who watch regularly have seen me review and complete numerous different train Amic acid products and tranexamic acid in skin care what can it offer it the most robustly studied skincare ingredient we mostly give it by mouth to patients who have melasma as well as to treat other things in medicine but in dermatology it and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation with pretty good success but applying it to the skin one might think oh it going to be great for hyperpigmentation it might but we actually have some promising clinical experience from small case studies showing applying tranexamic acid seems to be really helpful uh for post-inflammatory athema persistent redness it sticks around after like you and also for people who have rosacea the the facial redness of rosacea it also shows promise topically for helping out with your moisture barrier which ultimately can help to reduce irritation dryness help overall with skin hydration I haven my skin since using this ingredient consist consistently but it doesn to bother me either and so like I said I with this ingredient now for like 8 months this also has ascorbic acid vitamin C which is a tricky ingredient not the most stable thing and challenging to get into the skin but if it gets into the skin it can help not only with hyperpigmentation with anti-aging because it but it may even help to improve collagen production ultimately decreasing wrinkle depth but you know it in a skincare product given the stability issues this also has sodium escor phosphate that is a stable form of vitamin C which can get into the skin but does it convert to ascorbic acid question mark there is a small study of patients with acne showing that sodium escorial phosphate seems to be helpful for those individuals do we all need to be using it would we all benefit from it again it that science has yet to address then it ingredient that has been shown to be helpful for Waring off oxidative stress anti-inflammatory healing and these include atic acid medicc acid and asiatica side as well as just good old cantella asiatica extract all right so I ended up using this twice a day morning and evening after applying the tear tear and I feel as though it it because like I said I tranexamic acid consistently now for like 8 months I don drastic change in my skin prior to using this I was using the Ana tranexamic acid serum that has B12 in it you guys remember um the main difference I observing in using both products is a the an11 obviously had B12 this does not the annual one also had a that high percentage of niacinamide whereas this one has a more reasonable percentage so if you percentages of niacinamide you get along with it though you might try this over the ano one but honestly like I really can that I I genuinely find them to be very comparable and performance and feel Comfort no problem with the Haru Haru Wonder dark spot go away serum so it might be one if you marks dark marks red marks and you want something to soothe to gently hydrate to help potentially support the needs of improving those this might you know might be something you might want to consider but as it stands now with my skin it need in my routine but don there next in line is a moisturizer also from Haru Haru I bought this it didn come in the Advent calendar whereas the tear tier and the go away serum did so I bought this solely because of the cute packaging it comes in a little coffee cup mug paper mug Type S jar I just thought that was so cute had to have it and I was like well I trying out the serum that I got in the Advent calendar might as well get the gel cream to go on top and I have not mind this at all 5% niacinamide still a reasonable percentage strength uh no tranic acid fragrance-free has Squan which is an emolient also has panthenol which is very moisturizing Asiatic acid and masso side again compounds from centella helpful for healing fragrance-free I genuinely have found this to be a pleasant lightweight hydrating gel moisturizer if you have really oily skin you don moisturizers or you rosacea is precipitated by using like really heavy eclusive moisturizers but you still need a moisturizer to address You Know Your Skin Barrier issues this would be a good one to consider is it the best moisturizer I but at this point I that you know I have pretty high standards for something that it to be like oh my gosh yes oh my gosh yes um this is this is a good facial moisturizer it but I tested out using this a fair amount on my body arms and legs actually a really good body moisturizer as well maybe this brand would come out with like a gel cream I actually come out with body gel cream it Neutrogena the Hydro Boost body gel cream that I really like with hyaluronic acid I cream maybe a little bit thicker with some petrolatum in there although I don use petrolatum much anyway I digress love it no problem with it happy to use it actually almost finished with it and I adorable cup and then the next one did come from a Korean Advent calendar can remember if was style boner yes style it that right probably not the vitamin nourishing lip balm this has been something that I actually do find myself going to multiple times a day whenever I feel like my lips are getting a little not dry per se but like I just want to judge them up a bit um so I have used this lip balm a lot and I can out why because my lips aren they bur on my face and it lip balm or lip ointment or lip mask it doesn formulation that really lock in moisture into the lips to keep them hydrated soft it an emolient to soften any dry flakes but I have found myself just almost like out of boredom sometimes just reaching for it and putting it on almost habitually and it really like that it doesn flavorant in it because flavorants in lip balms can end up causing irritation that kind of gets you hooked on the lip balm because the irritation takes a while to show up once it does and you reach for that same problematic lip balm again not realizing it this doesn flavorant SL fragrance doesn really exotic ingredients it does have surprise surprise niacinamide which is going to be helpful for an impaired moisture barrier provided you tolerate it and your lip skin is prone to irritation given the nature of how the the skin on our lips really doesn stratum corium going on it ascorbic acid stable form of vitamin C so the niomi the ascorbic acid may be helpful for brightening up the lips although you don the way of pigment cells on the pink part of the lip um but an antioxidant that may help W up oxidative stress from environmental exposures although this is not a lip sunscreen so for being outdoors make sure you sunscreen on your lips especially if you are out shoveling snow the UV ray days they do reflect up off the snow and you know your lips are vulnerable territory it amoland um I actually used it like I said almost out of habit quite a bit even when my lips aren of you who watch my Vlogs you several months ago I purchased a lip balm from usan with coconut oil and I was commenting in some of my Vlogs about how it again doesn Petrol lotum in it this one from usin to really lock and hydration it it just like smearing a little coconut oil on your lips to soften any dry flakiness if you don doesn kind of similar in terms of performance this is a kind of product that have in your purse good to have on you for when you computer all day in the office the heater somebody and you kind of want to just judge up your appearance a bit not makeup but you just want to look a little bit more together something on the lips not necessarily A gloss cuz a lot of people are not interested in having some sticky shiny gloss this is good you know this kind of rejuvenates the appearance of the lips and softens the skin of the lips to make them just cosmetically look better so that someone who lipstick hoarder like I am this would be a great product to consider in those situations I I not least not a Korean product but category-wise the most important category a sun screen that I have been talking about trying and those of you who watch like a lot of my shopping videos you would you just buy that thing already and use it and tell us what is it any good I finally did the e.l. Untouchable invisible sunscreen SPF 35 so you know I love E. I really like that this I have been loving it sunscreen zero z0 white cast I mean there here there there comes out clear comes out colorless it is a chemical sunscreen it done up to 80 minutes which I love so if you happen to get you know sweaty doing some shoveling snow or whatever great I never had any issues with it causing Burnie stingy eyes used it around my eyelids and no problem or have been my one gripe with it is that I suggest shaking the bottle a little bit before applying it because I did notice that when you squeeze it out it feels a little oily coming out if you shake it that did didn you sunscreen this is very similar no Nia cide in this which is a win for those of you who don because their tinted one which I also love does have niacinamide I believe this does not it to find niacinamide free anything but it sunscreens so if you sensitive person all right y was this month not mad at all really grateful to have been sent those Advent calendars because I get a lot of interesting Korean beauty products to test out I like on my eyes eyelids I the Sam um eyeshadow and then on my lips I that I like I said really grateful that they send me those because it kind of is fun to try everything out over the you know over the year all right with that I going to end this video on the ins slight I Fast Five so you can check that one out out if you missed it but if you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don I [Music]	Success
Skincare We Need To Discuss | February 2025 Reviews	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhfYNw2E-VQ	Dr Day	it what that means oh yeah get your popcorn get your snack get your beverages put Charlie in a Timeout because yeah it time for the Fast Five Five skincare products that yours truly tested out put through the ringer throughout the month of February and I got the notebook pen and Pad connected first of all let sunscreen surprise surprise on this channel on this channel yeah um and I sarcastic because sunscreen most important skin care product okay but finding a sunscreen that doesn can be a challenge right they can be too thick goopy casty burn sting I fan of lightweight gels so I decided to give naked Sundays is that the name yeah naked Sundays a a test drive now I tried one of their other sunscreens in the past and found it to be a too thick too chalky it was a zinc oxide number that was not my favorite but when I saw they had a clear colorless sunscreen gel I said oh wait oh wait step on up to the bar cuz I got a Shaker in hand I got some mint and we this Cabana clear yeah Cabana clear SPF 50 really really had hoped that this would be water resistant but it it still want it to be water resistant is because this type of formula is made for summer heat summer sweat activities outdoors working out outside you don want some thick pasty chalky creamy zinc oxide oppressive layer on your skin that evaporation of sweat and keep you from well reapplying every 2 hours while you a sunscreen gel is a go-to in these kind of situations but you water resistant anyway a sunscreen gel is also a great option for people who well like gels they like the lightweight feel but especially it into if you mustache prominent eyebrows and you not so jazzed about sunscreens that leave this weird residue and people are like what is going on are you going gray in a weird way oh I made a rhyme this caught my eye and let me tell you it has not been disappointing now I was a little timid those of you who have been here since the 2016 days one of the first controversial opinions I shared on this channel back in the 2016 era was with regards to my negative experience with the at the time cult favorite Australian Gold Botanical sunscreen now this brand has since come out with many other sunscreens but at the time this was the IT thing to be talking about using reviewing lots of people use it love it but for me it was not it was not something that my skin got along well with for whatever reason it caused a lot of skin irritation for me and at the time I said I don about this that does not work for me maybe just maybe it plump that was the only thing I thought maybe it had cockadoodle doo in it I was like oh gosh I don time when I got that irritation uh good news it has not only not cause me irritation but I loving it loving it loving it love the Finish very lightweight now it does make you dewy glowy and that lasts pretty persistent it bouncy radiant glow if you those who is a dieh hard matte like you want it to be like almost like you got powder on pass on this if you like a little Dew a little hydration a little glow yeah this is great no white cast it is a chemical sunscreen now this an Australian brand but the ingredients for the sunscreen actives are what are allowed in US sunscreen so you getting you know an American sunscreen all right you Australian sunscreen with the Australian filters cuz that wouldn okay and you can buy this at Target I bought mine on Amazon of course they get a little fancy and they use like the fullon chemical name for Ava benzone which if you um it might throw you for a loop being like Oh my gosh where where is the UVA filter in here it it it made a name if you will not only does it not burn or sting but I tolerate it around my eyes no problem and I mentioned you know the eyebrow thing cuz I put it on my eyelids up in here in my brow area doesn seeping into my eyes giving me blurry vision which is great can can I want to Hype up about this cuz I know some of you are already falling asleep and about to click out but before you do those of you who come in here throwing your hands up in the air saying not another product with niacinamide I cannot tolerate it it burns it stings it causes me irritation and it is in everything as a matter of fact even my dishwashing detergent is marketed now as having Nia Cinema to get rid of dark spots on my glasses you watch that coming if it isn guess what this no Nia Cinema all right so that was that I tested out some lip care products this past month one of them was the popular I mean very hyped on Tik Tok at least amongst The Young Summer Fridays I have to look down cuz I get Summer Fridays and naked Sundays like all mixed up and I want to call it naked Friday and summer Sunday and then I Fridays um these Lip Butter balms you would think the way people talk about these that they to use to try and I know I party and trying them story of my life I don kind of wait it out and be like H do I really want to try that I don what about this less expensive thing so I finally gave this a go the cake batter cake birthday birthday cake lip butter balm and I was not impressed this has zero longevity on the lips okay it does not it just got a run-of-the-mill body lotion and put it on your lips which you can do but mind you it does not have the the longevity on the lipss lips you know they skin there stuff is less you know you you got to formulate with lips in mind I notice if you put products that are not meant for the lips on the lips it of like they just sort of fall right off that was my experience with this it got shea butter it butter I don that right um so it some more natural if you will Butters no petroleum jelly which is probably why I don jelly on the lips lock in hydration prevent saliva from further drying out your lips no no petroleum jelly it is a vegan formula but of course it has fragrance in it hence the birthday cake um which you know a lot of people probably like it but be aware of that uh fragrance irritation allergy to fragrance and lip balms can lead to the Vicious Cycle of your lips becoming chapped after using a product and then you put that thing back on cuz it feels so good and then you just kind of repeat this vicious cycle because every time you were then exposed to the allergen irritant you know it kind of feeds the process after that soothing softening feeling and effect has passed you know and that the the irritation manifests so just be aware of that um this would not be one I would repurchase okay I would not repurchase this and even the Aesthetics of it you put it on and it got Shimmer in it which looks nice that does not last that has no longevity okay and y on here I products I all things lip care products and this is just Bonnie Bell of lip smackers can do a better job okay like your 12-year-old has better lip balms than this trust me so I was not a fan now let yeah another lip product so rock sent me this in PR they um lip volumizer I went in with trepidation because lip plumpers lip volumizers they there that is a low-grade irritant and in this case it which causes Vaso dilation and that going to lead to tissue swelling and that however capsicum you know can be irritating because hello it if you away capsicum can be pretty irritating for rosacea I mean we mostly think about it as a trigger when you ingest it but putting it on the skin the baso dilation even if it I would not go messing around with that if I had rosacea which I don not cause me any irritation I will say the Plumping effect is nice it definitely is there the Plumping effect does not last very long however it takes a bit for it to manifest it lasts maybe um an hour and a half 2 hours so you would need to reapply to repeat that effect you do get at least I did a bit of a tingle with that okay A bit of a tingle something something but uh not burning or anything like that for me now one thing I will say about this the formula is nice and thick good for reducing water loss from the lips and protecting the lips from irritant and let me tell you in contrast to that summer Friday sticking it does not wear off easily like you put it on it does the Plumping thing the Plumping thing kind of dies down but it like you put it on at 7 in the morning and come lunchtime you eat your lunch and you up now yeah that that product it goes over lipstick wonderfully you know if you have a lipstick on that you want to then have a Plumping effect and some gloss this would be a great product it has collagen peptide in it which is hydrating you know people get all you know high and mighty about collagen and skincare they say oh it ever waste your time money or efforts on collagen in skin care but collagen in skin care is not intended to get into this skin and replace collagen yes it too large to do that even the peptides can it works and works well in my experience and why I along for the ride is that it helps with moisture retention in the outermost stratum corium layers and that Smooths everything out so it humectant and so just like hyaluronic acid in your skin care is not going to localize to the dermis and fill your wrinkles like a hyaluronic acid filler wood we all can appreciate hyaluronic acid in moisturizers for its hydrating effect same thing with collagen and it got collagen peptide in it which is you know small not the whole fullon collagen protein um but none less likely is working to improve moisture retention so I have really enjoyed this if you your lip closed for a bit and you open them as you start talking there sticks to the the lips kind of are sticking together and you get these little tiny fine strings they snap back up onto your lip and they don like strings hanging as I have encountered with some lip care products it doesn sticky and it does have a bit of a stringy effect all right so keep keep that in mind that might be so disgusting in your mind to have to deal with that that you get me off this this yacht of lip Plumping all right so just be aware of that I lip plumpers because I just feel like my lips are fine the size they are for my face they voluminous but I feel like they fit my face and I interested in lip filler as a matter of fact I remember reading this autobiography of a ballet dancer gy Kirkland this is a long time ago before filler was so mainstream and I can remember being so shocked at the concept of injecting filler into your lips because she had had that done at the time I mean this was back in the 70s yeah the 70s for having a more dramatic onstage presence you know that was her mindset like because she wanted you know your face kind of gets lost on on stage in ballet and that so over the top and that was kind of her mindset there fast forward to 2025 you go walking around and people are rocking the gy Kirkland lips and they they donkey H okay that gravitate towards I think they get lip filler blindness this plumper is not going to get you that kind of effect just a subtle oh did you just eat um you know some hot wings or something and your lips are swollen from the hot sauce that you want to eat a a spicy food you might get a similar effect um all right that is the lip volumizer let promised you guys in last month Five that I would try out and yes I did the tier tier hydroboost enzyme cleansing bomb you Fast Five we talked about the uh milky toner which I was like not so great better than the ordinary milky toner but anyway that that video which you need to watch if you care the teer tier hydroboost enzyme cleansing WM as a reminder it came along with that milky toner in one of the Korean Advent calendars which were gifted to me this I ended up taking with me to New York you guys watch the Vlogs hopefully if you that went over the weekend but I took this with me to New York because it good travel size and then I to use it since returning and it does what you wanted to do you know it cleansing balm you put a little bit onto a dry face massage it in it starts to dissolve the makeup great for mascara eye makeup just gently massaging you not you know wiping away with some drying wipe so it it it does that and then a little bit of water you can get it to work up into a creamy uh Emulsion it rinses off just fine you know this is what I do I do the double cleanse with a product like this I do that step outside of the shower I don just smear it all over my face and then I hop in the shower and then I wash my face with a gentle cleanser and it it since like 2017 when I first discovered double cleansing all right and this this works really well I like that it has no scent not only is there no fragrance there balms that are fragrance-free they have a bit of an aroma of whatever the underlying butter is which is fine you know it doesn when I reviewed and tried out Cave cleansing balm I was always talking about how it felt like you were rubbing a croissant on your face it had a real like butter butter smell to it this is completely neutral no odor no Aroma now while it is fragrance free I will point out it does have lavender extract Rosemary extract so if you have fragrance allergy it could crossreact so just keep that in mind it rice brand oil amazing really nice texture it it surface and it rinses off easily yes you could use this by itself without a second step water-based cleanser like I do um if you wanted to although I will say when it comes to removing makeup I don I find sink face washing to be the most insufferable practice that that do that I do what I do with the double cleanse the idea of of removing makeup at the sink forget about it forget about it forget about it forget about it too messy you got drips of water that are laced with black mascara Gunk messing everything up just frustrates me and I use often times might be using a tubing mascara or something so you got this black everywhere no thanks prefer to do that in the shower much more efficient so yeah this is a good cleansing balm I repurchase it 100% we two on tier tier as far as stuff I really like in the skin care realm that I not least we need to talk about of course I tried another body lotion this past month because I when it comes to moisturizing the body I like I take it very seriously I use body moisturizer pretty much from the neck down sometimes I moisturizer on my face I have talked about how I enjoy L Ro P bomb where well they came out with lip aare Ura 10% roughness smoothing lotion which I knew I had to try out because Ura hello hello hello hello 10% Ura is very hydrating helps soften great if you have rough and bumpy skin keratosis pylas if you elbows the knees around the ankles due to friction frictional um thickening you have an old dried up eczema that is discolored that yeah Ura can be really fantastic so I was stok for that it also has shea butter it soothing and and let document no ni cinnamide in contrast to the lip aare AP which I just mentioned does have nide this does not hold up hold up because if you actually do have eczema you toe into the water really slowly like you first with this because burning and stinging all right Ura can sting I I remember as a child with my atopic dermatitis encountering Ura for the first time and it was like being slapped on the cheek um that but it took me by surprise and nowadays I use Ura like it and so I don that but you know formulation can impact these kinds of things and I get you know UPS of my hand eczema especially this hand um I get the full-on dis hydrosis all right I get the little bumps and yeah you know if you know you know and if you don know more check out my video on hand eczema but um let me tell you uh it will it it causes stinging in my hands also on my legs especially the popl fossa the the back of the knees I get a little burning stinging a little definitely a bit of a tingle if not a full La wooo which you know it have to say if you are itchy one positive of that discomfort is it kind of It kind of silences the itch because it stinging discomfort and then it oh wow now I that say like if you example with at topic dermatitis eczema um and you struggle as is to grease them off cuz that managing eczema as consistent moisturizer but you got a little kid wiggling around who does not like moisturizers this you may run into problems they may start crying on you because it is not necessarily comfortable but all I have to say this performs well following day this is a testament to a good moisturizer the following day you rolly stuff like if you scratch your leg where you put it you film coming on up okay and the forearm especially has a nice youthful dewy bounce to it a firmness that was not there prior so it does really well and the moisturized skin that dewy bounce it does last throughout the next day and even into the following day cuz I did Skip to test out their 48h hour hydration claim and I have to say it actually does provide lasting hydration the skin is Supple bouncy glowy smooth doesn hours after applying now one thing I always complain about with these L Ro POS moisturizers is the freaking packaging is so insufferable that bottle is like what you and I haven but I I already know it I the the bottom third of moisturizer it ends up tunneling out to the sidewalls tunneling out and up and so you this fullon like doughnut of lotion down there that you cannot access with the pump and you guess it I hate this you have to take the pop off and bang it out into your hands do not like doing that I don find it annoying I find it messy and I find that you can amount of product you end up using a ton and you know you or you don annoying I prefer the gold Bon packaging let me tell you the Gold Bond moisturizers they are in the right packaging even the pump bottles are better than this because they at least don that roll the tube down when you get down to the drags and really syringe it on out so you don speaking of Ura yes 10 out of 10 goldbond moisturizers are amazing so long story short this is great be aware it does cause some burning and stinging on impaired skin such as areas where your eczema is flaring up or you know if you or something and you a nice healing uh moisture izer you might run into some unexpected discomfort with this one let me know if you you seem to recall when I brought it onto the scene in one of my Vlogs where I share um backstage if you will behind the scenes uh what I recall the first go around with this I I seem to recall some of your comments indicating that you also had found it to to burn and sting and I issue with Gold Bond I issue with other Ura moisturizers so it their Ura is is formulated in this I I would only assume anyway y the Fast Five um two lip care products a sunscreen a body cream and a cleansing balm not too bad for the shortest month of the year telling you I set of skin but the possibilities of trying testing are endless anyway y having a great beginning of March you had a fantastic February let me know in the comments what skincare products you have been loving and adoring but if you guys enjoyed this one give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe I bye [Music]	Success
Skincare & Hair Favorites We Need To Discuss | March 2025	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAmXcVA7Lwk	Dr Day	It Ain are March is over all right it went out like a lion lamb I don that with you guys buckle up buttercups cuz it don fingers I promise I can count most days five beauty products skincare products that I tried out throughout the month of March worth discussing now first off euin every body everybody first of all is getting hit left and right sideways you can seems without getting an ad for that userin radiant tone line which I reviewed earlier this month and we all know already the backstory of thodol okay I tone us existence back when it was just just a European uh slumber party we had a video on thodol from from me okay so so it products they have that strong fragrance the ingredient works but don the radiant tone 2% exfoliating ha complex Gel Cleanser because this is underrated fragrance-free so you getting slapped in the face with OD usin it has glycolic and lactic acid which can help soften and exfoliate rough and bumpy skin dry dull skin texture smooth the surface of the skin and if you have hyperpigmentation can help gently exfoliate to accelerate the clearance of some degree of hyperpigmentation depending on its background nature also also helpful for allowing for perhaps better penetration of ingredients that you put on after this is rinsed off now a lot of people are under the um impression that exfoliating acids are useless in a cleanser that just rinse down the drain and that is a myth there is something known as coacervation which is some sort of fancy chemistry wherein these active ingredients can get on your skin in a meaningful way remain there and not just be rinsed down the drain while the cleansing ingredients go to work to remove oily build up dirt Etc and then that is what is actually rinsed down the drain so it Walgreens has a glycolic acid cleanser but I want to say it comparison to this this was on Amazon but it has since sold out I don if they but you can get it at Ulta highly recommend it be really careful though using it around your eyes it might lead to dry eyelids delicate skin eyelids neck more vulnerable to overdoing it with chemical exfoliants including in a cleanser I mean that test showing that these work in my experience is that I often you know if I dry and it obviously it keep just be really careful when you use it that you washing your eyelids you make sure to rinse it off thoroughly and that you don behind on the eye area because for me personally a lot of times cleanser residue kind of gets trapped either in my eyebrows cuz they right clinging on for dear life to anything that comes in contact pollen especially it Landing Pad straight into my eye also you know the the hollows around your eyes they kind of they kind of sit as like a little crevice for for residues to to collect but otherwise provided you rinse it off well this is actually really good and with consistent use um Alpha hydroxy acids also help with moisture retention so highly highly recommend trying this out if you motivated or intrigued by Alpha hydroxy acid cleansers for their skin benefits for various issues which I just described yall know I had the opportunity of course every year I go to the a attend that to get CME credits and while I time okay I like to have a good time and if you right you might want to go to Disney World I don theme parks there I goes to bars so having theme parks is like wow something really entertaining to do so of course I went and if you been following me since the beginning of my channel the aad was in Orlando several years ago and I went to a Disney World then as well and I Disney adult or anything like that but I had a great time the sun in Florida is not out to play okay it it had long sleeves a hat highly recommend people were actively getting severely burned the day I was there it was pretty cool but the sun doesn aside from the Hat the long sleeves long pants I also brought with me a new discovery which I abib Airy fit sunstick this is a chemical sunscreen stick this curve but let me tell you it back and forth and back and forth under your eye on under your brow get your forehead get your sides of your face I mean reapplying with this has been a dream and it doesn the thing I always caution about with sticks is they are are prone to skip areas and under application so you need to do multiple passes over a given area they don don I remember when I was a teenager taking a trip with my school to uh a water park and one of my friends relied on a sunscreen stick and bless her pale skinned self because she had streaks of burnt red skin interspersed with uh porcelain white so it actually was a good sunscreen that she used it was just the application issue this particular sunscreen you do have to be careful do multiple passes but I love the overall shape of the applicator I think that is a a key feature of it that makes it um nice for application especially like on the jaw area it gets good coverage but it under the eyes and on the forehead easily it on and deposits on the skin really easily I find a lot of sunscreen sticks very stiff and they give you some resistance as you Glide them across the surface of the skin which again will lead to skipping and under application likely so I really like this easy to do multiple passes it reapply to my face um throughout the day while I was at the parks and my neck uh my hands were mostly covered with the sun protective little um hand covers on my UPF shirt but the other thing about this is that it well it so no white cast with it it is water resistant 80 minutes so it lot of boxes no nice CineMate for those of you who are sensitive I mean a bib is a brand that I have discovered a lot of loves still as a side note really really loving the rice barrier jelly mask highly recommend that glycerin sensation for barrier repair another great one that um I have been using and actually almost finished up I reviewed this earlier this month this is from Boma they sent this to me the phyto muin glow serum and I reviewed it for you guys so if you want a lot of details on this versus kerx snail muin versus another favorite the skin1004 pro bio seea ampul you need to watch the full video but I have continued using this and I finished with it and it objectively it snail amusin power Essence in my opinion but it significantly significantly better than that horrific Mixon Bean Essence which did not do anything and uh it some really good ingredients that I personally get along well with and and enjoy for example polyglutamic acid is both super hydrating but it also deposits this like lightweight thin film to help with moisture retention and to help with skin elasticity it has ceramides it has root extracts instead of snail mucin which give that slippery slimy texture that I personally really enjoy I mean a little bit left here I show you guys it stringy the stringy really love it and this has been look at that can is it picking up on camera the strings this has been a pleasure to use and it really hydrates pretty nicely um so I continued to use that and I about done so that three the next is okay um from Suave I have been working with them okay I going to do a sponsored post over on Instagram but I agreed to work with them after trying out this bonding infusion repairing line that they have which is products aim to help with people who have riddle damaged hair from heat styling color treatments this is the hair mask in the line I really like the line overall but the hair mask is like the one thing for sure to definitely try out because all of these products have citric acid plus amino acids which help to just sort of bring back together some of the bonds in the hair so that you get less breakage less brittleness but the citric acid also makes the formula ation um the pH lower and that has a smoothing effect for the strands so using products these bonding repair products can help if you do have a lot of breakage a lot of brittleness related to chemical processing or heat styling but it also can just help to make your hair a little glossier a little smoother the hair mask is a great way to introduce the ingredient and see how your hair interacts with it because it conditioning it thick after you rinse it out shampoo you only put it to like the mid part of my strands all the way down I don up in here cuz I have super fine hair if I use conditioning masks up here it like wo wo wo wo okay it really can weigh down my hair but um this really helps smooth down the hair cut down on frizz and just give you that glossy shiny bounce they are super affordable but with that bonding repair technology that everybody is seeking and you often encounter in like more expensive products like Olex for example this gets you those Salon quality results but at a fraction of the price now these products do have fragrance in them okay um it it like it smells like Sweet Tarts you know when you open up the little I don know if they make these anymore this is like a classic Halloween candy you know the little Sweet Tarts three pack that you wanted and be like the last candy well I love the smell when youd open it it up it child I exactly what this smells like it doesn Linger on your hair it overwhelming but it I actually really like the fragrance no methyl isolone in the shampoo for those of you who are allergic um and it super affordable so definitely check out the bonding infusion line especially if you have brittle hair I have really fine hair and it does you know especially you know it slacking on the hair trims once it gets as long as it is now the ends you know they can get a little rebellious and you know get a little more brittle so this has really helped and I really like it a lot so that was another one I wanted to mention and then last but not least let is one of the moisture sticks from Neutrogena so I discovered these I want to say 2 years ago it was an Impulse buy as lip products often are for me at Walmart and I absolutely adore the moisture stick I can color I got at the time um but when I went to the a uh Neutrogena had a booth and they often are giving away samples so they were giving away um a ton of their moisture smooth color sticks and the thing about Neutrogena you know it a skinc care brand great products right I been you know since I skincare but every time I try one of their makeup products I wow this is really really really good they like nice and soft and smooth the color lasts a really long time I raspberry Rose shade they do unfortunately have flavorant so if you for a fragrance-free lip gloss from Neutrogena with equally good color payout like with equally good pop of color that lasts is the Hydro Boost um lip glosses those are amazing these are really good too but they they really nice and I can the other Shades that I got so that the Fast Five for the month of March it flew by very very quickly great month and spring is on the way is it here already I check the calendar for when the first day of spring actually is but it is heating up

Discoloration Fighting Skincare WE NEED TO DISCUSS	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_1bs3lXzeE	Dr Day	May is here. It is clear that summer is just around the corner. I mean, this is the month where we kick off summer. And you know what that means? The first of the month. What do we do? What do we show up for? What do we put Junior in a timeout for? What do we send little Charlie out in the backyard to start digging weeds for? The fast five. Five skincare products that I testing out, putting through the ringer over the past month. down my final thoughts, consensus. And this month, you guys are in for a treat because it is all things discoloration, redness, dark spots, stuff intended to tackle that. Now, when it comes to well, summer skin discoloration, not destroying your skin barrier, all things skin health, you guys already know you need to be protecting your skin from the sun. So, this past month, I went back on a train that led me to a town of frustration, and that is the Melisil train. You recall back in July 2024, I told you guys all about Lar Ro Pose Mela B3 line, the sunscreen, the face wash, the serum, and after that video, I put Melisil the rest because my chief complaint was that the fragrance in those products was so headacheinducing. What the heck is Melisil? Melabether. Melisil is an ingredient that has been 18 years in the making owned by L ingredient that is thought to work by disrupting incorporation of precursors into melanin pigment ultimately helping to put the brakes on hyperpigmentation. So it looking to address dark spots, not redness, dark spots. When it comes to fading dark spots, you doing the sun protection, too. Otherwise, these ingredients not doing you any favors. And when it comes to addressing redness, you also need the sun protection. Plus, remember sunscreen is a moisturizer. Helps reduce water loss, limit skin irritation. But like I said, I was annoyed by the strong fragrance in the Melb3 line. Kind of was a little headache inducing. And fragrance for a lot of people ends up causing skin irritation. So I had to give KES a try. I bought this auto tone discoloration and UV solution SPF 30 with melisil and nioinamide, which together are great ingredients for dark spots. No fragrance in this whatsoever. And I I actually really like the way it looks on the skin. Why does that frustrate me? It interested in and it and I like the way it looks. Like what to complain about? I to complain about. This is like 54 55 bucks depending on what retailer you purchase it from, which I think is highway robbery for an SPF 30 non-wateristant daily facial moisturizer. Now I get it. Melisil, you know, it it coming of age, so to speak, to be included in products. All right? It is it is an adult in the skincare ingredient lifespan. It in the baby stages behind the bench all these years. Maybe it ingredient to formulate into products or whatever. I just think that this is cost prohibitive and we need more options with Melisel that don fragrance. The Lose Pose line, the Mela B3 line, not cheap either, and it it comes with that headache inducing fragrance. All I had to say, this looks great on the skin. It offers what I was looking for and it doesn fragrance, but that price point, get out of here. Get out of here, Kes. I don know what you know, you think now that you into we go into LaGuardia, Lagoria gotten a whole facelift, whole shopping section dedicated to KES, all bougie in there. And you think just cuz you you revived LaGuardia that you can be charging us $55 for an SPF 30. Get back to the bench. Figure out how to make that less expensive, please. All right. Those of you who have redness prone skin, especially with the summer months, the heat, the humidity, sometimes heavy moisturizers, they are just not your friend. They may precipitate more redness or maybe you issues going on contributing to the redness, contributing to irritation, contributing to discoloration, dark spots. What to do? Like I said, sunscreen, which you should be using every single day, is a moisturizer. Sometimes people need a little burst of hydration, soothing properties. So, I got to give a shout out to this. Kind of at the halfway point here. The packaging reminds me actually of amoxicylon. Who else sees amoxicylon when you see this maybe from a distance overlay a pink falter on it, you getting out of school? So, this is from the brand Celax. First Cellax product I wanted to try it out because I like milky toners, but a lot of them are misses for me. They don out. I really like that this is a simple formula. It has camides and it really nice non oily emulsion. Feels like a soothing, hydrating, thin filmed lotion. Doesn It Plus, it has this peptide which probably is improving water retention in the skin. The peptide is called aquatide or aqua aquatid. And this peptide allegedly is going to help uh stimulate autophagy pathways in which cells basically eat damaged organels, eat themselves. Sort of like a recycling repair pathway. That of autophagy. It gets kicked off in a variety of settings, but allegedly this peptide kind of, you know, is is sort of guiding your skin to do to do that to do that to repair perhaps from oxidative stress from environmental aggressors. Whether or not it actually does that, I already know that peptides do help improve water content in the skin. This peptide has been shown to reduce transepidermal water loss, improve the water content, and help with skin hydration. Great. Really have liked this as the first step. I lot in the morning, like especially if I don want a little bit of a little bit of something there. Um, I don use a moisturizer first thing in the morning, I kind of prep my skin. If you use a serum on over it, it option as well. Speaking of serum, um, those of you with redness and and or discoloration, Peach Slices Super Fade. I reviewed this for you guys, but if you missed the review, because I lot of comments in my blogs where I using this and and you guys are like, whoa, what is that? So, this has licorice root, of course, good for redness as well as the moisture barrier, soothing the skin, and good for discoloration. It also has kic acid in it, though, an underrated dark spot corrector that chilates copper, which is necessary for the enzyme tyrosinase, which is responsible for making that melanin pigment. Kic acid is great. And it also has settle trenexamate uh mezylate which is a form of tranexeamic acid. Now trrenexemic acid applied to the skin. There behind it but what we do know is that a it appears to improve the moisture barrier. So it may help reduce irritation that otherwise exacerbates both redness and discoloration. And it has actually been shown clinically to help quite a bit with post-inflammatory arythemma and facial redness associated with rosacea. Plus this has 4.5% nioinamide good for both redness and hyperpigmentation. Hyperpigmentation specifically, it has a unique mechanism in that it disrupts the transfer of pigment from the pigment producing cells and melanocytes to the surrounding skin. So you being addressed in terms of hyperpigmentation in this one lightweight, hydrating, fragrance-free, affordable serum. I mean, what love? It compounds from Sentella botanic extracts, which are soothing and anti-inflammatory. This is like under like around 11 bucks, which I think is a great price, especially these days, cuz I mentioned this in a vlog recently. I for skincare, like the drugstore brands, the going rate is like 14 to 22, $25 these days, which back in 2016, $25 was like, are you kidding me for a drugstore product? But now it these fast fives have been singing the praises of some stuff from a bib. A bib has yet to disappoint me. My gateway into a bib was actually a sheet mask of all things. Something I don use. During the lockdown, I discovered an AIB sheet mask. I was like, Um, this is a sheet mask that actually has been impressive. Didn repurchase it or anything like that. Then I encountered their barrier jelly, which I will not shut up about. The barrier jelly. It protectant. glycerin, great for sensitive cheeks. Then last month, I discovered and I sunst stick. Yeah, me a sunscreen stick. But this one, this one outperforms many other sunscreen sticks because of the shape, the ease of application. I mean, I talk about all the excellent features about it. So, um, I saw this, the glutathione dark spot serum, and I you know, as somebody who my eyes peeled for what with the dark spot correctors, cuz when it comes to skincare ingredients, fading dark spots, you ingredients that can be particularly helpful. So, this one was interesting. I drawn to it is not just, oh, a bib, oh, dark spot serum, but honestly, these little spheres. You can already see, look how much I Um, it are loaded with antioxidants which can help defend against oxidative stress that contributes to redness and discoloration. What are the antioxidants? Well, nioinamide good for dark spots, redness, also has glutathione, an antioxidant, and ascorbic acid, that personality disorder of a skinare ingredient that stable, has issues penetrating, formulation, formulation, formulation. I don is formulated to meaningfully enter the skin, but it does have the unique sphere thing to deliver which perhaps contributes to overall stability. I don of papers on that kind of thing, but it does have furulic acid, another antioxidant, which has been shown to be helpful for ascorbic acid stability. So, you have that in there. And one of the things that I hate about ascorbic acid as a antioxidant in topicals is that it oxidizes and I find it irritating and stains the skin. I have not experienced that with this whatsoever. And it I bought this not even realizing it had ascorbic acid in it. I bought it because I was drawn to all the things that I mentioned. Plus, it glutathione, an antioxidant I really like. Let does have ascorbic acid in there. I not getting that oxidation, that orange discoloration that can happen. It doesn water. It does have some other forms of vitamin C which are stable and may get into the skin, but whether or not they do what you C from ascorbic acid remains to really be addressed. Long story short, I have simply adored using this. It hydrating. It great to use in the morning because put it on, it absorbs down in the skin, dries down, it doesn filminess to it, and then sunscreen layers on over this perfectly. So that pairing together, you know, the the antioxidants plus the UV protection, it environmental aggressors, ultraviolet radiation, pollution, all that stuff that will exacerbate dark spots and redness. And with the summer coming up, I mean, maybe you already. You be spending more time outside, whether it be going to the beach, the park, whatever. Summer is a time people like to be outside. This is a great summer hydrator with some antioxidant defense on there. All right, last but not least, when it comes to dark spots, redness, sensitive skin here, we people who have sensitivity, like a lot of the jazzy ingredients that can help, the cosmetic ingredients that can help with discoloration, maybe they burn, they sting, they end up irritating your skin, and irritation ultimately can worsen both redness and hyperpigmentation. You I do? What do I do? Why? Well, I don want to try every single thing out there only to only to get burned. So, I talked about this ingredient a lot. I have a lot of videos about it. It prescription ingredient, and at prescription strengths, it can be particularly helpful. It treat at a prescription strength to treat rosacea, acne, melasma, but it generally well tolerated, can be a little drying, but it has other benefits. It very, very mildly exfoliates the skin to help remove buildup, and it also is anti-inflammatory. It helps combat both hyperpigmentation and redness. But like I said, it those who have sensitive skin. The epitome of sensitive skin is going to be rosacea. And it Stuff that you buy without a prescription. That formulations. Not the same strength, but can still be helpful. Still be helpful. You know, I wouldn necessarily to treat any skin condition. That can have a supporting role in your skincare needs when it comes to discoloration. That is azelleic acid. I have recommended numerous azelleic acid products over the years. I a ton. Some of my favorites are the Polish choice azelleic acid booster that has licorice root and salicylic acid. So that prone skin that heals with a dark mark. Also, The Ordinary has an azelleic acid suspension. They were one of the first brands actually that I ever encountered doing azelleic acid in the US market. I don first, but they were the first brand that I ever encountered doing acid. So much so that I was like, is this even legit? There options out there. in the Korean skincare game. They are not sleeping. Not only are they not sleeping, but they they do not get drowsy. They don loopy. All right? They don at the bench. So, APLB is a brand, a Korean brand sunscreen and body wash I have raved about with glutathione. Speaking of glutathione, talked about these products in various other fast five. saw they had azelleic acid uh a cream with azelleic acid and I had to try it because a lot of people who deal with redness and dark spots they an underlying barrier issue going on. They to go about incorporating azelleic acid with your moisturizer. Why not just use a moisturizer with azelleic acid that might serve your needs depending on what your needs are and your whole skincare routine. So APLB facial cream. This is a really nice azelleic acid formula. Very hydrating, very soothing. It has rice extract, which I love. Very soothing and supportive. Sacroyces ferment laden with hydrating compounds, soothing anti-inflammatory properties. A fragrance-free, non-greasy cream. Um, works well as a nighttime facial moisturizer. Try this during the day as well because aselic acid is one of those ingredients that you can use multiple times a day. Um, you can technically use it like three times a day if you tolerate doing that and have the time and bandwidth to do that. Although most people it asking a lot. So um I tried it a couple of times in the morning just to see how it performed under sunscreen. No problem. Didn with alcohol- based sunscreens which often times don creams. Not at all. So this is nice and it thicker than some of these hydrating toners and serums. So I thought they did a really good good job with this and I thing about azelleic acid too that bears mention is it may be particularly beneficial and maybe even why honestly it works for rosacea because it some antimicrobial properties. And whether it be that or its exfoliating effects, it helps perhaps to cut down on those little demadeex mites which play a role in rosacea and little red bumps. Demadeex are are are pesky. So this, you know, can be helpful in that regard. All right, y flew by. Lots lots of stuff coming at you guys. Um, and I got this face. I only have one face, but we put it to the test here. We put it to the test and we try stuff out and report back. Let me know in the comments though. Have you guys tried any of these things? What was your experience? Share in the comments cuz that makes a big difference. You know, I am just one experience opinion. And yes, I can speak to the ingredients, what they do, who might benefit from them, but your testimonies are also super helpful to this community because it gives some people, you know, more information, you know, as far as consumer experience. Anyway, y on the ends, I my recent video comparing the K with melisil to Lar Rose Pose with mel. So, check that out if you missed it. Um, but if you guys enjoyed this one, give it a thumbs up, share it with your friends, and as always, don forget sunscreen and subscribe. I talk to you guys tomorrow. Bye. [Music]	Success
The Skincare Products I'm Loving & Regretting: May 2025 Edition	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjkwQhk-xog	Dr Day	Well, it Charlie is out of school for summer. He Take a deep breath because guess what time it is? It Five skincare products I put through the test throughout the month of May. What I loved and what I absolutely regret even venturing into and you should avoid. In no particular order, number one, I decided to buy several Olay skincare products. Why do they seem to have a shrine to Olay in every retailer? They prices are ridiculous. We get it. We get it. You know how to put a B vitamin into a cream and get it into the skin. Applause. Applause. I also saw that they have this slugging mask. Now, slugging was a trending topic on Tik Tok for some time and it area in the skin talk space. trends and popularity on Tik Tok is really what unfortunately is shaping a lot of where skin care goes these days. Let get the slugging word on our package. So when people are searching slugging, this is going to pop up. That that goes. They because the practice of slugging involves putting a thick balm ointment, namely petroleum jelly, straight up Vaseline. as a last step in your nighttime skincare routine. Works out really well for many people for improving dryness. Just allowing you to wake up with fresh, dewy, moisturized, soothed skin. However, for some people, it skin. It evaporation of sweat, get a little overheated. And if you live in a hot tropical humid climate, you may find that the slugging game leads to little heat rash like eruptions. When I think of slugging, I think of an ointment, right? Like petroleum jelly, Aquafor Caravee healing ointment. This is a thick rich cream. What should come as no surprise cuz they going to put it in there. You know, Carave is going to put camides and they will be putting nycinomide. That is that is their thing. Nioinomide, which I love. Great ingredient for redness, hyperpigmentation, the moisture barrier, anti-aging. But some of you are sensitive to it. And I you don you you butter, great olusive prolotum, hence the whole slugging nomenclature because prolotum is what kicked off the slugging naming. Last step of your nighttime skincare routine. Petroleum jelly all over the face. While I would consider this a thick, rich, olusive night cream, it into the slugging category. It like a heavyhanded prolotum ointment. It Honestly, I was blown away by Olay generosity here because you want to know how much I paid for this? You want to know how much I paid for this? $9.99. And I Walmart it know, Walmart with Amazon. But um I, you know, being a Prime member, I was like, in. the filming of this video, Amazon is like, we\\ that price point, I was like, why why would anyone buy the majority of Olay moisturizers, which often are like $34 and above, when you could just get this one, which has the same type of ingredients, and it cream. And so, I was like, great. I I honestly I okay? I test. It the job of a heavy duty night cream. You wake up the following morning, and your skin is moisturized. Doesn sting. For me, not a whole lot to say about its performance. It slugging level though. It slugging level as far as that heavy occlusion. This is more a thick cream. Was able to use it around my eyes as an eye cream. As a side note, worked well. Now that we went over that, I need to update you guys on this skin to mint twoin-one shave oil plus moisturizer coconut bliss scent. So, I adore shave oils. They product for reducing shave irritation, nicks, getting a smoother shave. I love the pump packaging on them. I love the way that they stay on the skin throughout the shaving process and then rinse off easily. And I find them to be very moisturizing, less messy in the shower. That Hut is at the top as far as ranking for shave oils. They of shave oils. They have a couple of different scents that smell really nice. What I particularly like about the Tree Hut ones is that they perform amazingly of course, but the scent is more an in shower experience, not a deposit on the skin and actively scent you experience. The skin one I was really excited about. I do not like the scent. It strong and that don very strong and it does scent your skin. It lingers too after you shower. So, I don feel like it is a little bit thinner and a little bit more unwieldy compared to the Tree Hut one. So, in other words, this works. It does what it to do, but I have not loved it as much as the Tree Hut shave oils. Those are the best. Speaking of Tree Hut, I want to make sure everyone has swallowed their beverage. Don take a sip. I don choke. Look out the window. Make sure Charlie is out of the pool. Okay? If you him, make sure he this this right here is going to suck you in. You tried a triette sugar scrub. I know. Shocker. Who is she? Well, honestly, Amazon sent me a little PR package which included this. So, it was gifted to me and I always talk about these in my shopping videos. They And I was like, you know what? I to actually test this out. This is the Jelly Bear scent. I have to say, these do leave the skin baby soft. I lying to you if I said I did not find that this really delivered great results. I especially have liked using it around my ankles where I tend to get buildup of dry skin just like from running, working out, the friction of socks and shoes, I tend to get dark discoloration on my ankles. Really liked it there and I on my upper arm. I think that if you have rough and bumpy skin, keratossis pilaris, these sugar scrubs probably yield some temporary cuz with KP there no cure, okay? some temporary but market improvement in the look and feel of the keratossis pyloris. Before I was a dermatologist, before I was on YouTube, I used to make my own little sugar scrub. I just go in the kitchen, take a bunch of sugar in a bowl. Like I I remember doing this in middle school. Take a bunch of sugar, put it in a bowl, and pour like canola oil or Crisco or something and make a sugar scrub for my hands. And I just thought I was so cool back then having discovered this. And it does leave your skin really soft, really smooth. So, I get the popularity of these. Plus, they have a variety of moisturizing oils, imollian that soften the skin as well. Now, you can overdo it with these scrubs and cause a lot of dryness and irritation. So, it delicate balance, but I think for the purposes of improving the appearance, texture, and feel of rough and textured skin, bumpy skin. I can see the appeal here. When you use these, if you going to go down the path, make sure that you use them in the shower after you skin has gotten wet because the mechanical exfoliation of the sugar scrub will go a lot more efficiently effectively if the top stratum corneium is nice and hydrated with the water in the shower. Here is the pitfall with these. Um, the fragrance is in the room. It is really what the name of the game is here. Mind you, I do like this scent. It got a little citrus, a little berry. It scent. And it actively scents your skin. You get out of the shower and you smell like they call it jelly bear, which my brain is getting all confused with because I think jelly bean or gummy bear. While jelly bear, it much for my brain to process. It of a citrusy berry scent with a little bit of apple overtones. I way it smells, but it get out of the shower, you rinse your skin, you still smell like the scrub. You put your pajamas on. You unwind for the night. Then you get in the bed and guess what? You like a gummy bear. You get in the bed. If there they too. And you roll over and you asleep, you gummy bear. It scents the skin. Just like the skin shave oil scents the skin, so does it. This past month has been a lot of fragrance for me, more so than I ever use on a regular basis. I don know how people are going to bed with all of this perfume on because it kind of gets to a point where it almost arouses you and prevents good sleep. You fall asleep and you bit and maybe kind of move your head a bit and all of a sudden you catch a whiff and you\\ that that Like it it actively scenting your skin. Sulfur is a great ingredient for a variety of skin conditions. It for acne. It great for perorificial dermatitis. It can help cut down on the burden of demadeex. It dermatitis. So, a lot of facial concerns. Sulfur can help. Sulfur is safe to use in pregnancy. It well tolerated, although it can be drying. And the thing most people do not care for when it comes to using sulfur is the way that it smells. And my go-to recommended triedand-true product for utilizing sulfur is the de la Cruz sulfur mask. Very inexpensive, fragrance-free. Sulfur can be a little bit drying, but otherwise very well tolerated aside from the smell issue. And a lot of people are love that, myself included. Like that is my go-to recommendation. But many people are like, I like it, but I don smell like sulfur. So, I decided to try Kate Somerville cleanser with 3% sulfur. And this is interesting. It that generates a pretty rich lather. You could use it as a mask. You do want to rinse it off. It does have fragrance. The reason I tried the cleanser is because I was thinking, well, maybe this will not leave the skin smelling like sulfur. And it does not. It does not leave your skin smelling like sulfur. It does smell a bit like sulfur when you using it, but it doesn the skin smelling that way. It has a lavender scent to it. Not strong, not headacheinducing. The lavender does not remain on your skin. Now, a word about this. It wash. Don because eyelid skin is very delicate and this could be too drying. So, this was okay. I had no issue with it except after a while, I started to notice that around my mouth in particular, I was getting a lot of dryness and redness. So, I backed off on using it. Otherwise, it to use sulfur in my routine on a regular basis, I would just do the de la Cruz one because it than Eradicate. But I don anything bad to say about eradicate provided you fragrance. And it smell so strong of the sulfur. This this was a month where my nose was really put to the test. Aside from that thing, everything here has had fragrance, including this. This was a flop. So, this is the Wella hair brand. I don know why something in my brain wants to call this Walla. I get this confused with Wleta. Wleta, Wolita, whatever. And this is Wella. So, this is a hair care brand. I have heard all of these great things about, okay, so much hype around this hair care brand, their hair oil. I have been like, I don don Smooth line was not for me. I on the shampoo and the hair oil in a future video perhaps. But let me just say you guys, if you were thinking about buying the step 2 intense mask, don it. Don mask I have ever used. It is so useless. It does not condition the hair like a hair mask should. It does not leave the hair with improved manageability. It doesn hair look dry. I have wavy hair after using this. It ball down there. You know what I mean? It as a hair mask. Very very strong fragrance. This is basically a strong perfume cosplaying as a conditioning hair mask. And it does not it intense at all. It of its performance. It is so weak. It on par with hotel room conditioner. And we all know how lame hotel hair care products are. This is the worst of the Well stuff. I would not I would not repurchase it. You know, a hair mask for me really coats each individual strand a lot more efficiently in more totality in comparison to a conditioner. They tend to be a bit thicker. Some people say there conditioner and hair mask. It they believe that as well. But I have found that certain products marketed as hair masks tend to be a bit more all-encompassing. They the ointment of hair conditioning, but this is just not that. As a matter of fact, like you know the V5 conditioners pretty good, right? Those V5 conditioners, they perform much better than this V5 hair care. Um, you know, the the cheap the most inexpensive drugstore conditioner out there is going to beat this for me at least as far as performance. Awful, awful, awful, awful, awful. And very, very strong scent. I mean, this is strong. It lingers. It doesn annoying. It scent. Gives me a headache. That a me issue, but I imagine a lot of you out there will not like that. All right, those are the five things I wanted to yap about today. If you were eyeing any of these things, hopefully this video saves you. My wish is for Tree Hut. And I I to. Tree Hut. I know this is just like probably asking way too much cuz let face it, people buy Tree Hut stuff for the scents, the cute packaging, but if they could just come out with one line that encompasses all of their products that is fragrance-free, a fragrance-free sugar scrub, a fragrance-free shave oil, a fragrance-free body wash, a fragrance-free hand wash, a fragrance-free cream in the top, just make the label pretty. Give it a good ingredient like oat. And those of us who don We will buy because TreeHut, they really do a good job with a lot of their products. Everything I Tree Hut, I\\ really good. Can I get this in a fragrance-free version? want to smell like a gummy bear or jelly bear or whatever you what however you rebranding candy. I don like that when I give me a fragrance-free option for the fragrance allergic out there or the fragrance annoyed or the fragrance irritated, whichever bucket you find yourself in. We want a frag I want, I should say. I don you all. You need that. We didn we are. I I would like a fragrance-free sugar scrub. Yes, I would. I think it be great for people who have keratossis pilaris. Um, and I think they would like it. There are other brands out there who do body scrubs for KP. Anyway, y me know in the comments. Have you guys tried any of these? Like the Wella hair care. Is that something that has worked out really well for you? And I you know, it Very well could be the case. Could be the case with any of these. All right, y put one of my recent reviews. So, you can watch that one next if it looks interesting to you. But if you like this video, give it a thumbs up, share it with your friends, and as always, don forget sunscreen and subscribe. I talk to you guys tomorrow. Bye. [Music]	Success
17 SKIN CANCER RISKS YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ?? DERMATOLOGIST @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQUCJQWmnIk	Dr Day	well hey guys it skin cancer awareness month in this video we factors for skin cancer if you are new here welcome my name is andrea i board certified dermatologist i post a lot of skincare content here on youtube if that is of interest to you consider subscribing or follow me over on instagram or tick tock i post on those platforms a lot as well there are many types of skin cancers melanoma which is deadly squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma anyone can develop a skin cancer even if you have a deep skin tone and you never burn you can get a skin cancer but in this video we talk about things that put you at increased risk for making skin cancers number one is indoor tanning going in a tanning booth or tanning bed increases your risk of developing skin cancer including the deadly melanoma if you go in a tanning bed before the age of 35 it can increase your risk for getting melanoma 75 going in the tanning bed just once can also increase your risk for basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma tanning beds are so dangerous because they deliver a very high and strong dose of uva rays uva rays are part of the radiation that comes from the sun penetrates the skin really deeply destroys collagen suppresses the immune system the tanning response is kind of like a ouch to that and that is why your skin turns brown tanning beds put you at elevated risk for all sorts of skin cancer as well as skin aging so never ever ever get in a tanning bed they are carcinogens and anyone under the age of 18 should not be allowed access to a tanning bed in fact many states regulate this and in some countries around the world tanning beds are illegal number two is a sunburn a sunburn is an inflammatory response to a lot of skin damage caused by ultraviolet radiation from the sun and immediately of course it skin is permanent skin damage that cannot be repaired or reversed as part of that skin damage you have changes in the dna in your skin cells having just five sunburns in your lifetime doubles your risk of melanoma having one sunburn in early childhood that blisters doubles your risk of melanoma the more times you get a sunburn the greater your risk of skin cancer is because it is cumulative damage that cannot be repaired or reversed so if you are a parent or caregiver of young children do everything possible to protect them from getting a sunburn it will pay off dividends in their older adulthood because they won of severe sun damage that elevates their risk of skin cancer not to mention it will minimize the burden of changes that lead to premature skin aging number three is having pale skin and light hair now any skin tone can develop skin cancer but if you have pale skin as well as either blonde hair or especially red hair that puts you at a gre in a greater risk category because the pigment in your skin is such that it doesn extent of protection you are more vulnerable to sunburns these skin types are more likely to burn when they don protect their skin from the sun oftentimes these individuals have a lot of freckles which themselves are not a risk for skin cancer but they a clue like this is a person that is going to be more vulnerable to sun damage the kind of sun damage that leads to skin cancers later on in life another group of people who have pale skin are people who have a condition albinism this is a genetic disease where the skin cells that make pigment don any pigment and these individuals are at extreme risk for skin cancers because they don that protective pigment at all number four is having a lot of common moles now common moles are very common but having more than 50 does ever so slightly increase your risk of melanoma they themselves rarely rarely really ever turn into a skin cancer but people who have more than 50 of them it kind of another one of those clues that this is a skin type that is going to respond to sun damage in such a way that maybe they develop a skin cancer so that is another risk factor common moles are symmetric smooth brown they may be a little bit elevated and they tend to be uniform in appearance they head of an eraser so they those are common moles but then there are atypical moles otherwise known as dysplastic nevi these are much larger and they themselves rarely turn into a skin cancer although they can but having a lot of these also puts you at increased risk for melanoma having more than five atypical nevi is a risk factor for melanoma and some people have a lot of atypical nevi for those folks it is recommended especially if there of skin cancer that they see a dermatologist for regular skin checks people with 10 or more dysplastic nevi have 12 times the melanoma rest does plastic nevi not only are larger in shape they can have a few different colors it appearance they typical mole number six is another type of mole it congenital meaning you are born with this type of mole people who have congenital nevi can develop melanoma within them and the risk is anywhere from zero to five percent depending on the size of the congenital nevis again these are present at birth now if you have a congenital nevis that is the size of the palm of your hand or smaller very very very low risk however there are some types of congenital nevi that are large enough to cover big portions of your back and the buttocks those are called bathing bathing trunk nevi those carry a much greater risk of developing melanoma those individuals have to undergo more frequent skin checks number seven is being older it are on this planet the greater your risk of skin cancer developing the reason for that is skin cancer likely represents cumulative burden of sun damage so the longer you more ultraviolet radiation that your body has seen more likely skin cancer is going to appear and as we get older our immune system is not as robust and the immune system is really important for removing damaged skin cells therefore your risk goes up you know as a side note a lot of people like to interject their personal arguments whenever i caution about getting too much sun exposure and i advocate for protecting your skin from the damaging effects of sun along with the recommendations of the american board of dermatology the american cancer society and pretty much any medical body out there people always say well our ancestors they didn cancers they did get these skin cancers but you have to remember our ancestors did not live long enough to really get as many skin cancers the life expectancy has gone up tremendously and with that comes more skin cancers more time for uv damage to accumulate to lead to cancer number eight is being male men have a much greater risk of basal cell carcinoma and squamous carcinoma we don speculate it may be due to more sun exposure throughout one perhaps occupationally i also think that women are more inclined at least historically to wear either sunscreen and or makeup and some makeup offers low amounts of sunscreen so that might actually you know help explain some of the discrepancy number nine is having a history of skin cancer once you make one skin cancer you more of them it your skin has seen a lot of sun experienced a lot of sun damage or there are factors in your background medical history your immune system for example that put you at risk and once you make one we know you and so once you make a skin cancer and you have it treated well then you likely going to be paying more visits to the dermatologist for skin checks to survey for when that next one is going to appear having one basal cell carcinoma means you are very likely to make another basal cell carcinoma having a basal cell carcinoma also makes it more likely that you go on to make a melanoma number 10 is your family history if you have a family history of melanoma it can increase your risk of developing a melanoma specifically if a first degree relative has a history of melanoma by first degree relatives we talking about people who are related to you by blood who are either your mother your father your brother your sister or your children 10 of people with melanoma have a family history of melanoma and it may be due to shared lifestyle factors shared exposures or it may have to do with genetics number 11 is a weak immune system uh having an impaired immune system means that your body can damaged skin cells and repair damage to the dna in your skin cells and you more likely to form skin cancers people who have an impaired immune system due to underlying medical conditions or medications that they take may put them at greater risk for skin cancers people who have organ transplants they have to go on medications that immune system so as to not reject the transplanted organ they are at much greater risk for skin cancers some people with hiv which can go on to lead to immunosuppression they also may be at increased risk for certain types of skin cancer number 12 is a long-term or severe skin injury like a scar from a thermal burn or in some cases you can have a chronic bone infection that makes its way to the overlying skin both of those chronic injuries can put you at slightly increased risk for certain types of skin cancer it small increase but for those people it is worthwhile surveying at least the affected area whether it be the scar or the area of the bone infection is to make sure that they number 13 is if you have ever had something called puva puva stands for sorelyn and uva it is a type of treatment that we use in dermatology for a variety of skin conditions most commonly psoriasis as well as vitiligo it does carry a slightly increased risk of skin cancer because it uses a very controlled dose of uva rays that again damage your skin put you at risk but like i said that type of treatment it less commonly used these days we have better forms of phototherapy and then we have better medications for treating those diseases number 14 are certain rare genetic conditions one is called zeroderma pigmentosa and it is a condition in which your body does not heal dna damage and therefore you make skin cancers very young like in childhood and as an adolescent so very young the other one that comes to mind is something called basal cell nevis syndrome otherwise known as gorelin syndrome this is a genetic condition in which you make a ton of basal cell skin cancers number 15 is infection with certain types of hpv human papilloma virus human papilloma virus is a family of viruses and hpv viruses can cause common warts that happen like on your hands and your feet that are not associated with skin cancer or any type of cancer so if you have a wart on your hands and feet yes that due to an hpv virus but no it going to put you at risk for skin cancer but some types of hpv do increase your risk for skin cancer namely those that infect around the nails and those that infect the skin around the genitalia and around the anus can put you at risk for squamous cell carcinoma in those areas smoking if you smoke cigarettes at least that will increase your risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the lips now you may be wondering what about other things that are smoked i can only tell you that we terms of the risk with tobacco smoke it out risks with these other things that people smoke but you might postulate that the risk is there as well because you are exposing the skin to heat and potentially noxious chemicals compounds that condense on the skin and lead to skin damage and then finally exposure to certain toxic chemicals people who are exposed to arsenic do have a increased risk of skin cancer arsenic it may be a contaminant in well water so for those of you out there if you these risk factors it examine your skin and do skin checks i going to be doing a video if it already on how to check your skin for potentially skin cancer and uh you know what things to look out for so stay tuned for that video if it not up already but uh yeah i want to also emphasize to you guys that just because you don have any of these risk factors it doesn skin cancer they and the longer you are around on this planet the more likely it is that you will develop one so knowing your risk factors definitely helps in you know paying careful attention early on but anyone can develop one so don you are out of the woods anyways y informative if you liked it give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don subscribe i bye [Music] you	Success
Melanoma skin cancer: Q&A with dermatologist Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKFv1bg2hu0	Dr Day	well hey guys happy Friday for the Q&A today I melanoma this was highly requested after my basal cell carcinoma video so check that video out if you want more information on really the products some of the most important stuff you should know about your skin far more important than any product or video I could ever give you guys but anyways melanoma what is it is a deadly skin cancer that occurs in cells in the skin called melanocytes melanocytes are the cells in our skin that make pigment that make color in the skin and they can acquire mutations throughout our lifetime that result in uncontrolled growth and subsequent formation of this cancer called melanoma and it is not as common as other types of skin cancer like basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma but it is fairly common and it cases is actually increasing from years prior it can occur at any age in adulthood it children although it can occur in children as well but importantly people can die from melanoma it is a skin cancer that unlike basal cell carcinoma for example which tends to stay in the skin melanoma can spread outside of the skin and metastasize throughout the body and is a very deadly disease if particularly if it I in the US alone in 2019 it that we four hundred and eighty new cases of melanoma in the US alone also 7230 people will die of melanoma in the year 2019 in the United States risk factors for getting a melanoma are your age melanoma is more common in people over the age of 65 if you in the past your chances of having another melanoma are greater so having a prior melanoma puts you at an increased risk for getting another one also if you basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma that too is a risk factor for melanoma if you have a lot of moles for reasons we don seems to be a risk factor for melanoma as well and if you have multiple moles that are what what are deemed a typical atypical mole anesthetic Niva is their is their medical name if you have more than five of those that is a risk factor if you have a strong family history of melanoma you melanoma is more common in people with really fair skin that burns easily while melanoma is more common and in Caucasian skin types it can and does occur in darker skin types melanoma is more common in men than women however melanoma is diagnosed before the age of 50 are actually more common in women than men melanoma is 20 times more common in whites than it is in blocks but it can occur in both in blacks as well the lifetime risk of getting a melanoma is 2.6 percent for whites for Caucasian people that means that one in 38 Caucasian persons will develop a melanoma it thousand black people will develop melanoma and it one in 167 Hispanics will develop melanoma while there are a lot of different risk factors for melanoma we don factors come together to put you at risk having a lot of moles for example is a risk factor for melanoma but moles don always turn into melanoma and not all melanomas come from moles so how that how that you are tied together we really not entirely clear but we do know that melanoma is mutations in the DNA of the melanocytes and those are mutations that largely are acquired through your lifetime they acquired from exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun or from a tanning bed using a tanning bed is a risk factor for melanoma it significantly increases your risk for melanoma and the most common mutation - that you can acquire that isn something called a b-raf mutation b-raf is what is called an oncogene waltrip islet radiation seems to play a role in many types of melanomas it seems to have no role in other types of melanomas because you can get melanoma on body sites that are rarely ever exposed to the Sun like the soles of the feet for example and less commonly you can have an inherited gene mutation that puts you at risk for melanoma so melanoma can arise on totally normal appearing skin but it also can occur within a skin lesion it can arise within a completely normal looking mole that benign melania CITIC nevis or it can occur within a funny-looking mole which is called an atypical malign acidic nevis or a dysplastic nevus these are an eve I that are large and they just look a little funny and remember what I said as a risk factor for melanoma is if you have five or more on these atypical funny-looking moles then there atypical looking solar linty Co which is a sunspot that you can get on Sun exposed areas tends to appear in older adults and a really funny looking sunspot is sometimes melanoma can arise in those then a large size congenital nevus melanoma can sometimes arise and those as well melanoma can occur anywhere on the body it doesn sites it can also occur in your mouth in your genitals and the vaginal area I can occur in your eyes your nose and your nail beds in the first sign is usually all looking freckle or mole that looks different has a variety of different colors to it or sometimes it can just be a bump that has no color that an a melon otic melanoma or melanoma that has no color to it there can be some areas within the spot that look like a scar so you can see it can take on a few different forms some melanomas start out at squat because the melanoma cells the tumor cells grow out into the skin before they grow down whereas other melanoma types grow down very quickly and they present more as a raised bump the things that you should look for though in terms of checking your skin are a variety of features that fall under the mnemonic ABCDE a stands for asymmetry any new or changing lesion that is asymmetric is suspicious meaning if you draw a line through it it will look different on either side the second B is for borders irregular borders is another suspicious feature color variation is C so a lot of different colors within the the lesion black blue brown tan white all within one lesion that is suspicious and then the size diameter that greater than six millimeters is suspicious and then the e stands for a ball thing which really just means this is changing it looks different than it did a few months ago different in a weird way or you know it becoming itchy or tender it into something else so that those are things that you should be aware of when you skin checking your own skin is really an important part of surveying for suspicious lesions particularly if you have some of the risk factors that I mentioned such as a strong family his or multiple atypical knee by doing self skin exams is a it in identifying melanomas that important because if caught early they can be treated and cured whereas if they are left undiagnosed the likelihood of them growing deeper and causing metastatic disease is greater so there are a lot of different subtypes of melanoma and they things like where they they look like some of the mutations that they contain and how how they how they are thought to then go on to evolve the first type is called superficial spreading melanoma this is a flat irregular looking lesion that most often occurs in areas of intense intermittent sun exposure for example very common in men on the trunk on the chest and on the back so you know men don their whole lives with their shirts off but they do spend intermittent periods of time in the Sun wear their shirts off so that is where they occur and in women it so that sun exposure you wear shorts sometimes during the year not all year and you know you get more UV exposure on the legs intermittently throughout the year they existing mole so these are more likely to come up in a mold another wise normal-appearing mole and it that ultraviolet radiation exposure in those areas suppresses some of the immune system ability to clear out the abnormal melanocytes the second type of melanoma that I malignant this is a melanoma that occurs exclusively in Sun damaged skin it more common in older adults and it going to be more at most comment on the head and neck area because those are the sites of more continuous sun exposure and the risk is most closely tied to the degree of sun damage that you have and it who have side their life working outdoors so outdoor workers this type of skin cancer is more common in women the third type of melanoma is one that is less common it called a crowell indigenous melanoma it melanoma that occurs on the palms of the hands and the soles as well as in the nail beds this is the one of the least common types of melanoma both in whites and in blacks it is pretty uncommon but of the melanomas that black people get this is the most common wand and the most likely one a person of color is to get and it has nothing to do with ultraviolet radiation and it can appear as a black spot on your palm or sole that appear in the nail beds as starting out as a streak but turn into a thicker dark discoloration a bump in the nail yeah thanks in the nail definitely bring it to the attention of your dermatologist we a lot of people don spend a lot of time and training and we have a lot of knowledge base on the treatment of the nail I mean that is our territory treatment of the nail on the nail bed there are a lot of tumors besides melanoma that occur in the nail there you know you know warts and a variety of other things there so pay attention to your nails if something funny comes up bring it to their attention and you know it could be a melanoma very rare of cases then the last type that I nodular melanoma this is a type of melanoma that tends to grow downward more so than outward so it presents as a large bomb and this is a type of melanoma that a lot of times does not meet the criteria of the abcdes meaning it looks just like a smooth symmetric uniform bumps sometimes and some of its symptoms may be discomfort pain tingling and it can arise pretty much at any sight but the head neck is more common how are melanomas diagnosed you play an important role in the diagnosis of melanoma you and your spouse it actually shown that people who are married get their melanomas dying earlier because they have a spouse looking out for them so doing self skin exams particularly if you have multiple risk factors for melanoma it important it these once a month in a well-lit area you just get completely naked and get a handheld mirror or your partner can help you as well look at all surfaces of the body and look for anything that changing or suspicious also really important to look in the general area you know in you you won there unless you look and still look there and anything that comes up new you definitely bring it to the attention of your your health care provider people who have multiple risk factors are also advised to have routine skin exams and some people who have a lot of moles or even advised to undergo something called mold mapping where we photograph all of your moles and kind of do this total body photography that way we have an account of your moles that we can then fall out with time that is that is a really good way to keep track of multiple moles then it even occurs the derm towing to take a biopsy of it a biopsy is a skin sample that can be done either by shaving the area off or by punching it out or by cutting it out and the type of biopsy is going to be guided by the type of melanoma the location and the size but the idea is to get the largest sample possible and we send it to you the pathologist to look at under the microscope and sometimes we do a lot of other tests on the on the sample something called immunohistochemistry fluorescence in situ hybridization comparative genomic hybridization and also gene expression profiling can all be done to characterize the lesion and all that information can be put together to cope with the consensus about if it is something that is truly a melanoma or not sometimes you might also be advised you have what node biopsy that some features in your initial skin biopsy you may they have to have a biopsy of the lymph node that drains the surrounding skin to make sure there is no suspicion the treatment for melanoma is going to be influenced by the stage of the melanoma so how advanced it is and the location but melanomas are treated with what called wide local excision meaning they are cut out and as much of it as cut out as possible and sent to the pathologist to ensure that the margins meaning their surrounding skin is negative tumor and also in some cases you may actually have to have a lymph node dissection which can be very involved so meaning the lymph nodes that are in the area may have to be removed as well so you know that that happens when melanomas are more advanced that you have to have that once the melanoma has metastasized meaning spread to other organs the prognosis is grim and there are more involved treatments that can be pursued one is immunotherapy which involves giving medications that look like in inflammatory mediators of our immune system to kind of get our immune system revved up and go after the tumor another one that started medical school and we gotten is a really novel treatment it a drug or class of drugs that target that b-raf mutation I mentioned that was most common in melanoma I called the BRAF nib and another called Demi rappin in for example and then depending on some of some melanomas may respond to you a medication that inhibits another gene called seek hit and that drug is called a peel mmm this is a drug that gets your immune system to attack the melanoma as well we have a new more class of medications called check immune checkpoint inhibitors the way these work is they kind of get on some of the coy ways that melanoma can distract your immune system one of the ways is that it can express something on a surface called pd-1 ligand what that does is it binds to the surface receptors receptors on some cells and your immune system and kind of tells them to go away basically so we have drugs now that go in and interfere with that that little that little deviance and that can really help extend patient new novel drugs and treatments for this disease but it is deadly people do die format and the incidence is quite is increasing what is the outlook for melanoma melanoma that is caught early on is what it just within just within the skin hasn spread deeper down that actually has a very good prognosis and it cutting it out the risk of developing a metastatic melanoma are more involvement melanoma is increased the longer the delay is between appearance of the atypical spot and diagnosis so if anything comes up on your skin get it checked out sooner rather than later that after melanoma has been diagnosed and treated you have a lot more follow-up that needs to occur you have to have regular skin checks from your dermatologist they the surgical site where the melanoma must cut out make sure there evidence that it gonna examine your lymph nodes depending on the type of melanoma that you have they may order a blood test you should check for certain markers and honestly if you traumatic to go through after you gone through the pain and trauma and fear of dealing with a melanoma diagnosis and treatment after it every time you have to go in for a skin check that could be really scary like oh my god what if they find it so definitely reach out to your family members and you know don to ask for emotional support see how the counselor don traumatic that can be it it it very vulnerable and knowing that they looking for cancer I think it of one of the scariest things for patients and it often is something now we forget about it cancer circle or like wow you know people kind of move on after that but really that part is almost just as scary so yeah but anyways guys I hope this video was helpful to you if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don I

BASAL CELL SKIN CANCER: WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW| DR DRAY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xy8ulxxy9Uw	Dr Day	well hey guys in today to talk about a major reason you should protect your skin from the Sun through the use of sunscreen and some protective clothing and that is a skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma skin cancer is the most common cancer diagnosis in the United States there are three major types of skin cancer that we think of and that we see it commonly the first two are basal cell carcinoma which I talk about in today squamous cell carcinoma these two skin cancers basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are lumped together in a category called non-melanoma skin cancers this is to distinguish them from the third skin cancer melanoma melanoma is a deadly form of skin cancer in contrast the non-melanoma skin cancers are very treatable and curable so that is to distinguish the two there are many other types of skin cancer it three but those are the three major categories and in today said I carcinoma and the United States there are probably over 3 million diagnosis of non melanoma skin cancer on an annual basis and of those 80% are basal cell carcinomas so it cancer that we see in the United States and it worldwide as well basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that arises in the cells at the basal layer of the epidermis of your skin the epidermis is the top of your skin and it consists of a stack of cells and the top stack of the cells is a type of cell called squamous cells and then the very bottom layer is a small band of cells called basal cells and they separates your epidermis the top layer of the skin from the dermis the bottom layer there right there at the junction between the two layers of the skin basal cell carcinoma arises within those cells basal cell carcinoma while it is not a skin cancer that metastasizes readily or spreads to other air in the body it can be a locally very invasive and what that means is that the skin cancer cells once they form in those basal cells can infiltrate into the surrounding skin and almost put out little roots basal cell carcinoma is kind of like a weed in your garden if you can think of it that way it puts that little tiny roots and can really just take up a lot of real estate on say for example the skin of your face basal cell carcinoma is the result of cumulative lifetime exposure to ultraviolet radiation as well as other things that you take the DNA in those skin cells both exogenous factors that cause mutations like ultraviolet radiation as well as just spontaneous mutations bad luck and genetics ultraviolet radiation as well as tobacco and pollutants and ionizing radiation or all factors that can contribute to mutations in these cells and throughout your lifetime the accumulation of those mutations ends up in the formation of a skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma and some individuals are going to be at greater risk for developing these there are more common in people who are very fair complexion who have blonde or red hair and blue eyes they more common in people who have had a history of being on a medication that lowers their immune system or that have a disease that lowers their immune system like HIV basal cell carcinomas while they are more common in people with a fair skin type they can and do occur in darker skin types as well people who have a history of a chronic wound or scar are also at increased risk for basal cell carcinoma in the affected area because that chronic inflammation leads to the accumulation of these mutations at what time can result in basal cell carcinoma the sun exposure that you have in early childhood is actually thought to be more responsible for the risk of basal cell carcinoma then sun exposure that you have in later in later adult years basal cell carcinoma takes a long time to amount a faster to have its onset so that what ultraviolet radiation from the Sun as well as tanning beds and even those seemingly innocent UV lamps that they use in nail salons to harden your nail shellac all can contribute a history of a blistering sunburn in childhood is a risk factor for the development of basal cell carcinoma some people are more Sun sensitive than others so if you are fair come if you have a fair complexion blonde hair or red hair or blue eyes you are at an increased risk for four basal cell carcinoma that skin cancers most commonly but that not to say that people with darker skin types such as African Americans don develop basal cell carcinoma either and ultraviolet radiation is not the only factor that plays a role in the accumulation of these mutations other risk factors include a chronic wound or chronic injury side a chronic non-healing wound for example on the lower legs can predispose you to basal cell carcinoma it inflammation and irritation can disturb the cells of the basal basal layer and lead to leach you feeling the fire for a basal cell carcinoma also certain autoimmune skin diseases namely lupus of the skin the skin disease that to the immune system and that skin disease is associated with an increased risk of basal cell carcinoma particularly in the areas affected by the skin disease and then also it terms of other factors if you have a history of being on a medicine that lowers your immune system that can also also play a role and the reason for that is that the medicines lower your immune systems ability to recognize these cells that have mutations early and get rid of them too being on an immunosuppressive medication or if you have a disease or medical condition that lowers your immune system such as HIV that too is a risk factor or for basal cell carcinoma classically this skin cancer is seen most often and older Caucasian males although women definitely get this as well and now we younger adults and we young women in particular if you have a history of being of using a tanning bed that is a major risk factor because of the ultraviolet radiation exposure that you get through the tanning bed and then there are some genetic diseases in which there are inherited gene defects that predispose the individual to forming these basal cell carcinomas for example there which also goes by the name basal cell nevus syndrome and then lastly in terms of risk factors having a basal cell carcinoma is a risk factor for having another basal cell carcinoma might put you at increased risk and you can imagine why the beta cell carcinoma that we see and it presents on your skin that surface but there are all these abnormal cells underneath lurking and those are kind of primed to then go on to form a basal cell carcinoma so you are at increased risk especially if you think of things like cumulative exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun in early childhood you know the chances are it wasn got all right in that one area it probably all over and you mutations lurking under the skin so having a having one diagnosis of a basal cell carcinoma is a risk factor for getting another one somewhere else but what does basal cell carcinoma look like it actually can look like a lot of things that scary things about it most commonly it presents is a red smooth shiny bump almost looks like a little firm pimple or cyst and it grows very slowly so it not the kind of thing that erupts suddenly overnight and with time it can develop what kind of a smooth a little little perimeter almost like a doughnut type border around it I photo of that here as well so you can get some idea of it all cell carcinomas they also will have sometimes what ages or a big dilated blood vessels that you can see on the surface they can alter eight which means kind of break open and scab over think it spontaneously bleed and they also can start to change colors show different colors like brown black and develop pigment it also can be a flat scaly red plaque that looks for all intents and purposes like eczema or maybe psoriasis that will present on the skin and uh a less common way about a more concerning ways it actually can present looking like a scar and that is called morphia form basal cell carcinoma it looks like a white shiny scar and that type is tends to be a more locally invasive so much so that it can invade the little nerves in your skin and cause some symptoms like numbness tingling in the face and even pain that invasion this tumor cells can start to invade the surrounding nerves it typically detected clinically on a skin exam but some symptoms that might cause you to bring it to the attention of your treating healthcare provider are say a classic history would be a red bump that comes up and doesn it won little kind of scabby thing that you keep picking at it bleeds and heals over those are actually kind of suggestive features of a skin cancer such as basal cell carcinoma so as always any anything that pops up on your skin that is new changing uncomfortable just doesn right to you tell your doctor tell your doctor right away you know it to be safe than sorry what are some complications of having a basal cell carcinoma well I already alluded the fact that it ever metastasize to other areas of the body and for those of you aren familiar with that term that basically just means a cancer starts out in one area and one organ system of your body and spreads to another doesn carcinoma although there are rarer exceptions and so you know that not as much of a concern but the longer the longer it goes untreated the more little roots that it puts out and therefore the harder it is to get out and the more likely it is to recur after it has been treated the longer you go untreated and undiagnosed so but better prognosis better outcome if you treated early when the basal cell carcinoma is small the other obvious risk was going to be a scar after treatment off to get into the different types of treatment and also poor wound healing skin infections those are more complications of the treatment so let treatment the first type of treatment is something called excision which is basically a skin surgery that involves cutting out the tumor and closing it back up together with either stitches or allowing it to heal right by what called secondary intent meaning just just heal on its own what new skin come into the area excision has a pretty high cure rate and a fairly low recurrence rate it depends on the size of the tumor and the location as to whether or not excision is an appropriate treatment when the basal cell carcinoma undergoes excision as the treatment the dermatologist we have to take a sufficient amount of normal normal appearing tissue from around the tumor so what may seem like a small bump we actually still have to take out a pretty big hole there has to be a margin of anywhere from three to five millimeters of normal appearing skin that is excised at the same times after the tumor is cut out it is sent to a pathologist who looks at it under the microscope to see if there is any more tumor remaining at the edges and the borders and if the edges and the borders are clear that is considered treated but sometimes they not clear and more surgery needs to be done so a risk of excision is inadequate removal or risk of recurrence second type of treatment is called Mohs micrographic surgery actually is a very high curate and it is used for skin cancers that are in high risk areas like the head at certain areas at the head neck certain sizes maybe in certain patients who have a history of immuno immunosuppressed or in patients who have had recurrences or on immunosuppressive medications so there are a lot of criteria for what type of basal cell carcinomas undergo this type of treatment but if if the basal cell carcinoma needs to have that what it involves is examining excisions layer by layer of the tumor to check very carefully for clear clear margins so instead of just taking this wide margin as in an excision you go a little bit by a little bit and look at each little bit until you have until you have those bits that are clear of tumor so it sparing in other words the third type of treatment is more superficial and reserved for very small basis cells are low-risk and that shave excision which instead of actually cutting out the tumor into the deeper layers and stitching it up it just involves shaving it flat off you kind of take a little scoop of the base to make sure you get that basal layer so that one way or another more superficial skin surgery that can be done on certain basal cell carcinomas is something called electrode desiccation and curettage which basically involves scraping the tumor out and burning the base whether it be a shave excision or electro desiccation and curettage both of these more superficial surgeries are nice and that you don and you know it quicker of a procedure but there is a higher rate rate of recurrence of the tumor coming back in other words and you depending on the tumor features as well as the location for aesthetic reasons it may not be appropriate the fourth type of treatment is liquid nitrogen freezing spray this also is only appropriate for very small lesions sometimes is used alongside other treatments but it involves freezing the tumour cells and that freezing them results in the cells thawing and and kind of dying after lack of a better word the fifth type of treatment is something called photodynamic therapy and this involves applying onto the skin a photosensitizing chemical that that is taken out by the skin cancer cells preferentially and once that is done once that is exposed to light visible white and because those cancer cells have taken up that chemical they light and they die is the is the idea but it local lesions smaller lesions and it also has a very good cosmetic outcome and that you don scarring and almost kind of she was secondary it these little remove awesome just sun damaged skin cells as well the sixth type of treatment is a cream called in my coma or aldera this is a medication in a cream form that actually makes your immune system rev up and come in and hopefully clear out the tumor again more superficial lesions that are gonna be less than two centimeters in diameter or those would be you know potentially appropriate for this treatment the tumor becomes very inflamed and then it heals and it heals with minimal scarring the seventh type of treatment is a cream called FEX or a five-floor of yourself this is again approp going to be only appropriate for very small tumors and it is applied at twice a day for six to twelve weeks and it has a much higher recurrence rate than other treatments and I is an option and then the eighth type of treatment it radiation therapy this is basically like x-ray treatment of the tumor cells and this is most often used either as a primary and cases of basal cell carcinoma where surgery is just not in the patient best interest particularly very very elderly individuals who may be a little frail too frail for the procedure this is something that is considered but it also used as an adjuvant treatment meaning it particularly for stubborn stubborn basal cell carcinomas that are really invasive into the surrounding skin sometimes radiotherapy radiation therapy is used as an adjuvant treatment um and it something that is really appropriate for young people and does how risks of predisposing actually to skin cancer down the road so something that is used more on a case-by-case basis basal cell carcinoma is for the most part curable and you know not that people die from but there are advanced cases for sure and some you know it not not out of the woods to do you have to have a multi-modal approach to treatment using a combination of surgery on radiation therapy and really advanced cases we also now have medications that target some of these mutations that occur in basal cell carcinoma namely a medication called vis motor job which was with a brand name airbag that is used in some cases of basal cell carcinoma particularly in cases of genetic diseases where there is a risk for basal cell carcinoma our you know basal cell carcinoma is a big part of the disease the outlook for basal cell carcinoma is pretty good though most are cured by treatment but it does have a pretty high recurrence rate and 50% of people who have a basal cell carcinoma will get another basal cell carcinoma at least somewhere else on their body it within three years of the first diagnosis so it requires that you know you have ongoing ongoing surveillance with total body skin exams from your healthcare provider on a regular basis as well as due to self skin checks at home prevention is key you can do what I tell you to do every day and that is broad spectrum sunscreen and some protective clothing if you have young children this is key because it at the beginning of the video the sun exposure that you have as a young child sets you up for basal cell carcinoma later on in life so I mean you know if a child gets a blistering sunburn that just that mutations in their skin that I can definitely put them at a risk for skin cancer down the road you gotta protect your skin on a daily basis year-round regards to the weather even if it cloudy out you know so long as daylight ultraviolet radiation is is affecting the health of your skin and it enough to just wear a sunscreen you have to wear a broad-brimmed hat when you outdoors long sleeves and just don outside during mid-day when the Sun makes when sun exposure is is at its peak so that tell you about basal cell carcinoma comment below and if you want me to do more videos on skin cancers on squamous cell carcinoma the other one you got to worry about so with that I hope you enjoyed this video if you liked it give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don subscribe I [Music]	Success
THE SKIN SUPPLEMENT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ?? Dermatologist @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0QDCgSWCx0	Dr Day	well hey guys as you know there are a ton of supplements out there that make all sorts of claims about benefits for the skin things like collagen gummies hyaluronic acid tablets now i a lot of these supplements in other videos so definitely check those out but in this video we about a dietary supplement with actual good evidence to support its use for skin benefit if you are new here welcome my name is andrea i dermatologist if you like skincare skincare product reviews anti-aging tips consider subscribing or follow me over on tik tok or instagram i post on those platforms pretty consistently as well so what is this mystery supplement you speak of it is nicotinamide otherwise known as niacinamide yes that the b vitamin vitamin b3 which is in pretty much every skin care product these days i know you guys commiserate with me in the comments a fair amount on how niacinamide while a good ingredient in care products it seems to be something brands are just pumping in left and right and some people do find it irritating anyways i digress and if i use nicotinamide and niacinamide interchangeably throughout this video my apologies just know they mean the same thing vitamin b3 this is a water-soluble form of vitamin b3 and it important as a precursor for something called nad and nad is important in the process of repairing damaged dna so we biggest stressors that your skin has to deal with on a day-to-day basis is environmental stressors ultraviolet radiation pollution infrared radiation specifically ultraviolet radiation damages the dna in your skin cells and it also suppresses the immune system that circulates throughout your skin to kind of clear out damage and that is one of many reasons why sun exposure contributes to skin cancer formation later on later on in life it the immunosuppressive properties as well as the damage to dna nicotinamide is helpful for repairing damaged dna it anti-inflammatory and it inhibits that sun-induced suppression of the immune system in the skin where the heck do we get nicotinamide is it something that is in the water do we make it ourselves largely we get it from our diet you can find it in fish poultry legumes certain grains it foods and in nuts unless you follow an incredibly restrictive diet there is a good chance you are getting vitamin b3 in your diet so why would you need to supplement and is it even beneficial well turns out because nicotinamide is anti-inflammatory it has been studied in dermatology as a dietary supplement for a few skin conditions namely a condition which we won for time is a blistering disease that often affects older adults it can be triggered by medications in combination with another anti-inflammatory together can help treat that condition which is a blistering disease because niacinamide can help in repairing damaged dna as well as putting the brakes on that uv mediated immunosuppression in the skin it has been examined in clinical trials as a supplement to perhaps mitigate skin cancer formation older adults who have a lot of sun damage they make this skin lesion called an actinic keratosis and actinic keratosis is a precursor to a skin cancer the more actinic keratosis that you have the greater the risk that you will have skin cancer and it kind of a reflection that you lot of sun damage going on and those patients often have to come in more frequently for skin checks and have these actinic keratosis frozen off and removed anyways so a clinical clinical trials have been done looking at nicotinamide 500 milligrams twice a day for four months and people who have a lot of actinic keratosis at the end of the four months people getting nicotinamide in these studies had statistically significant fewer actinic keratosis in comparison to people getting the placebo in addition to having a lot of sun damage another group of people who are at a greater risk for forming skin cancers are people who have had organ transplants because they are taking medications that suppress their immune system so they not able to clear out those damaged cells in the skin as well because of that they are at a greater risk for forming skin cancers and they often make a lot of these actinic keratoses so one study looking at this population of people getting 500 milligrams of nicotinamide again twice a day for six months at the end of the study those individuals had statistically significant fewer actinic keratosis now i keep saying 500 milligrams twice a day and one of the studies they actually looked at taking it once a day and while the once a day dosage did decrease the number of actinic keratoses relative to placebo is not as much as taking it twice a day now once you make a skin cancer like a squamous cell carcinoma or a basal cell carcinoma your risk of making another one is quite high and that is why once you make one and have it removed you have to keep going back to the dermatologist to have skin checks to monitor for new ones coming up so in one study people who had already had one non-melanoma skin cancer they were enrolled in this trial given 500 milligrams of nicotinamide twice a day for a year at the end of the study there was a statistically significant decrease in the number of new actinic keratosis that these people were making in comparison to placebo but importantly that effect went away after they stopped taking it so bottom line taking 500 milligrams of nicotinamide twice a day may help in reducing the number of pre-skin cancers that people make who are at risk for making them however you have to keep taking it in order to maintain that benefit so once you stop you lose the benefit you to making the same number of actinic keratosis all right so that who make a lot of skin cancers you know they damage we of these studies were done in australia where the uv is quite potent what if you 20s your 30s you have never had a skin cancer before you sunscreen or whatever is this beneficial to you there that you need to be taking this um because you know it looked at in these populations who are at risk and again as i said it doesn doesn like sunscreen will so whether or not people who don skin cancers yet or have significant sun damage are are a transplant patient making a lot of skin cancers or pre-skin cancers it doesn necessary we don the research to support everybody taking it it supplement you got to buy it and like i said in those people for which this has been studied for they have to keep taking it in order to maintain those results so for just everybody to take it it may not be like the most cost-effective logical thing to do how safe is it to take nicotinamide is it dangerous is it harmful are there adverse effects that can occur yeah i mean you can run into problems with it for sure if you take very high levels um 500 milligrams twice a day appears to be very well tolerated with no side effects and so that is what is recommended to these patient groups however you definitely can run into dangerous side effects when taking very high doses you can get into toxic ranges if you take too much three and a half grams per day will definitely get you to toxic levels that can damage your liver so starting out you have elevation and the liver enzymes you can develop nausea vomiting headache it and it also can interfere with the platelets platelets are the component of your blood important for clotting and so if you have low platelets this may not be the best thing for you it could potentially interfere with that especially at high levels you know nicotinamide this is a dietary supplement but it drinks energy drinks and stuff like that so you can imagine how depending on your lifestyle and you know if you a lot of supplements you might actually end up running into the territory where you are getting to too high of an amount of this that is one problem with dietary supplements they lot of times you can get high levels of things and on you know unknowingly so same thing happens with b12 supplements you know i i have to take b12 because i am a vegan but uh some people take b12 and then they drink energy drinks with b12 added and then maybe they take some other kind of supplement that has b12 in it and too much b12 is associated with triggering acne for a lot of people and they just don realize how much b12 they are consuming so remember it dose if you don carefully you can easily get too much so that is one word of caution if you are like reading about nicotinamide or you know thinking about it first of all hasn benefit for just generally healthy people and second of all you can get to toxic levels uh and that can seriously damage your liver the other thing about nicotinamide supplements is that there is potential for medication interaction so if you take medications um definitely discuss with your health care provider before considering the supplement especially if you take the drug carbamazepine uh it is a medication some people with migraines take and some and it anti-epileptic medication so nicotinamide can interfere with the metabolism of that drug and make it get to too high of a level in your body so that is a potential adverse effect all right so you right like i i you that this is the end-all be-all there people who make a lot of skin cancers but young otherwise healthy people your focus should be on protecting your skin from the sun with sunscreen and sun protective clothing not sunbathing you there than in chasing after taking this as a supplement now i mentioned this at the beginning of the video kind of joking around about topical niacinamide or nicotinamide same same thing and you will find that in a ton of skin care products and it beneficial for a variety of skin issues when applied topically because it antioxidant so it kind of helps reduce the burden of oxidative stress in the skin upon exposure to environmental stressors and there is research in clinical trials looking at topical application of this ingredient for acne there percent niacinamide is as effective for moderate acne as one percent clindamycin a prescription treatment for acne there two percent niacinamide gel and showing that that decreases sebum production reducing oiliness and shine so the combination of reducing inflammation and reducing sebum output light likely explains why this is a beneficial ingredient for acne topical niacinamide also can help alleviate and improve some of the visible signs of skin aging it demonstrated when applied anywhere from two to four percent uh to help improve the look of fine lines red blotchiness likely because it also can improve the appearance of sunspots help them fade hyperpigmentation it can help fade and it can help in improving sallow yellow skin which is one of the visible signs of skin aging that you know people don don of the visible signs of skin aging they may ask things like complexion improving uh you know how to improve dull skin but part of some of the visible signs of skin aging is this actual yellowing of the skin due to damage of the underlying dermal components from chronic uv exposure kind of gives the skin a yellow appearance combined with a loss of elasticity topical niacinamide can kind of improve some of those some of those visible signs of skin aging so niacinamide may also be helpful for those of you who deal with rosacea because not only does it help calm down redness but it has been shown to improve skin barrier function so for people with rosacea a key issue that they deal with is this this problem with barrier barrier this barrier issue it makes them more sensitive to things that come in contact with the skin irritants that why a lot of skin care products are irritating to people with rosacea cleansers moisturizers burn and sting niacinamide if tolerated can improve barrier function and make the symptoms of rosacea likely better plus it anti-inflammatory which also benefits rosacea in terms of the bumps that people with rosacea get so it things however you know like i mentioned at the beginning of the video it in skincare products left and right at high percentages much greater than what has been examined in these studies and it can be irritating a lot of you guys comment in my videos gosh i cannot do niacinamide uh it burns it stings it causes irritation i do not get along with it and it is in everything these days i hear you there i mean you know it not right for everyone and not everyone gets along well with it and finding products nowadays that are free of it seems increasingly more of a challenge it a lot of cleansers um and it moisturizers all that to say uh oral nicotinamide is has been shown to be beneficial for people who make a lot of skin cancers at 500 milligrams twice a day it is safe well tolerated however people who have problems with their platelets or people taking carbamazepine should definitely exercise caution with this and you certainly can oral nicotinamide get yourself into liver damage that could be quite deadly for you applying it topically to the skin has several benefits provided you tolerate it all right y nicotinamide a lot of you guys have been asking me to talk about it for a while now there is another dietary supplement with quite a bit of research to support its use for skin benefit for hyperpigmentation improving sun damage from you know spending time outdoors and it is called polypodium so in the description box as well as on the end slate i i talk all about polypodium if you missed that definitely check it out if you were interested in dietary supplements with evidence behind them for their use and skin and skin benefit jeff definitely check that one out but if you guys like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen and subscribe i to you guys tomorrow

Actinic keratosis removal, treatments, and prevention| Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjqGEaGPgEI	Dr Day	well hey guys welcome back to the Friday QA today I actinic keratoses I answering your questions about what they are why have her and what treatment options are pursued to get rid of them actinic keratoses are very common skin lesions that are rough scale a bumpy spots that occur on sun damaged skin in areas of the scan that are frequently exposed to sunlight we take them very seriously in dermatology because they are a pre malignancy a pre an early form of a possible skin cancer they are a precursor to a skin cancer at noon as squamous cell carcinoma and therefore we make every effort to detect them and treat them early on an effort to prevent this risk of skin cancer development actinic keratoses are the result of abnormal skin cell development caused by DNA damage to the skin cells that DNA damage is due to ultraviolet radiation exposure either from the Sun or from a tanning bed specifically ultraviolet radiation in the wavelengths of UVB the wavelengths that burn our skin also caused these mutations and our skin cells and as these mutations accumulate in skin cells actinic keratoses form pre skin cancers that later can turn into a full-blown skin cancer known as squamous cell carcinoma as I alluded to you in the intro of the video actinic keratoses are very common people with fair-skinned are more at risk and tend to develop more of these in their later adult life also people with a history of a severe sunburn at any point in their life most often in early hood do you have an increased risk for developing these pre skin cancers later on in adult life it takes a while for them to you up here and usually they don adulthood it is the job of our immune system to make every effort to clear out these pre skin cancer cells these cells that have damaged DNA but as we get older our ability to do that kind of is overwhelmed and also in individuals who have medical diseases that lower their immune system and/or take medications that affect their immune system are at more risk their immune system either due to medication or disease is not able to efficiently clear these pre skin cancers not only in people who have a fair skin type but people who have a history of sunburn and also people who have spent time outdoors either for recreational purposes or as part of their occupation if you kind of often times they look like a wart their scaly rough bumpy little spots sometimes it can be quite large and they occur on the backs of the hands as well as the face the forehead very common location for them is on the ears which is one reason why I really educate and hope that you all make sure to put some protection on your ears and protect your ears from those damaging wavelengths of UVB they sometimes they can them they can be brown or gray or tannish and sometimes they are light colored skin color now the main concern with these skin lesions in 1a why we take them so seriously is that they can develop into a skin cancer but we also take them seriously because they are they can be very disfiguring they unsightly and therefore they can affect your quality of life having multiple actinic keratoses how risky are they in terms of turning into a skin cancer to be frank the risk of anyone actinic keratoses turning into a full-blown cancer is actually very rare but people who form these and form multiple of them they kind of a clue to their overall skin cancer risk and people who have more than ten of them which is not uncommon at all thought you equate to about a 10 percent 10 to 15% risk of developing a malignancy a squamous cell carcinoma malignancy which is a full-blown skin cancer that often has to be excised or treated surgically and can leave behind very disfiguring scars so definitely something that you want to prevent rule number one though never self diagnosed your own skin diseases this can really set you up for a lot of trouble so the diagnosis should be made by either your treating healthcare provider honestly most primary care family Doc very very accustomed to seeing these are very good at diagnosing them so either you or in the case of a dermatologist you might be saying you know they would be the one just to make the diagnosis not you they I appearance but occasionally a biopsy is needed which is just taking a little sample of the skin lesion and sending it to our friends the pathologist to tell us exactly what it is first approach is treating these skin lesions is to destroy them and to do this we use a variety of techniques probably the most common and if you is a good chance you treatment done it liquid freezing spray this is the same treatment that we also used to treat warts so if you this it can be very uncomfortable and very painful and depending on the size of the of the octet of keratosis and its location or their be on your face or your body then that dictates how how how lesion heals from the cryotherapy and more often than not there cases where the lesion is a little bit thicker and requires a more aggressive freecycle you can be left with a scar and you also can be left with a type of permanent scar that leaves behind a white spot so it lose the color of the skin in the area treated so that that know something naught is not desirable the other other very common way to treat them is something called electrode desiccation and curettage and what that is is using a sharp tool to scrape out the pre skin cancers off of your skin put numbing medicine of course in at first you don sharp instrument to pick out the skin set the precancerous skin cells and then we burn behind the base with a little electric cautery device that will that will get rid of any of remainings and that option will heal with almost small scars so not something that you to want but is an effective treatment option in terms of destruction so just cutting them out or destroying them is one approach but another approach particularly in people who make a lot of them which is not uncommon is to take a field approach and treat a large area all at once and the reason for this is if you fold to treat the skin the the actinic keratoses that we can see with our eyes on your face but also the fact that people make a lot of these we know those people continue to make more of them and they continue to make more of them because they have DNA damage DNA and their skin cells elsewhere in there on their face for example that is going to turn into one of these pre skin cancers so we try to treat the whole area all at once it called a field field treatment to treat what we can see and what is lurking under at the skin is going to pop up later on and on a very common way to do this is to use different kinds of medication creams that destroy the abnormal skin cells a very common medic cream that is used is something called 5-fluorouracil or fu Dax this is a medication in a cream form that is cytotoxic to pre skin cancer cells by flora your cell cream is applied to the area before several weeks depending on the area and whatnot is very uncomfortable the area that you applying the cream to gets incredibly red irritated inflamed and can blister it through but that is a common way they treated another common cream that is helpful for this problem and kind of achieves the field field effect that I talking about here is something called Emiquon Maude or al-zahra this is a medication that can helped you guide your immune system to come in and clear out those pre skin cancer cells off of your face or elsewhere on the body where it a couple of times a week for several weeks and is also uncomfortable 5fu or Fe dioxin and aloe vera it weeks of treatment it medication that can also be prescribed is something called in general meditate or it also goes by the name Pokeno which is the brand name this medication also will help to clear these out in the field feel the fact and it is effective actually only and with only two or three applications so it time and therefore is easier for people to tolerate it other type of field treatment that is effective and helpful although very it can be very uncomfortable to go through is something called photodynamic therapy and what this entails is applying this is done in in the clinic a photosensitizing agent is applied to the area whether it be on your upper arms for example chest or even your your face a photosensitizing agent is applied and that photosensitizing agent specifically will concentrate in the disease precancerous skin cells of the area and then the area of that F that dose of a particular wave like a visible light that will then kill off those cells that have taken up that photosensitizing agent that was applied is there anything that can be done to prevent these from forming stretch some protection using a broad-spectrum sunscreen SPF 50 or greater actually can reduce the number of these that form and will lower your risk of making them you have to wear a sunscreen on a daily basis all year-round in order to have this preventive effect so it is an important behavior that everyone should put into place and as a side note I can you sunscreen on and protecting your skin from the Sun but aren about vitamin D deficiency how do you get vitamin D the wavelengths of light that not to meet vitamin D synthesis in our skin are the exact same wavelengths of ultraviolet light that cause these DNA mutations in our skin and set up set us up for risk for skin cancer they also it of ultraviolet light that burn our skin there is no dose of ultraviolet light from the Sun UVB or no amount of sun exposure that you can pursue that will raise your vitamin D without subsequently mutating the skin cells and you cells and putting you at risk for skin cancer as well as a sunburn you might I rays your vitamin D because it isn even known if sun exposure is effective or efficient at elevating someone vitamin D vitamin D is incredibly important to our overall health particularly in terms of the function of our immune system and our bone health definitely underplaying that whatsoever vitamin D low vitamin D and vitamin D deficiency is increasingly common and we rates of vitamin D deficiency increase but pay attention we rates of UVB sun some related skin cancers also increasing quite a bit so clearly we dose that activates vitamin D synthesis in the skin because we skin cancers that it also causes you have low vitamin D levels or you told that discuss with your healthcare provider how to how to restore that if it diet but getting vitamin D from the Sun is not safe effective or clean efficient another preventative measure however that supplement of b3 nicotinamide nicotinamide consumed at 500 milligrams twice a day will has been shown to decrease the number of actinic keratoses that people form specifically people who already form a lot of them taking this supplement has been shown to reduce the number of actinic keratoses that someone forms so it doesn getting them but it will help to reduce the number of additional legions that you form when this is stopped however your baseline risk of forming war goes right back up so it seems as though it something that has to be continued nicotinamide also can decrease the severity of pre skin cancers about form but if you an actinic keratosis or multiple actinic keratoses what is the outlook after they recur later on in life and once you start making them you are at increased risk for making more of them as well as for making all types of skin cancer squamous cell carcinoma basal cell carcinoma and the deadly melanoma so you know know that it requires you to then see the dermatologist a lot more frequently it a burden on your time and you have to go through these treatments a lot more often which are not fun so yet another reason to protect your skin from the Sun but I hope this video is helpful and overviewing actinic keratoses their treatment options kind of what they are and what not if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always

HOW TO DO A SKIN CHECK AND WHAT TO LOOK FOR ?? DERMATOLOGIST @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2yE86kWCPY	Dr Day	well hey guys it skin cancer awareness month and in this video i do a skin check and examine your skin to look for potentially pre-skin cancers or skin cancers you are new here welcome my name is andrea i dermatologist i upload a ton of skincare content here on youtube please consider subscribing if that is of interest to you or follow me over on instagram or tick tock i post on those platforms a lot too the american cancer society recommends that people do self skin exams once a month especially people who have multiple risk factors for skin cancers and if you risk factors for skin cancers check out my recent video on know your risk i go over some of the most common risk factors for skin cancer so check that out but do you know anyone can develop a skin cancer even if you don factors and knowing your skin examining it is a good thing and maybe can help you catch something early on when should you be doing a skin check like i said the american cancer society says once a month that good idea now it doesn when you do it but i mean practically speaking it makes the most sense to examine your skin like when you gotten out of the shower out of the bath before you naked so you can really look at all the skin and obviously you don have any makeup on that could be obscuring things so after the shower is typically a good time now first of all starting out you want to face a mirror and you want to be in a room that has good lighting and you just want to look very carefully at all surfaces of your face your neck the ears and your arms as well as your chest and your stomach women should examine the breasts lift up the breasts and look underneath the breast if you have a lot of abdominal folds you want to make sure that you as well lift up your arms and check in the underarm area and then take a careful look at the backs of your hands and the palms of your hands look between your fingers and look all around your fingernails then you want to take a seat and look very carefully at your thighs as well as the tops of your feet in between your toes and your toenails then grab yourself a hand mirror and take a look at the soles of your feet very carefully then bring that mirror up to the back of your legs look at the backs of your calves you know one leg at a time and the backs of your thighs one leg at a time then you want to stand up and with that hand mirror you to take a careful look at your buttocks and your back so you the lower back and then you bring that mirror up around and look at your upper back take a careful look at the back of your neck and the back of your ears then you also want to take that hand mirror and look very carefully around the groin and the genitalia a lot of people don melanoma can develop in the genitalia lastly do not forget to take a careful look at your scalp as best you look through the scalp take that mirror make sure you your ears all right so that examine your skin but what the heck are you looking for you know most people have freckles moles all sorts of things that are harmless uh and it can be hard to tease out all that background noise from something that may be potentially suspicious like an early skin cancer or god forbid a melanoma so how do you kind of tease out all that noise so it can be challenging to tease out just like the background noise of normal skin spots from something that could be potentially suspicious so here are some common things that are perfectly normal on a skin shack and as you do your skin check each month you going to come to realize that yeah i had this mold forever and it not changing so first of all you gonna probably see moles that you for a while moles otherwise known as nevi they dangerous very very very very very rarely they do go on to form to turn into a skin cancer moles are typically small they uniform in size shape they can be flat or raised they and they very very very very very rarely turn into a skin cancer now people who have a lot of moles that is a marker for an increased risk for melanoma so having more than 50 moles is a risk factor for melanoma but yeah they especially on sun exposed areas then some people have what are called atypical moles otherwise known as dysplastic nevi now these differ from common moles in that they they can be a little irregular in appearance they can have a few different colors kind of brown and tan to them they may be a little irregular in texture the vast majority of these atypical moles they are completely harmless they never change or do anything harmful but in some cases they can change and melanoma can arise in a dysplastic nevis and an atypical mole having a lot of atypical moles does put you at increased risk for melanoma having more than five the increased risk however that comes with having more than five dysplastic nevi the increased risk for melanoma is actually pretty small so don these just keep an eye on them with your monthly skin checks number three is a congenital mole or a congenital nevis congenital means it something you were born with these are really common often dark brown sometimes almost black congenital nevi may have a hair growing through them and they can be raised they vary in size from small to large and with large congenital levi there actually is an increased risk of melanoma so if you have a congenital nevus that is the size of the palm of your hand or smaller very very very low risk of that ever doing anything you know turning into cancer or anything like that but if you have a congenital nevus that large portions of your back or your buttocks it trunk nevis just because of how it looks that does come with an increased risk of melanoma and those patients actually need to be followed more regularly another skin finding that you may identify especially if you were in your older years is an actinic keratosis this is a skin lesion that is hard to see for a lot of people but you can feel it so i didn to run your hands over like your forehead your ears all of your sun exposed skin if you feel something that you look at it very carefully it of red appearing that could be something called an actinic keratosis actinic keratosis they can evolve into a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma so it identified early and treated they really common especially in people who are a paler complexion and who have a lot of sun damage they after the age of 50. it somebody under the age of 50 to have actinic keratoses but i mean i impossible it they feel gritty sometimes they can kind of tingle itch actinic keratosis can pop up on the ears the head and neck the backs of the hands the lips and they feel a little rough gritty then another common skin lesion especially as you get up there in years is something called separate as seborrheic keratosis this is brown to tan kind of waxy in appearance almost seems like it skin like you know somebody just came up and stuck this this thing onto you and sometimes they get caught up if you and then the skin underneath bleeds and then they grow right back these are they they kind of look like warts but they completely not harmful they don skin cancer they going to change into a skin cancer they are not dangerous but those are something that often gets referred to a dermatologist to say hey is this new thing that me something to be scared about so that something that you may already have on you you may have already been told by your doctor don the barnacle on the ship of life a lot of people refer to them as i don i don could rub people the wrong way but yeah they anything to do with sun exposure or sun damage it doesn like we have the full story there nothing that can be done to prevent those from occurring i do have a video by the way on separate keratosis including the treatment escada so if you video out i description box so those are some common bumps that you may see on your skin certainly not an exhaustive list of possible skin findings but just some common ones but what about melanoma the thing about melanoma is it can actually overlap in appearance with a lot of these normal appearing things but it something that just kind of all of a sudden stands out to you as this wasn there before or this just doesn you know it stands out it ugly duckling sign because it doesn on the surface of your skin so if you got a lot of moles freckles or severe keratosis or whatever a lot of sun damage the melanoma is going to be like something that just stands out to you as different and it can it can change in appearance from month to month it uh it melanoma are typically very irregular if you draw a line down the middle of it it can be a few different colors within a melanoma brown and black most common but it can be skin colored tan melanomas may bleed easily or ooze it can be uncomfortable and again it going to be something that that comes out of nowhere and just suddenly looks very different so that would certainly be something to urgently bring to the attention of your health care provider if you have a dermatologist let them know that you have a new skin finding and you need to be examined if you see something new on your skin that just doesn feel right or something on your skin that seems different you don know what it is but it hunch that something is different not what it once was definitely bring it to the attention of your of your dermatologist because a lot of times patients will come in and they this mole is kind of freaking me out it looks different there different about it i can finger on it and even for the dermatologist looking at it pull out the germatoscope take a look at it it may not even really seem too you know objectively that different but a biopsy is done a lot of times those do actually end up being skin cancers so your hunch that something is off that that is actually a very helpful clue that you know further investigation may be needed so i hope this video was helpful to you guys you know skin checks there they can be a slippery slope i don doing them any more often than once a month because you can get a little bit too nervous about certain things and it can be a good idea especially if you have a lot of moles and things to just go ahead and take some photographs of certain areas if you was this here last month was this here this you know if something is new or not just so that you yourself overly anxious about things it that way if something new does actually pop up you can show that to your dermatologist in some dermatology clinics that do a lot of skin cancer they doing total body photography to monitor new or changing lesions so that may be something that your dermatologist is already doing for you but if not you know or if you don access to a dermatologist consider taking some photographs especially if you lot of moles that could be very helpful if something new pops up then you have that to compare to so in the description box i factors for skin cancer you don to miss so if you missed that video definitely check it out i the end slate but if

7 SKIN SIGNS NOT TO IGNORE ?? DERMATOLOGIST @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYUBg8ZmstI	Dr Day	well hey guys in this video i be covering seven signs of skin cancer you don here welcome my name is andrea i board certified dermatologist i upload skin care content here on youtube if that sounds of interest to you consider subscribing or you could consider following me over on instagram or tiktok i platforms as well now there are quite a few different types of skin cancer but for the purposes of this video i to be going over seven signs of the most common type of skin cancer which is basal cell carcinoma not only is basal cell carcinoma the most common type of skin cancer it common cancer diagnosed worldwide in the us it americans will be handed a diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma each year most people who get this type of skin cancer have a paler skin type and a history of a lot of unprotected sun exposure however any skin type any skin tone can get this type of skin cancer so while it you have a deeper skin tone this can affect you as well it exposed areas but it also can occur in areas where you a burn when you hear the word cancer that sounds really really scary and it is but in the case of basal cell carcinoma rest assured it growing skin cancer and it life-threatening if a left untreated however it can start to grow very deep into the skin and it can impact the nerves and the blood vessels that can infiltrate there and as it gets deeper it removal process leads to more noticeable scarring and can be quite disfiguring so best treated early to prevent not only disfigurement but also to reduce the risk of recurrence [Music] number one is a pink or red growth that kind of dips down in the center this is often mistaken for either a sore or an acne scar it has a red rim to it but a little dip in the center and that can be a sign of a basal cell carcinoma if it doesn away you might want to get it checked out if you don area and it acne scar [Music] number two is a growth or scaly patch on or around the ear the ears are a frequent location for skin cancers namely basal cell carcinoma and it can easily be mistaken for just a patch of dry skin or sore you keep putting moisturizer on it that may temporarily make it feel softer but it always kind of comes right back [Music] number three is a sore that does not heal maybe even bleed sometimes or oozes or maybe it heals but it always comes right back this is sometimes mistaken as a pimple or a sore it can bleed ooze and it can be uncomfortable painful itchy have a little numbness and tingling sensation to it a lot of times these might appear for example on your nose and again some people just think oh it have the most stubborn acne a given pimple should not last and persist it should go away granted you may get pimples elsewhere but that is more than just acne it might be a skin cancer [Music] number four is a slightly raised patch of either dry or irritated skin anywhere on the face or on the body and it can be brown black tan red or pink any you know different colors a lot of times this is just mistaken as a patch of irritated skin kind of similar you put on moisturizer and just doesn maybe you even try like a product that is meant to smooth the skin and exfoliate and it just patch just keeps coming back this rough area of skin that could be a clue to basal cell carcinoma [Music] number five is a round growth it might be pink red tan brown black maybe even a mixture of some colors and it can be a little smooth or rough oftentimes this is mistaken as a mole or a wart um you know people will go in to the drugstore and buy over-the-counter wart treatments to try and get rid of it it might actually be a skin cancer this is tricky because warts they tend to stay around for a long time eventually they go away but they pretty stubborn and so if you something that you think is a wart it do know in the back of your mind it could be a skin cancer especially if it [Music] number six is a scaly rough spot maybe it mistaken as a freckle or a age spot as a matter of fact some people will go as far to go to a med spa and have it treated with like intense pulse light in a med spa thinking that it in reality it so if you have a new brown or tan spot that definitely have it examined by a board-certified dermatologist it could be a skin cancer not just some sunspot or age spot [Music] and lastly number seven is something that looks like a scar it may be white yellow kind of bound down and feeling tight it might appear shiny and smooth but in your mind you a cut there or any kind of injury so why would i have a scar that could be a clue for a type of skin cancer called amorphia form basal cell carcinoma there are a lot of different types of basal cell carcinoma as a side note that they can look like pretty much anything on the skin any kind of growth you have to be mindful of skin cancer all right so those are some clues that you might be dealing with a skin cancer but i want you guys to understand there are hundreds and hundreds of different types of skin lesions that can pop up on your skin and they can be totally not cancer not this at all there are things like warts skin tags benign growths like seborrheic keratoses and so it may not be that but it important to have it evaluated where do basal cell carcinomas arise most often it body that see a lot of sun especially the head and the ears they can happen around your eyelids that and remind you guys to put sunscreen around your eyes and wear your sunglasses because basal cell carcinoma can definitely impact the lid margin and removing it is more involved than if it happens elsewhere on the body it can happen on the shoulder on the trunk like your chest or your back especially the upper back where you often get a lot more sun exposure and on the lower legs especially a common area for women maybe you did a lot of sunbathing in your younger years didn put sunscreen on your legs god forbid you went in a tanning bed i mean these are common areas for this type of skin cancer to arise actually is on the shins are there any symptoms with the basal cell carcinoma well in some cases it can be painful and because these skin cancers they slowly grow downwards sometimes they can entrap little nerves throughout the skin and that can make the lesion the bump or whatever feel itchy kind of tingly pins and needles type sensation and in some cases blood vessels can grow into the basal cell carcinoma that makes it more kind of what weep and that is why some people think they have a sore or a pimple but it doesn heal that is a red flag that you might be dealing with a skin cancer a skin lesion that bleeds itches oozes and doesn get checked out and see a board-certified dermatologist for evaluation this type of skin cancer tends to arise in people you know around their 50s older adults but it happening in younger and younger demographics women in their 30s can develop basal cell carcinoma and especially if you have a history of using a tanning bed that puts you at greater risk for any type of skin cancer so if you have a history of going in a tanning bed or getting a lot of blistering sunburns in your early childhood pay careful attention to your skin if you in the back of your mind that it is possibility that something that doesn heal is a skin cancer and rather than going to dr google or on social media try and see a board-certified dermatologist to have it evaluated like i said there are a lot of skin lesions that can pop up as we get into our wiser years especially skin tags warts seborrheic keratoses a ton of things that are not this type of cancer but can look an awful lot like it therefore it best to see a board-certified dermatologist who can properly evaluate it and the the thing about basal cell is sometimes it can be treated right away you don treatment depending on the size the location a variety of other things sometimes simply the fact of biopsying it and removing it to evaluate it under the microscope is the treatment [Music] all right you guys so those are seven signs of basal cell carcinoma it really common and again it skin cancer that impacts people of a paler skin type if you are a deeper skin tone this type of skin cancer certainly can impact you as well so even though it with a lot of sun damage and people who are prone to sunburn anyone can get this anyone can get those so i hope this was helpful to you guys and um i have videos on other types of skin cancers namely melanoma so i going to link that video in the description box and i on the end slate if that is of interest to you it is an older video but it still accurate so check that out but if you like this one give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen and subscribe i guys tomorrow bye [Music] you	Success
5 THINGS YOU ARE GETTING WRONG ABOUT SUNSCREEN ?? Dermatologist @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJQJoFx48-Q	Dr Day	well hey guys there is still a ton that people are getting absolutely wrong about skincare and about protecting their skin from the sun in this video we common misconceptions that americans have about sun protection the aad american academy of dermatology conducts a survey every year of u.s adults attitudes on sun protection so we going to go over that we find out what people are still getting wrong if you are new here welcome my name is andrea i am a board certified dermatologist i post skincare content here pretty consistently on youtube if that is of interest to you consider subscribing hit the bell button so that you video if you like tik tok or instagram consider following me there as well i pretty consistent on those platforms too so the american academy of dermatology did a recent survey in 2021 of over a thousand adults in the u.s about their attitudes towards sun protection good news 82 percent of the adults surveyed said that sun protection was more important to them now than it was five years ago so that more aware of the need and the importance of protecting their skin from the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation i always see comments in my videos like oh if i had only known this when i was in my 20s or 30s back then we didn ourselves with baby oil and try and get burnt to a crisp to try and get a tan all the stuff and now we consequences much later so that people have a better understanding now how important it is to protect themselves from the sun however this survey revealed that people are still getting a lot wrong interestingly though 62 percent of respondents rated their sun protection knowledge as excellent to good here getting a lot wrong about sun protection but they know it think they actually are 63 of adults surveyed reported getting a tan that is an increase of 9 up from 2020 and when you get a tan that is an indicator that you protecting your skin from the sun people have this idea still it belief that we need to break that getting a tan is healthy it know people think oh i didn tanned so i any amount of sunburn and any amount of suntan both are a form of skin injury basically when you get a burn or a tan that is a reflection that the skin cells have damaged dna and over time that accumulates leading to skin cancers the more times you get burnt the more times you tan throughout your lifetime that is accumulation of dna damage that can and does lead to skin cancers which are super duper common not only here in the us but worldwide 30 reported getting a sunburn that is an increase up from 25 in 2020 that is a huge jump this is a problem people know they be protecting themselves from the sun but perhaps they idea that sunscreen alone is not enough and this is a slippery slope people get overconfident in oh i sunscreen on and what happens is they stay out too long and the data is showing us that in this survey people are staying out long enough to get enough uv exposure that they more and they this is not good canning and sunburn equal skin injury by virtue of dna damage that cumulatively leads to skin cancer the more times you do this the more time you burn and tan the greater your risk of skin cancer so this is what we protective behaviors and wearing sunscreen while it can protect from a burn if you put it on and you overconfident with your application and you stay out too long or you don reapply and you get a burn you getting more uv 67 of adults surveyed reported the belief that spf 30 offers twice the protection from the song as spf 15 false the spf number tells you how good a sunscreen is at protecting you from uvb and a higher spf doesn protection so spf 15 will block out 93 of uvb rays from the sun and an spf 30 will block out 97 of uvb rays from the sun if and this is a big if you apply enough sunscreen you have to apply two milligrams of sunscreen per centimeter squared of surface area and i know you basically a really thick layer yeah you need to be applying two milligrams of sunscreen per centimeter squared of surface area of sun exposed skin that is a pretty thick layer and the studies show that people just don of it so what happens is because people are putting on too scanty and a layer the layers too thin and or they skip areas they end up with an a much lower spf than what is on the label for example an spf 15 sunscreen in real world use it ends up being something at most closer to an spf 5 or 4 which is really not enough in order for sunscreen to work you have to apply enough of it you have to apply it to all sun exposed areas you know people frequently skip areas like their ears or their back or their scalp and you have to apply a sufficient quantity of it and you need to reapply it sunscreen rubs off and so by reapplying it helps to touch it up where it address the fact that initially you likely under applied it so how much do you need you need one ounce which is roughly a shot glass to cover the body as far as for the face alone it always tell people to apply a couple of layers so a quarter of a teaspoon applied twice that half a teaspoon that tends to be about right you also want a quarter of a teaspoon for the neck applied twice another half teaspoon ultimately that ends up being a teaspoon amount 65 percent of respondents said they rarely remember to reapply i understand it tough to reapply sunscreen and i often get this question do we need to reapply why do we need to reapply the reason you need to reapply sunscreen throughout the day is because first of all some of it rubs off and second of all you likely don to begin with and by reapplying you deposit more sunscreen on the surface of the skin you adequate coverage that studies show that by reapplying people are get reach a point where they have a better overall spf on the on the surface of the skin now i understand that when you like do i need to be reapplying you know it outside the rule of thumb is reapply sunscreen every two hours while you outside and if you get in the water you definitely want to reapply sunscreen as soon as you get out i encourage you to use water resistant but even with water resistant sunscreen once you get out of the water you need to reapply sunscreen so just be aware of that that the sunscreen is going to be really helpful it protective package but there are there are limitations i want to i want to interject this point too people get super overwhelmed they they you guys this is your largest organ so there are a lot of things that you need to take into account here in order to protect it and keep it healthy for the long run so the sunscreen is a major piece of it you of it you have to be consistent with it higher spf might actually end up being better for you the studies show studies show that choosing as higher spf sunscreen while on paper it doesn difference in terms of its ability to block out those uvb rays i already told you 15 is 93 of uvb is blocked out and 30 is 97 once you start getting higher i mean we reality based on how people apply well then higher spf is better here thing that people are not clear on when it comes to uv rays from the sun and sunscreen spf is telling you how good the sunscreen is at protecting you against uvb rays from the sun that burn the skin but it tells you nothing about the other type of ultraviolet radiation that reaches your skin and leads to skin cancer and that is uva so in a sunscreen number it tells you about the ability of it to protect you from a burn but it doesn about the ability of a sunscreen to protect you from those uva rays and that with a deeper skin tone that tan easily they are not going to necessarily be under the impression that they need to be wearing sunscreen because all the messaging around sunscreen is about protecting you from a burn which doesn necessarily impact people with a deeper skin tone as much sure they can burn but it deepen in color and that again is a sign of skin injury upon sun exposure because it are labeled broad spectrum can protect from those uva rays so it important for people of all skin tones to protect their skin from the sun because those uva rays i mean that really really what is hitting people in a way that they that skin cancer so much so that when sunscreens first came out they really didn protected against those uva rays they just had ingredients to protect from the uvb rays the burning rays as a result it encouraged people to stay out longer than they ordinarily would because they weren still getting so much uva that the reason why we think that there may be a bit of a correlation between an increase in skin cancers with the advent of sunscreens is that early on sunscreens did not protect from those uva rays whereas now uh those at least that are labeled broad spectrum should be protecting you from those uva rays provided you apply the sunscreen correctly and enough of it here another thing people didn that 43 of respondents reported they were unaware of the fact that shade offers some protection against uv rays from the sun that sun protective messaging we always tell you to seek out shade because shaded structures can block uv rays as well now it type of shade structure if you to go sit under a tree that help but it as much as being under a roof some sun is going to come through the leaves and stuff but getting under a tree is you know gonna help protect you a little bit tree plus sunscreen is better than sunscreen alone a roofed porch plus sunscreen better than sunscreen alone better than sitting on the porch with no sunscreen why uv rays they through the sides and they be scattered up off of surfaces they reflective surfaces and hit you on all angles so you kind of have to think about that as well when you out shade it alone is definitely not enough you definitely can burn by being under an umbrella speaking of umbrella the ability of an umbrella to offer protection is going to depend on the fabric umbrellas are great but like sunscreen you don an umbrella because the uv rays are going to bounce off of reflective surfaces sand studies actually show that an umbrella alone is inadequate at protecting from a sunburn but it and com it combined with sunscreen those two together are better than doing either alone especially if you are outside at the beach where you where there that that definitely helps size obviously matters you know a little tiny umbrella is not going to offer as much coverage as a big umbrella the other thing to factor in when we how good shade is is proximity to other shade structures so a single tree is not going to offer as much sun protection as being in a forest full of trees those other neighboring trees they block out some additional uv and protect you even further than just a solitary tree all right so it percent of people realize now that sunscreen is important as opposed to five years ago where they had no clue that is fantastic but they and so just knowing that sun protection is important is not enough if you doing it right doing it wrong and being overconfident you actually might be putting yourself at even greater risk you may end up staying out too long because you confident in your sunscreen as a result you get too much uv exposure increase your risk for skin cancer and sun damage current estimates are that one in five americans will receive a skin cancer diagnosis sometime in their lifetime and if you my videos on risk factors for skin cancers i one skin cancer means you to make more down the road and this year it 780 new cases of the deadliest type of skin cancer melanoma will be diagnosed and uh 7 650 people will die from melanoma this year so it take serious there are multiple types of skin cancer triggered by uv rays and protecting your skin from the sun is imperative to reduce your risk of skin cancer sun protection also protects against accelerated skin aging people need to realize that biologic age does not always correlate to chronologic age you can be biologically much older than the number of candles on your birthday cake one way to push your biologic skin age well beyond your chronologic age the number of candles on your birthday kick is to get unprotected sun exposure it just a fact uv rays are well established to cause skin cancer they damage the dna in your skin cells they suppress the immune system in your skin impairing the ability to heal from damage that leads to skin cancers and prominent accelerated onset of skin aging in the form of wrinkles discoloration loss of elasticity impaired wound healing all right so in general the recommendations are when you are enjoying the outdoors seek shade avoid being outdoors as best you during the hours of 10 a.m and 2 p.m that sun are most intense and if you are going to be out then then be really mindful and definitely seek out shade either in the form of an umbrella or you know a porch a covered structure in my opinion public health measures should include providing shaded structures for people especially in parks and playgrounds where children play because the majority of sun damage that contributes to skin aging is acquired in early life and we can save ourselves a lot of money in the long run by minimizing skin cancers by protecting our children from unnecessary uv exposure by giving them shaded structures to play under wear sun protective clothing you know sunscreen is great but it protective clothing sleeves hats pants definitely wear sunglasses to protect your eyes and the skin around your eyes and i things to look out for in terms of clothing for sun protection talking about different fabrics you can always look for fabrics that are labeled upf to really ensure good protection basically just kind of boils down to the density and the weave and how the material is made to ideally block out 98 of uv rays but yeah um don on don will inevitably over expose yourself when choosing a sunscreen pick one that is labeled broad spectrum that tells you it will protect you against both the burning uvb rays as well as uva rays the ones that penetrate really deeply lead to skin cancer and wrinkles and all that kind of stuff and i recommend choosing a sunscreen that is at least spf 30 while technically on paper spf 15 should be more than adequate we know people don enough and so if you choose an spf 15 you end up somewhere closer to spf 3 that and ideally especially if you to be outside choose one that resistant it will hold up a little bit better with sweat not run into your eyes as much and is better when you are in the water if you sunscreen on ensure you at least have something protecting you while you are physically in the water again reapply when you get out people don this but when you are in the water whether the ocean or the pool or the lake or whatever that is often when you are getting sunburned because you cool in there you don your skin is burning the sunscreen rubs off comes off in the water you exposure so try and you know be mindful of how much time you physically in the water and get out and reapply or wear things like a rash guard you know they make swimsuits that have long sleeves these are all good ways to go further and protecting your largest organ let me know in the comments did you learn something from this video don protection you know it you are using it and reining in these other behaviors i hope this video was informative if you liked it give it

10 FACTS TO PREVENT SUNBURN ???? Dermatologist @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD36VRD0eBA	Dr Day	well hey guys it skin cancer awareness month get excited because in this video we dropping 10 fast facts about sunburn these are things that people either don get wrong and my hope is that by the end of this video you will be better informed so as to protect your skin from the damaging effects of uv rays that come from the sun and put you at risk for skin cancer sunburns prematurely age your skin and they put you at risk for a variety of skin cancers basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma and some types of the deadly skin cancer melanoma now if you are new here welcome my name is andrea i am a board certified dermatologist if you like skin care skin skincare product reviews if you want anti-aging tips then definitely subscribe hit the bell notification that informs you when my videos go live if you like shorter form content consider following me over on tick tock or instagram i on those platforms as well before diving into the 10 facts what exactly is a sunburn a sunburn is an inflammatory response to uv damaged skin cells in the outermost layer of the skin what happens is the body reacts with a lot of inflammation coming in blood vessels dilate that brings in redness warmth in some cases depending on how much sun exposure you got the sunburn can be so intense that the skin blisters comment below have you ever had a blistering sunburn miserable to have to cope with very very painful and uncomfortable fact number one anyone regardless of your ethnicity or skin type can develop a sunburn however sunburn is going to be more common in some people than others people who have pale skin are going to burn a lot more readily with unprotected sun exposure than people with very deep skin tones at the heart of whether or not you called melanin melanin is what gives the skin pigment and it helps to defend the skin against the insult of ultraviolet radiation melanin works by darkening the skin after uv exposure so people with deeper skin tones they don easily they whereas those with a paler skin type are more susceptible to burning and almost never tan but both a sunburn and a suntan regardless of your skin tone these are both outcomes that represent sun damage they are your body response to uv rays while people with deeper skin tones rarely if ever burn they may be at some point in their life put on medications that increase their chances of actually developing a burn fact number two you can burn despite wearing sunscreen the purpose of sunscreen is to protect you from a burn but it sometimes think oh i i burn they often think that the sunscreen was ineffective or didn to ensure that you don don one piece of a full sun protection package to minimize the risk of a sunburn it you have sunscreen on that you and then end up staying out in the sun too long and you get a burn if you watched any of my videos on why you need to reapply sunscreen you know that it rubs off and the protection wanes with time it comes off with sweat and if you happen to get in the water even if you sunscreen when you get out you need to reapply it because some of it have rubbed off and you that protection the best approach to protecting your skin from a sunburn is not only to wear a broad spectrum sunscreen to all sun exposed areas make sure you reapply it every two hours while you are out in the sun and also seek out shade in the form of umbrellas or a shade structure and limit midday sun exposure that are most intense take a look at the uv index to gauge your risk of a sunburn when going out unprotected the higher the uv index the faster your skin will burn when you are not protected but a lot of people mistake this to mean that when this uv index is low then they are not at any risk of sun damage and that is false just because the uv index is zero or very low doesn no uv it just means that the risk of a sunburn is not as great if you are going out without sunscreen even when the uv index is low risk from uv exposure is still there so you don necessarily burn to have damage from uv rays the uv index kind of gives you a gauge as to how quickly your sun your skin will burn if you go out without sunscreen on and that is going to vary a lot uv intensity varies a lot depending on your geographic location the time of the year and the time of the day and again during the midday hours that is most intense that a sunburn is greatest so really focus on limiting the amount of time that you are out in the sun during the time when the uv index is quite high because that is really when the rays are greatest fact number four did you know that you can get a sunburn on a cloudy day even when the sun is not obviously out uv rays are still touching your skin and you definitely can burn up to 80 percent of uv rays are going to penetrate through clouds to reach your skin to lead to sunburn and sun damage even if you easily you exposure on a cloudy day so that is why you need to protect your skin every single day wearing a broad spectrum sunscreen and a sun protective hat other measures fact number five light pink is still bad some people are under the impression that unless they get a bright red burn or their skin blisters then they they think a little bit of pink is safe and it redness is a clue of a lot of damage under the surface of the skin light pink redness is still bad likewise any type of tan on the skin isn of skin injury so if you lines it got too much uv exposure there a lot of damage brewing under the surface of the skin and that damage occurs in the form of not only dna damage to the skin cells but it lowers the immune system in the skin making it harder for your skin to fight off infections and to clear out damaged cells fact number six is that repeat sunburns over your lifetime cumulatively increase your risk of skin cancer the more times your skin burns the greater your risk of skin cancer becomes and this is because uv rays they damage the dna and your skin cells and they also interfere with something called tumor suppressors tumor suppressors are part of your biology that puts the brakes on tumor formation cancer formation uv rays mess that up uv rays also mess up and suppress the immune system so your immune system gets quieted down so much that it doesn inefficient at clearing it out further putting you at risk for for skin cancer and the more burns you have throughout your lifetime the greater your risk of skin cancer i ask you guys to comment below and if you have ever had a sunburn that blistered but here having one blistering sunburn in childhood or adolescence doubles your risk of melanoma sunburns at any age are not good and the more that you get throughout your lifetime the greater the risk of skin cancer but sunburns that you got in early childhood are most contributory to your lifetime risk of skin cancer so if you are the parent or a caregiver of a young child do everything possible to protect their skin from a sunburn you will save them in the long run not only from accelerated skin aging that they won appreciate until they also it will help in minimizing their risk of skin cancer so do whatever it takes to protect them from getting a sunburn that includes sunscreen as well as sun protective clothing shade structures being mindful of the time that they are out in the sun especially during the midday hours as i said the more sunburns that you have throughout your life the greater the risk of skin cancer but did you know that having five or more sunburns doubles your risk of melanoma so throughout your life if you doesn doesn faint pink as i said earlier that doubles your risk of melanoma which is a deadly type of skin cancer fact number nine there is no such thing as a base tan um hopefully people are getting away from this myth but for a while people were under the impression that they could go in a tanning bed before going on vacation and that that would protect them from sunburn it doesn increase your risk for skin cancer [Music] [Music] a tanning bed uses uva bulbs to tan the skin as well as destroy dna and your skin cells destroy the immune system and it uses very very strong doses much greater than even from the sun to tan the skin and it offers no sun protection a uva mediated tan from a tanning bed does not protect you from a sunburn so stop that thinking if you believe that getting a tan will protect you from the sun when you get a tan it means that your skin defenses are down ah they have been hit they have been sucker punched especially if that tan was derived from a tanning bed and fact number 10 you can easily burn when you are in the water in fact this is actually when a lot of people get a sunburn is when they are enjoying the water they in the ocean because uv rays penetrate through the water up to 40 of uv rays from the sun will hit your skin if you are even half a meter under water you would have to dive down two and a half meters inshore or four and a half meters offshore in order to be avoiding uv rays people are more likely to burn when they because their sunscreen rubs off and the water cools them down so they don realize that their skin is burning and they stay in the water unprotected much longer one study i think from new zealand actually showed that 69 percent of sunburns and kids actually happen while they were in the water it takes a couple of hours for a sunburn to manifest after exposure roughly about four hours so i think that represents a big disconnect in people what being in the water and getting a burn they will just assume that it came from being outside rather than necessarily the time they were in the water so when you swim whether it be in the ocean the pool the lake or whatever where water resistant sunscreen and make sure that you get out and reapply it and don getting out and reapplying it if you in the water for greater than 40 to 80 minutes then definitely get out and reapply this is why i rash guards they can also offer some sun protection while you are in the water as well so i highly encourage those all right you guys so those are 10 fast facts about sunburn it soon i hope this video was informative to you all so when it comes to protecting your skin from a sunburn a suntan or basically just the harmful effects of uv rays definitely wear a broad spectrum sunscreen make sure you reapply it every two hours while you are outside and if you engaging in water sports or it hot and humid you wear a water resistant sunscreen it just ensures that it stays on the skin a little bit better if you do enjoy water sports make sure that you reapply the sunscreen when you get out and don just rely on sunscreen alone this is a common pitfall make sure that you rain in sun protective clothing you seek out shade you don you exposure during midday when uv rays are strongest take a look at the uv index to kind of gauge that but don and overconfident if the uv index is super low it doesn it just means that you won quickly but remember you don burn in order for those uv rays to be damaging your skin i hope this video was helpful to you guys in the description box and on the end slate i put my recent video on five things that people commonly get wrong about sunscreen so definitely check that one out if you missed it i cover some more myths and things that people are just getting wrong frequently and putting yourself at greater risk for not only sunburn but skin cancer and accelerated skin aging if you like this video

NEW STUDY SHOWS EATING FISH LINKED TO MELANOMA ?? DERMATOLOGIST @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJCyxDs5pdQ	Dr Day	well hey guys in today going to be discussing a new diet study that came out in june that identified an association between a particular type of food and the deadly form of skin cancer melanoma but before we get into the video make sure you are subscribed to this channel if you like skincare content from a board-certified dermatologist hit that little bell icon because that is going to alert you when my videos go live also follow me over on tik-tok and instagram and very consistent on those platforms as well if you weren most common cancer worldwide it estimated that about 20 of americans will develop a skin cancer before their 70th birthday skin cancer is an umbrella term for a variety of different types of cancers but some of the most common skin cancers are basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma and then you got the deadly melanoma there are a variety of risk factors for skin cancer including having pale skin light colored eyes red hair having many moles having a lot of freckles and importantly sun exposure throughout your lifetime especially in early childhood the number of sunburns that you and any history of going to a tanning bed are also well established risk factors for skin cancer and then of course underlying medical conditions and certain medications can further increase your risk to a certain extent it is preventable through lifestyle modifications namely protecting your skin from the sun by wearing a broad spectrum sunscreen sun protective hats clothing being mindful of how long you are outside if you have multiple risk factors such as having numerous moles it skin checks i have a video all about doing a skin check at home so i to link that down below in the description box if a skin cancer is caught early it can be cured in many cases when it comes to cancer prevention diet is a hot topic issue people want to know are there certain foods that i should be avoiding to reduce my risk of certain types of cancer or are there foods that maybe can help reduce my risk of cancer that i should be incorporating more frequently as far as diet and melanoma a new study was published in june of this year in cancer causes and control that examined the association between fish consumption and melanoma this was a large prospective cohort study looking at close to half a million adults in the united states it the nih and aarp diet and health study americans aged 50 to 71 from a variety of states new jersey california florida pennsylvania north carolina as well as two metropolitan areas detroit and atlanta participants recorded their fish intake for 15 years participants were followed for a median of 15 and a half years during that time there were 5000 5034 malignant melanoma cases and there were 3 234 cases of melanoma in situ which is the early melanoma before it has really invaded and become more problematic this study tried to control for a variety of other risk factors alcohol consumption smoking history family history of cancer people were excluded if they had a history of cancer if they died during the study duration or if they relocated to another location the researchers really tried to control for sun exposure by taking into account geographic uv radiation as well as the individual were not able to properly control for cumulative sun exposure which we know is a major major risk factor for skin cancer including some types of melanoma and what this study identified is that individuals with the highest consumption of fish actually had an increased risk of malignant melanoma relative to those who had a lower total amount of fish consumption roughly a 20 percent increase in melanoma risk this was after adjusting for age sex family history alcohol consumption and smoking history and they saw a similar association between higher fish consumption and melanoma in situ which again is the very early thin melanomas what was really interesting though about this study is that fried fish was inversely associated with malignant melanoma it wasn significant inverse association meaning more fried fish consumption less melanoma but it was not to be expected fried fish like fish sticks that a health food but interestingly enough if you just take the data at face value which i don you might you know believe that eating fish sticks might protect you from melanoma at baseline at the time of enrollment people who had higher fish consumption tended to be male they tended to be younger again this is looking at ages 50 to 71. people you know closer to their 50s tended to be those with a higher fish consumption they tended to have a higher body mass index a higher level of physical activity and they also tended to drink more alcohol in general they had higher education and they also had a higher calorie consumption so given what this study showed does that mean that you should swear off fish i don should proceed with caution when interpreting studies like this because remember association does not equal causation the researchers speculated perhaps the association was related to the fact that fish can absorb toxins from the water like mercury dioxins polychlorinated biphenyls and it shown that consuming fish a high amount of fish can lead to an increased level in these in the human body however this study doesn look at any of those compounds the association was seen with tuna fish and other fish but it wasn so i don that deep frying your fish somehow removes it of these potentially harmful compounds so i think that reach there they collected that can really point you to that conclusion some fish are going to have higher amounts of mercury they sun exposure in the individual life based on their physical activity and where they live but that doesn into account what their sun exposure was like when they were 10 15 20. did they get a lot of sunburns in early childhood uh did they visit the tanning bed these things were not were not they were not able to capture they also didn established risk factors like um having red hair or the number of moles that you have or a history of going to the tanning bed the number of sunburns that they some other studies in the literature albeit small that actually suggest the opposite you can go into the medical literature and find a study that will support whatever you want but it important to look at everything and so there are actually some other studies albeit small in comparison to this that show the opposite for example there is a study that shows that inuit people have lower risk of melanoma and it to be related perhaps to their diet which is very high in fish there also was a hospital-based case control study in italy that showed again an inverse association between fish consumption and melanoma that could be because of the quality of the fish consumed in italy versus you know new jersey or north carolina where a lot of the participants came from there interest actually in consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids from the diet in terms of melanoma risk people have actually looked at this again the data is kind of all over the place but it the polyunsaturated fatty acid profile may actually be protective it or anything but all that to say the data at this point in terms of consuming fish and melanoma risk are seriously budding heads does eating more fish mean that you are eating less of other things there are other food groups that research suggests may be beneficial in protecting you against sun damage foods rich in lycopene like tomatoes watermelon foods rich in beta-carotene like sweet potatoes carrots red pepper drinking green tea which is rich in egcg may also have a protective role there even research suggesting that drinking my favorite beverage coffee may also likewise be protected because of the the flavonoids but perhaps people who eat a lot of fish their diet maybe lacks some of these other micronutrients that could have more of a protective effect it fish it eating less of and replacing with more fish in other words maybe it balanced diet not taking into account their sunburn history and the history of tanning bed use history of the number of moles i really think you know you really can conclusions here about the amount of fish consumption and melanoma risk it just again association does not prove causation eating a lot of fish may also be a marker of someone who spends a lot of time fishing and as a result gets a lot more sun exposure or maybe if you eat a lot of fish it developed a taste for it in your early childhood spending a lot of time outdoors at the beach in the sun this study also assumed that the habits at baseline remained fixed meaning the consumption of alcohol the smoking and the exercise but a lot can change in 15 and a half years that could influence the results that they start to appear in mid to late life and therefore i don age group and their eating habits is really going to appropriately capture foods that influence melanoma risk i think if you already have the stage set for developing a melanoma you can eat all the fish in the world i don it form a melanoma i i mean maybe maybe if you eat so much fish there much mercury that you you it pushes you over the edge for maybe a more invasive melanoma but i just find it i just find it a reach to say oh you had a little bit too much fish and that was the deciding factor so there definitely a lot more going on here that is not being captured by the study and they don fish prepared fish again if you consume a lot of fresh fish maybe it you spend a lot of time outdoors catching the fish and preparing it yourself or you live somewhere more coastal where you have access to fresh fish versus people who eat maybe more canned tuna as opposed to freshly caught tuna well they level of sun exposure the fact that the fried fish didn associated with melanoma also kind of hints at this so yeah at the end of the day do i think it or eliminate the amount of fish in your diet because of the study absolutely not i would make no recommendations based on this study whatsoever why am i making this video then i because this particular study popped up a lot in the news and news headlines can sort of be sensationalized putting it lightly and we have a lot of media put in front of our faces every single day it can be easy to react to headlines not have time to go in and you know read deeper you saw the headlines and you were wondering hmm should i stop eating fish this study doesn of recommendation let me know in the comments though if you came across this definitely always talk to your doctor before making any kind of lifestyle or diet change especially if it headline there scenes that is not always as clear-cut in a news article so hopefully this video was helpful to you guys on the endslate i uh nicotinamide and skin cancer prevention so definitely check that one out but if you like this give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don i [Music] you	Success
The Mind-Blowing Truth About Sunscreen	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRMsPpVwuJs	Dr Day	does sunscreen actually do anything or is it just another thing to separate you from your dollar well hey guys you know I tagline is sunscreen And subscribe a lot of you are sunscreen fans like myself but there are a lot of Skeptics out there and there misinformation online that might have you questioning should I even really be using sunscreen does it even do anything is it just a waste of time sunscreen is intended to protect your skin from the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation that comes from the Sun and these UV rays are known to cause various types of skin cancer sunscreen falls into two main categories organic commonly referred to as chemical sunscreens and inorganic commonly referred to as mineral sunscreens in chemistry organic just means compounds that have carbon in them so active ingredients in organic sunscreens contain carbon and the bonds between the carbon in these ingredients are what allow the active ingredients to absorb UV rays inorganic AKA mineral sunscreens they contain not compounds that have carbon in them but rather sheets of metal oxides zinc or Titanium with oxygen the way that these sheets of metal oxide protect you in inorganic sunscreens it similar to how organic sunscreens protect you they absorb UV ray to a certain extent they can reflect UV rays as well but primarily they absorb just like organic sunscreen now that you know how sunscreens work you heard someone say hey you should wear sunscreen it can protect you from getting skin cancer isn before we get into it though you have to understand that studying cancer any cancer including skin cancer is very difficult because cancer is what we call multifactorial meaning there one cause for cancer your genetics influence your risk where you live other things that you medical history I mean it complex thing to study lab-based experiments done in animals in the 80s and 90s so not on actual human skin showed that sunscreen can protect cells from the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation and can protect against the changes that lead to cancer when we talking about sunscreen protecting humans from skin cancer primarily we talking about three types of cancer melanoma there cancers which includes squamous cell carcinoma as well as basal cell carcinoma probably one of the most frequently cited studies when it comes to recommending sunscreen for the prevention of skin cancer is a large randomized controlled trial that was done in Australia and this was a really well conducted study it was done where there was an intervention group getting sunscreen every single day to the Head the neck the hands and the forearms for four and a half years versus a control group of people who were allowed to use sunscreen at their discretion but they actually followed the people in the study for well over 10 years and this study showed that there was a 40 decrease in the incidence of squamous assault carcinoma in the group using SPF 15 sunscreen and daily as opposed to those who are using it at their own discretion this study showed that SPF 15 applied daily to these sites did not reduce the risk of basal cell carcinoma however now baseball cell carcinoma is a very very very slow growing skin cancer so that may explain this observation because it takes a very long time to appear so it adults in the study that the sunscreen intervention was too little too late to prevent basal cell carcinoma that was already likely Brewing under the surface in the study the group that had to use SPF 15 sunscreen daily they had a slightly reduced risk of sunburn but overall there weren in throughout the study this study was pretty good too in that they assessed compliance with the sunscreen they actually weighed the bottles to make sure that the sunscreen was being used what about melanoma well in this study 15 years after the completion of the study they looked at melanoma and there was a decrease in the risk of invasive melanomas in the group who was using SPF 15 daily overall there weren invasive melanomas at all detected in this study this graph looks at the occurrence of first melanomas after the four and a half year intervention at different body sites yellow line is the group that had discretionary sunscreen use and the blue line is the group that had daily SPF 15 sunscreen to the head neck arms and hands you can see there a decrease in the percent of new melanomas there was also a decrease in melanoma melanomas in this group at sites where they were not told to put sunscreen when they asked them however about their sunscreen use about 25 percent said yeah I actually did apply the sunscreen to the trunk and the leg when they assessed compliance in the control group 38 percent said they did not apply sunscreen remember they allowed to put sunscreen on as as they like and 38 did not so it looks like in this study there melanomas and there decrease in invasive melanomas though by and large there weren invasive melanomas and I also want to point out that there between the two groups in terms of their outdoor Exposure One group isn other so that another Australian study that randomized individuals to use sunscreen daily or a cream that had no sunscreen in it so a control in the summer months and that study show that the sunscreen group had a decrease in the number of actinic keratoses actinic keratoses are precursors to squamous cell carcinoma they can turn into squamous cell carcinoma but another big risk for developing skin cancer is if you have a suppressed immune system because your immune system is vital for clearing out the cells that get damaged by UV rays so when you are immunosuppressed you a lot you cancers people especially who have had an organ transplant so there that looked at organ transplant patients who wore SPF 50 sunscreen over 24 months so two years this study showed that in that group which is a high risk group for skin cancer the SPF 50 sunscreen did in fact reduce their risk of actinic keratoses and squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma to a lesser extent so it can protect against skin cancer and namely squamous cell carcinoma and its precursor actinic keratoses randomized controlled trials do show protection against melanoma the deadly form of skin cancer but there are actually a lot of different types of melanoma some of which have nothing to do with the sun it may reduce your risk of certain types of melanoma but not all of them one thing you claiming that because there using sunscreen it skin cancer and causing the skin cancer rates to go up and that is completely false the research that we have shares the opposite that sunscreen protects against UV damage to the skin cells that leads to skin cancer so why are skin cancer rates going up then if you know we first of all we have gotten better at detecting them early detection when it comes to skin cancer is key the sooner it other reason on skin cancer is increasing is that people are living longer like I said earlier these skin cancers namely basal cell in particular are very very slow growing so the longer you live the more likely you are to to develop a skin cancer or living longer so we have more time to make these skin cancers there thought that sunscreen may actually negatively impact people around the sun because it sort of makes them feel as though they they have a shield of armor which it is not the recommendation is to never rely on sunscreen alone to protect your skin from the Sun but especially historically people you know I were under the impression that oh I put sunscreen on so I can stay out longer and as a result they probably got too much sun exposure sunscreen is not going to protect you a hundred percent so staying out too long is definitely going to lead to Too Much UV exposure that can put you up you know increase your risk for skin cancer that and the fact that sunscreen needs to be reapplied it rubs off people may not have been the best about that and it also very important to know that when it comes to you ultraviolet radiation and harm to the skin there are two types of ultraviolet radiation that come from the Sun there responsible for a sunburn and then there really deeply and destroys your collagen that skin aging but it also plays a huge role in skin cancer and older sunscreens did not come completely protect against those UVA rays so people were applying sunscreens that were mostly just UVB protection so they allowed them to stay out in the sun longer without burning but they were still getting a ton of that deadly UVA radiation into the skin so that you know that we now have better sunscreens that offer what is called broad spectrum protection protection so that look for as a side note when you choosing sunscreen huge huge huge driver though for the increase in skin cancers especially in women unfortunately is the tanning bed usage tanning beds they deliver a really really high dose of those UVA arrays so going to the tanning bed even once can drastically increase your risk of skin cancer and of course premature aging which brings me to my next point the role for sunscreen and protecting you against sun damage and premature aging probably one of the most extreme forms of sun damage that we can you know many of us have had at one point in our lives is going to be a Sunburn and you know that sunscreen is marketed and sold as an over-the-counter medication for here in the U.S is for protecting against a sunburn which is a extreme form of sun damage but sun damage and premature skin aging you know our society looks at you know measures to protect against premature skin aging they view that as a vanity thing as a cosmetic thing but it know it protects you from the outside world it thermoregulation and you prevent skin aging completely and you know it doesn on that but you want to care for your skin you want to keep it healthy into your older adult years because excessive premature skin aging puts you at risk later on in life for skin problems infections poor healing and that can seriously have a negative impact on your quality of life your health sun damage happens in all skin types all skin types all skin tones need to protect their skin from sun damage and from sunburn all skin tones can get a sunburn specifically there looking at Daily application of SPF 15 or SPF 29 sunscreen daily versus intermittently and they showed individuals who applied sunscreen daily overall there was a significant reduction in sun damage compared to the group that applied it intermittently so you know a lot of people are like do I really need to apply it every day research suggests that applying it daily has a more noticeable effect in terms of improving and reducing and protecting against sun damage 24 lost skin Aging in the daily use group another study showed that daily application of an SPF 30 moisturizer reversed some of the signs of premature skin aging like model hyperpigmentation and this has also been shown in people who have deeper skin tone like I said sun damage happens in all skin tones all skin tones can have Sunburn and all you know excessive sun exposure leads to premature skin aging and also on all skin types and it just a vanity thing it the Australian study that I mentioned earlier the study showed that daily sunscreen used over the four and a half year period led to an arrest in accumulation of of sun damage in the Skin So premature skin aging what about skin of color what people who have deeper skin tones who don burn that easily are they protected do they need to be wearing sunscreen don they naturally have sunscreen built into their skin people who have a deeper skin tone skin of color they have more of the pigment melanin In Their Skin and it is more protective than the pigment in paler skin types the thing is that that pigment it the burning Rays mostly UVB that people with that type of skin they don burn as easily but that doesn that they the Sun that penetrates really deeply into the skin and and causes premature skin aging and all skin types do burn there there is a threshold of exposure where you will get a burn even if you do have a deeper skin type all skin types will sustain sun damage it just looks different in different skin types there are also a lot of skin conditions that predominantly affect people of deeper skin tones that are driven by UV exposure from the Sun and for which sun protection is helpful namely melasma boost inflammatory hyperpigmentation and excessive sun exposure is very inflammatory so if you have any underlying skin condition like acne eczema rosacea excessive sun exposure can aggravate those conditions in skin of color wearing sunscreen not only can prevent hyperpigmentation and deeper skin tones but it also can reverse existing signs of of sun damage as well as hyperpigmentation because if you think about it if you continue to get unprotected sun exposure it be very difficult for your skin to heal to repair to regenerate that sun damage that has led to that discoloration but what about wearing sunscreen to protect against skin cancer in people who have skin of color deeper skin they do get skin cancers at a much much lower rate than people with paler skin but they do get skin cancers all types of skin cancers but they do get them while they diagnosed at a later stage when they harder to treat and more advanced but the skin cancers that people who have deeper skin tones get they typically related to sun exposure they make melanomas that happen in areas where the sun doesn souls as a matter of fact you probably know Bob Marley passed away a melanoma on his foot even the non-melanoma skin cancers when they happen in p people who have skin of color they tend to be more so related to occurring in an area where there scar rather than necessarily being related to excessive sun exposure so while sunscreen use is very important for all skin types and all skin tones with proven benefit for all skin type and all skin tones the role for sunscreen in skin of color for protecting against skin cancer has not been demonstrated there are currently no randomized controlled trials clinical studies that show that that look for the role of sunscreen and protecting against skin cancer in non-white patients all of the sunscreen studies that we about looking at skin cancer they were all done in white patients so whether or not that deeper skin tones in terms of protecting against skin cancer we don answer to that I want to make that clear there of sunscreen use for reversing sun damage and helping with certain underlying skin conditions in people who have deeper skin tones but we don any research actually showing that sunscreen use and skin of color decreases skin cancer but all skin types and all skin tones can benefit from wearing sunscreen to protect against sun damage and premature skin aging which ultimately you know the longer you this planet you want to keep your skin as healthy as long as possible so in summary sunscreen Works to reduce the risk that you will get a sunburn and to reduce the risk of premature skin Aging in all skin types in all skin tones provided you do you do that you need to apply enough of it and you need to reapply it every two hours while you are Outdoors to all Sun exposed surfaces check out my video on how much sunscreen you need we go over it in detail there it important to to understand that sunscreen is not a shield of armor and you also need to rein in other Sun protective behaviors wearing a hat wearing sleeves seeking shade not staying out too long wearing your sunglasses to protect your eyes relying on sunscreen only and not using these other things and being mindful of your sun exposure actually could increase your risk of skin cancer because you would end up getting too much unprotected sun exposure because again sunscreen is not a shield of armor it clear from the research that wearing sunscreen can reduce the risk of developing what carcinoma and its precursor actinic keratoses in individuals who are at risk for making those which is going to be people who have a paler skin type who got a lot of sun exposure or people who are immunosuppressed like organ transplant patients more studies are needed to clarify the role of sunscreen for protecting against basal cell carcinoma and melanoma and we don any research to show that wearing sunscreen protects patients who have skin of color against skin cancers sunscreen is safe I know there are a lot of people who are worried about the safety of different sunscreen ingredients I do have a video talking about that so I down below in the description box and I also hear a lot of concerns from people about sunscreen and its role in you know potentially lowering individuals ability to make vitamin D in the skin recently I did a whole video on that and I to put it on the end slate so you can watch that one next but I hope this video was informative if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow bye [Music] thank you [Music]	Success
Merkel Cell SKIN CANCER EARLY SIGNS NOT TO MISS	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vRBwMPijc	Dr Day	well hey guys many of you probably have heard Jimmy Buffett sadly passed away from Merkel cell carcinoma and in today about Merkel cell carcinoma what the heck is this I questions please talk about the skin cancer Merkel cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer it is rare it as aggressive because it has a tendency to spread to other parts of your body and it also has a tendency to recur after treatment the Merkel cell is a special cell type in your skin and it responsible for light touch Merkel cell carcinoma arises within the specialized cell type in your skin now I have a whole playlist here on YouTube of all different types of skin cancers like basal cell carcinomas squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma Miracle cell carcinoma is very rare in comparison to these other skin cancers in the U.S about 3 000 new cases are diagnosed every year now while it records actually show that we more and more cases of Merkel cell carcinoma in recent years and there are a few reasons why this might be first of all Merkel cell carcinoma is a skin cancer that in the majority of cases occur in individuals over the age of 50. we have a larger population of adults over the age of 65 and that percentage of people is expected to increase in future years furthermore adults over the age of 65 are unlikely to have a history of protecting their skin from the Sun back in the day people were not habitually putting sunscreen on and they weren wear sunscreen and protect their skin from the Sun seeking shade and Sun protective clothing nearly everyone who gets Merkel cell carcinoma is an older adult at least over the age of 50 typically with hail skin while it is an aggressive skin cancer treatment advances in more recent years are helping patients with Merkle cell carcinoma live longer and importantly if Merkel cell carcinoma is caught early and diagnosed early it actually has a better prognosis overall meaning you have a a better outcome better chance of surviving if it is caught early but fortunately when it comes to skin cancers it our skin and we see it so what should you look out for in terms of Merkel cell carcinoma now it red maybe sometimes purplish bomb that for the most part happens on areas of the body that have seen a lot of sun exposure throughout your lifetime the majority of cases happen on the head and neck that might be your scalp it might be your ear your cheek your nose but your forearms the backs of your hands they too see a lot of sun exposure and we frequently see cases of Merkel cell carcinoma at those locations the skin lesion of Merkel cell carcinoma this bump that appears out of nowhere it often is mistaken for a pimple a cyst a sore and it typically painless for that reason a lot of patients don worried about it initially because they think oh it it really bothering me uh I see the doctor about it or people are just not able to get in to see a doctor that is definitely a common scenario unfortunately but if caught early that is when you have the best chance of a better outcome because it to have spread deeper the other Hallmark feature of Merkel cell carcinoma is that it tends to grow pretty quickly like all of a sudden you have this bump and over the next couple of months it gets noticeably bigger the vast majority of cases of Merkel cell carcinoma happen after the age of 50 with the majority of cases being in adults in their 70s and 80s however there are rare cases of Merkel cell carcinoma in young adults and children these cases oddly enough tend to happen on the Torso more so than the head and neck while Merkel cell carcinoma is a heck of a lot more common in people who have a paler skin type that tends to burn or Freckle easily it can occur in people who have skin of color who don is painless but but as it persists it can start to itch be a little uncomfortable sore it can also start to bleed ooze and ulcerate three things are thought to play a major role in Merkel cell carcinoma and they probably all come together to lead to this rare skin cancer the first is sunlight ultraviolet radiation from the sun is known to cause skin cancers it is a known carcinogen the way ultraviolet radiation causes skin cancers is that it damages the DNA in skin cells people who have a pale skin type and who have seldom ever Protected Their Skin from the Sun are a lot more susceptible to this damage every time you go out in the sun and you Sun those UV rays they hit the skin and they damage the DNA in your skin cells and your body has the ability to clear out that damage however over time the damage accumulates to the point where your body can no longer clear it out and what then starts to happen is that those cells start to change they start to acquire mutations that give them advantages and cause them to hang around and not be cleared out and over time those mutations tip them over to become a cancer cell and a cancer cell can grow in an unlimited fashion and can move around spread outside the boundaries of where cells are supposed to be and spread to other body sites and that is what can happen with Merkle cell carcinoma it ultraviolet radiation is playing a strong role in Merkel cell carcinoma similar to other skin cancers of other cell types in your skin in addition to the fact that the majority of cases of Merkel cell carcinoma happen on sun exposed sites where the skin was seldom ever protected from the Sun another clue that it just look at the areas of the world where we see the most cases of Merkle cell carcinoma in the United States specifically Hawaii has some of the most cases of Merkel cell carcinoma and they actually have the highest highest strength of UV exposure of any state in the U.S worldwide Australia has the most cases of Merkel cell carcinoma which should not come as a surprise to anyone because they have very strong ultraviolet radiation in Australia that they the highest rates of all types of skin cancers worldwide the other clue that ultraviolet radiation plays a role in Merkel cell carcinoma it comes from patients actually who have psoriasis who receive a treatment called puva puva stands for soreline plus UVA it special type of treatment using a controlled dose of ultraviolet radiation in combination with a photosensitizing agent to treat psoriasis to suppress that abnormal inflammatory response but people who have undergone this therapy with UVA which primarily in our day-to-day life is coming from the Sun that know sometimes we use it in a controlled fashion to treat skin diseases patients with psoriasis who have this treatment they have a hundred times greater risk of Merkel cell carcinoma now if you have psoriasis and you have received pubic therapy Don carcinoma is still very rare the second Factor playing a major role in one risk overall from Merkel cell carcinoma is the immune system a weakened immune system is a common theme amongst people who have Miracle cell carcinoma your immune system is responsible for preventing you from getting sick from preventing you from getting all sorts of diseases when your immune system becomes weak then you are a lot more susceptible to all types of diseases including many cancers especially skin cancers anything that weakens your immune system can increase your risk for all types of skin cancers as you get older your immune system starts to weaken that of normal aging so once you get over the age of 65 your immune system is no longer as robust at clearing out damage cell so you are even more vulnerable to again all types of skin cancers then some people take certain medications that suppress their immune system specifically people who have had an organ transplant they have to take medications that suppress their immune system so that their immune system doesn those medications put them at heightened risk for skin cancer so they have to undergo more regular skin exams from a board-certified dermatologist to screen for skin cancers they are an at-risk group for Merkel cell carcinoma as well as other skin cancers if you have an underlying medical condition that leaves your immune system weak that too can put you at risk for skin cancers including Merkel cell carcinoma for example patients who have HIV or Aids the third factor is a virus called the Merkel cell polyoma virus this was discovered in 2008 I was going to say recently but then it recent and it combination of UV rays is damaging the skin plus immunosuppression leads to changes in this virus that maybe activate certain things that trigger overall the formation of Merkel salt carcinoma roughly 60 to 80 percent of Americans have Merkel cell polyoma virus and for the most part it doesn any problems saw that we acquire it when we are young children by the age of five and for most people it does not cause any disease but it setting of prolonged unprotected sun exposure with all the UV ray damage Plus immunosuppression in your older adult years this virus and some people can change and be associated with this cancer interestingly enough though that you look at Merkel cell carcinoma in Australia there are Cancers that they removing their Merle cell carcinoma cancers that they people they to the same extent as we are here in the U.S regardless it immune system plays a vital role and newer therapies that help the immune system Target the cancer cells are where you know treatment is really going and has really helped these patients live longer with this cancer so it typically diagnosed on a skin exam your dermatologist also should be feeling lymph nodes that are close to the tumor to see if they are enlarged that might be a clue that you have some spread to neighboring lymph nodes your dermatologist is going to remove part of it or all of it and send it to the lab to be examined under a microscope by a pathologist and that is how the diagnosis is made if the pathologist says yes this is Merkel cell carcinoma you may also need to undergo some sort of evaluation of your lymph nodes either what lymph node biopsy or a fine needle aspiration to see if there is Miracle cell carcinoma that has spread there and it addition to that it may need some body Imaging like an MRI or a pet scan to look to see if the cancer has spread to other body sites now these things that I here these are not done as treatment but rather they are done as part of staging staging is a way to describe how extensive the cancer has spread the treatment path for mergle cell carcinoma depends a lot on not only the stage of cancer but also your background Health the size of the tumor many factors go into determining a treatment plan for patients with this cancer because in addition to it being one that can easily spread it risk of recurrence stage 0 and 3 likely will be treated with excision cutting it out the goal here is to cut out the tumor as well as a rim of a normal appearing skin around the tumor that may have little bits of tumor cells in it however depending on the size and the location of your tumor you may need to undergo a special type of skin surgery called Mohs surgery with Mohs surgery they go in and they take out sections of surrounding skin at a time and each each section that they take out they look out under the microscope to see if there still cancer cells there and the idea there being that they cancer cells but sparing you any uninvolved tissue however you may need to undergo surgery to remove the lymph nodes now again Merkel cell carcinoma is one that has a high recurrence risk after treatment to reduce that risk you may need additional therapy called adjuvant therapy and in the case of Merkel cell carcinoma it may be radiation therapy now for some people depending on their tumor size and their background health excision removal of the tumor may not actually be possible radiation therapy alone may actually be what some patients undergo what palliative therapy palliative therapy is not actually treating the cancer but rather treating the symptoms if someone is in really poor health and not a good candidate for surgery their tumor is very extensive this may be the root of treatment palliative and that may include radiation therapy or chemotherapy to shrink the tumor and alleviate painful symptoms when the cancer has spread elsewhere immunotherapy may be offered a villumab is a type of immunotherapy that basically you know it works to help your immune system attack these cancer cells better take on points from this video Merkle salt carcinoma is a rarer skin cancer but the number of these that we are diagnosing here in the U.S is actually increasing likely due to the increase in the Aging population Merkel cell carcinoma most often happens in a background of a lot of sun damage coupled with immunosuppression either related to your age background medical history medications you may be taking and the Merkel cell polyoma virus that many of us have in the body also plays a role it the Sun play a major role in Merkel cell carcinoma and unprotected sun exposure throughout your lifetime is a risk factor especially if you have a pale skin type that burns easily or freckles I say this all the time but protecting your skin from the Sun is one of the most proactive things that you can do to keep your skin healthy long term not just to prevent the signs of skin aging skin thinning discoloration but also to reduce your risk of skin cancers protecting your skin from the Sun involves wearing a broad spectrum sunscreen when you outdoors wearing sleeves hats sunglasses sun protective clothing seeking shade also stay away from the tanning beds that of UVA that DNA in your skin cells and put you at increased risk for all types of skin cancer and premature skin aging you know know it makes me so angry when I see people spreading misinformation online that the sun does not cause skin cancer it just makes me so angry that this is where we are at this point that social media is being used to mislead people on something so basic that we know and is so well established that the sun does cause skin cancer the sun damages DNA in your skin cells mutates those cells and causes skin cancers basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma all related to UV damage from the Sun you can enjoy the outdoors and derive the benefits of being outside while still protecting your skin from the Sun and yes your ancestors did get skin Cancers and they did die of skin cancers the first skin cancers have been described back to ancient Egypt but why are we seeing so many more skin cancers now than we ever did in the past because we are living longer a huge chunk of our population on is over the age of 65 and that chunk of the population is expected to grow that is a major reason why skin cancer is increasing like I said I have a whole playlist of signs of skin cancer not to miss I talk about all the different types of skin cancer as well as a video on how to do your own at-home soft skin check to look for new worrisome skin signs that could indicate an underlying skin cancer so check those videos out I can watch next but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share with your friends and

How To Tell If You Have Skin Cancer | Dermatologist Tips	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJZ0qy4tPLY	Dr Day	how to tell if you have skin cancer May is melanoma awareness month now melanoma is one type of skin cancer but there are many other types scamac cell basil cell Merkel cell which is a lot rarer and as a side note I have videos going in depth on all these different types of skin cancers and they can be found in my skin cancer playlist you definitely need to check that playlist out because I give a lot of life-saving tips if I say so myself with regards to how to check your skin at home signs of different types of skin cancers but how can you know if you are dealing with a skin cancer what are some signs what are some things that you should be looking out for in comparison to other types of cancer the good news with skin cancer is that well it easier to find because well you just have to look whereas some types of cancer that happen internally they hiding in there and there way to find them early on with skin cancer if it cases it can be removed and treated and that however if a skin cancer diagnosis is delayed the skin cancer can grow and as it grows it can put out little Roots depending on the type of cancer it can take over a larger area and in many cases it can turn into something that is a lot more stubborn to treat requires a more involved surgery to remove um or you know potentially depending on the subtype of cancer could become more potentially life-threatening say for a melanoma something you may not realize about skin cancer is that it can happen pretty much anywhere it can happen obviously you know maybe what comes to mind is Sun Exposed Skin because many types of skin cancer are related to cumulative sun damage um but really you can get a skin cancer in places where the sun doesn of your feet the genitals you can get skin cancer in your scalp your eyelids the lips your ears so you really have to be very comprehensive when looking out for a skin cancer skin cancer also can pop up in your nails your fingernails your toenails I suggest checking your skin at home on a monthly basis and this is especially helpful if you who has a lot of moles at Basel but honestly anyone can benefit from doing this now you want to be really comprehensive when examining your skin and doing self skin checks you want to look at every spot you want to make sure you part your hair and that you taking a careful look at your scalp you want to get a mirror and be able to examine your back you want to be able to examine the backs of your thighs check out my video on how to do a skin check at home because I go step by step outlining the process in a streamlined fashion for an efficient total atome skin check better yet get somebody else to help you out two sets of eyes are always better than one Speaking of which fun fact hairdressers are our biggest Ally in the skin cancer detection space because they detect many skin cancers in the scalp early on they bring them to the attention of their client and say hey I I think you should get that looked at skin cancers can happen at any age but they are more common the older you get risk factors for certain types of skin cancers include cumulative sun exposure throughout your lifetime if you sunbathing you got a lot of unprotected sun exposure that definitely is a risk factor also if you have ever used a tanning bed that certainly puts you at risk being a paler skin type having multiple moles having multiple moles that are atypical in appearance also having um light eyes red hair lots of freckles also people who have a weakened immune system who are immunosuppressed say for example you have had an organ transplant you have to take medications to suppress your immune system to prevent your body from rejecting your organ transplant well that is an at risk group for different types of skin cancers they need more intensive monitoring by a dermatologist skin cancers can also happen in areas where you have had a skin injury such as a chronic wound that hasn properly that is a potential site exposure to ionizing radiation is also a risk factor um say for example you were treated with ionizing radiation for a Cancer and well now the skin in that area is more at risk for developing skin cancers because the radiation does alter some of how your body surveys for cancer what does skin cancer look like well it can take on a variety of different appearances many things you might be under the impression are just like a pimple or a h skin tag could in fact be a skin cancer but as a general rule of thumb here are some tips a worrisome feature is a mole that starts to change in appearance now when it comes to moles that are dark in color if they start to change appearance you really want to look at them for the following features because these following features are suspicious for perhaps a melanoma they melanoma the a stands for asymmetry if you have a mole that all of a sudden becomes asymmetrical meaning you draw a line through the center of it and it not the same on either side that is potentially concerning the b stands for borders there are regular shaped Borders or or sort of blurred borders that would also be worrisome color is the C having multiple colors or a change in color all a sudden an area where it black or there be worrisome d stands for diameter anything that becomes larger than say the head of a pencil eraser roughly 6 mm in diameter that is something that may be worth paying more attention to because potentially could be signs of an evolving uh skin cancer speaking of evolving that is what the E stands for so basically something that has evolved to have these changes and is you know kind of becoming different as time goes on that is more worrisome so that moles that you have that might be changing or dark spots that may be changing in line with potentially worrisome for melanoma but another sign outside of the abcde Ugly Duckling sign basically if you stand back especially if you who has a lot of moles you stand back you look at yourself and yeah you a lot of moles but there looks different it stands out and maybe you never noticed it before um but it just looks unusual in comparison to your other moles it Duckling sign but there are also many non- melanoma skin cancers and truthfully these are actually a lot more common than melanoma they become increasingly more common as you get into your older years they can take on the appearance of of a dome shaped growth sometimes with an overlying dilated blood vessel or maybe you have this rough scaly patch or you may have this stubborn sore or ulcer that just does not seem to heal speaking of things that don cancer if you especially but really anyone if you get what you think is a pimple and it does not go away that is suspicious pimples while you can continue to get many pimples an individual pimple should go away on its own so that is worrisome something that looks like a ward could potentially be a skin cancer a rough scaly patch or a area of the skin where it looks almost like a scar or has a waxy appearance certain skin cancers can take on the appearance of a pink reddish growth that sort of dips in the center a sudden appearance of a brown or black streak in the nail is also a worrisome finding that you would want to bring to the attention of your healthc care provider a skin spot concerning for a skin cancer may have some symptoms associated with it it can itch it can bleed can have a pins and needles tingling sensation because sometimes little blood vessels Co throughout the skin cancer and that more prone to bleeding or little nerves are coursing through it and getting trapped and that and needle sensation or causes pain or itch or discomfort but by and large people who develop skin cancers um you feel otherwise healthy that is one of the tricky sneaky things is that a person who develops a skin cancer for the most part is you know going about their life healthy as a horse so to speak doing everything that they normally do normal appetite no fevers night sweats you know it like you know it critically ill or just not feeling yourself or feeling fatigued or unwell um that per se most people are are feeling well doing skin checks at home can really help you out because you can monitor your moles your spots and if something is changing again it it to your dermatologist early because if caught early the outcomes are much better how does a dermatologist diagnose skin cancer well they examine your skin um they look at the given skin spot of concern with something called a dermatoscope we can look for certain features but if it is something that is truly worrisome for a skin cancer a skin biopsy will be needed and that sounds really scary oh my gosh a biopsy a skin biopsy is not as scary as it sounds it involves just putting a little numbing medicine in the spot and removing the spot and depending on the size location stitching it up but uh it Dermatology visit so when you make an appointment with a dermatologist they examine your skin if they find something or the spot that you they biopsy right then and there so the biopsy is the skin spot that taken out the biopsy is put into a bottle with preservative in it and that is sent to a dermatopathologist so the dermatopathologist takes it and their lab technicians process it into um slices and they look at the tissue under the microscope and they look for cancer cells and if they find them they put that in their report um they also comment on the extent and and things of that nature they may in some cases take the biopsy and do some special laboratory tests on it special stains markers for cancers once all that information is comes together in a biopsy report then the dermatologist can go from there in a lot of cases the biopsy is the treatment is the cure they got it all out with the biopsy that you know especially if if caught early sometimes that that cases more treatment would be needed such as a another surgery to make sure to get it all out and in some cases depending on the location the size the type of uh skin cancer you may need to have a special type of skin skin cancer surgery um called Mo surgery Mo surgery basically is a surgical approach to removing um skin cancers where where you take little pieces piece by piece to make sure you get all of the cancer out but at the same time because you going in this step by-step fashion and you microscope at the time of removing it the the the surgeon is actually taking taking the skin cancer out piece by piece and taking it over the microscope and looking at it saying did we get it all no all right let some more all right did we get it all all right no let more well we got it all so that surgery works and the reason that it so helpful is it has the highest cure rate for different skin cancers and it tissue sparing meaning they have removed the least amount of skin from you possible to ensure getting all of the cancer out and when we areas on your face you can imagine that that not a whole lot of wiggle room speaking of which in some cases your um dermatologist U Mo surgeon will need to do a special type of repair to cover the area that they have cut out so that might involve a flap or a graft or something of that sort all of that is a bit above and beyond the scope of today are some general pointers on how to tell if you have a skin cancer in the description box I will link um some websites where you can look at images the reason I don video is that they are a bit graphic in nature and YouTube will remove the video if I include them so I will put them in the description box they are publicly available so you can go and look at them there also check out my skin cancer playlist where you can learn all about basil cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma you can learn about melanoma you can learn how to do a atome skin check you can also learn about how to prevent skin cancer and you can learn about how to get ready for your first dermatologist appointment so I have a lot of videos in there that I think will be helpful to you all and are relevant to bring up in this month of melanoma awareness all right guys I hope this video was helpful to you if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow bye [Music]	Success
Top Benefits Of Photodynamic Therapy	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENzQPLo4Hwc	Dr Day	there freezing there scooping punching excising lasering there is a laundry list of destructive treatment modalities at our disposal for tackling unwanted lumps bumps rejuvenating the surface of the skin and importantly for tackling those pesky skin Cancers and pre skin cancers today we therapy what it is it what it might expect with this treatment modality photodynamic therapy is highly useful for treating actinic keratosis which are a type of pre skin cancer those rough gritty pink bumps in areas where you exposure more common in people who have a paler skin type who have seen a lot of sun throughout their lifetime photodynamic therapy also is useful for treating sell carcinoma that is thin in the skin ooh I made a rhyme also basil cell carcinoma that is pretty thin in thickness outside of treating skin cancers photodynamic therapy can be a highly useful tool for getting rid of other unwanted issues like warts photodynamic therapy can even be employed to clear up acne it for Rejuvenation purposes all right now that you know what this is used to tackle what the heck is photodynamic therapy anyway photodynamic therapy involves employment a photosensitizing agent that localizes specifically an abnormal cells coupled with oxygen and light this results in a reaction that creates reactive oxygen species that damage and Destroy structures in the problematic precancer and cancerous cells essentially it is a way to selectively destroy skin cancer cells cells that are harboring wart virus to tackle acne this is a photochemical reaction you you outside of treating cancers it works to treat acne because the photosensitizing agent kind of localizes in the pyo sebaceous unit AKA within your pore and it kills off that pesky cutie bacterium acnes that is responsible for acne and also helps to put the sebaceous gland in check the photosensitizing agent can be delivered to the skin in a variety of ways just applied directly to the skin specifically just to the skin problem of concern like the skin cancer it can be given by mouth or it can be given through an IV the photosensitizing agent once administered concentrates in the cancer cells however only in the presence of a specific wavelength of light does the photochemical reaction ensue to damage those cancerous cells not all light is created equal you need light of a specific wavelength in order to trigger the photochemical reaction we have a variety of tools tools to deliver light of the wavelength of interest you can use a laser you also have LEDs light emitting diodes and third you can actually harness daylight to trigger the photochemical reaction what color of light is used blue light red light and near infrared so what might one expect with getting photodynamic therapy well when you go in your dermatologist will likely be prepping the skin problem of Interest in order to get any heaped up dead stuff off so that the so that in the case of applying it topically it has a better chance of localizing to those problematic cells they might scrape it they might use salicylic acid or Ura in advance to get that dead stuff really thin because as you guys know from my videos on salicylic acid and Ura it helps to exfoliate that dry rough stuff they might even take a needle and poke little holes in the skin bump of concern then the photosensitizing agent would be applied to the skin in the case of topical application after the photosensitizing agent is delivered you need to wait usually about 3 to 6 hours so that that photosensitizing reagent can concentrate in the cancerous cells in the case of a pr- skin cancer or a cancer or in the case of a ward really needs to get in there and concentrate then a laser or an LED some sort of light source is directed to to the lesion that has been treated with the photosensitizing agent in the case of the topical application depending on the light source this will take anywhere from 5 to 45 minutes in the case of daylight it the light source has been delivered then the treated area is usually covered to protect it from further light importantly this treatment makes the skin very sensitive if the photosensitizing reagent has been given by mouth or through an IV you to be photosensitive everywhere including your eyes but if it applied to the skin you photosensitive where it was applied in some cases your dermatologist might need to repeat this roughly 7 to 10 days later but what you might expect from this treatment is that once the photochemical reaction ensues it basically the equivalent of a sunburn rather than being triggered by ultraviolet radiation however it is triggered by the photochemical reaction of the photosensitizing agent Bloss visible L whether it be from an artificial Source or from the Sun but rather than Dam ding your healthy skin it damages the problematic skin side effects include burning stinging the area that is being treated might swell because there is this inflammation coming in to destroy and clear out those problematic cells the skin can crust over it can be very itchy as the skin starts to heal you have some peeling some flaking and you have to be careful because as the skin is peeling flaking and inflamed it lot more vulnerable to skin infection so you want to take measures to keep the area protected with physical coverings like a bandage for example if the inflammation is too exuberant there is a risk of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation this is more of a risk in people who have a deeper skin tone but it happen rarely you might experience temporary hair loss in the treated area this is because all of that inflammation has a bystandard effect on the hair follicles and they receiving words that it grow hair so you might experience temporary hair loss for example if you treat a skin cancer there a pre- skin cancer or a skin cancer or maybe you happen to have some other bump that your Derm wants to treat in the scalp you might have a patch of hair loss where you are receiving the treatment now keep in mind this is only temporary your hair will regrow once everything has calmed down and the treatment has been over for some time it takes time for hair to grow so you have to be patient hair loss is not a common side effect of photodynamic therapy but it is possible just in the treated area if you have this done it not as though you all over and again it the pros of getting photodynamic therapy specifically for treating pre- skin cancers known as actinic keratosis it also helps to clear out subclinical lesions meaning bumps that are lurking within the skin that haven popped up yet we can eyes but there is Sund damage and pre pre skin cancer is waiting to emerge and if you know that you end up having to follow up with your dermatologist for another check you get more of them and it of like chasing around when the next one is going to pop up a real advantage of photodynamic therapy through something known as field cancerization you targeting these subclinical lesions so you pop up down the road another advantage of photodynamic th Y is that people note kind of a Rejuvenation to their skin other pros of photodynamic therapy are that provided it and correctly there are really no longlasting side effects now I did mention it post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation you get a really exuberant response but that will clear up with time so long-term side effects are not common another Advantage specifically with regards to treating cancers is that if need be down the road you can have that treatment done again you can have photodynamic therapy as many times to a given spot as necessary this is in contrast to radiation therapy radiation therapy cannot be repeated multiple times because creates a problem in the skin when you receive too much photodynamic therapy is less invasive in contrast to cutting skin cancers out and it also doesn it time it less expensive in contrast to many other treatment modalities it in terms of it really targets problematic cells that photosensitizing agent goes to the problem cells not to the healthy cells and in contrast to excisions or even cryotherapy there usually no scarring the downsides of photodynamic therapy are that it really can only reach where light can reach because it requires light to cause that reaction so it appropriate for cancers that are really deep that have gotten into organs or that have spread elsewhere that have metastasized but for the most part in dermatology our skin cancers are at a part of the body of the skin where the light can access photodynamic therapy may not be appropriate for people with certain underlying blood disorders photodynamic therapy also unfortunately can make you sens to light for some time not permanently but for some time and specifically visible light so you going to need to take measures to protect your skin from the light especially if you an IV or orally then your body your eyes are going to remain sensitive your skin will remain sensitive but if you have the photosensitizing agent applied just locally to the skin you really only need to concern yourself with aggressively protecting that area you want to wear a hat long sleeves Sun protective clothing you to avoid spending time Outdoors you also going to want to stay away from the beach from the snow and from walking on light colored sidewalks because sun is reflected up off those surfaces onto the skin plus the beach you know you the sun beating down and reflecting up off the sand the water and so it more exposure of visible light not the ultraviolet radiation but visible light wearing sun screen is important because in the case of pre skin cancers wearing sunscreen can help cut down on the number of pr- skin cancer as you go on to form however sunscreen is intended to protect you from ultraviolet radiation so the photosensitivity that you going to experience will not be helped by wearing sunscreen sunscreens are not going to offer that protection now yes sunscreens that are tinted with iron oxides can offer some protection against Blue Light and the visible light wavelength also um certain newer sunscreen ingredients seem to offer some visible light protection but not enough to adequately protect or reliably protect I should say against the visible light that is going to aggravate your skin burn sting in this short-term period where you are more photosensitive you guys know I atome treatments with LEDs for hair loss acne for uh Rejuvenation improving collagen wrinkles skin smoothness reducing inflammation in the skin for example I often promote the eye Restore for hair restoration and the uh omnilux Contour mask for photo Rejuvenation or the omnilux clear mask for acne however if you have gotten photo dnamic therapy keep in mind you can the medication has made you very sensitive to the wavelengths that these put out and you will have burning in the areas you know these devices come with a warning not to use if you have received any kind of photosensitizing medication this would be a case for not using those devices discuss with your doctor when you could resume those devices in the future because it photos sensitivity So eventually you should be able to go back to using those at home devices but just keep that in mind all right guys that wanted to talk about with regards to photodynamic therapy it tool for treating pr- skin cancers skin cancers acne and variety of other inflammatory skin conditions lumps and bumps I really hope this video was helpful to you now if you are dealing with skin cancers I have a whole playlist of skin cancer information different treatment modalities different types of skin cancers even the rarer skin cancers like Merkel cell carcinoma so check that playlist out I will link it down below in the description I really hope this video was

8 SIGNS OF HIGH CORTISOL *SKIN & HAIR* @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFXin5bSXbs	Dr Day	well hey guys your skin might just be trying to tell you that your cortisol is too high in today be sharing with you eight signs of high cortisol cortisol is a hormone made by your adrenal glands it is essential and it affects pretty much every organ and tissue in your body cortisol regulates your metabolism how your body utilizes proteins fats and carbohydrates cortisol also plays a key role in controlling your blood sugar and your blood pressure it also is vital for how your body responds to stress cortisol lowers inflammation throughout the body and cortisol also is essential in how your body regulates its sleep wake cycle your body has several mechanisms in place to tightly control cortisol levels you see too much cortisol is not good too little cortisol is not good you want it right in the middle where it needs to be just right all a Goldilocks at either end of the spectrum either extreme too much or too little can be catastrophic and life-threatening in no particular order sign number one of cortisol excess is weight gain where weight gain is most notable is in the face fatty deposits in the midf face especially in the cheeks this is referred to as plethora or also sometimes referred to as Moon faes patients can also develop an increase in fatty deposits in the upper back giving the appearance of a hump sometimes is referred to as a buff buffalo hump although I that terminology fatty deposits can accumulate above the clavico given the appearance of a thickened and shortened neck one of the more striking findings in terms of how fatty deposits accumulate trunkal obesity putting on a lot of weight in the midsection whereas the arms and legs appear to be spared of this fat storing in rare cases roughly 8% patients can also develop fatty deposits behind the eyes sign number two is skin thinning especially on the elbows and knees taking on the appearance of wet cigarette paper very very fragile and prone to tears this is also commonly seen on the backs of the hands patients who have very high cortisol levels will frequently develop a lot of skin tearing and accumulation of bruising on the backs of the hands with high cortisol levels you have atrophy of both the epidermis the top part of the skin and the dermis the deeper part of the skin because the epiderm and dermis atrophy the skin becomes more Fragile the underlying blood vessels beneath the skin can become more apparent this may be obvious in the form of dilated blood vessels or teang ectasias another sign of skin fragility is that with peeling off of tape from the skin surface say an adhesive bandage you will easily get skin tearing sign number three is stretch marks the medical term for stretch marks is stria now stria occur because a the skin is a lot thinner as it relates to the atrophy of the dermis here and often times patients put on a lot of weight very suddenly especially in the midsection around the abdomen they also can develop stretch marks in the inner thighs the arms now in contrast to the stretch marks that are often seen with increased weight gain or with growth spurts or during pregnancy the stretch marks of high cortisol are much wider roughly a centimeter and they have this very striking purple bright red Hue this is in contrast to the pink to silverish appearance of stretch marks occurring with like pregnancy or growth spurts in addition to stretch marks in the abdomen these can be seen on the buttocks the thighs also they can develop stretch marks on the lower back and the breasts sign number four is acanthosis Niger cans now you from my video on skin signs of diabetes we talked about a canos of Niger in that video I also have a whole video dedicated to acanthosis Niger cans what the heck is this this is a type of velvety skin thickening velvety in appearance dark grayish Brown most often occurring on the neck but it can occur on the face often occurs under the arms it also can occur on the backs and the hands acanthosis nigricans it a type of change to the epidermis acanthosis nigricans is your Skin of telling you that there is a problem going on with your body respond to insulin otherwise known as insulin resistance that commonly seen in in diabetes and as I mentioned at the start of this video cortisol plays a vital role in regulating your blood glucose the acanthosis nigricans is your Skin of telling you hey the blood glucose is not quite going right there wrong with insulin going on here and the reason this happens is that your skin cells are actually responsive to insulin when the insulin level are high as it relates to insulin resistance that directly going to show up on your skin as a clue that there endocrinologic or Andor metabolic problem going on such as occurs with high cortisol levels number five is steroid acne yes you can develop very intense acne when your cortisol levels are too high but it from the acne that you may develop at any point in your life uh cortisol acne is is unique in its appearance in that it erupts all at once and the lesions of steroid acne all appear more or less the same that steroid acne can erupt not only on the face but the neck the upper chest the back and the upper arms as well it is not uncommon for patients in the hospital who develop High cortisol as it relates to a medication to also develop steroid acne steroid acne may actually be related to a little yeast that lives on every one pittosporum you see when the cortisol levels are too high and you have the suppression of the immune system of inflammation as a result well then your body starts responding to things that it otherwise had ignored in the past and one of those is that little yeast that is naturally present on everyone and a manifestation of that response is steroid acne sign number six you can have some significant changes in hair growth why might that be well as I pointed out at the beginning of the video the gland that makes cortisol is the adrenal gland but your adrenal glands also make androgens androgens are hormones that can influence hair growth contribute to hair thinning this is known as androgenetic alopecia androgenetic because it involves the hair follicles response to androgens but genetic because there is a genetic component to it and when the uh Androgen hormones are too high you can start to experience what hair loss basically the hair follicle responds to those elevated Androgen Levels by miniaturizing turning into a baby hair in women this is often seen as a widening of the central part in Men you might have a receding hairline although the presentation can be a bit mixed again some people have a genetic tendency towards androgenetic alopecia but in the setting of elevated cortisol the androgenetic alipa it is going to be very striking and it much more rapidly then it would as a result of your underlying genetic tendency towards androgenetic alopecia so much more drastic and onset in terms of the changes in hair growth and hair density in some cases women might develop what of terminal hairs in a male pattern this includes hair growth on the upper lip the sides of the face the upper chest around the ARA the abdomen and the upper thighs as a side note recently I did a whole video on acne in your 40s and we talked a lot about uh per menopausal and postmenopausal acne and skin changes how they relate to the Androgen hormones so definitely check that video out if you missed it heroism is certainly a potential finding you also can develop an increase in what Downy hair growth uh in the setting of high cortisol dowy almost Peach f it can happen on the face the body uh and those are just those little vellous hairs sign number seven of high cortisol is delayed wound healing why might that be well as I said at the beginning of the video cortisol lowers inflammation and you might think oh what a wonderful thing turns out inflammation is important to a certain extent just like cortisol you can have too much inflammation you can have too little inflammation inflammation is a vital part of the wound healing process when that inflammation is suppressed too much from uh high levels of cortisol well it results in slow wound healing so say you get a cut not only is that cut going to be more likely to heal with a bruise it for somebody with really high cortisol an not uncommon scenario might be you brush up against something say the edge of a table and because the skin is thinning it tears easily and that tear takes forever to heal and because of that it puts you at risk for scarring as well as skin infections speaking of skin infections my final skin sign of high cortisol is you infections with fungi or Yeast remember earlier I pointed out that yeast that naturally lives on everyone malesia or pittosporum however you want to name him now in the setting of high cortisol levels like I said your body starts to respond differently to that yeast and you start to develop skin conditions related to an overabundance of that that little yeast whether it be steroid acne which we talked about earlier which might be related to the yeast or whether it be a condition known as tenia Versa col aside from pitos there are also a variety of fungi that can infect the skin known as dermatophytes these cause things like foot fungus toenail fungus nail fungus you when your immune system is so weaken the inflammation the inflammatory responses are so depressed from high cortisol levels you become a lot more vulnerable to these likewise the yeast known as candada is a lot more comfortable on your skin and mucous membranes in the setting of high cortisol your immune system is basically not operating optimally to respond to that cada yeast you can get candidal yeast infections in and around the mouth thrush uh or pear which can result in angular chitis I have a whole video on that you also can get candidal skin infections in the skin folds like under the breast and you may develop candidal yeast infections in the vagina but what causes high cortisol levels in the first place you may have elevated levels of cortisol because you are taking in too much that might be related to a medication some patients are put on a class of medications known as glucocorticoids prazone meth pricone dexamethasone which can lead to high cortisol levels and the development of these symptoms that we today putting these medications on the skin something we use a lot in dermatology topical glucocorticoids we use them to treat a lot of different skin conditions and they can be very effective they differ in how strong they are and you actually can absorb these glucocorticoids from the skin depending on the string strength depending on the location depending on the nature of the skin and depending on how long you been using it and a consequence of that is you can develop these symptoms of high cortisol that we outlined in today of a board certified dermatologist prescribing you corticosteroids to treat a given skin condition this is very unlikely where you can run into this though is there have been reports of certain skin bleaching creams that people buy in the store that have undisclosed amounts of glucocorticoids corticosteroids and there are reports of people coming in presenting with these symptoms of high cortisol Cushing syndrome and it bleaching product that they purchased that had undisclosed glucocorticoids in it so that and you know we talked about medications that can impact this cause high cortisol but you also have to be wary of dietary supplements uh Believe It or Not uh certain dietary supplements have been found to have undisclosed glucocorticoids in them namely those marketed as adrenal support uh supplements some of them have been found to have undisclosed amounts of glucocorticoid and in patients present uh with the symptoms of of Cushing syndrome come to find out it to one of these dietary supplements now those are causes where the the the call is coming from outside of the house but the call can be coming from inside of the house um and by that I mean you might have a tumor that is leading to high cortisol there are a few different types of tumors that can cause high cortisol the first is a tumor that makes a lot of something called act which tells your body to make more cortisol these tumors most commonly are located in a part the brain called the pituitary or they can be a lung tumor uh there are other rarer forms of tumors like this but most commonly that they develop a tumor in your adrenal gland that just pumps out a lot of cortisol or you can develop a um overgrowth of adrenal gland tissue making overall more cortisol so those are some potential causes of very high cortisol levels but I hope this video was helpful to you all in outlining the signs of high cortisol now on the end slate I recent video for you guys on signs of hormone imbalance so check that one out next if you are at all interested in the skin signs of endocrinologic disorders but if you guys like this video give it a thumbs

10 SIGNS OF IRON DEFICIENCY NOT TO MISS // DERMATOLOGIST @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzm3NOj3Npc	Dr Day	well hey guys in today going to be going over 10 signs of low iron if you is Andrea I a board certified dermatologist and in this video we going to be going over how the skin hair and nails provide clues to iron deficiency the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide what is iron iron is a mineral that is naturally present in Foods in our diet it foods and of course is present in dietary supplements iron IR is essential for hemoglobin what the heck is hemoglobin it blood cells that is responsible for carrying oxygen from our lungs to different tissues throughout our body iron is also present in another protein myoglobin and is really important for muscle function and connective tissue Health it is vital to the health of our immune system to fighting off infections it plays a key role in how certain enzymes throughout the body do their thing and iron is is really important for epithelial structures like our skin the lining of our gut when people become iron deficient they become very lethargic they have poor exercise and work tolerance I mean just think about it your body is really just not able to transport oxygen to the tissues so that your body can function properly and in shoulder and iron deficiency can result in developmental delay and poor growth it also can cause cognitive and intellectual dysfunction when your body becomes low in iron you will crave it so much much it can lead you to eat things that are not food this is called paa and one type of Pica is called geoasia basically eating dirt another type of Pica is Pago fasia eating ice chips why might you become iron deficient we can think of causes of iron deficiency in three broad categories number one is increase in demand for iron number two is an increase in loss of iron from the body and number three is a decrease in intake or poor absorption of iron increase in demand for iron is typically seen in periods of your life where you have a need for growth like when you were an adolescent going through a growth spur in infants iron is vital for pregnancy because you are growing another human being and it demand when you are lactating category number two for iron deficiency is increase in loss of iron this can happen with childbirth you often lose quite a bit of blood and it can happen as a result of having a menstrual cycle and especially if your periods are heavy you can lose blood in your stool from your gastrointestinal tract maybe from a a bleeding ulcer and if you donate blood that is a risk factor for iron deficiency as a matter of fact 25 to 35% of people who regularly donate blood which is a good thing to do by the way I do encourage people to consider and look into doing that but 25 to 35% of those who do regularly donate blood will go on to become iron deficient category number three is a decrease in iron intake or poor iron absorption vegetarian vegan diets while you can get sufficient iron from those diets you have to be a lot more strategic uh or just poor diet overall not just vegan and vegetarian any chronic inflammatory bowel disease can lead to poor absorption of iron Crohn alterative colitis if you kind of surgery to your stomach or intestines like bypass surgery certain medications can impair the absorption of iron aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications can irritate the gastric lining and lead to poor absorption of iron in premenopausal women the most common cause of iron deficiency is going to be menstration and pregnancy now in men and postmenopausal women the most common cause of iron deficiency is going to be loss of blood from the gastrointestinal tract say from like an ulcer or something or it absorption so let hair and nail signs of iron deficiency number one is poer that basically means you will appear pale because your body starts to shun blood away from the skin to more vital organs as the oxygen carrying capacity of your blood decreases with that drop in Iron now for people with deeper skin tones poor is not going to be as obvious you have to look at the palms of the hands in order to appreciate Po in people with deeper skin tones people with deeper skin tones will at Baseline have pigment in the creases of their palms and the surrounding skin will be much paler there deficiency the pigment in the creases starts to fade and once the pigment in the creases Fades to a point where it matches the surrounding skin that actually roughly equivalent to having a hemoglobin level less than seven so that is a clue to anemia to to iron deficiency Anem right there just by looking at the Palms it it approximates even a lab value another way to check for poor is to look at the mucosal membranes they too can become pale that place to look especially in people with deeper skin tones oral mucosa can become pale and then the mucosa that lines it called the uh conjuntiva uh pull your lower lid down and look at the and look at the mucosa there it will become pale in the setting of iron deficiency number two is one of the most frequently searched skin issues I feel like on the internet and that is dark circles now this is not specific to iron deficiency and why it occurs it entirely well understood but it may be secondary to the fact that there is less circulation to the skin under the eyes making it look more pigmented or it could be that the face is pale and so the pigment that is naturally present under the eyes is more obvious now in many cases of iron deficiency anemia where you have dark under eye circles many people do report Improvement once their iron levels are restored to normal number three is angular kitis now I have a video talking all about this Condition it corner of the mouth with redness sometimes a little bit of swelling and one of the reasons why people with iron deficiency may be more vulnerable to this is because iron is so important for the health of the epithelial cells that there plus people with iron deficiency are more likely to have issues with candada yeast because they don know the amount of microorganisms well and candada yeast is naturally present in our mouth but with iron deficiency it can kind of take over a little bit especially in the corners of the mouth where the skin may be very weakened moving into the mouth number four is atrophic glossitis look at the tongue it and glossy and painful what happens here is that because of the iron deficiency you actually lose the taste bods and that the reason that happens is because iron is so important for those differentiating epithelial cells so without good iron levels those kind of become atrophied and you get a very smooth shin shiny tongue it was very painful you can hot foods or alcohol and so it uncomfortable fortunately you know that will resolve with iron replacement number five is itch you can have generalized itch all over the body or you can have localized itch for whatever reason people with iron deficiency are known to develop itch in the areas around the genitals and around the anus we don that seems to be a particularly vulnerable itchy area and people with iron deficiency it may be a presenting sign of an underlying cancer and Cancers often can present with generalized itch especially certain lymphomas Hotchkins Lymphoma is one of the classics to present with generalized itch and you know it may kind of tie in with iron deficiency just because you don mean you have cancer but uh that is a sign of you know that is a skin sign of Cancer number six dry skin remember back to my video on extreme dry skin we were talking a lot about that hereditary condition iosis vulgaris but in that video I mentioned you also can acquire extreme dry skin from certain underlying medical conditions iron deficiency might be one reason for extreme dry skin because you oxygen delivery to the skin to to to the tissues and iron is so important for the function of enzymes that control the differentiation of the epidermis so the Integrity of the skin basically and you dryness and that ties into itch as well whenever you have dry skin and an impaired skin barrier you to deal with itch as well and they kind of feed off of each other as you lose more water and become itchy you scratch that further disrupts the barrier worsening dry as it those two together uh can can be a clue to iron deficiency number seven is a nail finding that is interesting it called coo Nikia or spoon Nails the nail plates are very thin and the lateral edges ivert so that if you look at the nail it almost looks like a little spoon you could put a drop of water in there now this is something that young children have and it they often have it on their toenails and it goes away and in certain occupations you can develop this as just kind of a a result of handling of certain things but it is seen in iron deficiency as well overall the nails are more likely to be brittle in the setting of iron deficiency probably a combination of the fact that you have poor oxygen delivery to the nails you know those cells that are trying to divide to make the nail plate and you also have you know Iron is important for the enzymes that are involved in cellular division so you just have some weakening there as a result result of that number eight we kind of already touched on but I to broaden it a bit and that is just a tendency to develop skin infections we already talked about how you likely to get a yeast infection in the corners of your mouth angular chitis but that yeast can also cause skin problems yeast infections in the genital area under the breast anywhere we have skin on skin contact and bacterial skin infections namely staf cacus that bacteria that causes impetigo it also can get down into the hair follicles and cause um a boil people with iron deficiency can also develop a variety of fungal skin infections more likely to deal with like ringworm for example likely a combination of impaired immune system plus impaired skin barrier function just making for an overall more hospitable environment for the colonization of a variety of microorganisms and pathogens number nine is dra my brittle hair the hair is going to be more prone to breakage likely because of poor oxygen delivery nutrient delivery to the hair follicle for growing healthy shiny hair any nutritional deficiency the hair is going to be lackluster brittle and prone to breakage and last but not least is hair loss hair loss and iron deficiency they literature for a long time many times patients who come in with hair loss will check their IR iron levels and they will have low iron why this causes hair loss probably due to the fact that the hair matrix it actually make the hair it those are some of the most rapidly dividing cells in the human body iron is so important for cellular division for duplicating DNA and skin cells there an enzyme ribonucleotide reductase it is required for uh replicating our DNA and it needs iron to do that so it makes sense you know you cell divisions in the hair Matrix so you you can develop what basically the hair Cycles are like okay let many of us into the game and by into the game I mean antigen that phase of the hair cycle instead they they they go on the bench which is known as teen you get shedding and so you may have notice you know it other videos it hairs a day but with the telogen of fluvium I mean it coming out clogging your drain this can result and diffuse thinning but iron deficiency may also tie into androgenetic alopecia pattern hair loss that a lot of people deal with it may even uncover an underlying tendency towards androgenetic alopecia just because it puts a lot of stress on The Matrix the hair Matrix cells so yeah definitely low iron and iron deficiency is is associated with hair loss we don know the full picture as to why this happens and in many cases you know replacing the iron definitely improves the hair loss albeit slowly anyways you guys those are the 10 signs of iron deficiency I hope you all enjoyed this video on the ulate I video on the signs of B12 deficiency if you different nutritional deficiencies lead to skin hair and nail findings but if you like this give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen And subscribe I to you guys tomorrow bye [Music]	Success
WHAT DIABETES DOES TO YOUR SKIN // DERMATOLOGIST @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOOLPv0BSjg	Dr Day	well hey guys if you are new here i board-certified dermatologist and in this video i ways in which having diabetes can impact your skin diabetes is really common it is a group of disorders characterized by high blood sugar and disturbances and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism all right number one is acanthosis [\\xa0__\\xa0] cans this is a skin condition where you have dark velvety plaques on the sides of the neck under the armpits can happen over your knuckles and the sides of the face and it is a marker of insulin resistance which occurs in diabetes it can precede the onset of diabetes and it binding to receptors in the skin cells and a lot of people think that it either hyperpigmentation but it skin thickening and in some cases it can improve when the diabetes is under better control but for others it does persist topical treatments may help improve it but for the most part they really only minimize the appearance it still persists i have a video all about this condition so if you it i the description box if you want to learn more number two you can turn yellow it called keratinemia and it yellow orange discoloration of the skin it may be due to a deficiency and conversion of carotene to vitamin a leading to build up of this yellowish pigment in the skin and it may also be due to a combination of that plus the collagen in our skin gets changed by the high levels of sugar in the blood and that combination can lead to yellowing of the skin number three is a hallmark finding of diabetes and that is called diabetic dermopathy otherwise known as shin spots because it happens on the shins these little round oval sores that have a dark brown rim around them they are brought about after maybe you whack your shin they trauma but they persist due to poor healing which occurs in diabetes number four diabetic thick skin this is actually pretty common with long-standing diabetes it the elevation and blood glucose changing the collagen and the deeper layers of the skin it can cause swelling of the collagen and that can cause thickening and stiffness of the skin and what happens is the fingers lose the ability to straighten it starts with a pinky finger and then it begins to affect the fingers moving all the way to the thumb and that inability to straighten the fingers due to thickening of the skin is called the prayer sign because when you put your hands together you cannot put the palms together because the skin is so thickened and tightened number five is similarly related it is a condition called sclera edema basically thickening and diffuse redness on the back upper back and the neck and this has to do with swelling of the collagen in the deeper layers of the skin in that area it almost looks like you got a sunburn up there the skin is very thick now number six is not always due to diabetes but in the vast majority of cases of this condition it is associated with diabetes and that is this condition called necrobiosis lipoitica this starts out as little bumps on the shins that expand with time that can expand and then an ulcer can form now on the shins not only do you have poor circulation there because of the nature of the anatomy of the blood vessels but with diabetes you have even worse circulation so it poor healing this condition can be really hard to treat and can be a source of significant morbidity for patients because the skin does break down it can be treated with steroid injections and it also can be treated with aspirin pentoxyphylene now these medications and treatments they offer some benefit but in many cases the condition persists now i mentioned at the beginning of the video that diabetes is a disease in which there is a disruption in the metabolism of both carbohydrates and lipids diabetics tend to have high triglycerides that is a type of fat in the blood and one skin manifestation that can occur in diabetes is something called eruptive xanthomas these are the sudden onset of crops of firm yellow bumps that have a red rim this is a reflection of high triglycerides now unfortunately when the diabetes is treated and under better control this will remit now you can see eruptive xanthomas and patients taking medications that raise their triglycerides too high as an adverse effect so it but it certainly is something that we see in diabetics a fair amount as a result of elevation in triglyceride levels number eight remains a mystery and that is something called diabetic bullet bullet is a medical term for blisters the blisters most commonly affect the the hands and the feet they range in size anywhere from a few millimeters all the way to centimeters it blisters in diabetic patients may be a manifestation or secondary to the neuropathy that diabetics develop so neuropathy is basically nerve damage to the nerves in the skin the periphery can cause numbness and tingling in the hands and feet poor healing abnormalities and kind of sweating and one manifestation of that neuropathy may be these diabetic bully which are big blisters in diabetes you have damage to both the small and large blood vessels and blood vessels and circulation throughout the skin is key to skin health and when that is impaired you can actually have death of the skin dry gangrene most commonly affects the hands and the feet like the toes now because of the neuropathy diabetics have poor sensation in their fingers and toes the skin doesn blood vessel injury from their disease so that is a set up for the formation of ulcers on the fingers and toes sores that really can become infected and serve as an entry point for infectious microorganisms so definitely a source of morbidity to diabetics speaking of hands and feet oddly enough many diabetics develop redness over the hands and feet and this is thought to be due to abnormalities and how the blood vessels dilate there but they can have persistent redness the extremities often are very cool and sensate you know they don just due to poor circulation number 11 is actually going to be your nails so diabetics because they have poor circulation and neuropathy that ends up impacting the health of the nails and you get what dystrophy basically brittle thickened kind of crumbling nails that and cracking around the nail beds that unfortunately serves as a very hospitable environment for nail fungus so diabetics are prone to nail fungus number 12 is something called a perforating disorder it that have a rough what keratotic center and this is most often seen in diabetics with renal failure who are on dialysis why it happens we but uh it can be very itchy and more bumps come out with scratching and when you biopsy one of these bumps and look at it under the microscope the reason it disorder is because what is in the center that keratotic rough bump in the center of the bump if you look at it under the microscope it collagen and elastin that is getting extruded out to the surface of the skin from the deeper layers of the skin so it diabetics who have renal failure oftentimes on dialysis now i already talked to you guys about necrobiosis lipoitica how that happens on the shins most often and can ulcerate i talk to you guys about acryl gangrene on the hands and feet but another thing that is related to the neuropathy is the formation of ulcers that can happen on the lower legs but it can happen on the feet as well anywhere where you have chronic pressure the skin just breaks down and you have poor sensation there due to the neuropathy and that can be very very challenging to heal because again diabetics have very poor wound healing they often have to see a specialist to have these treated all right so diabetics they have poor healing poor circulation they get neuropathy and they have an impaired immune system and all of these things you know it leads to skin breakdown and makes them very very very prone to a wide variety of skin infections and one of the more common types of skin infections that diabetics get is candida it you know it causes yeast infections in women in the genital area it also can cause yeast infections of the genitalia in men uh it can cause a condition in the mouth on the corners of the mouth known as angular kelitis it can impact the tongue you can get a yeast infection of the tongue on the skin the nails it candidal paronychia now diabetics also can get a yeast infection in the web spaces between their fingers it interdigita blastomycetica eib it can cause little cracks in the skin allow for entry of other microorganisms put you at risk for you know a more severe type of infection but it circulation impaired immune and impaired immune system and an impaired skin barrier that really just makes diabetics quite prone to yeast infections number 15 another type of infection is going to be a bacterial skin infection and similarly to why diabetics are at risk for yeast infections they risk for a variety of bacterial infections staph bacteria that can cause impetigo it can cause folliculitis which is an infection of the hair follicle diabetics can get a type of skin infection called erythrosma this red painful rash due to a bacteria called carine bacterium pseudomonas is a bacteria that can infect the ear cause an ear infection but in diabetics because of their poor circulation their impaired immune system that bacteria can actually turn deadly in the ear it can get into the bone and actually get into the brain i mean it can be life-threatening number 16 is going to be fungal infections like ringworm toenail fungus foot fungus diabetics typically have typically have foot fungus or skin again it is it is a ripe for colonization of yeast bacteria and in this case what are called dermatophytes a type of skin fungus and last but not least number 17 being a diabetic you can have uh persistent facial redness you can have a red face it can also affect the neck and the upper chest this is called rubiosis not entirely sure why this happens but it is pretty common maybe due to you know the the microvascular disease that diabetics have fortunately it does typically improve when the diabetes is under better control all right you guys so those are 17 ways in which having diabetes can impact your skin you know diabetes it condition regardless of the type that you have it is pretty serious it can can and does impact pretty much every organ system as i your skin is a window to what is going on internally and you can see here how in the setting of diabetes with all of these underlying issues it really surfaces quite literally to the skin and there are a lot of clues going on to the patient severity of the disease the chronicity of it so if your doctor tells you that you have early diabetes or pre-diabetes insulin resistance please take it seriously i don realize the potential for severity with this condition because it you know these things they don can be the road that you if you don dietary and lifestyle changes can make a difference for sure if you get that diagnosis from your doctor like hey i worried you know your sugars are hot something called the hemoglobin a1c definitely take it seriously you know it things that can show up if this gets out of hand and it certainly can and i of some of the more common skin findings but we i already alluded to the neuropathy you can lose a limb that is not uncommon end-stage renal disease and diabetics having to be on dialysis um it wish this on anyone on and so if you if somebody had if your doctor has told you that they know elevated blood glucose signs of early diabetes definitely do whatever you can to bring in whatever lifestyle factors you can exercising changing up your diet and and try and try and you know be proactive about it because this is the last thing that you want all right you guys i hope this video was informative and helpful if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe i bye [Music] you	Success
TOP SIGNS OF VITAMIN B12 DEFICIENCY @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4IQaOQ735Y	Dr Day	well hey guys i dermatologist and in this video i going to share with you the signs of vitamin b12 deficiency vitamin b12 otherwise known as cobalamin is a water-soluble vitamin that is essential for neurologic function it for red blood cell formation and for dna synthesis it is a cofactor in a variety of different processes that are essential to keep your body healthy we get vitamin b12 from our diet for meat fish dairy fortified foods and supplements in order for vitamin b12 to be absorbed from our diet it first has to be liberated in the stomach and it also has to bind to something called intrinsic factor that is made by cells lining our stomach called parietal cells intrinsic factor plus b12 are later absorbed in the intestine now because b12 is crucial for the health of your nervous system should you become b12 deficient you actually can sustain permanent neurologic damage so it really important that b12 deficiency be caught early and treated immediately to prevent permanent neurologic damage one of the reasons i love dermatology so much is that your skin is a window to what is going on internally and there are a variety of findings that affect the skin hair nails and mucous membranes that clue us into b12 deficiency so we can catch it early who is at risk for b12 deficiency there autoimmune disease called pernicious anemia that results in lowering of intrinsic factor so those individuals can diet certain medications that affect the acidity of your stomach likewise can impair absorption of b12 metformin people who take it for greater than four months are at risk for b12 deficiency and then of course antacids people who have crohn ileal resection that intestines they to absorb b12 properly they folks who have a tapeworm believe it or not that does happen and can definitely impact b12 absorption and result in b12 deficiency there conditions in which you don properly alcoholics are of course at risk because as i videos on vitamins and minerals alcoholics as their disease advances they stop eating and just rely on consuming alcohol solely which has basically no nutritive value and they become deficient in a variety of vitamins and minerals including b12 vegans and vegetarians are at risk for b12 now vegetarians may be getting some b12 from dairy infants breast fat from vegan or vegetarian mothers also are at risk for b12 deficiency so you know if you follow those diets i follow a vegan diet it is critical at least for vegan diets for sure to supplement for b12 if you vegetarian you know you may be getting it from dairy definitely check with your health care provider to go over that what are the signs of b12 deficiency because b12 is so important for the formation of red blood cells you can develop an anemia and that poor energy and just you know kind of overall pale appearance you can also get a drop of other cells in your blood like the white blood cells that are important for fighting off infection the thrombocytes which are important for clotting so those are downstream manifestations of untreated b12 deficiency as it affects the um the blood system now as i mentioned at the beginning of the video you can develop some pretty severe neurologic deficits in the setting of b12 deficiency first you can lose your reflexes so you know when you go to the doctor and they whack on like your your elbow or your knee with that rubber mallet they your reflexes those can go away you can actually develop dementia severe cognitive impairment you can develop abnormalities in how you walk loss of peripheral sensation loss of vibratory sensation now you can develop a peripheral neuropathy b12 deficiency actually can lead to psychologic symptoms irritability poor mood and even psychosis i we look for as a clue for b12 deficiency we that deficiency is going to show up actually it can affect the tongue it referred to as a glossitis meaning inflammation of the tongue first you get these linear painful red patches that coalesce into diffuse atrophy of the tongue essentially what that looks like is a very smooth shiny red tongue because the taste buds start to atrophy and it presents with symptoms of pain it can obviously impact the taste you can lose sense of taste or have abnormalities in taste as the taste buds atrophy you can get an itchy burning tongue different little tingling sensations if the patient happens to wear dentures they may no longer be able to tolerate them due to mouth pain beyond the tongue you can have dry mouth as a whole and dry cracked painful lips outside of the mouth probably one of the more textbook skin findings of b12 deficiency it actually hyperpigmentation localized to the backs of the hands and the backs of the feet kind of over the knuckles and in some cases you can have more diffuse hyperpigmentation that hyperpigmentation can also affect the palms and appear in the creases on the palms uh as well hyperpigmentation can affect the nails too something called malana nikea now why this happens we sure it changes in something called glutathione and antioxidant in the skin coupled with increase in free radicals it leads to abnormal upregulation of pigment production giving rise to hyperpigmentation fortunately you know this is reversible when the b12 deficiency is identified when we talking about hair probably one of the more noteworthy findings is premature graying of the hair in the setting of b12 deficiency so that would be kind of you know a sudden grain in combination with some of these other things like the hyperpigmentation on the backs of the hands the tongue findings that i outlined that would definitely be a clue for perhaps a b12 deficiency going on fortunately the skin and mouth manifestations that i they are reversible when the b12 deficiency is treated but the neurologic symptoms they are not so that is why it is critical to identify the b12 deficiency immediately treat it correct it to prevent these severe neurologic um downstream effects so all these signs and symptoms of b12 deficiency that i outlined here they specific for b12 deficiency so how do you actually nail down the diagnosis well you can check a serum b12 level and serum b12 greater than 400 picograms per mil is considered normal anything less than that is going to make you worry about b12 deficiency now people who take in good b12 but can because they don factor well then we going down a pathway of checking different lab values and uh we to maybe check some antibodies to see if you know you have an autoimmune disease that kind of a more advanced workup of b12 deficiency and it can be treated by either intramuscular b12 or oral high dose oral supplementation but yeah you don lot of people take metformin a lot of people take uh you know what proton pump inhibitor or a h2 blocker like things like tagamet omeprazole these things can impact your ability to absorb b12 from food whether or not you need to take a b12 supplement you know if you you may need to if you depending on how much dairy you consume or fortified foods now if you um if you take one of these medications like metformin or proton pump inhibitor things that affect gastric acid then talk to your health care provider you know you may actually need to take a b12 supplement or if you have you know crohn are groups that you know that that where you need to have a conver you know you about supplementing anyways but if you consume animal based products meats fish then you know no there a reason to take b12 although you know it you know you mostly urinate it out but i will say as a dermatologist we do see acne breakouts in people taking unnecessarily high amounts of b12 so you know it without the potential for harm all right you guys those are the signs of b12 deficiency uh vitamin b12 is critical for your brain for your nervous system for your red blood cells and you know the skin and inside the mouth the hair the nails this can be clues that you have b12 deficiency but everything i outlined here as far as these presenting signs they you some discoloration on the backs of your hands don it and think that you have b12 deficiency um you know as long as you otherwise healthy you know take it for what it is hopefully knowing the risk factors for b12 deficiency is informative to you guys i hope this video is educational on the end slate i on the skin manifestations of vitamin c deficiency if that is of interest to you i will also link it in the description box along with my video on the signs of vitamin d deficiency the signs of zinc deficiency so check those out if that is of interest to you but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with

Signs Of Low Estrogen In Women: What Your Skin And Hair Are Trying To Tell You	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4b5KA_v9d4	Dr Day	signs of low estrogen in women in today about the characteristic skin changes of low estrogen or estrogen deficient skin how declining estrogen levels in women lead to skin hair and nail changes estrogen is a hormone it referred to as the female sex hormone however it plays a role in a variety of different functions throughout the body and both men and women have estrogens now in women of reproductive age the ovaries are the primary source of estrogen production however peripheral tissues like our skin also can produce estrogen via the action of an enzyme known as aromatase that actually converts Androgen hormones like testosterone to estrogen and this happens in both men and women menopause is defined as going a full year with no menstrual period due to failure of the ovary to produce estrogen and at that point moving forward the peripheral tissues are the main source of estrogen production in women women experience many changes with the onset of menopause and the decline in estrogen levels it plays a key role in a variety of functions and is really important for controlling and regulating many processes that happen in our skin it influences the biology of all different cells in our skin the keratinocytes that comprise the epidermis the fiber blasts that make collagen elastin tissue and the deeper layers of the skin when we think about skin aging a lot of the focus is around collagen production in the deeper layers of the skin however with age especially with menopause and the decline in estrogen in the skin you experience thinning of the epidermis that comprised of keratinocytes whose biology is very much influenced by estrogens down in the deeper layers of the skin of course there is less collagen production this is a contributing factor to the appearance of wrinkles it us to lose about 1% of collagen each year starting in our 20s the microscope that starts to become obvious around our 30s but for women there off with menopause due to loss of that estrogen signal for healthy collagen production these changes are going to be most striking in areas where you a lot of sun exposure because ultraviolet radiation from The Sun Also damages our collagen you also experience a decline in skin elasticity snap recoil the ability of the skin to recover from deformation if you take the skin on the back of your hand and you pinch it up and let it go with menopause it to take 3 to four times longer for that skin to return to normal here something people don estrogen is actually really important in wound healing healing from Cuts scrapes surgeries estrogen plays a vital role in All Phases of the wound healing process the inflammatory phase when the immune system comes in and cleans up the damage the proliferative phase where new healthy skin cells come in to fill in that wound and the remodeling phase where the skin is getting strong and being sort of built back together if you will from underneath estrogen is important for all three of these processes there is a slowing down and impairment in wound healing it is not as robust as it once was this is important because it means that you have to take extra care of any cuts and scrapes that you get you have to be mindful of how you care for wounds after a surgical procedure with the slowing down of wound healing and estrogen deficient skin it makes you more vulnerable to skin infections that further slow down the wound healing process not only is the skin thinner in the epidermis not only do you have a decline in the supportive framework of the dermis but you also have a decline in the ability to retain moisture within the skin leading to skin dryness this is due to a decline in production of hyaluronic acid a hygroscopic compound that helps hydrate the skin as well as a decline in production of glycosamino glycans and the components of the Skin Barrier so the skin becomes more vulnerable to transepidermal water loss leading to dryness this also renders the skin a lot more vulnerable to irritation as it allows better penetration of well irritating things into the skin estrogen actually has a cytoprotective effect against oxidative stress when you exposed to environmental aggressors this generates the production of reactive oxygen species that damage the DNA in our skin cells as well as damage protein lipids create an infl inflammatory Cascade no environmental aggressor illustrates this quite like ultraviolet radiation but of course we other things throughout our day like pollution infrared radiation that likewise generate ractive oxygen species in the skin so with that loss of the cyer protective effects against reactive oxygen species from estrogens it really important to be mindful of the fact that with menopause your skin is not able to handle the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation as robustly as it once was now of course everyone across all generations needs to be mindful of their sun exposure and protect their skin from ultraviolet radiation however with age our ability to recover from the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation declines and a big part of that in women is the estrogen deficient state of the skin and you lose that cytoprotective effect of estrogen against reactive oxygen species that damage collagen further not only exacerbating wrinkles but damaging the ability of our skin to recover the cellular damage to our DNA and also renders the epidermis a bit abnormal in its turnover processes leading to the buildup of dry rough skin texture some women actually experience acne breakouts with menopause this isn board but with a decline and estrogen you may have more Androgen signaling going on at the level of the oil gland leading to well acne breakouts acne can affect you at any age another way in which estrogen deficiency in the skin SK leads to a meaningful change is in its effects on vascularity the blood supply the blood flow the formation of new healthy blood vessels that declines as estrogen levels decline not only the formation of blood vessels but also their quality their integrity blood vessels are a lot more Fragile with age and with decline in collagen production and this is important because not only does it play a role in slower wound healing because you don optimal delivery of Healthy Growth factors to come in as part of the wound healing process but you also have fragile blood vessels that are leaky therefore you to bruising and this is obvious especially on the backs of the hands the backs of the hands are territory that sees a lot of ultraviolet radiation exposure throughout our lifetime so there because of that throw in estrogen deficiency and you have a situation where you may become more vulnerable to getting bruising on the back of your hands it is quite slow to heal along with these changes you might expect increased skin fragility estrogen plays a key role in the production of something called ezin which is necessary for good Junctions between the cells of our epidermis so the skin is a lot more fragile more vulnerable to tearing that skin fragility is at Baseline going to be more of an issue on certain locations compared to other like the backs of the hands for example something a lot of women knowe with menopause is they they notice that they all of the sudden have enlarged pores and here happens remember what I said about estrogen and how important it is for getting good collagen production because it signals to those fiberblast cells to make healthy collagen and a lot of that declines as estrogen levels drop well because you lose that supportive framework around the pore in the deeper layers of the skin what does it have to do but dilate making Poe size appear larger to the eye couple that with the fact that the epidermis is more vulnerable to to water loss to dryness well as the skin around the pore is drier there that pore is going to become even more obvious plus you may develop commonly abnormalities in skin cell turnover of the epidermis normal for that to happen with age and sun damage and decline in estrogen and so you get a buildup of kind of dry rough skin and that can contribute to blackhead formation clogging of those pores as the cells aligning the pore are just not turning over and maturing like they once did estrogen deficiency doesn the skin but also the hair growth cycle it experiencing thinning of the hair and they may have the onset of what as androgenetic alopecia or pattern hair loss now this can happen much earlier than menopause but it may be more of an issue as you go through menopause and thereafter because estrogen plays a key role in the hair growth cycle your hair may become not only thinner sparer you may see your scalp more readily but also the hair strands themselves are a lot more vulnerable to breakage they become brittle the texture of your hair may change speaking of brittle brittle nail syndrome this is characterized by those Ridges of the nail and a susceptibility to splitting of the nails a lot of this has to do with the decline in healthy collagen production for the nails as well as production of proteins from those keratin it cells the skin around the nail the nail folds are more vulnerable to dryness as well and that can impact the Integrity of the structures around the nail that help protect the nail Matrix the part of the nail that grows the nail plate all right so those are some of the main findings of estrogen deficient skin which is a normal thing with menopause the skin can be described as estrogen deficient so what can you do about this well you may choose to do nothing that women after talking to their doctor may choose to go on hormone replacement therapy hormone replacement therapy can reverse some of these changes such as the loss of collagen the wrinkles such as Skin dryness skin fragility skin elasticity can improve you may note an improvement in hair density and thickness and you may note that your nails are stronger and not brittle however hormone replacement therapy is not right for everyone so definitely something to discuss with your doctor your gy olist what about applying estrogen to the skin there is a small amount of research that supports the role of topical estrogen in reversing some of the changes that occur with estrogen deficiency in the skin such as Skin dryness fragility wrinkles topical estrogen for reversing these changes is not super well studied in terms of the long-term effects but it can reverse the fragility the dryness the crepiness it not going to be right for everyone this is another thing to perhaps talk with your gynecologist about I can if this is right for you but it is an option and many women do find a lot of benefit in using a topical estrogen cream or gel for example alternatively there are cosmical that are phytoestrogens these can be described as selective estrogen receptor modulators these come from botanic extracts they include ingredients like isoflavones genestin and there for Resveratrol there research on this specifically for estrogen deficient skin but what we do have is some evidence suggesting that it may help with improving skin hydration dryness skin fragility as well as wrinkles but we don studies comparing these ingredients to a placebo control cream so it to predict to what extent these things will reverse these changes now it important to point out at this point that hormone replacement therapy estrogen applied topically and phytoestrogen cosmical while they may help reverse some of the signs of estrogen deficient skin they will not change sun damage so keep that in mind for example if you have a lot of wrinkles and sun damage estrogen is not going to correct that that is damage that has occurred from ultraviolet radiation one of the other things I would advise anyone at any life stage but especially with estrogen deficient skin is to embrace regular moisturizing it you out tremendously and you already doing it if this is something you can be very uncomfortable but think of moisturizers as kind of a second skin they help reduce transepidermal water loss which is going to be more of an issue if you have estrogen deficient skin they help lubricate the skin surface reducing pressures on the skin that might lead to tearing they also help with moisture retention and ultimately that has a temporary Plumping effect smoothing out little fine lines and wrinkles moisturizers with Alpha hydroxy acids may help improve collagen production specifically 12% or higher lactic acids such as what is found in amlactin lotion talked about this in several videos such as my video on how to reverse crepy skin and my video on how to reverse skin thinning but this is a relatively inexpensive generally well tolerated lotion that you could apply to the skin that not only can help improve the thickness of the epidermis which declines with age and with menopause and with estrogen deficiency but also can tackle tackle the dermis and improve dermal thickness speaking of improving dermal thickness and epidermal thickness you also have topical retinoids like tretinoin Tartine tritin adapalene or you may elect to use a cosmotic active form of vitamin A like retinol o or retin alahh now I have lots of videos on my Channel about these ingredients definitely check them out but they can help you out in terms of some of the changes that happen with estrogen deficient skin now there are a variety ofor metic procedures out there that can help stimulate collagen production in the deeper layers of the skin certain laser treatments certain chemical peels and energy based devices at home there is low-level laser therapy with red and your infrared light these work to stimulate the fiberblast in the deeper layers of the skin to make new healthy collagen they also help to reduce some of that inflammation which is going to be a greater issue because again decline in estrogen less support in terms of cell protection from environmental aggressors and reactive oxygen species leading to more inflammation in the skin and red and near infrared phototherapy low-level laser therapy can mitigate that also can help improve circulation to the skin blood flow improving skin Radiance and helping with the issues of delivering Healthy Growth factors that decline as estrogen levels drop off but I cannot emphasize this enough while it protect your skin from the sun it really important in the setting of estrogen deficiency with mature skin because a lot of the defenses against ultraviolet radiation are not quite as robust as they once were like for example wound healing recovery also our ability to handle reactive oxygen species so protecting your skin from the Sun is super important especially if you do have a skin injury or you have undergone a surgery keep in mind that ultraviolet radiation slows down healing all right guys that talk about for today regards to the signs of estrogen deficiency in the skin I really hope this was informative to you on the ins slight I video on topical estrogen cream so make sure you check that one out next if you want to learn more about what it has been shown to be helpful for but if you guys like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don I [Music]	Success
SKIN SIGNS OF LOW THYROID LEVELS // DERMATOLOGIST @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIxReIjqVPA	Dr Day	well hey guys if you are new here I board certified dermatologist and in this video I the skin signs of low thyroid hormone otherwise known as hypothyroidism you guys know I love Dermatology so much because the skin the hair the nails they are a window to what is going on internally and there are many skin manifestations of hypothyroidism first of all what the heck is a thyroid anyway it gland that sits in the front of the neck and it makes hormones that are critical for how your body uses energy now when the thyroid hormone becomes low then your body kind of slows down in a variety of different ways why might someone have low thyroid hormone the most common cause of hypothyroidism is an autoimmune disease called Hashimoto thyroiditis in which you have an autoimmune attack on the body to make thyroid hormone properly you also can have inflammation in the thyroid that happen if you get sick you have a viral infection some people undergo surgery and have some or all of their thyroid removed and because of that they have to be on thyroid medication for the rest of their lives Others May receive radiation therapy to the thyroid that results in hypothyroidism certain medications can lead to low thyroid hormone namely lithium amiodarone carbom mopine and fenin you can even be born with hypothyroidism although that called congenital hypothyroidism now because iodine plays a pivotal role in synthesis of thyroid hormone diets that have too much iodine or too little iodine actually can result in hypothyroid hypothyroidism is actually really really common there is a good chance that you know somebody or even you yourself have dealt with this at some point in your life it pretty common the symptoms of low thyroid are Insidious meaning they gradually accumulate over time to be problematic initially they include things like low energy fatigue it can impact your mood cause depression and other psychiatric symptoms it certainly can impact your weight and lead to weight gain cold intolerance weakness and inability to concentrate now as we get older our risk of low thyroid increases but unfortunately these symptoms sometimes they they get misdiagnosed as just being related to getting older or you know dealing with adult life issues oh you that time of course you know three kids and blah blah blah low thyroid hormone also can be misdiagnosed as a psychiatric illness depression for example people have been known to be put on anti-depressants when in reality they have thyroid disease so what are the skin clues for low thyroid the skin becomes cold pale and dry when you have low thyroid hormone your core body temperature lowers and in an effort to preserve that the compensatory mechanism is for the blood vessels in your extremity to clamp down to hold on to heat to keep the core part of the body warm and because of that you have cooling of the extremities the arms the legs you have cold hands and feet the dry skin with thyroid disease can be pretty intense recently I did a video on extreme dry skin otherwise known as iosis vulgaris and in that video I pointed out that that condition can be acquired secondary to an underlying medical cause and hypothyroidism is a medical cause of acquired eiosis vulgaris why well thyroid hormone plays a huge role in the output of sweat the output of oil and the synthesis of fats in the top layer of the skin the epidermis so thyroid hormones really important for Skin Barrier function overall and for lubricating the skin with oils and that dryness is most profound on the extremities the legs the arms a lot of you guys I know deal with dry High cracked heels hypothyroidism can definitely be a cause of that it called acquired palmoplantar cermat can affect the palms and the soles of the feet it underlying thyroid issue may be at play recently I did a video on what diabetes does to the skin and in that video I pointed out that it can cause a diffuse yellowing of the skin called kermia that also can happen in hypothyroidism why that occurs we don really know but it palms and Soles especially if you have a deeper skin tone it obvious on the rest of your skin but if you look very carefully at the Palms and soles they have yellowing and that is thought to be due to abnormalities and the metabolism of kerene from the diet one thing people don that dermatologists not only are we specialist when it comes to diagnosing issues of the skin but also issues of the nails and the hair hypothyroidism definitely can impact your hair because thyroid hormone plays a key role in the hair cycle and people who have hypothyroidism they develop diffuse thinning of the hair because their hair cycle is kind of all screwed up as a result of low thyroid hormone they also can develop what effluvium a lot of hair shedding and the hair itself becomes very coarse and brittle and prone to breakage and this can affect not only the hair on your scalp but the rest of your body one key finding that you can often pick up on in people who have hypothyroidism is that the lateral third the outer third of their eyebrow becomes thin now there are other conditions that can cause thinning of the eyebrows I have a video by the way on thinning eyebrows so check that out if it with it that is another clue and it the hair cycle being shifted around and affected from lack of thyroid hormone with hypothyroidism the Nails also grow really really slowly they brittle if the hypothyroidism continues untreated you can get an increase in something called mucco polysaccharides things like hyaluronic acid the ground substance in the deeper layers of our skin you know we pay to have hyaluronic acid injected into their lips to look fuller but with hypothyroidism you can get an accumulation of that type of substance and it has a profound water binding ability and as a result people with hypothyroidism they develop a condition called mix edema due to accumulation of that ground substance the skin becomes swollen and almost has a waxy appearance as a result of accumulation of this mucopolysaccharides and increased water binding capacity in the deeper layers of the skin and it can actually change your face it can cause broadening of the nose the lips become very swollen you get puffy eyelids and the tongue becomes noticeably enlarged mucco polysaccharide accumulation it doesn the skin though it can occur throughout the body including around the heart around the vocal cords and a presenting symptom is deepening of your voice as a result of the accumulation of that mucopolysaccharide the skin looks very pale in hypothyroidism because basically the accumulation of uh ground substance mucopolysaccharides in the deeper layers of the skin with all that water binding ability down there and all that increased water content it it changes how light is reflected off the skin and it looks a lot paler you also can get entrapment of the nerves in the wrist and you can get what tunnel syndrome numbness and tingling of the fingers and poor grip strength in the hands and that entament can also occur uh in the face you get facial droop referred to as a facial palsy you can also have abnormalities in the function of the muscles around the eyes you get a droopy eyelid in many cases people with hypothyroidism they to bruising probably related to uh a decrease in production of clotting factors and the blood vessels the capillaries are much weaker those are the skin signs of hypothyroidism now they don talking about accumulation over time when untreated and these things will resolve when the thyroid hormone is replaced with the medication there also are some other skin diseases that are associated with hypothyroidism meaning if you have hypothyroidism especially autoimmune hypothyroidism you likely to have some of these other conditions the first one is alopecia Arata that is another autoimmune disease that attacks your hair and it presents with sudden loss of hair maybe in just a few patches you get all of a sudden a complete bold patch it can affect your eyebrows and it can affect your eyelashes it can affect hair on anywhere on your body so if you have hypothyroid you are at increased risk for for having alopecia Arata vice versa if you have alopecia Arata you are at an increased risk for having autoimmune thyroid disease Vitiligo another autoimmune condition this time it attacks the pigment producing cells in your skin leads to white patches with no pigment uh it can affect the skin and the hair as well and chronic hives chronic ticaria uh is also associated with the presence of anti-thyroid antibodies and in some cases treating the thyroid dis disase will result in resolution of those hives people with hypothyroidism also can develop a variety of different anemias anemia is basically when your uh blood is not optimally carrying oxygen around we with hypothyroidism is that you can develop an autoimmune uh attack on part of the uh stomach that makes something called intrinsic factor which is necessary for The Binding of B12 so you don that I did fairly recently on the skin signs of B12 deficiency remember autoimmune disease was one reason to be B12 deficient and for folks who have hypothyroidism they are at increased risk for what basically autoimmune anemia related to uh you know an inability to take a B12 properly so those are the skin hair and nail manifestations of hypothyroidism it is a really common disease disase a lot of people deal with it and it can make life very difficult for people who are going through this as you can imagine poor energy weakness fatigue mood changes increased weight um poor exercise tolerance constipation people deal with as a result of hypothyroidism I mean a lot of symptoms and it really can be be quite devastating to cope with fortunately you know these these things I hypothyroidism they do resolve when the hypothyroidism is treated but that can take some time so it is really you know not a pleasant thing to have to deal with I think that you know people who deal with hypothyroidism often times they struggle to maintain their weight as you can imagine when your thyroid is low your metabolism slows down so you put on weight you don so you have really poor exercise tolerance as a result of the hypothyroidism and because of the increase in those mucco polysaccharides you actually have accumulation of water weight now when the thyroid disease is treated that can go away but it can take some time so I think this group of people is a vulnerable Target for the diet and well Wellness marketing of all sorts of gimmicky products you know to balance your hormones and for thyroid health and all of these things so you really have to be careful having hypothyroidism it can be very emotionally taxing just kind of feeling like your body you have no control over anything so hopefully this video outlined you you know the skin findings of hypothyroidism but also you know some of the other symptoms that can easily be dismissed um as you know just stress related to day-to-day adult life or you know just old age but in reality you know that is a very very treatable condition that if left untreated it can be deadly it can be quite deadly and take a tremendous toll on your health and your emotional health all right you guys so those are the skin signs of hypothyroidism I hope this was informative on the ins slate I to put my most recent video on what diabetes does to your skin and you know the skin signs of diabetes if you want to check that out but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always

9 Warning Signs Of Liver Damage NOT TO MISS	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD5_vafm-iY	Dr Day	nine warning signs of a damaged liver you do not want to miss your liver is a huge organ it in the body and it has so many jobs it produces bile it filters your blood it responsible for metabolism of proteins carbohydrates lipids and it detoxifies the body but it can be seriously damaged by well consumption of too much alcohol a liver toxin it also can be damaged secondary to underlying genetic or medical conditions such as certain autoimmune diseases and it can be damaged as an adverse side effect to certain medications or certain dietary herbal supplements can damage your liver and many people have what liver disease which ultimately can lead to scarring down damage of the liver otherwise known as therosis your skin is a window to what is going on internally and there are some fascinating warning signs of damaged liver that here on your skin as well as your nails and your hair when your liver becomes damaged things go arai in the realm of blood clotting estrogen metabolism and the blood vessels in your arms and legs they dilate you have kind of abnormal circulation all of the sudden through your arms your legs throughout your skin and one of the ways in which a damaged liver is going to show up as a result of these changes is you all of a sudden you have red Palms Palmer aemma is a proper terminology for this finding especially red on What called the theer Eminence and the finger pads this redness will blanch meaning when you touch it you press down on it with your finger or a glass Slide the redness goes away but as soon as you relieve that pressure it comes right back pulmer athema in liver disease is thought to be the result of again the abnormal circulation going on as well as increases in estrogen now to be clear palar athema is not specific for liver disease palar athema can also be seen in rheumatoid arthritis hyperthyroidism diabetes and it is a very common finding in pregnancy so if you are at home pregnant you look down at your hands they are red do not panic that actually very normal with pregnancy as a side not I actually have a video going into a deep dive on pmer athema all the other potential underlying medical conditions but it does often manifest in patients who have serious liver disease number two is something called spider angiomas again this is related to a combination of perhaps the abnormal circulation as well as an increase in estrogens remember your liver it responsible for hormone metabolism when you have a damaged liver estrogen becomes high and it can make all of a sudden these little abnormal blood vessels appear on the skin a very large uh vessel and then you have all these tiny little blood vessels radiating out from it you see that on the skin it looks like a little spider web it like pmer athema these are not specific to liver damage so if you have a couple of these don prominent Tan jaasia in the skin condition rosacea in contrast to rosacea tan jaasia from a damaged liver are not going to be associated with the other signs and symptoms of rosacea such as flushing blushing burning sensitivity um those little bumps that can be filled with PFF you with a dilated blood vessels from a spider angom related to a damaged liver spider angomas can be seen in 10 to 15% of otherwise healthy people for example they might pop up in teenagers here and there not an uncommon finding but also they can be seen in pregnant women or in women who are taking hormonal contraceptives birth control pills that have an estrogen component sometimes might develop these however when they become concerning and a warning sign of potential liver damage is when they kind of appear all of a sudden and you have multiple and there pregnant or taking birth control pills 33% of patients with curosis of the liver will have spider angomas prominent dilated blood vessels teenasia look like a spider web spider angomas range anywhere from a few millimet to a centimeter in diameter another contributing factor in the formation of these as it relates to people who who consume excessive amounts of alcohol to the point that it has damaged their liver in addition to the problems with estrogen and circulation throughout the body there leads to an increase in something called vascular endothelial growth factor so that stimulates these blood vessels to kind of pop up abnormally cuz the levels of the growth factor like up there as a result of all the alcohol consumption number three is an artero venous hemangioma these pop up usually on the head and neck often on the lips I of them on the lips red blue soft almost like a nodule this is basically a tumor of blood vessels and it again related to the increase in vascular endothelial growth factor abnormal circulating estrogen levels and problems with just overall circulation in the periphery being somewhat off gives rise to these growths basically they prevalent in Middle a men but anybody with a damaged liver can have these if the liver disease is treated alleviated improved upon well these will regress number four is the paper money sign so patients with a damaged liver therosis of the liver can get so many of those little spider angomas but sometimes in an eruption sort of in a more widespread fashion to the point where if you take a step back and you look at their skin it looks like that little thread that goes through well paper paper money like bills that security thread these commonly will show up in crops on the neck the chest number five is a CIT Medusa wow Medusa Greek mythology you know she had the head of all those snakes because the LI liver is such a huge organ and all this blood is circulating through it when it gets scarred down well you get a backup in flow and you get a lot of increase and pressure in your abdomen and that slows down and backs up the flow of blood around you can get very prominent varicose veins on your abdomen on your stomach upper chest area you know we seen prominent varicose veins and people who have uh who are on their feet all day uh you see those on your legs right but when they pop up on the stomach that is a warning sign of a damaged liver and the name capet Medusa refers to the fact that there will be the large varicose veins with kind of radiating projections looks like well Medusa coming out around the around the um umbilicus the belly button number six is jaundice this yellowish discoloration of the skin the whites of the eyes and the mucus membranes this yellowish discoloration is basically accumulation of Billy Reuben and it is seen in patients whose liver has been damaged to the point where their Billy ruin levels rise to above 2 mg per deciliter you want to check the whites of the eyes and the mucous membranes because there are a lot of things that can make the skin yellowish for example if you eat a lot of carrots or pumpkin you can develop what kind of yellowish color but in contrast to jaas keratina Derma is not going to affect the whites of your eyes or the mucous membrane so with jaas a real um Telltale sign is if you look under the tongue you can see a yellowish discoloration that the first areas where it pops up or the back of your throat that little hangy ball thing called the uvula will also be yellow the color of jaundice varies anywhere from sort of a lemon yellow to an apple green number seven is not necessarily a skin finding immediately but a skin feeling and that is itch man having a damaged liver will leave you very itchy especially on your arms and legs and the itch can be persistent or it can come and go the itch of liver disease often leads to very itchy palms and soles of the feet it related to a variety of things increases in your body well as progesterone metabolites number eight is pigmentation it is not uncommon for patients with a damaged liver to present with this abnormal pigmentation on the face some people refer to this as hepatic face it complexion thought to be the result of disruption in hormone metabolism patients with a damaged liver also often have this black discoloration on their arms and legs and last but not least is a nail finding not the only one but one that is often seen in liver disease it called Terry Nails what the heck are Terry white nail bed but if you look at the tip of the nails you see this reddish brown transverse band about half to 2 mm in diameter and with Terry you little half moons are absent now like with many of these other skin findings Terry underlying medical conditions like congestive heart failure for example but they are something that is seen in liver damage and it related to kind of this abnormality and blood vessel formation and a tendency towards making tan jaasia might underscore that red transverse band that you see at the tip along with the background white nail bed all right y warning signs of a damaged liver not to miss but let me tell you we have barely scratched the surface there are even more findings more nail signs more skin signs more hair signs that I didn get into in today say why is a dermatologist talking about warning signs of liver disease let me tell you dermatologists are going to identify liver disease in a lot of cases because the skin provides the clue all right y informative educational and that you enjoyed it I have a whole playlist on my channel detailing many other skin findings associated with a whole host of different health problems thyroid disease B12 deficiency if you enjoy these types of videos check out that playlist I recent videos from the playlist on the ends slate so that slide that come up next Once I disappear it to have a thumbnail if you tap on that thumbnail

Skin SIGNS OF LOW VITAMIN D @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z0-h5UsfaY	Dr Day	well hey guys in this video i be talking about the skin signs of low vitamin d i what it is that vitamin d does for our skin and how low levels may be implicated in certain skin issues skin is both a source of vitamin d as well as a target organ for the bioavailable forms of vitamin d vitamin d is a fat soluble vitamin there are two forms ergo calciferol which comes from plants like mushrooms and coal calciferol that you can get from animal foods like fatty fish for humans our skin is actually a major source of vitamin d seven dehydrocholesterol plus uvb rays from the sun lead to the production of pre-vitamin d3 which is converted to coal calciferol now it doesn vitamin d from the skin or from your diet it has to go to your liver and then it has to go to your kidney in order to be processed to the bioavailable form and these pathways that lead to vitamin d synthesis are all very tightly regulated by various factors such as vitamin d levels themselves parathyroid hormone fibroblast growth factor calcium and phosphorous levels vitamin d is critical for the health of our bones our musculoskeletal system children who are vitamin d deficient develop something called rickets and in older adults it can lead to brittle bones osteopenia and an increased risk of fractures to have poor vitamin d but the past decades we have learned of various extraskeletal functions of vitamin d it for regulating cell division differentiation cell death and it important for the health of our immune system so what are the skin signs of low vitamin d truthfully there are none there is no specific skin rash manifestation skin finding that is a clue to vitamin d deficiency and the symptoms of vitamin d deficiency they not even specific to vitamin d deficiency they include muscle weakness pain fatigue depression and anxiety so if you have any of those it is not it doesn deficient so i felt compelled enough to sit down and make a video talking about vitamin d even though there are no specific skin findings of vitamin d insufficiency so why does it even matter for your skin we have learned that vitamin d plays a major role in the health of your skin it important for the growth and differentiation of the main cell in your skin the keratinocyte your epidermis consists of several layers of skin cells keratinocytes in different phases of differentiation the final end result is what is called the stratum corneum where you have those keratinocytes enmeshed in a proteinaceous lipid milieu that really functions to protect you from the outside world that creates a barrier that whole differentiation cycle of the epidermis is really the end result of that is to form a barrier so we know that vitamin d is really important for the differentiation of those skin cells it important for those skin cells dying when you are exposed to uv rays it triggers a lot of dna damage and your skin cells should do your do you a favor and decide to commit suicide it programmed cell death otherwise if they didn down the road vitamin d is really important for that process as well and it control of what basically the first phase of the immune system kind of coming in in response to pathogens and environmental stressors that trigger dna damage vitamin d is important we have learned in in that process as well so having low levels of vitamin d and being vitamin d deficient it definitely can translate to health problems including for your skin but to be clear there is no skin problem for which low levels of vitamin d are causative nor is there a skin problem for which taking a vitamin d supplement is curative so what skin conditions are more likely to be impacted by your vitamin d levels a skin condition called psoriasis psoriasis is a complex disease it has to do with your genetics there is a genetic predisposition to developing psoriasis and it has to do with your immune system and what it is is actually a total systemic disease where you have high levels of inflammation you develop a specific type of rash but you can also develop a type of arthritis that can be very debilitating and people who have psoriasis are at increased risk for a variety of other health effects namely cardiovascular disease obesity depression anxiety so it skin problem it is a total body health issue there are multiple problems in psoriasis besides just the skin lesions themselves but if you have psoriasis you know firsthand of the skin lesions it can have a tremendous impact on your quality of life your emotional health so we started looking more into how vitamin d plays a role in psoriasis and honestly the studies they conflicting it to isolate vitamin d levels and correlate them with a disease outcome because there are a lot of different factors that go into your vitamin d levels where you live you know your what latitude you live at dictates your relative exposure to those uvb rays that contribute to the skin synthesis your diet body surface area your lifestyle people who are obese or overweight they tend to have lower vitamin d levels and that is thought possibly to be due to the fact that vitamin d is a fat soluble compound and perhaps it is sequestered peripherally in fat stores leading to a lower plasma level of bioavailable vitamin d and people who are overweight or obese and i already mentioned that people who have psoriasis they have a greater likelihood of being overweight or obese possibly due to their genetics or just the underlying inflammation at the root of psoriasis makes them their hormonal profiles skewed to hold on to fat stores more readily making it more difficult to lose weight or maybe it has to do with the fact that they can develop a pretty debilitating arthritis that maybe limits their mobility probably multiple things now we have some studies that show an association between low levels of vitamin d and psoriasis we also have some studies that correlate inversely vitamin d levels with the severity of a psoriasis meaning the lower the vitamin d the more severe the psoriasis however we also have studies that contradict these findings so it it that not here to bs you interestingly enough though one of the treatments for psoriasis is a topical vitamin d analog we have a few of them for example calcipotrial can help clear up the psoriasis and whether or not that has to do with helping to control the proliferation of skin cells because psoriasis is actually a hyper proliferative skin disease where the those keratinocytes they too rapidly and that thick scaly plaques in psoriasis so maybe a topical vitamin d helps with that or helps with the immune response and a treatment for psoriasis that works quite well for the skin problem for the skin lesions for clearing those up is actually narrow band uvb uvb is what comes from the sun along with other things like uva and visible light and infrared radiation but you can just isolate the uvb rays and use it as a treatment for psoriasis uvb suppresses the immune system so that is one reason why it may help but another reason why it may help at least in the case of psoriasis possibly is due to maybe vitamin d synthesis in the skin from the uvb from the treatment so that may possibly underscore one of the reasons why that treatment is so particularly effective for psoriasis one of the main functions of your skin is acting as a barrier keeping irritating things out keeping pathogens out and keeping hydration in and water in you know when you lose the integrity of the skin you lose more water and if it enough you can actually lose a lot of water and develop electrolyte abnormalities and become critically ill and when the barrier is impaired you infections things getting in to the skin causing infections things like staph bacteria we have learned that vitamin d plays a major role in barrier function for the skin it synthesis of the lipids in the skin as well as the protein milieu that those keratinocytes the cornea sites at the top dead layer are kind of enmeshed in when i think of barrier defect the hallmark skin disease that is due to a defect in the skin barrier is atopic dermatitis otherwise known as eczema where you can develop weepy oozy itchy rashes very easily it condition it comes and goes flaring with things like stress the weather over bathing and we know that underlying atopic dermatitis is a defect in the skin barrier so vitamin d may import be important in that there are some studies that show that people who have atopic dermatitis do you have lower plasma levels of vitamin d in addition to its role in helping with the skin barrier for people with eczema another thing you can immune regulation part of what underlies eczema in addition to the barrier defect is immune dysregulation and the immune profile is kind of skewed abnormally and it in leveling things out and controlling that and giving a more normal immune response controlling that dysregulation that leads to up regulation otherwise of inflammatory mediators it that drives eczema flares and the symptoms of itch and people who have eczema so perhaps vitamin d may play a role there in lower latitudes there is an increased prevalence of atopic dermatitis speculate that perhaps it has to do with getting less uvb exposure for skin synthesis of vitamin d but that also could reflect genetic differences and in some populations there a genetic risk for atopic dermatitis at those locations now it is growing that vitamin d does play a major role in skin health how the barrier recovers and remains intact immune responses but we simply don have the data to show that vitamin d insufficient insufficiency or deficiency causes any skin disease nor is it curative for any skin disease now as dermatologists we treat not only the skin but we also treat the hair i do have a video on how hair loss may be due to low levels of vitamin d so don forget to check that out if you were dealing with hair loss vitamin d has been implicated in the health of the hair follicle and in some patients who have low levels of vitamin d and hair loss supplementing their vitamin d may help with their hair loss what is the best way to get vitamin d that is a difficult question to answer it probably varies from person to person depending on their genetics certain risk factors for low levels of vitamin d that maybe we haven can get vitamin d from your diet fatty fish fortified foods mushrooms you can get it from supplements and your skin can help you out in synthesizing it using uvb rays from the sun so questions i always get are are you worried about vitamin d deficiency because you protect your skin from the sun no there is no safe level of uvb exposure from the sun that you can get that will not simultaneously put you at risk for skin damage and skin cancer those same rays they also cause dna damage in our skin that can put us at risk for skin cancers so there exposure that will raise your vitamin d levels while not simultaneously putting you at risk for skin cancer and sun exposure alone may not simply be enough to get many people to a good level of vitamin d anyway it likely has to do with not only body surface exposed latitude time of day genetics race pigmentation etc there are studies looking at populations that live in very sunny areas and they still have vitamin d insufficiency and deficiency honolulu for example 58 of people have low levels of vitamin d pretty darn sunny there they a good amount of sun exposure likewise a study done on women in santiago chile showed that 27 percent of premenopausal women had low levels of vitamin d despite sun exposure and 60 of postmenopausal women had vitamin d levels less than 20. what about all that sunscreen that you wear aren worried that that is going to make you low in vitamin d no good news studies show that wearing sunscreen does not impact your skin good vitamin d sunscreen helps protect our skin from those uv rays but it doesn have a recent study showing that on under maximal use conditions which almost nobody uses sunscreen on maximal use conditions as it milligrams per centimeter square still allows for vitamin d synthesis to occur and in fact many argue that wearing a broad spectrum sunscreen that also protects you from those uva rays which are really harsh to the skin they damage collagen suppress the immune system and put you at risk for skin cancers many argue that wearing a broad spectrum sunscreen that protects against both uvb and uva may actually help your skin with the vitamin d synthesis why uva rays from the sun actually can compromise vitamin d synthesis and the skin rendering it inefficient and so having a sunscreen that blocks those may allow you know that little amount of uvb that gets in is it seems to be enough and the uva protection may actually help your skin out in the long run i do not advocate getting seeking out unprotected sun exposure as a means to raise your vitamin d because as i said there that levels now i know i don sun avoidance that is a one of the most common misconceptions among many about me is that i promote that everybody stay indoors in a cave yeah i mean i don vlogs or not i do not advocate sun avoidance but it is important to protect your skin from those uv uv rays that damage the collagen in your skin lead to immune suppression and ultimately those uva rays can compromise the ability of your skin to create good vitamin d and you can still get vitamin d synthesis from the sun when you fact it may help you make vitamin d better in the skin so that is that is not something i have i don total sun avoidance and staying indoors you cannot argue the health effects of you know being outdoors so i that something that i have ever told anyone to do just stay inside all day in a cave but i don recommend unprotected sun exposure in an effort to raise your vitamin d levels of course i d is not important for human health but it is important to be mindful of the fact that some of what you hear about the increasing rates of low levels of vitamin d they can reflect a detection bias not only have we changed the threshold for vitamin d insufficiency but people are coming in in droves requesting vitamin d testing which actually is not recommended to just test vitamin d on otherwise healthy people but people come in requesting the test so more tests are being ordered more people are being labeled vitamin d insufficient and everyone really have good evidence that vitamin d insufficiency leads to or is causative of many of these diseases for what you about it may simply be guilty by association it may be that unhealthy people or people who are at risk for these things have lower levels of vitamin d as a marker of poor health we don right you guys so in summary vitamin d is critical for bone health yes the sun is a major source of vitamin d you can also get vitamin d from your diet and from supplements if necessary now vitamin d plays a major role in the health of the skin in terms of keratinocyte proliferation differentiation apoptosis it plays a major role in immune regulation within the skin as well as throughout the body in general and it function in the skin which is one of the main reasons we have skin is to keep us protected from the outside world and to keep things in namely fluids and electrolytes so it is a very important ingredient in total body health now i hope this video was helpful to you guys on the end slate i video on vitamin d and hair loss so check that out if you missed it and in the description box i as well as my video on sunscreen and vitamin d so check those out but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it

The Truth About Shingles: Why You Get It And How To Heal It Fast	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6Cnw0DSLKY	Dr Day	well hey guys today I want to talk to you about shingles I over the years please talk about shingles it is not fun to deal with what the heck is shingles well let me know in the comments did you ever get Chickenpox uh raise your hand I certainly did well shingles is basically caused by the same virus that caused your chickenpox um the chickenpox virus after your chickenpox goes away the virus goes to sleep in What dorsal root ganglia in your spinal cord and your immune system is like stay in there it kind of you know keeps it keeps it dormant but with advancing age or if you get uh sick if you develop a cancer your immune system becomes compromised your immune system sort of forgets about it and that virus wakes back up but this time instead of causing chickenpox it causes a different type of rash which is commonly referred to as shingles shingles is a blistering uncomfortable rash that typically erupts in little groups of bumps generally arranged kind of in a linear configuration along the distribution of a nerve as it courses through the skin and what you had shingles is that it does not cross your midline so if you you know draw a line and bict yourself and half the shingles rash will stop abruptly and not cross that that line that case however there are exceptions to every rule uh there are cases especially in patients who are really sick in the hospital or have underlying problems with their immune system certain types of cancer they compromised quite ill if they develop shingles well it actually can you know ignore that rule and be more widespread anyone can develop shingles but it definitely a lot more common in older adults uh the older you get the greater the likelihood that that little virus will wake back up and cause this problem because you know as we get older our immune system you know it gets older so that memory of that virus that process that declines with age Jingles can happen pretty much on any body surface often happens on your torso whether it be your chest or your abdomen but it also can involve your face your scalp as a matter of fact I have seen many patients over the years who develop it in their scalp and it initially is misdiagnosed because as it looks like just little pimples people think they have a foliculitis and often times then it ends up being shingles so easy diagnosis to miss if you are not suspecting him starts out typically as localized pain and the pain is unique I don if you never experienced a ner nerve pain it like along the lines of that uncomfortable feeling that you get if you hit your funny bone um that shock like tingle so initially it and then uh you may feel feverish you may feel ill and within about 1 to 3 days you start getting this eruption of little blisters and the blisters many times a very Hallmark feature of them with very the virus itself that that causes this is called vericella uh the Hallmark you know kind of nature of these blisters in shingles is that they have a little dent in the center it cuz they often times a hair follicle um so that that get these little blisters the blisters can then fill with pus then they get crusty and crust over and then they go away also you know as you are getting this you will often have very enlarged lymph nodes on the side where you have the shingles rash it can be quite striking especially if you have say the rash like on your on your flank on on on your side you know of your tors of your abdomen very rarely though people can develop shingles with no rash uh just have pain in the area and they don a rash for whatever reason that but it does happen I it before um anyway so the pain and symptoms gradually subside in young people typically takes about 2 to three weeks for the whole process to run its course for older adults usually 3 to four weeks everything cross over goes away and you are you are good to go importantly the most important point to take home from this video well there are a lot of really important points but one of the most important points I want you to remember is that when you have shingles that rash is contagious you can give somebody chickenpox who has never had chickenpox before because you shedding virus particles so for example a young child who maybe hasn Chickenpox vaccine if they come in close contact with you especially close to the rash well you can shed that virus to them and they can get Chickenpox so you want to avoid elderly adults older individuals people who have cancer or you know are on some kind of immunosuppress of medication anybody who is imuno compromised you want to you know Steer clear of don pregnant women because you definitely can you know you can be really devastating to the developing baby to be exposed to veracel virus uh it can be quite quite deadly you are no longer infectious when the rash is completely crusted over so every blister when every blister is crusted over the rash is no longer contagious like I said most people it goes away but you can develop serious complications and those complications are more common the older you get okay um one of them is you know if it involves certain parts of your face it can actually involve your eye and that is an emergency because it definitely can cause complications with your vision and a clue that you need to get yourself some urgent medical attention is if you have the rash involving the tip of your nose um that that warrants immediate attention by an eye doctor because you likely have involvement of your eye you know it can scar depending on how deep the blisters are especially should you accidentally pick at them scratch at them you know in contrast to chickenpox shingles is not typically itchy it it it so keep that you know for that reason people don much um one thing that can happen though with shingles I in some other videos it isotopic response um and it interesting because basically you have the shingles and it goes away and for whatever reason there things are just not quite the same in that area of skin you can develop another skin problem there it Wolf example was it a month ago or so at this point I did a video on lyen planus lyan planus is known to erupt in an area where you previously had shingles that went away that it I different skin conditions appear in an area that previously was shingles after the shingles has gone away rarely it can cause U muscle weakness facial Psy particular one known as The ramsy Hunt Syndrome you may have recalled was that a couple of years ago what actor was it that developed it um oh was it Justin Bieber yeah Justin Bieber who had Ramsey Hunt Syndrome um and you know in older adults or adults people who are real sick in the hospital cancer patients or whatever you know it it becomes a lot more concerning because the shingles virus that the vericella virus it can you know become involve internal organs gastrointestinal tract the they can get a really really serious pneumonia I mean getting getting shingles as an older adult can can really be riddled with complications the verell virus it lot nicer to young kids generally um in comparison to older adults like you don the same virus causes chickenpox you don it tends to be a lot more you know serious and you can get like I said a serious lung infection you know pneumonia you also can get what an in sephtis basically involve involving your brain and that you know can be quite quite deadly so you want to avoid that the other thing with shingles that you know again is more common in older adults and can be very debilitating it neuralgia so if I didn this vericella virus that causes shingles and chickenpox it virus um and so that post herpetic neuralgia basically you have persistent pain in the area where you had shingles once the shingles goes away um it of patients over the age of 40 not something that we see in you know younger adults so much but once you get you know 40 and above it starts becoming more and more of a possible risk for you and it have persistent pain it continuous burning sensation becomes quite a debilitating chronic pain syndrome I would not wish on anyone you can also have persistent itch in addition to it being more common in older adults who have shingles it more common should the shingles involve your face when you get shingles how to get rid of it you mostly just let it ride its course rest you know don overdo it many people who get shingles they just carry on um you know dep it varies from person to person how sick you feel but a lot of people feel just fine like it swear I what skinc care product aside from sunscreen do I recommend in like 99% of my videos petroleum jelly it barrier because the skin is going to be compromised with that rash going on you don on top so petroleum jelly is helpful after applying a thin layer of petroleum jelly then just cover the rash with a bandage this will help protect it and facilitate ate better healing overall also you know this will seem obvious to you should you develop this but avoid wearing tight restrictive clothing that puts a lot of friction on the rash that will cause you a lot of pain and can potentially compromise healing now another thing that can be very helpful in terms of alleviating the symptoms of the shingles rash is to just take a soothing colloidal oatmeal bath can be very not only hydrating to the skin but help soothe the symptoms and just overall help you feel a little bit better if an antiviral medicine like acyclovir or Val cycl uh if it 3 days of you developing symptoms it can shorten the duration of you having shingles and reduce your overall pain so that be offered so in terms of preventing shingles uh like I said it becomes a lot more common the older you get shingles vaccine is recommended for older adults or adults with an underlying problem with their immune system and it can cut down on your risk of developing shingles but importantly it cuts down on the risk of serious complications from shingles such as post herpetic neuralgia so even though it doesn your risk of getting shingles to zero should you get shingles and you are vaccinated it can help cut down on the overall severity and risk of serious complications trust me you don get post herpetic neuralgia okay if I I mean it can be so debilitating I mean it syndrome and talk to anybody who has chronic pain I think anybody with chronic pain would agree that whatever you can do to prevent having a chronic pain syndrome you know definitely for older adults if they get shingles which is a lot more common they are at greater risk of having you know infection that goes into their brain their gastrointestinal tract and you know serious pneumonia can land you in the hospital so the shingles vaccine can substantially cut down on your risk of developing serious complications if you do develop shingles and it also can decrease your risk of developing shingles albeit it doesn to zero risk once you can you get it again you can you certainly can get shingles another time but again if you are older or if you have underlying medical conditions that weaken your immune system that ability to remember that virus it strong so you can get it you can get shingles again all right y what I wanted to talk about with regards to shingles let me know in the comments have you ever had chickenpox have you had shingles I hope this video was informative to you on the endslate I going to put my recent video All About syphilis which is on the rise definitely check that video out because you need to inform yourself about why it rise and you know signs to look out for but if you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen and subscribe I guys tomorrow bye [Music]	Success
6 SIGNS OF TOO MUCH YEAST *SKIN* @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8j6z5gSwPc	Dr Day	well hey guys in today going to be covering six signs that you have too much yeast specifically I going to be covering six skin findings associated with too much of the yeast malassezia to be clear there are other yeast that can cause skin rashes like Canada yeast we covering those in today only going to be focusing on skin problems that arise as a result of too much malassezia yeast what the heck is malassezia it part of everyone normal to have this yeast on your skin however in certain circumstances certain situations the yeast can get a little bit too comfortable proliferate too much your immune system might decide to rebel against it and it can cause certain types of skin problems one thing you need to understand about malassezia is that most of the species on your skin actually require external lipids to survive guess where they get these lipids from the sebum in your pores oil the oil that you make problem number one is something called head and neck dermatitis head and neck dermatitis is actually a subtype of atopic dermatitis and what it is is a rash that appears on the head and neck as the name implies specifically on the eyelids particularly it also can cover the forehead the sides of the neck and extend into the scalp it even be accompanied by little hives especially on the side of the neck now the interesting thing about this condition it affects people who have atopic dermatitis their body for whatever reason decides that it is going to mount an allergy against certain proteins in the malassezia yeast which again is part of everyone Flora so you develop rashes to the yeast in your skin and these rashes are most problematic When you sweat because sweat actually releases the proteins that from the yeast that you are allergic to the reason this happens probably has a lot to do with the underlying immune dysregulation in the skin of people who have atopic dermatitis accompanied by the fact that with atopic dermatitis there Integrity they have a higher skin pH this is very conducive to overgrowth malassezia comment below and if you have ever heard of dupixon or seen the commercials this is a medication that is used to treat atopic dermatitis but a side effect of it is actually head and neck dermatitis my number one tip don try and self-diagnose this because it can look a lot like other things which also are common in people who have a topic dermatitis namely contact dermatitis in some cases testing may be required to really know for sure specifically an ige prick test will look for an allergy to the proteins on malassezia it can be treated treated with a combination of anti-inflammatories and anti-fungals anti-fungals can either be applied to the skin or taken by mouth and anti-inflammatories can be applied to the skin to help this along further topical anti-inflammatories namely triamcinolone is steroid cream topical anti-fungals Ketoconazole clotrimazole help reduce the burden of that yeast oral antifungals would be intraconazole or fluconi all number two is a heck of a lot more common than head and neck dermatitis and that is seborrheic dermatitis seborrheic dermatitis typically involves the face but it can happen anywhere where you have hair it loves the skin here on the sides of the nose it also likes to be in the eyebrows this part known as the glabella is a common area you have a lot of oil glands on your chest so many people develop it there you can develop it in the genital area the way it looks is a red rash it has an overlying scale that is described as greasy and or yellow some cases of seborrheic dermatitis you can have little red bumps and those bumps can be filled with pus separate dermatitis is a pretty common skin condition a lot of people have it if you deeper skin tone seborrheic dermatitis can look a lot different separate dermatitis can actually have a hypopigmentation so it can it definitely looks a lot different on deeper skin tones but it men as opposed to women probably because men have larger oil glands it very common in patients who have underlying problems with their immune system especially those who have HIV for whatever reason stubborn seborrheic dermatitis seems to be a problem and people with certain neurologic disorders namely Parkinson cord injury seborrheic dermatitis can look an awful lot like some other skin conditions namely acne and rosacea rosacea tends to favor the convex surfaces of the face whereas seborrheic dermatitis likes the concave surfaces acne on the other hand is different from seborrheic dermatitis and yes you can have the red bumps you can have the bumps filled with pus but with acne specifically you blackheads and white whiteheads AKA comedones there are no comedones with seborrheic dermatitis there way to cure it it can burn out on its own it comes and goes it tends to flare in the winter time for whatever reason as well as early spring it can flare if you get sick run down or if you stressed out it topical antifungals like Ketoconazole or clotrimazole to reduce the burden of malassezia in the setting of a flare of seborrheic dermatitis where you have a lot of redness maybe you have some itch a topical steroid medicine can be prescribed there are concerns with using topical steroids indefinitely on the phase you can develop side effects which are not good so instead if it to be where you have more stubborn seborrheic dermatitis you lot of flares a lot of redness your dermatologist may elect to transition you over to a steroid sparing topical anti-inflammatory these are most commonly going to be in the family known as calcinarian Inhibitors they include tacrolimus or pimprolamus AKA protopic or eledil because malassezia thrives in oiliness sebum low-dose I Accutane isotretinoin may be pursued to reduce sebum output helping overall and controlling the disease and that option for for some people number three is very much related to seborrheic dermatitis and in fact it the same thing that isn dandruff specifically occurs on the scalp most people have heard of dandruff you get flakes in the scalp in contrast to separating dermatite is what you might see on the face or elsewhere on the body with dandruff you really don have that background redness so you just have the flakes the flakes occur in patches and similar to semi dermatitis dandruff can come and go flares again in the winter time it can also flare if you aggravated again by excessive sebum so people who shampoo their scalp infrequently are more vulnerable to developing flares of dandruff but in contrast to seborrheic dermatitis dandruff typically is dryer flakes you don typically and again you don background redness babies can have dandruff it typically outgrow it at puberty when those sebaceous oil glands start cranking up then dandruff can recur I have a whole video on how to prevent dandruff flares where I go into detail but as a reminder shampooing your scalp not your hair trans your scalp directing shampoo lather to your scalp as frequently as your hair type will tolerate is one of the best approaches because it cuts down on the sebum up there then of course you have medicated anti-dandruff shampoos selenium sulfide zinc pyrethion salicylic acid and Ketoconazole these are anti-inflammatory and they help cut down on the burden of the yeast when you anti-dandruff shampoo again direct it to the scalp leave it on there for a few minutes so it skin and then rinse it out after you rinse it out come in with a conditioner to your hair strands to help keep the hair manageable I know in Europe they use peroxtone olamide but truthfully there that ingredient for dandruff it something we use here and so I familiar with how effective it is if your dandruff is really stubborn and really bothersome and it with over-the-counter medicated anti-dandruff shampoos see a board certified dermatologist that way a you confirm that it are certain prescription treatments that get better control in some cases help control the itch number four is neonatal acne and I say that in air quotes because it just called that neonatal acne as the name implies this is something that impacts babies neonates early on in life basically you know when they come out they terms of their immune system and immune responses are kind of slow and for this reason malesthesia can get a little too comfortable in baby get little red bumps most often on the cheeks it can happen in both boys and girls unlike true acne neonatal acne does not Scar and it of age with no treatment treatment can be offered in which case Ketoconazole cream is usually prescribed or maybe clotrimazole and that can help it clear up faster but no treatment is needed for neonatal acne now in contrast babies can develop true acne it acne infantile acne unlike neonatal acne is true acne it has comedones blackheads whiteheads it has it can have cysts nodules and it can scar if left untreated infantile acne happens anywhere from three months of age to 16 months of age whereas neonatal air quotes acne happens much much younger so that feature between the two number five tinea versicolor I know a lot of you guys deal with this uh it pityriasis first of color very common tends to affect teens young adults and it it can be really stubborn actually it doesn have any underlying health problems it pretty common it common in areas where you have a lot of humidity high heat it tropical environments because again you your oil it just ends up making for a more favorable environment for malesthesia yeast and what it does is it creates a rash that can be these little discreet spots or they can start to coalesce and be confluent they or they know they can look white depending on your background skin tone they really favor the like the upper torso the chest again there are a lot of oil glands there on your chest and your upper back also can happen on the sides of the neck the face I mean really anywhere in some cases it doesn anything wrong with your health however if you your cortisol is too high people who have the conditioned Cushing syndrome where your cortisol is too high they tend to have issues with malassezia and they often have tinea versicolor can can often occur and those folks probably because you know again they immune suppressed and so their body is not really keeping the malachezia in check making this more of an issue for them now with tinea versicolor in contrast to some of the other conditions that we yeast kind of overgrowing in these patches and if you look under the microscope you know you take a biopsy of the skin what Versa color is that not only do you see the yeast but you all also see what are called high feet these little like strands of yeast in in the skin it referred to as spaghetti and meatballs um so that diagnosed as well as just the clinical appearance of it and one cool if you all thing about this condition as well as other malassezia conditions is that we have a special tool in dermatology called a woods lamp so your Derm may turn out the lights put this lamp on and these skin lesions can fluoresce yellow so that malassezum treating tinea versicolor is is very frustrating on for the patient because it often recurs especially it may be the kind of thing where you get good treatment results it clears up and Summer summer boom it comes right back or you sweaty conditions and it just keeps coming back that things so there are a variety of different treatments one of the go-to for people who have this is to get the anti-dandruff shampoo cell awesome blue you don per se just look for an anti-dandruff shampoo when the active ingredient selenium sulfide and what you to do is uh you lather this to the areas where you have tinea versicolor so if it lather it all there so you leave that on the skin for a few minutes and then you rinse it off just to really let that selenium sulfide soak in there you going to do that daily for a month and that can help get rid of it and then after that do it once a month as maintenance to keep it from coming back now at first you know some people that not enough it you doing that there are other medications that can be prescribed topical anti-fungals there anti-fungal shampoo two percent Ketoconazole shampoo is stronger than what you buy over the counter you can you know that might be prescribed as a topical antifungal you lather it to these areas in a similar fashion that can get you good results in very stubborn cases and oral anti-fungal like intraconazole all or um fluconazole may be prescribed and that will help get rid of it faster but again it doesn it from coming back to keep it from coming back you really need to do your best to stay on top of the maintenance of doing like the once a month anti-dandruff shampoo treatment and also be mindful of sweaty conditions like change out of sweaty clothing because that is very favorable to the malassezia when you get very sweaty make sure you get in the shower and rinse the sweat off clean the skin efficiently that way you that tends to favor the formation of tinea versicolor now as I said at the beginning of the video you know this yeast really thrives in your sebum so if you performance enhancing drugs or testosterone that can increase sebum production this may be more of an issue for you and more recalcitrant more stubborn constantly coming back because you going on so modifying those dietary supplements accordingly you know can help out as well and number six malassezia folliculitis it technically acne it folliculitis which basically means that the malassezia has taken over gotten too comfortable in the follicle the pore and it acne there are no comedones or no blackheads and whiteheads instead what you get are red bumps all roughly the same size and appearance most often like on the upper chest the back again these are areas where you have a lot of oil glands but you know sometimes can happen on the forehead all the bumps roughly look the same and there background redness it can be pretty itchy while true acne can itch fungal acne AKA malassezia folliculitis definitely itches a lot of times people who develop this also have concomitant seborrheic dermatitis as well now people who are at risk for developing this are people who are immunosuppressed like people who get prednisone or people who are on uh you know immunosuppressed because of their background medical conditions people who are on prolonged courses of oral antibiotics can develop those because antibiotics disrupt your skin microbiome your skin flora and that may tip malassezia over the edge to to go on ham in the follicle people who have blood cancers like lymphoma leukemia they at risk for developing this otherwise healthy people can develop it too especially if you live somewhere very tropical very humid you wear occlusive clothing this can trigger it for some people as well and again if you taking a medication or a dietary supplement that increases sebum like testosterone for example that certainly can put you at risk for this itches and you know you may think you have acne you may be misdiagnosed as having acne I think that became referred to in the public as fungal acne how is this diagnosed well clinically the way it looks the history you know itch the history of if you were immunosuppressed you have Leukemia Lymphoma you antibiotics or maybe you know you live somewhere super tropical and it something that is more more common uh as well as a skin biopsy can be taken and in the skin biopsy what you see is within the follicle it be chock full of malesthesia in some cases you may have some pus there and if the Derm takes that and looks at it in the microscope they can often see they can often see these little yeast so you know it It lamp can come in handy you may see some yellow fluorescence all those things together can really help nail the diagnosis of heterosperum folliculitis or malassezia folliculitis things that would be prescribed to treat this are going to be an oral anti-fungal or even a topical antifungal can actually get rid of it quite efficiently you know it was always thought that you needed an oral anti-fungal to treat this because it well truthfully oral anti-fungal versus topical antifungal they both can get a cure you know clearance it just takes longer with a topical anti-fungal selenium sulfide anti-dandruff shampoos can also be highly valuable used in the same way they versicolor just lather to the affected areas leave that on the skin for a few minutes and then rinse off do it daily for anywhere from three days to a month after a given period of time of doing it daily you can switch over to doing it just once a week to to maintain control this is going to be important you know if you live somewhere that humid and you deal with with malice easier related issues or you know if you have a background medical history where you problems or you make you more susceptible to this and you maybe need it it may be necessary to do this on a more routine weekly maintenance basis all right y are the six skin signs you have too much malassezia yeast AKA pitterosporum now in summary malassezia it your skin you don because then things can go awry but in certain situations certain circumstances it can get too comfortable your immune system can act up against it and you can develop these specific skin problems that we covered in today try and diagnose them yourself because it can look an awful lot like other types of skin conditions see a board-certified dermatologist to know for sure what you are dealing with that way they can not only give you the right diagnosis but they can help you with the best treatment approach for you because honestly you know with these types of skin problems that arise from too much malassezia it as far as treatment either some things are going to be better options for some patients you know some of these things we talked about in today topical anti-fungals if you have extensive areas of the skin problem related to malassezia it might be too challenging for for you to use a topical in those areas like the back for example in which case an oral Maybe more appropriate for you I hope this video was helpful guys now on the on the insulate I skin signs of food allergies so definitely check that one

Signs You Have Bed Bugs And How To Get Rid Of Them	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkTS6OXo31Y	Dr Day	well guys the time has come for us to discuss bed bogs you have probably seen a lot of media coverage about bed bogs in Paris and in today to tell you everything you need to know about bed bugs how to find them how to know if you them bed bugs are insects that feed off of human blood they hide in dark spaces and cracks and crevices near where humans sleep and they come out at night and feed on human blood they are really tiny an adult bed bug is about the size of an apple seed baby bed bugs are about the size of a poppy seed they to come and feed on your blood while you are asleep and you them crawling on you and you going to feel them biting you they sneaky they they actually inject a little numbing medicine so you can are that you are a victim they basically vampires they come out at night to suck your blood bed bugs only come out in the dark to feed at night they hide in cracks and crevices near where you sleep they hiding in your your mattress your box spring especially like the little crevices uh in in the seams of the mattress they also hide in headboards they can also hide in baseboards they really small and they they hide in little tiny cracks and things they also can hide in upholstered furniture skin signs of bed bugs are the development of itchy red welts that are clustered together usually in groups of three we finally refer to this as the breakfast lunch and dinner pattern these clusterings of bites will often take on a zigzag configuration you will not typically see a bed bug on your skin they come out at night again in the dark feed for about 4 to 12 minutes and then they go back to where they came from they view you as basically a restaurant they take advantage of you and then they just leave other signs that you have bed bugs you may notice some little specks of blood on your sheets here about the wels of bed bug bites you will not develop these right away so the first couple of times you get bit there to develop these welts the welts themselves are basically your immune system coming in and like getting annoyed by the presence of bed bug saliva in your skin so it takes some time for your immune system to show up there and everyone reacts to bed bugs differently and that many cases by the time you start seeing the Itchy welts it been the host of bed bugs for multiple nights in a row and your immune system is just a little bit late to show up to the party to make these welts some people develop them after a couple of days other people it takes you know up to 14 days it and wife and the wife has weals and the husband doesn how could this possibly be bed bugs he not he getting bit his his immune system is just just you know not reacting quite as strongly but as you continue to get bit your immune system becomes a lot more Savvy and you develop the welts alwn sooner after getting bit so that they inevitably do become a problem for most people but a lot of people simply don react to them so just because somebody who is cohabitating with you does not have the wealth does not mean that you do not have bed bugs the wealth of a bed bug is very itchy and if you look very carefully at it you can see a little what in the center yeah that snacking went down that they bit you as far as the issue with bed bugs one of the main issues is that well they itch so you scratch them and they can become secondarily infected it serious allergic reactions to bed bugs although it can happen bed bugs do not fly they don and and the way that they are spread is basically they move with you uh to other places in your luggage most often or in furniture items like a mattress that maybe you give away to somebody you don furniture bed bugs don they don they feed on you and then they go back to their little cave so you to carry them on your skin as opposed to like lice or scabies those are things that you carry infestations that you carry around with you so a really common scenario is that someone stays somewhere that has bed bugs and the bed bugs make get into their luggage into their clothing and they travel with you that way or maybe you have picked up an old piece of furniture that came from someone who had bed bugs and they are residing like in the mattress the upholstery of the old furniture one thing about bed bugs that is important to keep in mind especially if you are very frustrated that you have acquired them is that it whether it be you or wherever you acquired the bed bugs it was not the root cause is not poor hygiene so outbreak of bed bugs can happen in hotels Motel cruise ships dorms apartment and condo complexes hospitals assisted living facilities nursing homes so if you you know acquired bed bugs on a trip somewhere from a hotel it stressful but it or motel or whever that you stayed was not clean uh it these the bed bugs come in because somebody brought them there and the person who brought them there it wasn because they had poor hygiene it the way that bed bugs move around they come with a person in their luggage or you know in furniture that they might move around with them and it doesn take much because you can bring home a few bed bugs like just one or two and very quickly have a full-blown infestation because throughout the lifetime of a female bed bug she will lay roughly 200 to 500 eggs so you can easily get a lot of bed bugs how do you know if the place that you are staying has bed bugs what do you look for when you check into your room room you might notice a musty odor not everyone though is able to detect this bed bugs release this chemical it with one another and it can take on a musty odor when you stay in a hotel room a motel room a cruise ship or or like a dorm a cabin whatever utilize the luggage rack don the bed or leave it on the floor because the bed bugs if they crawl from the bed to your luggage and then you bring them home or they can crawl from the floor to your luggage and you bring them home so you know put your luggage up on the luggage rack when you get into the room check for bed bugs this is what you you box spring the pillows you look very carefully along the seams you furniture in the room to reiterate you actual bed bug because again they they don on instead what you looking for are little tiny specks of blood you little dark black specks that is basically bed bug excrement I know I show you a picture here bed bugs have a hard exoskeleton that they shed so you may see these casings you might also see eggs but keep in mind they be very very tiny so you may not be able to see them if you are concerned that you have picked up bed bugs along the way of your travels what can you do when you get home to prevent an infestation well when you get home first thing you want to do is make sure that you wash all of your clothes you can kill bed bugs and their eggs with hot water and high temperature so wash all of your clothing including the clothing you did not wear in hot water in the washing machine and run it through the dryer that should kill bugs the bed bugs as well as their eggs bed bugs and their eggs can also be killed with a garment steamer so you can take that to your luggage as well if you not able to put these things in a washing machine right away you can seal them up in a garbage bag um and they won up in a garbage bag you can also utilize a hot dryer now if you you have bed bugs in your home how do you check for them similar to what I just told you about how to look for signs of bed bugs you in the mattress the seams the seams of the pillows the headboard you to be looking for the black specs the little specs of blood casings maybe some eggs but you truthfully to actually see a bed bug unless you do the following here is how to actually look for bed bugs you need to set your alarm clock to go off um anytime between 2 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. cuz that it do this uh for you but you or your partner needs to physically be in the bed because the bed bugs are drawn drawn to you to warmth to to human to a human body so because of this you physically need to be in the bed while someone else looks for the bed bugs they to come out if there cuz they bed Checker around the mattress the pillowcase the pillows uh you know upholstered furniture close to the bed they love that and again all around the baseboards they they and 5:00 a.m. so that find them they don they just crawl and they move really fast if you have bed bugs how do you get rid of them you have to have professional extermination they won just go away and a lot of people will try and leave and then come back guess what bed bugs bed bugs are definitely vampires because they can live up to a year without eating so a lot of people you know be like I apartment Mo you know go somewhere else for a couple of months however long and then I waiting for you they you bed bugs are tricky and many of them have mounted resistance to various insecticides so it requires a professional exterminator to come in to find them to destroy them they also follow up to make sure that they are gone so that live in an apartment complex the landlord needs to do that you know anybody who deals with bed bugs I I have you know very very sympathetic uh because it it nightmare honestly I mean they they last a long time and if you live in an apartment complex they easily make their way over to your neighbor um and and hang out in your neighbor before you know the whole floor has bed bugs the whole building has bed bugs it are they are they nuisance um but the good news is with the skin problem that they cause as welts itchy welts they they but you know they life-threatening so you die from bed bugs you know unless you have a severe allergy that not going to die from bed bugs you can get mattress protectors that will seal the mattress and box spring protectors that will seal it and so basically will prevent the bed bugs from coming out biting you similar to the mattress protectors that um you get for dust mites also can be helpful for uh preventing the bed bugs from getting out and biting you so bed bugs you know they feed off of of your blood and then they may go buy you know snack on someone else so can they transmit bloodborne diseases uh it unknown in a sense Studies have looked at that and it it doesn they do but they can carry pathogens like um hepatitis but they don actually effectively transmit it to other people it doesn they pain to get rid of if you are in the throws of a bed bug infest station you do about them like how do you get rid of the welts the wels themselves should go away um then a couple of weeks each we but you know as they bite you you going to get more and as they continue to bite you your immune system will get a lot more efficient at at forming these welts so things that you can do uh you know you want to cut down on the the itch sensation as best you can with topicals because itch is going to lead you to scratch which is further going to disrupt your sleep and put you at risk for skin infection so topical steroids just F little wel can help silence that itch you can even the the topical steroid hydrocortisone cream you can buy in the drugstore without a prescription it bite itch uh it uh just apply it you don just a tiny thin film to just the bite itself you don the skin uh twice a day and it get rid of the itch so the bite can heal faster um also there are over-the-counter uh lotions and creams that are you anti-itch creams that have peroxin in them a topical anesthetic that soes and you know helps cut down on the itch sensation uh if you do scratch and end up getting a secondary skin infection your dermatologist can prescribe a topical antibiotic ointment to treat that um but best to prevent that by trying to you know cut down on on the itchiness with topicals all right guys that regarding bed bugs I really hope this video was helpful congratulations if you even made it this far because I know talking about bed bugs is you know not everyone probably made you itch just hearing about it uh but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow [Music] bye [Music]	Success
7 Warning Signs Of Low Testosterone NOT TO MISS (Skin, Hair, Nails)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z45r20UCAQ4	Dr Day	your testosterone is on the decline and in today covering the skin hair and nail findings associated with a dropping testosterone testosterone is a hormone that plays a vital function in a variety of processes throughout your body I I can probably say it along with me the skin is a window to what is going on internally not just your skin but your hair and nails can all be impacted by a decline in testosterone now a lot of people think testosterone as oh that that male hormone yes it important in male physiology however women have testosterone as well it important for us as well and when levels decline are too low it can leave us not feeling our best why my ear testosterone be low in the first place it normal for testosterone levels to decline with age as part of the normal aging process but you can have a variety of underlying issues leading to a low testosterone for example Maybe have a genetic condition that leads to low testosterone or maybe you have an abnormality going on in your brain maybe you have a problem with your pituitary gland or you are hypothalamus those are parts of the brain that play a active role in our hormones maybe you have sustained some kind of trauma that has impacted testosterone production in men maybe you have had some sort of testicular injury testosterone levels can be quite low if you are critically ill if you have lost a lot of weight especially very quickly maybe through some sort of crack trash diet or if you have been excessively exercising especially doing a lot of cardio like running for example low testosterone can also occur secondary to obesity diabetes kidney disease certain drugs medications can also negatively impact your testosterone for example predisone a anti-inflammatory it given for a variety of things can lead to low testosterone also the antifungal medication ketoconazol I about ketoconazol and the shampoo or the prescription cream I ketoconazol that is given by mouth like a pill form it can result in low testosterone with side effects of low testosterone opioid medications or used recreationally also can leave you with low testosterone and anabolic steroids that people might use abuse for muscle building purposes will suppress testosterone release how do you know if your testosterone is low or maybe you are concern with regards to your testosterone levels are they healthy how do you optimize them I suggest I suggest going to the expert your health care provider nowadays there are so many direct to Consumer websites where you can have your testosterone checked you can be prescribed testosterone replacement therapy but it down the wrong path if you your health care provider because there testosterone replacement therapy can be game Cher for your health but it also can be harmful to your health if not appropriate so don the easy way out don influencers hello it may need to be on some sort of testosterone replacement and so don influence your health this is not just buying a protein shake this is this is a hormone okay now testosterone it hormone it plays a role in how our skin function how our hair is and how our nails grow and form when the testosterone levels decline one of the more obvious things that can happen is actually dry skin which isn specific right I mean watch any number of my videos and at least eight out of 10 we by X Y or Z so if you have dry skin please do not freak out and self diagnosed with low testosterone don that don videos are for okay I mean especially we skin may be related to something but dry skin can definitely happen when the testosterone levels are low because you have a decline in Skin Barrier function so a greater tendency to lose water and for irritance to penetrate the skin leading to dryness irritation itch and also buildup of dry rough skin texture now the other thing about testosterone and the potent form of testosterone dihydro testosterone actually play a pivotal role in the development maintenance and function of the sebaceous oil gland so on the flip side people who have hyperandrogenism one way in which testosterone can impact your skin is through sebera excess sebum production and acne so when your testosterone is too low you may not make adequate seum and you lose that lubricating effect that sebum offers now you likely will see an improvement in acne um but you going to have dry skin that to irritation also testosterone is really important for um the production of components in the D the deeper layers of the skin playing a vital role in structural Integrity of the skin so you might notice that your skin is not only dry more prone to irritation and itch but also more wrinkled in appearance and crepy more prone to tearing doesn from Cuts scrapes and wounds as efficiently chronically low testosterone can also impact your bone structure and that can show up in your face loss of bone in the face plays a role in the just sort of normal aging process of the face and I have a lot of video on how bone resorption in our face with age impacts the way skin subsequently appears hangs sags Etc and you from that video that having a lot of bone resorption as might occur with chronically low testosterone around the eyes results in Hollows under the eyes and a greater tendency towards dark under eye circles also that bone resorption leads to dissent of the cheek and you kind of get a less youthful appearance with a lot more of your facial volume descending to the lower face testosterone also plays a role in hair growth but it because the potent form of testosterone dihydrotestosterone which is produced through the conversion of testosterone by um the enzyme 5 alha reductase that potent form of testosterone that results actually can cause miniaturization of the hair follicles on your scalp and play a role in those who are genetically predisposed towards androgenetic alopecia or pattern hair loss and this affects both men and women um a pattern hair loss thinning because the hair basically turns into a little vellous peach fuzz hair you lose that long course terminal hair on your scalp and so having high testosterone can influence that hair loss but on the flip side if the testosterone is low you not getting healthy testosterone signals to the hair follicle for producing the hair strand and therefore you have brittle hair and overall diffus thinning and hair loss as well so it balance between too much and too little either end of the spectrum you can have some degree of hair loss with hyperandrogenism being associated with full-blown androgenetic alpia but you can still have thinning sparse brittle hair with low testosterone as well also your nails can become very brittle prent of breakage as well as the skin around the nails getting dry flaky nail ridging and also splitting of the nails with low testosterone speaking of hair growth you also can have a reduction in hair growth on the body under the arms the face men may notice that their beard is a lot sparser patchy chest hair hair on the genitals hair in these areas can become sparse patchy slow to grow when testosterone is low wow that was a rhyme speaking of slow to grow testosterone is also important for the um growth phase of the hair cycle so the um antigen phase of the hair cycle so your hair may not grow as long coupled with that significant reduction in oil production from the scalp you will really notice the hair not only being sparse and brittle but a lot drier in appearance it experience vaginal dryness with low testosterone this can lead to sexual dysfunction pain this may necessitate the use of vaginal lubricant men who are born with problems with their testosterone often lack pigmentation in the genital areas testosterone plays a role in pigmentation of the private areas the genitals for example or the AA and when you are born with a problem with testosterone being too low as part of your genetic makeup well you will often lack pigmentation in those areas other non-specific signs and symptoms of low testosterone include low libido low mood also fatigue and males can experience an increase in breast tissue development that when testosterone is low inability to focus to concentrate importantly testosterone plays a vital role in muscle building and muscle maintenance a lot of people as their testosterone levels naturally decline with age do find they have a much more difficult time putting on and maintaining muscle mass and let me tell you muscle mass is really important for not just the way our skin looks on our body because it kind of fills in space especially you know the natural loss of collagen and the deeper layers of our skin having good muscle tissue underneath kind of helps to you know to a certain extent offset that by space filling but if you lose muscle you lose that and importantly with a decline in strength you become frail you become frail also testosterone like I said is really important for your bones so you may deal with more Falls be at greater risk for fractures not a good thing all right guys so that up with regards to the Hair Skin and nail findings associated with low testosterone now on the ins slate I going to put my recent video all about the warning signs that your estrogen levels are too low check that one out next cuz there are a lot of skin findings that are associated with that so check that out if that to you but if you guys like

MONKEYPOX OUTBREAK: SIGNS & SYMPTOMS NOT TO MISS ?? DERMATOLOGIST @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uEvQF5YWFI	Dr Day	well hey guys you may have heard there have been some outbreaks all over the world of monkey pox and in this video we is monkey pox and i for you all the skin findings that happen with this particular viral infection if you are new here welcome my name is andrea i am a board certified dermatologist this channel is all things skin care if that is of interest to you definitely consider subscribing hit the bell notification that will notify you when my videos go live so i this video on may 21st saturday so things may have changed by the time this video goes live but as of the filming of this video there have been several outbreaks around the world of monkey pox and we so far cases have popped up in the u.s in canada spain italy the netherlands uk belgium canary islands israel germany sweden and australia now it people who have come down with this got infected but what is monkey pox it is a viral infection it is largely transmitted by contact with infected animals specifically rodents it was initially described and identified in a laboratory monkey in 1958 hence its name monkey pox but it major reservoir or source of the spiral infection how do people get it it largely through contact with infected animals whether it be handling them a bite from them or consuming or cooking or preparing meat from these animals it can be inoculated into human skin through a contact with infectious materials through anywhere on the skin where there bite a scratch or any kind of skin trauma it humans but human to human transmission can also occur through contact with the bodily fluids it also can be transmitted from human to human through large respiratory droplets such as what you would come in contact with if you like very very close proximity to someone through contact with surfaces that are contaminated like sheets linens a risk factor for human to human transmission is going to be crowded living conditions areas where they in very very close proximity to one another and it primarily happens in the rainforests of central and western africa people there do become infected with this as a result of handling infected rodents here in the u.s specifically in 2003 there was an outbreak in the midwest that particular outbreak was traced back to pet prairie dogs who had previously been housed in very close proximity to rodents that were imported to the us from ghana then last summer actually in 2021 there was a case in dallas and a case in maryland and both of those individuals had previously traveled to nigeria so they had perhaps come in contact there and came back got the illness but it was not transferred to anyone else now fast forward now to 2022 we up around the world in europe canada the us australia so after you are infected with this virus it takes anywhere from 4 to 20 days to start developing symptoms on average about 12 days then you develop a flu-like illness and it starts with a fever you get chills profuse night sweats muscle pain body aches headache backache there throat you can feel short of breath and have a cough one of the hallmark features though of this then about two to three days of developing fever you have really really prominent and large lymph nodes specifically in your neck like under your chin your jaw area the lymph nodes get to be a couple of centimeters in size and this is an important finding it distinguishes this particular viral infection from infections like chickenpox for example because again you brings me to the next point what exactly does the rash of monkey pox look like so the rash develops within 1 to 10 days of getting a fever it starts on the face and then spreads to involve the rest of the body the spots follow a very predictable course they start out as small red spots then they turn into bumps then those bumps turn into little blisters then those blisters fill up with pus then those pus bumps umbilicate basically just kind of sink in in the center umbilicate think of it like your belly button umbilicus a little dividend then that umbilicated bump cross over and then it flakes off this whole process every single spot kind of follows along that time course and eventually in about two to three weeks the rash completely crossed over flakes off and goes away so it involve the face your torso your back your arms your legs it can involve the palms and soles and it also involves the scalp in some cases the rash can be itchy to the untrained eye it may kind of appear like chickenpox which i know a lot of you guys who are quite young you probably never had to deal with chickenpox comment below and if you had chickenpox i did it may kind of look like chickenpox but again the distinguishing feature is going to be those really enlarged lymph nodes uh under the chin in the neck and also in the groin if i didn that so this rash it can be itchy but it spots can go on to scar and leave little pock mark type scars you can also get a bacterial infection on top of the rash if you scratch it especially because the area there it skin barrier it infection it shouldn it perhaps there infection on top of the rash so when you have this rash if someone comes in contact with the skin lesions the blister fluid they can get sick as well so it is infectious at that point but once all of the bumps of the rash have crusted over it it that it involves pretty much all surfaces scalp face body arms and legs palms and soles in some cases and it lasts a good long while anywhere from two to four weeks so that with a rash fortunately for the most part this infection is what self-limited meaning it follows along this very predictable course and then resolves and the rash can be complicated by an overlying bacterial infection which would further increase the risk of scarring in cases in africa the death rate from this particular viral infection is anywhere from one to ten percent most people who do end up dying from this infection have underlying poor health and it oftentimes due to complications arising from an overlying bacterial infection well in the 2003 outbreak throughout the midwest there were no cases of death from monkey pox how is it diagnosed well history of any recent travel is really an important piece you contact with people or animals who were a source a swab may be taken to culture for the virus and then a skin biopsy if you get a little piece of your skin a skin biopsy would need to be performed you look at it under the microscope and there are specific changes that are telltale of this type of viral infection they also can look at it with something called immunohis chemistry to look for specific viral pieces they also can look at the skin biopsy under a special type of microscope called an electron microscope and it can show specific viral pieces that really help make the diagnosis even further so i am in no way shape or form and infectious disease expert but i do know about the rash of monkey pox there were a couple of questions on my board exam for example about this i have never seen a case of it but i do know what the findings are i can identify them so i wanted to make this video for you all because whenever there are crazy headlines like this i know you know worries people and i thought it would be a good opportunity to talk about the skin findings it the people in these individual clusters and different countries who have come down with this how they were exposed yeah it this unfolds hopefully they to identify like the uh you know trace back the original exposure contact clarify what what that was i wanted to make this video basically to share with you guys what the skin findings are because i think it you know it that for people out there who may be wondering what the skin rash looks like and i think it to you guys who may be reading these headlines and nervous to just kind of understand a little bit more about this particular viral infection this video is not meant to alarm anybody or evoke fear i know when we hear about viral viral infection outbreaks especially with everything that scary but uh yeah i think at this point you know hopefully the cdc will be able to figure this out and it will be yet another outbreak like the ones we had in 2003 and you know hopefully no harm will come of it so to wrap it up to be clear this virus it and it it with infected rodents uh but it can be uh transmitted from person to person once somebody has come down with it mostly through closed contacts with infected bodily fluids skin on skin contact or infected surfaces and it viral infection that can make you pretty sick for a couple of weeks and you do have a rash that is pretty involved and lasts a couple anywhere from two to four weeks and that rash can scar there are some antiviral medicines that may be offered uh for people who are you know very ill or people who have underlying medical issues where it would be a concern i don unnecessarily worried but if you haven traveled recently you know hopefully this information may be helpful to you hopefully by the time this video goes live maybe we more knowledge more information but if you guys like this video give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don subscribe i bye [Music] you	Success
7 SKIN SIGNS NOT TO IGNORE ?? DERMATOLOGIST @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYUBg8ZmstI	Dr Day	well hey guys in this video i be covering seven signs of skin cancer you don here welcome my name is andrea i board certified dermatologist i upload skin care content here on youtube if that sounds of interest to you consider subscribing or you could consider following me over on instagram or tiktok i platforms as well now there are quite a few different types of skin cancer but for the purposes of this video i to be going over seven signs of the most common type of skin cancer which is basal cell carcinoma not only is basal cell carcinoma the most common type of skin cancer it common cancer diagnosed worldwide in the us it americans will be handed a diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma each year most people who get this type of skin cancer have a paler skin type and a history of a lot of unprotected sun exposure however any skin type any skin tone can get this type of skin cancer so while it you have a deeper skin tone this can affect you as well it exposed areas but it also can occur in areas where you a burn when you hear the word cancer that sounds really really scary and it is but in the case of basal cell carcinoma rest assured it growing skin cancer and it life-threatening if a left untreated however it can start to grow very deep into the skin and it can impact the nerves and the blood vessels that can infiltrate there and as it gets deeper it removal process leads to more noticeable scarring and can be quite disfiguring so best treated early to prevent not only disfigurement but also to reduce the risk of recurrence [Music] number one is a pink or red growth that kind of dips down in the center this is often mistaken for either a sore or an acne scar it has a red rim to it but a little dip in the center and that can be a sign of a basal cell carcinoma if it doesn away you might want to get it checked out if you don area and it acne scar [Music] number two is a growth or scaly patch on or around the ear the ears are a frequent location for skin cancers namely basal cell carcinoma and it can easily be mistaken for just a patch of dry skin or sore you keep putting moisturizer on it that may temporarily make it feel softer but it always kind of comes right back [Music] number three is a sore that does not heal maybe even bleed sometimes or oozes or maybe it heals but it always comes right back this is sometimes mistaken as a pimple or a sore it can bleed ooze and it can be uncomfortable painful itchy have a little numbness and tingling sensation to it a lot of times these might appear for example on your nose and again some people just think oh it have the most stubborn acne a given pimple should not last and persist it should go away granted you may get pimples elsewhere but that is more than just acne it might be a skin cancer [Music] number four is a slightly raised patch of either dry or irritated skin anywhere on the face or on the body and it can be brown black tan red or pink any you know different colors a lot of times this is just mistaken as a patch of irritated skin kind of similar you put on moisturizer and just doesn maybe you even try like a product that is meant to smooth the skin and exfoliate and it just patch just keeps coming back this rough area of skin that could be a clue to basal cell carcinoma [Music] number five is a round growth it might be pink red tan brown black maybe even a mixture of some colors and it can be a little smooth or rough oftentimes this is mistaken as a mole or a wart um you know people will go in to the drugstore and buy over-the-counter wart treatments to try and get rid of it it might actually be a skin cancer this is tricky because warts they tend to stay around for a long time eventually they go away but they pretty stubborn and so if you something that you think is a wart it do know in the back of your mind it could be a skin cancer especially if it [Music] number six is a scaly rough spot maybe it mistaken as a freckle or a age spot as a matter of fact some people will go as far to go to a med spa and have it treated with like intense pulse light in a med spa thinking that it in reality it so if you have a new brown or tan spot that definitely have it examined by a board-certified dermatologist it could be a skin cancer not just some sunspot or age spot [Music] and lastly number seven is something that looks like a scar it may be white yellow kind of bound down and feeling tight it might appear shiny and smooth but in your mind you a cut there or any kind of injury so why would i have a scar that could be a clue for a type of skin cancer called amorphia form basal cell carcinoma there are a lot of different types of basal cell carcinoma as a side note that they can look like pretty much anything on the skin any kind of growth you have to be mindful of skin cancer all right so those are some clues that you might be dealing with a skin cancer but i want you guys to understand there are hundreds and hundreds of different types of skin lesions that can pop up on your skin and they can be totally not cancer not this at all there are things like warts skin tags benign growths like seborrheic keratoses and so it may not be that but it important to have it evaluated where do basal cell carcinomas arise most often it body that see a lot of sun especially the head and the ears they can happen around your eyelids that and remind you guys to put sunscreen around your eyes and wear your sunglasses because basal cell carcinoma can definitely impact the lid margin and removing it is more involved than if it happens elsewhere on the body it can happen on the shoulder on the trunk like your chest or your back especially the upper back where you often get a lot more sun exposure and on the lower legs especially a common area for women maybe you did a lot of sunbathing in your younger years didn put sunscreen on your legs god forbid you went in a tanning bed i mean these are common areas for this type of skin cancer to arise actually is on the shins are there any symptoms with the basal cell carcinoma well in some cases it can be painful and because these skin cancers they slowly grow downwards sometimes they can entrap little nerves throughout the skin and that can make the lesion the bump or whatever feel itchy kind of tingly pins and needles type sensation and in some cases blood vessels can grow into the basal cell carcinoma that makes it more kind of what weep and that is why some people think they have a sore or a pimple but it doesn heal that is a red flag that you might be dealing with a skin cancer a skin lesion that bleeds itches oozes and doesn get checked out and see a board-certified dermatologist for evaluation this type of skin cancer tends to arise in people you know around their 50s older adults but it happening in younger and younger demographics women in their 30s can develop basal cell carcinoma and especially if you have a history of using a tanning bed that puts you at greater risk for any type of skin cancer so if you have a history of going in a tanning bed or getting a lot of blistering sunburns in your early childhood pay careful attention to your skin if you in the back of your mind that it is possibility that something that doesn heal is a skin cancer and rather than going to dr google or on social media try and see a board-certified dermatologist to have it evaluated like i said there are a lot of skin lesions that can pop up as we get into our wiser years especially skin tags warts seborrheic keratoses a ton of things that are not this type of cancer but can look an awful lot like it therefore it best to see a board-certified dermatologist who can properly evaluate it and the the thing about basal cell is sometimes it can be treated right away you don treatment depending on the size the location a variety of other things sometimes simply the fact of biopsying it and removing it to evaluate it under the microscope is the treatment [Music] all right you guys so those are seven signs of basal cell carcinoma it really common and again it skin cancer that impacts people of a paler skin type if you are a deeper skin tone this type of skin cancer certainly can impact you as well so even though it with a lot of sun damage and people who are prone to sunburn anyone can get this anyone can get those so i hope this was helpful to you guys and um i have videos on other types of skin cancers namely melanoma so i going to link that video in the description box and i on the end slate if that is of interest to you it is an older video but it still accurate so check that out but if you like this one give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen and subscribe i guys tomorrow bye [Music] you	Success
We Need To Talk About Syphilis | Warning Signs, Symptoms, & Treatment	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtWSDS5pe8k	Dr Day	this video might just save your life I don really need to talk about syphilis syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection once thought to be rare but cases of syphilis are on the rise this Resurgence in syphilis is tragic because it is a contagious sexually transmitted illness and it can be very deadly one of the problems with syphilis is that the signs and symptoms of syphilis look like the signs and symptoms of so so so many health problems that it the diagnosis if you don it one of the other reasons why this is so tragic is because we had almost gotten rid of syphilis here in the US at one point as a matter of fact back in the day a long long time ago when I was a medical student while I was taught extensively about the signs symptoms treatment Etc of syphilis I was also taught eh you see this just keep it in the back of your mind it as a historical Side Dermatology as a specialty probably would not exist if it were not for syphilis forget about Botox forget about filler forget about acne dermatologists originally were known as syphilology because that is what lended US credibility in medicine as a true medical specialty because syphilis can be um discovered diagnosed from skin exams skin findings and we really were um booming in our Heyday back in the 1800s how do you get syphilis well you get it from having sex oral sex anal sex vaginal sex and a pregnant woman with syphilis will pass it to the fetus and that is tragic because it causes severe severe severe birth defects and in most cases sadly the fetus is born dead still born syphilis is contagious and again you get it from having sex syphilis requires a human body in order to live and exist exist so you cannot get it from a toilet seat you can sheets from tables from sitting in a chair that someone with syphilis sat in the good thing about syphilis if you someone who likes to look on the bright side is that it to diagnose and it with the right antibiotic it can be cured the earliest warning signs of syphilis often appear on the skin why is syphilis On The Rise there are actually many underlying reasons for the increase in syphilis a big reason is actually just overall a decline in Awareness up until this most recent Resurgence in syphilis if you think I don years ago was not really something that was discussed that often not really on everyone Resurgence is so tragic is that it really just demonstrates um that we been too slack because in the the US at least we had nearly eradicated syphilis because at that time there was a lot of money being funneled into public health awareness around sexually transmitted infections you would see more at that time Billboards and things encouraging people to get checked for syphilis while it very easy to miss syphilis because the signs and symptoms of early stage syphilis which we they are transient meaning they appear and then they go away and they are us usually without any symptoms painless the skin while it can be a window into what is going on internally it window if you are looking at it most people are not examining every nook and cranny every skin surface with a mirror every single day so if it where you can you may not even know it early signs and symptoms they usually go away within about 3 to 6 weeks but even at that point when the symptoms and signs that you may have missed go away you are still contagious so people don realize they have it cuz they miss the signs and they go out and maybe have sex with someone spread it to that person that person then spreads it to someone else if they have sex with somebody else even when you don symptoms of syphilis even when they have gone away resolved you still are infected and you are still contagious so you still can spread it around another reason for the increase and syphilis is the fact that people struggle with access to healthcare diagnosing flu and getting treatment is essential for getting rid of it but if you to access health care in a timely fashion you can imagine how it more likely that this diagnosis is going to go missed for example if the signs and symptoms appear and you actually notice them but you are unable to get in to see a health care provider and you struggle to find somebody that is in your network or that you can afford all of these different access issues then the signs and symptoms go away and you probably think in your mind oh that must have been nothing it on with your life but you infectious you can still spread it and the syphilis does not go away and it will cause more health problems for you down the road I don you need to understand that testing for syphilis can find it early and save lives doctors are encouraged especially in the wake of the increased cases to have a very low threshold for testing for syphilis syphilis like I said it is the great imitator but as a patient the mention of syphilis might catch you off guard might make you a little uncomfortable like why do they think I have syphilis if you are the parent or a caregiver of a child a teen a tween and you find out that their doctor wants to test them for syphilis you may not like the sound of that oh no not my child with a sexually transmitted infection listen you want your doctor testing for syphilis it doesn who you are what you do in your life syphilis is on the rise testing for Syphilis is good medicine please do not get offended if you see that your doctor wants to test for syphilis like I said it imitator if you get tested for syphilis and it assured that it doctor can go about making a accurate diagnosis I dermatology is skin condition that we see all of the time a lot of I even have a whole dedicated video on it it called pitas Rosia it appears it it looks eerily similar to syphilis checking for Syphilis is a good thing to do even if you don history doesn have never had sex in their life still check for it because missing syphilis is not anything anybody wants on their clock and importantly if the Test shows that you have syphilis well you can get treated and it can be cured not only is that good for you prevent the spread of it to other organ systems but it good because you spreading it to other people what are some Clues signs symptoms that you have syphilis all right what you need to understand is that syphilis it moves through your body in different stages the first stage is called primary syphilis most people will develop symptoms of primary syphilis within 3 weeks of having sex with somebody who has syphilis The Telltale clue of primary syphilis is a skin ulcer you can have one or more of them and they are painless these ulcers are called a Shanker they can appear on your mouth in your genitals your vagina and your anus the canker usually goes away on its own heals up completely with no sign that it was ever there in about 3 to 6 weeks so again this is something that you could easily miss that sore is contagious and once the sore heals up and goes away you are still contagious at this stage not only can you spread it to other people by having sex vaginal anal oral but you can also spread it to other people through kissing if you have like a sore in your mouth if primary syphilis goes untreated the syphilis can then spread to other organs in your body if you are not treated you can go on to develop what next stage with secondary syphilis the disease is now spreading to other organs in your body so again you get a rash now the rash of secondary syphilis it can take on many different appearances and again it is the great IM Ator so it will look an awful lot like many other skin conditions skin problems classically the rash of secondary syphilis will involve the development of these coin-shaped spots on the palms and Soles but not everybody follows that textbook pattern with secondary syphilis you also can develop sores on any sort of moist surface mouth genitals nose with secondary syphilis you a lot more symptoms feel ill in comparison to primary syphilis it not uncommon for people to have a fever sore throat swollen lymph nodes you can experience fatigue weakness weight loss and you also can develop hair loss at this point if the syphilis spreads to the nervous system it have like a stiff neck a really bad headache you can develop hearing loss uh problems with balance you can also have problems with your reflexes and you can even develop paralysis with secondary syphilis secondary syphilis lasts weeks to months and then the symptoms go away um they go away for the most part some things may be permanently altered but a lot of the signs and symptoms will just completely resolve so again if you have not been treated and this goes away you may have thought gosh I had this really bad flu but I guess it was nothing and you go on and again all the while you are still infectious so if you continue to have sex remember you contagious so you other people just like with primary syphilis you can spread secondary syphilis by kissing if you have like an ulcer in your mouth or if you kiss an ulcer While most of the signs and symptoms of secondary syphilis go away that does not mean that the syphilis has gone away you still need treatment and treatment is essential to prevent you from getting more serious disease and from spreading it to other people without treatment syphilis will progress to the next stage the next stage is called a latent infection and a latent infection basically the syphilis is living within you but in contrast to the other stages you have any obvious signs symptoms you going to go about your life and you going to feel just fine this is called the hidden stage without treatment you can have Laten syphilis for most of your life you also can relapse from Laten syphilis to go back and have the symptoms of secondary syphilis all over again you can have about two to three relapses of secondary syphilis from the latent syphilis each time the secondary stage ends you will go into latent infection again then there is another stage that can come this is the one that tertiary syphilis involves destruction of organs it stage what you get are these really really deep sores that are called gumas kind of an odd name so gumas are these really deep sores that destroy whatever they are on whether it be your lungs your bones your skin at this stage the syphilis can take over your central nervous system your spinal cord your nerves your brain it syphilis it also can take over your heart your blood vessels that cardiovascular syphilis cause you know all sorts of heart and uh blood vessel problems disease quite serious tertiary syphilis is so destructive untreated it it can cause you to die I mean it can cause death tertiary syphilis can take years and years and years to develop from Laten syphilis but importantly even at this stage treatment can still help treatment can help stop it from spreading from causing severe disease however at this stage tertiary syphilis treatment unfortunately is not going to undo the damage that it has caused who gets syphilis anyone can get syphilis there are certain risk factors though that make you at an even greater risk of getting syphilis having unprotected sex with multiple partners definitely increases your risk again syphilis easy to miss easy to not realize you have it having unprotected sex will spread it to someone else and therefore that is a greater risk than not having multiple unprotected sexual partners men who have sex with men are at a greater risk for syphilis and having a sexual partner who tests positive for syphilis makes you at greater risk for developing syphilis being HIV positive is also a risk factor now one thing I want to point out if you have HIV and you are taking anti retroviral medicines they will not protect you from syphilis you are still at an increased risk of syphilis even when you are taking medication to treat your HIV those medications help slow down the HIV but they don from syphilis they don of getting syphilis how can someone lower their risk of getting syphilis well it is a sexually transmitted infection so not having sex oral anal or vaginal sex obviously will decrease your risk um but if you do choose to have sex uh protected sex with condoms and dental dams can help cut down on your risk of syphilis why am I making this video well again uh our namesake in dermatology is we think it no no no this is like actually our bread and butter and what like the specialty was born to do diagnose treat and educate about syphilis um it is on the rise and a lot of people are not aware of it and increasing awareness is key to get a hold of this current increase and outbreaks of syphilis I think that really where we have gone wrong as a society is we kind of slacked a little bit on educating the public about syphilis as a disease and we it on the rise that coupled with other things which I mentioned at the beginning of the video last but not least if you have been diagnosed with syphilis these five things you need to know these five things are essential number one if you are diagnosed with syphilis get treated the right treatment can cure the syphilis untreated the syphilis will spread to other organs throughout your body and untreated you can infect other people when you have sex number two is also very critical you have to tell your partners you have to notify your partners that you have syphilis because they need to be tested and treated because there likelihood that they may have it now that being said sometimes it always a safe thing to reach out to a partner all right I understand that as well talk to your doctor local Health Care authorities can actually intervene and communicate to your partner so talk to your doctor and work with your local Health Department they can intervene syphilis is a condition that healthc care providers are required to report diagnoses of to um Public Health uh to keep track so uh those Public Health agencies they can also work with you to inform your partners so that you know you don three you have to stop having sex for at least one week and until you have completed treatment and all of the signs and symptoms have gone away number four make sure when you are able to have sex again that you dental dams to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections and number five is super important make sure you keep your appointments with your doctors this is another reason that I I think contributes to the overall rise in syphilis cases again getting back to that access issue when you get a diagnosis of syphilis and you are given treatment you have to follow up with your doctor because they need to do tests to make sure that the syphilis has been cured that you no longer test positive that sometimes people need an additional course of treatment before they clear out the infection so you got to follow up with your doctor all right guys that syphilis I really hope this video was informative um helps with awareness because you know it thing to hear about I appreciate you guys watching especially to the end it really helps the video out get this message out there you know on my channel I have a variety of different skin care topics that we cover anywhere ranging from the gamut of like tips to get glowy skin all the way to syphilis trying to cover all of the dermatologic bases for you guys so I really hope you guys enjoyed this video if so give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe I [Music] bye	Success
DRUG-RESISTANT CONTAGIOUS RINGWORM IN THE US ??	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35CQ0gDWsO0	Dr Day	well hey guys you might just want to be on the lookout for ringworm this summer in the US we now have two reported cases of drug resistant ringworm and we going to get into it in today first of all what exactly is ringworm don think no worms are involved probably it often although not always appears ring shaped this is a rash caused by not a worm but rather different types of fungal organisms known as dermatophytes you can have ringworm really on any part of the body if it happens on the feet a lot of people will refer to it as athlete groin area you may hear it commonly referred to as jock itch because it is pretty itchy but you can develop it on the scalp the palms of the hands the soles of the feet the fingernails in the beard area really any body site can be affected it itchy and it identified and treated as soon as possible because if not the skin infection will spread out slowly to involve a more wide spread area of the skin and you can also transmit it to other body sites for example you can have athlete then as you pass your underwear over your feet put them on you can bring that fungus up to your groin area and get jock itch now for the most part this is actually a pretty straightforward skin infection to treat it can either be treated with a topical cream or ointment that has an anti-fungal medicine in it or in some cases where the rashes may be more widespread or it involves a hair you might need to take an oral medication that is an anti-fungal to treat it however over the past 10 years in South Asia and some Middle Eastern countries there has been the emergence of dermatophytes that are incredibly incredibly resistant to the typical anti-fungal medicines used to treat oil ringworm this newer fungus that is resistant to typical anti-fungal medications is called trichophyton endotiniae and while it has been around in South Asia in certain Middle Eastern countries for a while now it its way to other countries around the world in Germany there are a lot of cases actually Switzerland a few cases France Australia Canada Greece Denmark Belgium China and Vietnam ringworm caused by this fungus is highly highly contagious and it tends to involve a large body surface area and is incredibly incredibly itchy so we now have two cases here in the U.S these cases were identified in New York City a dermatologist in New York City has identified these two cases one of the cases is a 47 year old woman who had traveled to Bangladesh in the summer of 2022 and acquired a ringworm infection and Bangladesh is one of the countries where you have a lot of this ringworm she erupted in a rash all over her body and the typical anti-fungal creams did nothing to alleviate her rash so this led the dermatologist to suspect that her ringworm was actually due to this drug resistant trichophyton indoctiniang a second case actually involved a 28 year old female who has no travel history travel history is really important when we and emerging rashes in a given country did you get it somewhere else where that type of skin infection is more common so this particular individual had no travel history outside of the U.S she actually developed ringworm in 2021 in December of that year she saw a dermatologist for the first time but she happened to be pregnant so by January of 2022 she was started on anti-fungal medications that are typically given for this did not respond she was switched to another anti-fungal intraconazole and four weeks later the rash improved ringworm infection with trichophyte and indatinnier it does not respond to oral terbenophene that antifungal given for like ringworm topical anti-fungals are ineffective for this other anti-fungals like fluconazole Ketoconazole griziofulvin likewise not effective I suspect that we see more and more cases of this drug resistant ringworm possibly throughout the summer I say summer because like I said at the beginning of the video germanifieds really thrive in warm humid conditions and sweat they love it so you know summer is a is a time period where you tend to see a bit more of the of the of the ringworm cases although you can definitely see them in the winter time because again they are contagious so in the winter we all come in and hang tight to one another cling close cozy up and spread stuff from one another so all that to say I do I do think we all likely see more cases as the summer goes on and truthfully there probably are a lot of existing cases already here in the US that have not been identified if you are a health care provider definitely consider it if you have someone who has widespread ringworm meaning covering a lot of area a body surface area super scaly super itchy and you anti-fungal treatments you anti-fungal with terbenafine and is not improving you might want to consider consider trichophyton endotinia in cases where you have widespread ringworm that you antifungals or oral terbenafine and the rash is not improving if you testing for fungus and it comes up positive you may be dealing with a a case of drug resistant dramatophyte the travel history is really important if you doctor or hey I traveled to this country you need to think back having traveled anywhere in the past year or so not just to South Asia or certain countries in the Middle East although those are the places where you see it the most again it throughout the world as I mentioned it just not super common yet in the U.S the other thing about this and why a lot of cases might go missed is that in order to diagnose it it requires a special test typically with with germatified infections first of all it that you know you just scrape a little bit of the flaky stuff off and look at it under a month microscope slide with something called Koh and you can see the fungus there and start treating and then you of course also will send that flaky stuff off to the laboratory and they will culture it but here to find an indotinia it looks exactly like the the other types of fungus and so that actually have to send the specimen for specific testing genomic testing and so that that everybody has in-house so it may require you know special testing and a send out so how exactly is this treated then if the fungus is resistant to most typical anti-fungals and if not treating it is going to lead to this widespread infection it how do you get rid of it as it stands now the treatment of choice the thing that seems to be effective is intraconazole that is a medication You Take by mouth it seems to do the job however it frequently requires a longer course anywhere from four to eight weeks up to 12 weeks this medication can interact with other medication that you might be taking so if you to make sure that you are providing your doctor or health care provider with every single medication that you are taking as well as any dietary supplements because intraconazole can interfere with the metabolism of other medications and that can lead to Serious harm for you for example intraconazole can mess up the metabolism of Statin medications and put you at risk for something called Rhabdomyolysis oh that say make sure you volunteer every single medication that you dietary supplements and don you should never hold back but this is a case where it definitely could cause harm some cases are resistant even to intraconazole other alternatives are posiconazole or wariconazole but in some cases you might actually have to consult with an infectious disease specialist to help you tailor the treatment appropriately this is a case where diagnosis is key getting on the right path to treatment is essential because as with any ringworm infection if you Don don appropriately it you can spread it to other body slides and you can spread it to other people in the home I mean it can really really be a problem but part of the reason why this drug resistant fungus has emerged is due to inappropriate use of topical steroids to treat what are actually fungal infections and a lot of times people will have a fungal skin infection and they will go to the drugstore and pick up an anti-itch cream because they creams typically have steroid medication in them hydrocortisone for example and what will happen is they hydrocortisone on there and it takes away all the symptoms right away it just melts away the discomfort rash seems to clear up magically but that is a lie that is a lie because the fungal infection is in there going quite literally I mean it you and and really that making the fungus worse because that topical steroid suppresses the immune system that get better but it allows the fungus to really Thrive and take off and it can trickle down into the hair follicle you can you can really develop extensive fungal infections by using topical steroids like on the scalp for example you can get a full on involvement of the hair follicle that leads to a scarring type of hair loss in an untreated fungal scalp infection but the other issue is that you know as it immune response maybe you treating with topical anti-fungals but because you immunosuppressive aspect of the steroid on there well that the emergence of resistant microorganisms they have a resistant fungus that it um I and this medication that you typically that typically wipes me out I stronger and it selects for those stronger fungal organisms and that where you get emergence of well trichophyton indotinia which is resistant so if you have a scaly rash a make sure you get it diagnosed so you know exactly what you and B don it with an over-the-counter anti-itch cream because a lot of them have steroid in them that can make this worse there are also over-the-counter anti-fungal medications there terbinophen cream for example if you are using those to treat a confirmed case of ringworm make sure you use them exactly as directed and for the recommended duration so as to not Foster an environment that favors the emergence of resistant fungal organisms when it comes to skin rashes always always question is this ringworm because ringworm okay tinia or dermatified infection it mimics a lot of stuff okay a lot of things present as a round scaly flaky itchy rash psoriasis eczema it can look a lot like a fungal infection so you may have a fungal skin infection that has been misdiagnosed as something else and you steroid cream which as I here is only going to make it worse in the long run always think it could be a fungal infection it is a great mimicker and the last thing you want to do is prescribe or give a topical steroid that in the long run is going to make it so much worse for the patient it bad idea to do a Koh exam on a rash a Koh exam is basically a bedside test that little bit of flakes on a microscope slide and use something called Koh and look at it under the microscope a fungal culture should be sent that way you at least know you dermatified infection you don inadvertently give the patient treatments for things like psoriasis or eczema which can look like like ringworm I mean they can all look the same rule out a fungal infection if you are a patient don rash is eczema or psoriasis if you patient who has eczema or psoriasis and you treatments on something and it getting better that is a clue it might actually be something else namely a fungal infection a ringworm so keep that in mind when things are not responding as expected you got to dig a Little Deeper alright guys so I wanted to make this video to bring this to your attention the emergence of drug resistant microorganisms is definitely something that needs to be taken seriously you know on this channel I frequently harp on the emergence of resistant microorganisms when it comes to bacteria and I don highlight the potential risk of emergence of resistant fungi but here a case where we have resistant fungal infections emerging as it stands now trichophyton India tinea is not a widespread issue in the U.S but it definitely something to keep in mind you may have heard also in the news a few months ago that there have been cases of a drug resistant candidates a different microorganism it health problems in comparison to dermatophytes but same issue of a resistant fungal organism so we focus a lot on not overdoing it with like antibiotics for example so as to not favor the emergence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics but we also have to think about the same approach when we it should not favor the emergence of of fungal infections that are resistant to our anti-fungals once you get a ringworm infection whether it be the standard ringworm that or this you know superbug if you will there are a few habits that you need to put in place a few things you need to change up on the end slate I have a whole video on how to get rid of ringworm where I cover these things in detail so definitely check that one out so you are prepared to handle ringworm and do the right things so that you don so check that one out next but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don I [Music] thank you	Success
6 Warning Signs Of Insulin Resistance NOT TO MISS	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73i6qsm7jWg	Dr Day	six warning signs of insulin resistance not to miss the skin it is a window to what is going on internally today we are going to be talking about key skin findings that are Clues to insulin resistance first of all what is insulin resistance insulin is a hormone made by your pancreas it controlling your blood glucose your blood sugar normally after you eat a meal and you have an elevation in blood glucose insulin is released and that allows for that blood glucose to be shuttled where it needs to go into storage forms for later use insulin resistance is basically defined as subnormal glucose responses to a given amount of insulin the natural progression of insulin resistance is first to have hyperinsulinemia high insulin levels after a meal with time that then progresses to hyperinsulinemia in the fasting state in the face of insulin resistance over time the failure to maintain normal blood glucose leads to hypoglycemia high blood sugar and diabetes if you can intervene on insulin resistance early make Lifestyle Changes modify your behaviors get on medications where needed it really can change your life diabetes has so many complications that if you could do something early on in the process trust me you want to do it there are a few rare genetic conditions where patients maybe have a problem with certain receptors in their body that the downstream consequence of that is insulin res resistance but in the vast vast majority of cases insulin resistance is secondary to something else and in the majority of those cases it about 70 to 80% of cases of insulin resistance are related to obesity weight loss exercise and healthy diet can actually reverse insulin resistance that really be a GameChanger for many people but insulin resistance can also develop as a result of excess of certain hormones that might be hormones that your body produces or hormones that you are taking for example glucocorticoids like prazone or growth hormone that you might be taking the reason it important to look at your skin for clues of insulin resistance is that in the face of hyperinsulinemia your skin is actually going to see that there are receptors in your skin for insulin and when insulin is very high it receptors and evoke different skin changes but some of the skin changes that we directly related to hyperinsulinemia they are indirectly related to it because they are actually caused by elevated androgens did you know that hyperinsulinemia having high levels of insulin as in the case of insulin resistance actually can lead to an increase in free testosterone and androgen hormone in women this comes about because the elevated insulin inin causes our ovaries to make more androgens and because many people who develop insulin resistance have obesity having an increased volume of adapost tissue fat that adapost tissue actually produces Androgen hormones and leads to an elevation in testosterone so what are some of the skin changes associated with insulin resistance probably the one you nigricans this appears as this thicken velvety raised textured skin often in the skin folds you can see it under the arms the sides of the neck it can happen on the face the backs of the hands it can happen in a lot of places some people mistake this as hyperpigmentation but it of a type of skin thickening high amount of insulin binds to receptors on the keratinocytes they proliferate and that can this can be one of the earliest warning signs the acanthosis nigeran s will it stay like that forever in many cases once you intervene on the insulin resistance it can regress it can improve importantly it will not worsen once the insulin resistance is controlled there are certain topicals that can help improve the appearance and lighten things up a bit although again it hyperpigmentation it is skin thickening topical retinoids can improve the appearance as can topical ammonium lactate or Ura unfortunately because this happens in the skin folds these ingredients can end up being irritating say for example under the arms check out my video on acanthosis nyrians because I go into a lot more detail as to the different types of treatment today video is more focused on the warning signs themselves rather than going into the nuances of treating each warning sign number two is another one I have a lot of videos on and something I get a lot of questions about acrochordons ACR cordons is a medical name for skin tags soft skin color little growths that we describe often as being pedunculated which is in medical terminology for on a stock so you have this kind of tear shaped growth it around often on the sides of the neck under the arms again in the skin fult may be aggravated and brought out more so not just by the insulin levels that are driving the proliferation but also those frictional forces a lot of patients develop numerous skin tags on the sides of the neck they try and wear a necklace it become inflamed irritated they can really be uncomfortable to to cope with for a lot of patients they want them removed don over-the-counter skin tag removal things or some things that look like a skin tag might actually be something else you don but suffice it to say insulin resistance absolutely can lead to multiple skin tags now if you have one or two skin tags here and there don assume that you have insulin resistance they can happen spontaneously especially in areas under a lot of friction the other less specific skin finding because a lot of people have this they have it as it relates to dry skin they have it as it relates to atopic dermatitis it a condition called keratosis pyloris this is basically rough and bumpy skin or chicken skin some people like to call it little dry rough bumps around the hair follicle basically the skin cell around the hair follicle they don to shed efficiently they get dry they get stuck together and you get these little rough bumps the skin around these little bmps can become inflamed you can get a background of redness some people describe that as strawberry skin again if you have this don insulin resistance because it specific but there is an association with insulin resistance and keratosis pyloris so maybe some of these other findings are present as well it for you it before it could be a warning sign of insulin resistance now keratosis pyloris often happens on the face it can happen really anywhere where you have hair which is pretty much your entire body except your palms and your soles often happens on the upper arms the thighs and moisturizers with Ura ammonium lactate lactic acid glycolic acid salicylic acid all can help soften and exfoliate those dry rough bumps that is the kind of thing that you do have to keep using in order to control the condition but in the case of the insulin resistance if that that truly is underlying the keratosis pyloris for you well once that is addressed the Skin Barrier and the dry skin condition May improve the next three findings that I don insulin but indirectly relate to that because they are mostly related to having elevated androgens and that is acne new worsening acne can be a warning sign of insulin resistance because elevation in Androgen leads to more oil production so it might start out with gosh my skin is like really oily and greasy that could be the earliest warning sign all the way to Frank cystic breakouts acne is related to that little bacteria that lives down in the pore it thrives off of the oils that our skin makes so anything that increases oil namely through Androgen signaling will uh you know potentially trigger acne so a lot of patients who deal with insulin resistance do develop you know one might describe as hormonal acne in those cases the hormones are the major driving Factor hormones drive acne in everyone who has acne but they player in acne and patients with insulin resistance secondary to the elevation in androgens which again comes about in women because the insulin leads the ovaries to produce more androgen and in patients who have obesity the excess adapost tissue produces testosterone the other two are maybe not in your mind skin specific but we dermatologic remember dermatologists we deal with the skin the nails the hair the mucous membranes so a lot of people forget about hair growth and scalp as being related to skin but one condition I have many videos about maybe you sensing a theme here but can be actually a lesser known warning sign of insulin resistance by virtue of Androgen excess is androgenetic alopecia this is known commonly as pattern hair loss it happens in men and it happens in women uh looks a little bit different in men compared to women men tend to First experience this as a receding hairline whereas women start to First experience this as a widening of the central part although there can be some overlap there as well with women experiencing receding hairline as well the name is androgenetic alopecia the genetic as it as it sounds there is a genetic tendency towards this but the Andro part of that underscores the genetic tendency tends to be a sensitivity of the hair follicles to Androgen hormones such that the hair turns into a little baby velous hair prematurely and that is what leads to thinning and hair loss and balding so anything whether you you are genetically susceptible or not anything that leads to an increase in Androgen levels can really push your hair follicles over the edge to miniaturize and for you to develop well pattern hair loss of course in my videos on how to treat pattern hair loss a theme is topical minoxidil is a go-to standard treatment I also have videos on low-level laser therapy I have videos all about oral minoxidil and I also have videos about other hormone specific therapies to treat androgenetic alopecia like finasteride dutasteride spironolactone in women but if you have insulin resistance you that the final one is actually hertis now heroism refers to hair growth in a male pattern we your scalp this time we anywhere else so where is it that men grow hair that women really don chin the upper lip the beard area sides of the face your neck your chest around the AA of the breast and on the lower abdomen and sometimes the the thighs as well unwanted hair growth isn hair follicles are um they Something in the opposite ways in which we want we we being said a lot of women do have some terminal hair growth on their face that is kind of more related to like their genetics it ALS also can happen with the normal hormonal changes around menopause but we in these areas that is definitely a warning sign and you know there are a variety of approaches to getting rid of that hair there there I do have a video comparing laser hair removal to electrolysis which one is best which one should you choose so definitely check that out cuz anytime I talk about heroism I some questions hey can you talk about electrolysis like is that actually worth it check out that video cuz I go over the pros and cons there anyway you also have a variety of you know hormonal medications that can help to mitigate the the heroism and you know sort of remove some of that Androgen influence on the hair follicles but again when it is a warning sign of insulin resistance then often times you other signs it be isolated chin hair and you have none of these other things usually you going to have a canos Ians taken together if you have these warning signs definitely you need to see a healthc care provider and take care of your hormonal Health in other words you need to address the insulin resistance take lifestyle measures work with your doctor with a dietician um with whatever resources you have unfortunately resources are scarce and not available to everyone you can do something you have to you have to if you develop insulin resistance it goes unchecked you develop diabetes let me tell you it is going to take you down a path that really will shorten your life period Point Blank and if you can intervene on that it will totally revolutionize your health you can take back your life quite literally knowing these warning signs and identifying them can really be a wakeup call for a lot of people for changing some of their lifestyle habits now that being said as I said when I was talking about who gets insulin resistant it necessarily change through lifestyle factors like I said some people are born with genetic conditions for which they have you know underlying problems where this is going to be a thing for them regardless of their weight some people take medications have to take medications that can potentially put them at risk for this and it them and their doctor to to be monitoring for these things and adjusting accordingly all right guys so those are the warning signs of insulin resistance speaking of diabetes um I have a video on how diabetes impacts your skin I video on the insulate you definitely want to watch it because we go over even more findings that extend above and beyond what you can develop with just insulin resistance how diabetes can really take over your skin bya its effects on the vascular system the nervous system the Skin Barrier you name it you video out because it all right y give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow bye [Music]	Success
7 Warning Signs Of High Estrogen NOT TO MISS (Skin & Hair)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0srnyCZ7dQ	Dr Day	The podcast bros, they this. They going to talk about today, and that is the skin warning signs that your estrogen is too high. What your skin is trying to tell you about your hormones being out of whack, as they like to say. Estrogens are typically considered the female sex hormone. But both men and women have estrogens, and they actually play an important role in both of our baseline healthy physiology. So, they are something normal and good. However, there are a variety of scenarios where estrogen can get too high and like always your skin it many clues. There are three main categories of estrogens. There estradiol which is the most potent estrogen. It There is estriol which is produced by the placenta during pregnancy. And then there peripheral tissues. Like I said, both men and women make estrogens. Men can make estrogens in their testes as well as peripherally. Your estrogen can be too high as a normal healthy thing such as well during pregnancy. Perfectly normal to have increases in estrogen. It be harmful if it was not the case. But then there are variety of disease states and exogenous reasons to have high estrogen such as taking oral contraceptive pills or hormone replacement therapy as is given to women in pmenopause and menopause. Women who have to take exogenous hormones in order to control dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Also men who take testosterone replacement therapy, it have an increase in estrogen due to peripheral conversion of the exogenous testosterone to estrogens. Then of course you can have tumors that produce too much estrogens. These include tumors of the ovary, the testes, the adrenal glands and the hypothalamus which is in your brain. Certain recreational substances also can cause elevations in estrogens namely alcoholic beverage consumption as well as marijuana. A scenario where you get an elevation in estrogen hormones is actually endstage liver disease because the liver processing of hormones becomes impaired. Typically, we think of endstage liver disease cerosis as something that alcoholics eventually go on to develop, which is absolutely true because alcohol poisons the liver. But there are a variety of other underlying medical conditions that can lead to endstage liver disease as well and elevation in estrogen is characteristic of all of these. And one reason for elevation in estrogen that almost no one talks about which surprises me because it has become an increasingly increasingly increasingly common reason for estrogen to be high is actually obesity. Central atyposity that is excess fat centrally distributed around your waist. That is that is a danger zone actually to accumulate excess atapose tissue. It acts as almost its own organ at that point releasing and secretreting various inflammatory mediators as well as hormones including estrogens. A characteristic skin finding seen in a variety of scenarios with elevated estrogen is going to be pigmentation increase in skin pigment. This is very very typical during pregnancy. About 90% of women who are pregnant will develop either localized or generalized hyperpigmentation. This often includes darkening of the nipples, darkening of the genitalia. One might also develop what line up the abdomen. Also, your moles might begin to darken and you may even develop new moles, which as a side note, any new or changing mole should always be shown to your health care provider. Hyperpigmentation can also be seen in endstage liver disease. As a side note, check out my video on signs of liver disease because I do a deep dive on various skin conditions that you also will see along with liver disease above and beyond what is related to the increase in estrogen. You also can develop mealasma during pregnancy or other situations where the estrogen is high. Malasma is a hyperpigmentation condition where you get these patches of irregular discoloration that has angulated borders often on the cheek, the forehead, the upper lip, also can be on the neck and sometimes the upper chest as well. Rare to see this in men, but in these pathologic conditions, these diseased states, it has been known to appear. Many of these skin warning signs of elevated estrogens are going to be related to the development of vascular issues because estrogen actually increases blood flow and leads to the development of little blood vessels. One characteristic finding that is seen oftent times in pregnancy but also can be seen with taking in estrogen exogenously or with endstage liver disease or in any really of these underlying conditions men and women and that is a reening of the palms palmar athemma especially these areas of the palm known as the thear and the hypoththenar eminences. Now I have a whole video on why your palms are red. Okay, there are a lot of potential reasons. So before you freak out and think, high cuz my palms are red. There are other possible reasons. So check that video out. In addition to Palmer Aythemma, though, these little blood vessels might sprout up on your skin. One such finding that is often seen sometimes during pregnancy, but also in endstage liver disease or with taking even exogenous estrogen, something called a spider angioma. It called a spider angioma because it this little red bump that looks like the body of a spider and coming out from it are these red lines. The red spot in the center is typically raised up. So it really looks like a red spider. Now these can regress say after you deliver in the case of them coming out during pregnancy. Sometimes they will persist especially if you are taking in some sort of hormone exogenously whether it be testosterone that or hormone replacement therapy or oral contraceptive pills or they definitely can be seen in endstage liver disease as well as with excessive consumption of alcohol and possibly even marijuana as well and they may crop up with obesity. They may go away but sometimes they persist. There are treatments that can tackle them to get rid of them, such as intense pulse light and various vascular lasers that target the blood vessels. Speaking of blood vessels, you also can develop what a lot of people refer to as broken capillaries. The medical term for that is tangactas. Often can happen on the cheeks around the nose. We see these a lot actually in patients who do have endstage liver disease as a result of the elevation in estrogen. There vascular phenomenon in the hands known as ray nodes phenomenon that is seen oftent times in association with elevated estrogen levels. Ray nodes phenomenon involves these episodes often triggered by cold exposure where the fingers turn white because the blood vessels are clamping down. They go from white to blue and then as the blood flow releases back into the fingers they turn red. That phenomenon. And there are many underlying conditions associated with that, but elevation in estrogen is one. Let reminder, a dermatologist, we don focus on skin. We focus on hair, which is an extension of your skin. Estrogen prolongs the growing phase of the hair cycle. That growing phase is known as anigen. Pregnant women will relish in this during pregnancy because their hair on their scalp is fuller, thicker, growing longer, feels really lush. However, as soon as you pregnant and the estrogen levels decline, the hair cycle will shift around to the resting phase and the shedding phase. And then, you know, you it definitely can prolong the growing phase. Also, you may experience an increase in hair on the body. This is for women, facial hair, body hair, maybe your leg hair is growing quite a bit. That women in pregnancy will observe as it relates to the increase in estrogen. You might even notice this also with taking in hormone replacement therapy, oral contraceptive pills, is that while you take these medications, they make your hair grow like wildfire. Men, not so much. All right, men, they tend to in scenarios where their estrogen is too high. They tend to actually have sparser body hair. They might lose their underarm hair, the hair on their arms, their pubic hair may go down quite a bit. um and also may lose quite a bit of their facial hair as a result of the increase in estrogen. Now, the other thing that having too much estrogen might definitely play a key role in influencing the development of is actually stretch marks. Now, if you watched any of my videos on stretch marks, the medical term for which is stria. I always tell you guys that some people make them, other people don and those who make them will make them, and those who don difficult to predict if a woman during pregnancy will or will not develop stretch marks. Stretch marks happen when you have a rapid expansion of the skin surface area. It stretches rapidly and the skin kind of can and you get these stretch marks. They usually appear reddish purple in the early stages that and then they turn white. If they are treated in the early stages when they are reddish purple a lot easier to tackle as opposed to once they turn white then they are very very stubborn to improve. But there is likely an influence of estrogen in whether or not someone develops them. They also may develop in men who are say bodybuilding putting on a lot of muscle. Maybe they are taking exogenous testosterone you know as part of performance enhancement goals and maybe they are as a result having elevations in their estrogens. Well, estrogen can influence the amount of ground substance in the deeper layers of the skin and also can have an impact on um how close together the collagen fibers are. And so these factors may influence and and lead to a greater likelihood of stretch mark development in these situations where you have a sudden stretching force on the skin with weight gain or with putting on a lot of muscle. also can be seen in people who have a lot of central atyposity as well as in patients who have endstage liver disease. They develop acites, accumulation of fluid in the abdomen, stretching of the skin, they can develop really prominent stretch marks. So those are some of the main skin warning signs. Also, men whose estrogen levels are too high in addition to loss of facial, pubic, axillary, which means underarm, arm hair, they also may develop testicular atrophy, smaller testicles, and breast development. That gynecomastia. So, if you notices that you hair, your underarm hair, you developing little prominent dilated blood vessels and you have the beginnings of breast development and testicular atrophy, those are warning signs that your estrogen is way too high. But your skin is very, very sensitive to changes in levels of estrogen hormones. There are a ton of estrogen receptors throughout our skin on different skin cells including the keratinocytes which are the cells that make up the bulk of the epidermis on the fiberblast the cells that produce collagen as well as on the sea the cells that make up the oil gland and of course the hair follicle and estrogen is hitting those receptors and doing all sorts of things. When estrogen is too high, you can see skin changes, hyperpigmentation, vascular changes. Maybe even an added benefit you might appreciate, especially if you are taking say oral contraceptive pills, is that if you skin starts to clear up because it can reduce sebum output. But then, you know, you also may develop hyperpigmentation, mealasma as well. A lot of what we know about estrogen come from studying women as they approach pmenopause and go through menopause and experience a decline in estrogen. Just like what we have covered in today skin and hair signs that estrogen is too high. Well, your skin can also have a lot of things to say about estrogen being too low. And you may be wondering, well, what does that look like? You going to want to watch the video on the ends slate because I cover this exact topic there. So, watch that one next, especially if you are a woman so you might have some understanding of what can go on during menopause and thereafter with your skin in the setting of declining estrogen levels. I really hope this video was informative to you guys out there who maybe are wondering about this. Again, it can impact both men and women. If you all enjoyed this video, give it a thumbs up, share it with your friends, and as always, don forget sunscreen and subscribe. I talk to you guys tomorrow. Bye. [Music]	Success
8 SIGNS OF PCOS // SKIN SIGNS OF POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME // DERMATOLOGIST @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri_QEczD-Dc	Dr Day	well hey guys i dermatologist and in this video we going to be going over eight signs of polycystic ovary syndrome or pcos this is a pretty common condition that affects women of reproductive age it characterized by elevated levels of the male hormones androgens as well as irregular periods and in some cases the ovaries can become enlarged and cystic hence the name polycystic ovary syndrome and women who deal with pcos many times have high levels of the hormone insulin this puts them at risk for a variety of health problems and a lot of the signs of pcos that i to be covering in today do with high levels of insulin and high levels of androgens now to be clear the signs i video they if you have any of these it doesn that you have pcos number one is severe inflammatory acne people with pcos often deal with really stubborn acne that often affects the lower face like the jawline the chin as well as the neck and the upper chest this likely has to do with elevations in those androgen hormones because your pores have receptors for those androgen hormones and when the androgens bind there it leads to enlargement in your oil gland and increased production of oil which is part of why you get acne and it also causes the lining of the pore the cells that line the pore to kind of proliferate abnormally and get sticky and lead to plugging of the pores and with all that increase in oil or sea bomb there lives in our pore called cutie bacterium acnes and it kind of gets a little bit too comfortable and there is an inflammatory response you have pretty inflammatory deep cystic painful acne in pcos it is estimated that roughly 19 to 37 percent of adult women with severe inflammatory acne actually have pcos so it is a trigger to consider a diagnosis of pcos in a woman an adult woman who has acne that is new for the first time as an adult or acne that is really stubborn to typical treatments like benzoyl peroxide or retinoid now within your skin there are actually enzymes that convert those male hormones to an even more potent form and that is what leads to acne flares and some people regardless of having pcos or not they have enzyme activity in their skin that is more robust and so there is a lot of person-to-person variability as far as this inflammatory acne number two seborrhea that is a medical term for oiliness and i you have oily skin when you have pcos it androgen hormones they signal to the oil gland to increase in size and to increase oil output and you know you think about that with acne which we already talked about but there oily skin condition that in pcos called seborrheic dermatitis and it sees patches of red oily skin with kind of an overlying yellow scaliness and a variant of that affects the scalp and is called dandruff so dandruff is actually seborrheic dermatitis it the oiliness of the scalp and people with pcos they have more sebum more oil production as a result of having those the increase in androgen hormones seborrheia dermatitis it can affect the face like around your eyebrows around your nose like the corners of your mouth even the forehead and it also again can affect the scalp many people with pcos they describe their hair as very oily and always having an oily scalp oil production a lot of people think there that is causing the oiliness but oil production sebum production it is governed by hormones so people with pcos they have a strong hormonal input to their oil gland to make more oil that is why they have a greasy scalp oftentimes and why they have greasier skin and are more prone to acne number three is hirsutism what the heck is hirsutism hirsutism is a medical term that describes coarse terminal hair growth in a male pattern so having hair growth on the chin the chest the neck the back the lower abdomen and the areola around the nipple can be a sign of pcos the reason for that is that the hair follicles at these body sites are more sensitive to the male hormones androgens which are elevated in many cases in people with pcos and that triggers those follicles to produce a coarse terminal hair as opposed to the typical peach fuzz vellus hair that is ordinarily there there is a lot of person-to-person variability in terms of the sensitivity of the hair follicles in that area to androgens which we all have so just because you have a few hairs here and there that doesn you have pcos there are certain ethnicities who perhaps due to genetic variant differences are more likely to have terminal hair in this area and it not be related to pcos for example people who are of south asian descent are more likely to to deal with this whereas people who are of japanese descent are less likely to even if they have pcos so there is a lot of person-to-person variability and ethnicity your ethnicity can certainly influence whether or not you have this it has to do with the activity of that enzyme 5 alpha reductase so some hair follicles and some body sites they going to respond to androgens you going to convert them to the more potent form and that terminal hair growth changing from a bellis hair to a terminal hair whereas hair follicles on other body sites namely your scalp respond to these androgens in the opposite way and that is what brings me to the fourth sign of pcos and that is hair loss androgenetic alopecia on the scalp the hair follicles are sensitive to those androgens and that enzyme 5-alpha reductase that converts the androgens to more potent form it does that and the result on like the scalp is that the follicles instead of making coarse terminal hair they convert to a little baby vellus hair and that is why you have androgenetic alopecia or pattern hair loss now a lot of women deal with this who do not have pcos again as the name implies it has to do with both the androgens as well as a genetic tendency towards it but women with pcos are more likely to have androgenetic alopecia because oftentimes they have elevated circulating androgen levels that their hair follicle on their head responds to you by miniaturizing they can present in one of two ways one is a female pattern of hair loss in which the central part widens but you have preservation of your frontal hairline the second way is more of a male pattern of hair loss that women can develop in which you get receding of the temporal and frontal hair loss hairline with thinning of the vertex that men but women can have that pattern as well all right up into this point i covered four signs these signs are signs of pcos that reflect androgen excess but remember at the beginning of the video i pointed out that people with pcos also deal with high levels of the hormone insulin and this puts them at risk for a variety of metabolic issues diabetes and there are several skin signs of high insulin probably one of the most common is a condition called acanthosis cans i video but to remind you this is a skin finding where you have these thick they don or look like velvet in my opinion regardless there are these thickened brown uh areas of skin most often on the sides of the neck the nape of the neck it can happen on the sides of the face on the backs of your hands and commonly it happens in the armpits you can also have this in the groin and it happens because those high levels of insulin bind to receptors on the skin cells and cause proliferation meaning division and growth and that results in thickening of the skin there and these skin lesions they stubborn to treatment in some cases if the insulin levels come under control through medication or lifestyle changes then the acanthosis niagara cans can improve so acanthosis cans is seen in situations where you have hyperinsulinemia which often goes along with having pcos and in many times there is obesity as well so not all women who have pcos are overweight or obese but in many cases there are and the obesity actually the fat stores especially the abdominal fat it actually kind of contributes to the disease further because believe it or not there is hormonal activity coming from the fat tissue itself and so that kind of drives some of this and then the insulin resistance piece of that is related as well to the obesity so that further is what underscores having eight camphosus niagara cans along with being overweight or obese and having hyperinsulinemia and pcos comes stretch marks the medical term for this is striae distense why stretch marks form it due to rapid expansion in the tissues but in the case of pcos and insulin resistance as you know honestly not entirely understood why perhaps due to you know obesity and weight gain in adolescence in early adulthood number seven is another finding that goes along with hyperinsulinemia or high levels of that insulin hormone in pcos skin tags a lot of skin tags a medical term for skin tags are acrocordons and a lot of times people with pcos hyperinsulinemia and or obesity they will have the acanthosis niagara cans like in their armpits and they will have tons of these skin tags the skin tags can also happen on the sides of the neck um on the chest under the breast anywhere where you have skin on skin contact and a lot of friction these things can pop up they soft bumps sometimes they i have a whole video talking about how these are treated so if you with a lot of them check that video out it is old but the treatment is still the same so i will link that down below in the description box for you along with my video on acanthosis niagara cans but yeah this is a really common finding in insulin resistance now a lot of people develop these throughout their lifetime so it doesn necessarily mean that you have you know you diabetes or that you have pcos but it is really common in these groups and a common finding and and people with pcos and then last but not least it necessarily you know a sign per se of pcos but they often go together and they have many of the same overlapping issues like having high insulin levels diabetes risks many of the same chronic disease risks and they often come along with one another and that is a condition called hidradenitis sapurativa i have again a video all about this condition but it these boils for lack of a better word that develop under the armpits in the groin area around the buttocks they really really painful and they can form what mean it to live with and it is closely linked with pcos not everybody who has hidradenitis sapurativa has pcos but they are tightly linked all right you guys so those are eight signs of pcos now obviously i dermatologist so i signs of pcos but you know to make a diagnosis of pcos it blood work to rule out other things it is largely a diet it exclusion so you know blood work has to be done to rule out other things like a thyroid abnormality for example other medical conditions but there are a lot of medical diseases that people with pcos are at increased risk for i already mentioned type 2 diabetes because of the high levels of insulin and because people with pcos have irregular periods they have problems with ovulating then they are obviously at risk then for fertility issues and so that can definitely be a source of struggle and emotional distress for women who cope with pcos now if women with pcos they can get pregnant either with or without fertility treatments and when they become pregnant they are at increased risk for gestational diabetes which is a type of diabetes that develops in pregnancy and it can go away after you deliver or it can persist after you deliver and so you are you know at an increased risk for that if you have pcos pcos is also a risk factor for cardiovascular disease likely because you have a risk of type 2 diabetes and high levels you know because of the high levels of insulin and that goes along with having lipid abnormalities if there you know that ties in all those things tie into a risk for heart disease people with pcos also are at risk for obstructive sleep apnea so if you have this and you by your partner or family member uh somebody who you know is around when you it could be something called sleep apnea which basically is where you don sleep where you don and you you kind of stop breathing quite literally if you have this weight loss can help also you may have to wear a device called a cpap sleep apnea it actually untreated sleep apnea is quite deadly uh you can develop all sorts of chronic health problems from becoming you know not getting oxygen as you sleep headaches high blood pressure now because pcos you have ovulatory dysfunction your menstrual cycle is not normal and a risk with that is an increased risk for endometrial cancer as well also at an increased risk for fatty liver and mental health problems people with pcos are at increased risk for psychiatric illness and depression and anxiety for example so as you can see this is a disease where there are multiple consequences to your total body health so there are a variety of treatments for pcos that address some of the different issues so i into detail as to all the treatments i do have a lot of videos on hormonal therapies birth control pills for acne i have a video on i also have a video on hormonal hair loss treatments i have videos on treatment of androgenetic alopecia so i of those in today a lot of treatments that we use for people with pcos to control the skin manifestations and the hair loss the hair growth so there there so those are the eight signs of pcos i hope this video was helpful to you all now on the end slate i to put my video on the signs of diabetes since a lot of people who have pcos you know they have insulin resistance so check that out that you video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen and subscribe i guys tomorrow bye

Signs Of Lupus Not To Miss | Butterfly Rash & MORE	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWRChysg4_M	Dr Day	skin signs of lupus there are many celebrities at this point who have been very open about their struggles with lupus lupus is a chronic inflammatory condition that can affect the skin and by raising awareness about this condition a lot of people are searching for more information about lupus so in today going to be explaining what lupus is and I findings of Lupus what they look like so that you can have a better understanding of this condition now lupus is actually an umbrella term for several different conditions lupus in general is a chronic inflammatory condition that can affect pretty much any organ system in your body like your liver your kidneys your brain your heart your lungs and your skin and when it involves your skin we call that cutaneous lupus cutaneous lupus can show up in a variety of different ways it can be a widespread scay rash on your back it can be the classic butterfly facial rash where you have redness overlying the cheeks and nose some people develop thick round scaly ratches on their face that lead to scarring cutaneous lupus can also lead to the development of painful sores in your mouth in your nose it can affect the skin on your scalp leading to scarring permanent hair loss generally speaking when people say lupus they are referring to the most common type of Lupus which is systemic lupus emosis this is the most common and the most concerning the most severe as it can impact pretty much any organ system in your body like your liver your kidneys your lungs your heart your brain systemic lupus aratos SLE is an autoimmune disease an autoimmune disease is one in which your immune system attacks your own body it can be attacking your joints your heart your lungs in the case of cutaneous lupus it can attack your skin but you can actually have Lupus just in the skin you can just have cutaneous lupus not systemic lupus athemis meaning it potentially impacting various other organ systems in your body and there are a lot of types of cutaneous lupus that for the most part are just skin lupus I different lupus rashes where the rashes are clue that the lupus is pretty much just in the skin and for the most part remains a skin only type of Lupus the number one most common type is called discoid lupus athetosis with this condition you get these round disk shaped rashes that happen on the face the scalp these tend to be very scaly and sometimes they look as though they have very prominent pores especially on your face as these patches fade they can leave behind dark marks they can take away the skin color this is this is especially the case in people who have deeper skin tones discoid lupus emosis will go on to scar so it important to have it treated if you familiar with seal he had discoid lupus emosis throughout childhood and so that is what the scars on his face represent and he has been very open about this in the public discoid lupus also again can affect the scalp and lead to scarring permanent hair loss in the areas where it is arising in the scalp the second type of skin only lupus is called tumid lupus this is not very common you get these firm raised rashes bumps often on the chest for whatever reason um in contrast to discoid lupus these resolve with no sign they were ever there they don hypopigmentation and importantly they do not Scar the other type that remains a skin only lupus is called chill blaines chill blaes you get these itchy little red bumps on like the fingers the toes can also happen on your ears your elbows your knees and your nose when you are exposed to cold damp conditions it has this kind of Dusky purple color I actually already have a video all about this type of skin lupus which I to link Down Below in the description box so if you deal with this or similar related conditions where you get um little bumps on the hands when you are exposed to cold damp climates then you out I type that remains in the skin is called lupus profundus or it also goes by the name lupus peniculus and this is lupus affecting really deep parts of the skin namely the fat panniculitis just means inflammation of the fat so in this type of skin lupus it coming into the fat in the skin and this leads to these painful nodules as these deep-seated lumps heal up they leave behind permanent Hollows so as you can imagine treating this ASAP is key to prevent it from going on to heal this way which can as you can imagine be quite debilitating and disfiguring but as far as skin lupus that is more in keeping with oh this person might just have stuff going on internally there are two main types the first is called Subacute cutaneous lupus arithmos es this rash develops pretty quickly with sun exposure and consists of these round ring-shaped raised red flaky rashes it can have a purplish appearance and deeper skin tones they have a really scaly flaky border and honestly a lot of times they can be misdiagnosed as psoriasis and even eczema cuz they kind of can look this rash can look similar to those other skin conditions so that Subacute cutaneous lupus and then there is acute cutaneous lupus and acute cutaneous lupus is probably what actually most people are familiar with when they think about lupus and that is that butterfly rash otherwise known as a malar rash where you have a redish uh rash over the nose and cheeks and it usually appears after being in the sun sun does elicit this and it is a manifestation of systemic lupus aatos this is actually one of the diagnostic criteria um and if you have the butterfly rash it that you see um your health care provider a dermatologist a rheumatologist for further workout now that being said there are a lot of facial rashes that actually happen in this area and can look like the butterfly rash but are not it so whatever you do don diagnose yourself as having um systemic lupus arithmos for example rosacea can kind of look like a butterfly rash um sebc dermatitis also can look like a butterfly rash if you familiar with the subtle differences between these it so just keep that in mind that not every rash that happens in this area is a true lupus butterfly rash aside from the butterfly rash though sometimes a cute cutaneous lupus consisted of an eruption of like red bumps like on the chest the arms even the legs there are two other types of skin lupus that uh just to confuse you even fur further affect the skin but but we don them cutaneous lupus aerosis proper because they if you will in terms of of how they go the first is actually neonatal lupus yes newborn babies can be born with lupus in the skin it when babies are born with uh neonatal lupus it can present with a rash of round raised red rings on their face on their um upper chest and their scalp the these round rings are scaly but importantly they will go away when the baby is maybe a few months and they do not Scar the rash in the newborn does not need to be treated however the newborn does need to be followed carefully because this type of uh neonatal lupus as it some other organ systems their liver their blood counts and their heart it actually can cause a um problem with conduction in the heart and a slowed heartbeat and neonatal lupus is unique because it actually passing lupus antibodies to the baby so if you weren are in our mother um these important proteins called antibodies that that help fight off infection but we get some of them passively from our mother so we are born with some of mom she donates some to us but if Mom has antibodies that are autoimmune in nature she can pass those to baby and baby can have them for the first few months of Life causing things like well neonatal lupus so that this happens but as a baby grows up those antibody levels drop they wne cuz the baby donated to the baby from Mom and so the baby is you know the rash clears up and you monitor the baby for some of these other organ system things but um it doesn going to be negatively impacted the other one that somewhat nebulous territory of not really full-blown cutaneous lupus uh cuz it follows sort of it goes to the beat of its own drum so to speak is drug induced uh lupus uh so there are a variety of medications that you might take can actually trigger a lupus like illness drug induced lupus can happen after taking a medication for months to years the reason this isn you know really classified is a true lupus is that this will go away once that offending medication is stopped Minocycline is an antibiotic that we prescribe in dermatology sometimes for different skin conditions and actually it cause this potentially and I heard from some of you guys that you developed um drug induced lupus while you are on minoc cycling so it certainly can happen drug induced lupus from a medication can cause a skin rash but for some people there just have like some joint pains shortness of breath discomfort with their chest their heart maybe a little bit of a fever um lupus symptom DS but then again you know if it the medication needs to be stopped obviously then those things go away and that all that at this point in the video hopefully you have an understanding the fact that lupus is a chronic inflammatory condition that can present in many different ways there are many different variants of it and so one person different from another person is there a cure for Lupus no um short answer no there is no cure for Lupus unfortunately whether it be systemic lupus or lupus that is primarily in the skin there is no true cure but there are medications and treatments that control the disease and that is really important because as you can imagine this can be pretty debilitating life-threatening I mean it can affect your your internal organs to the point where you know as you requiring organ transplants because of their Loop pretty serious illness okay um so there medications that can control that autoimmune attack these medications can leave the individual imuno compromised okay so they have to be really careful about their health and they have to be really careful to protect themselves from infection while there is no cure for Lupus there are some caveats with those two types that are kind of out there in the nebulus territory and that is neonatal lupus will go away when the baby is um you know usually around 4 months of age it clear up but they can be left with in some cases permanent problems with the conduction in the heart that will require lifelong treatment but the disease process of Lupus is not ongoing for them because it was that short temporary window of time where they had mom were wreaking Hab the those antibodies naturally fell away and so that the disease process naturally resolves but they are they can be left with permanent sequella in their heart permanent heart problems the heart problem doesn born with neonatal lupus but it something that we check for and monitor for and then also the drug induced lupus will go away once you stop the offending medication so in the case of min cycling if you discontinue the minoc cycling the rash if you have drug induced lupus with a rash will go away or the symptoms if you have drug induced lupus without a rash will go away um so those are kind of the exceptions but by you know in general no there treatment is a must to control because as you can imagine if you do not treat and control the lupus in the skin it goes on to scar and cause permanent disfigurement and when it scalp it cause it can cause permanent hair loss how long does a Lupus rash last well it depends on the type of rash that you have in the case of the butterfly rash that again triggered usually by sun exposure uh often lasts anywhere from a few days to weeks and then it but if you have a deeper skin tone it can leave behind hyperpigmentation discoid lupus arithmos on the other hand those round disk shaped thick raised rashes those will persist for months to years and as they resolve they do heal with a scar if intervened on early though when they first pop up and or the you know the patient is on a medication to prevent them from popping up then they will not you know pop up and go on to scar and if they first pop up it decreases the likelihood of scarring what is the cause of Lupus well again it is an autoimmune disease but your genetics play a big role there are over a hundred different genes that can be inherited that lead to someone risk for lupus and then there are certain triggers that are thought to turn on those genes so not everyone who inherits those genes will go on to have Lupus that trying to figure things out um but there component to lupus so let triggers for Lupus because this is a big one that anyone who lives with lupus needs to be aware of there are many different triggers and avoiding triggers is key one major trigger is ultraviolet radiation from the Sun of course from a tanning bed but also from fluorescent lighting which isn once was but fluorescent light bulbs can produce a small amount of ultraviolet radiation that isn most people but for people with a lupus it actually can potentially precipitate their disease the other major trigger is cigarettes um cigarettes are a big uh source of gasoline in the fire that is autoimmune inflammatory diseases in general but especially lupus so if you smoke you have to quit um not just tobacco cigarettes but also vaping the other big trigger that can be hard to avoid is infection certain medications like I already mentioned minoc cycling can of course trigger drug induced lupus but uh if you have Lupus another thing that cautious with is dietary supplements because many dietary supplements adversely affect the per performance of Lupus medications so always discuss with your doctor your rheumatologist any dietary supplements because they definitely can mess up your lupus treatments stress is another big trigger I mean if you are stressed to the point where it your sleep you is that is definitely something that can fuel a lupus flare also major illnesses you know if you get um in a car accident or if you undergo surgery that scenario where you have to you know be careful and of course you know some patients with lupus they end up having to go on go into surgery because the lupus ends up damaging organs like their kidneys for example and so they have to go on a lot of medications to control their immune system uh and these medications can have side effects side effects that impact their appearance and I because I know that one celebrity in particular um actually maybe another another one recently too I think I heard they get a lot of criticism for the changes in their appearance and it like try being on high high do prazone for weeks at a time and we good you look okay like I really I think it regardless of if you had this disease or Not My Hope with this video is that now you have some understanding of what people with lupus live with and deal with so that maybe maybe you your mouth shut the next time some random stranger passes You by and you feel compelled to comment on their appearance because this is an example where you never know what someone is going through and lupus can have a huge impact on someone it be the skin rashes or side effects from the medications who gets lupus um I already mentioned obviously the genetic component so having a family member close family member with lupus put you obviously at greater risk CU it likely you inherited any one of those hundreds of genes but certain subtypes of Lupus are more common in some groups of people discoid lupus arithmos that the type of Lupus that can go on to scar but it only affects the skin that is most common in black people um and then systemic lupus emosis the systemic disease that can impact your organs most common in black women is also very common in Hispanic women and Asian women but no matter the type of Lupus treatment is key to prevent it from going on to have more debilitating disfiguring consequences whether it be to your skin or to your internal organs it is something that people who have it deal with for life for the most part the exceptions being neonatal and drug induced lupus all right guys that is what I wanted to say in today with regards to skin signs of lupus I hope this video was educational informative you learned something and that it clarified and questions you might have had about Lupus if you guys liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen And subscribe I to you guys tomorrow bye [Music]	Success
SIGNS OF HORMONE IMBALANCE IN WOMEN ?? DERMATOLOGIST @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-08q84BQqkg	Dr Day	well hey guys in today going to be doing a deep dive into hormonal acne and i answering your questions about when exactly blood work may be necessary to figure out if there is a problem with your hormones but before getting into it give this video a thumbs up if you like skincare content from a board-certified dermatologist be sure you and you have your bell notifications on that way youtube will let you know as soon as my videos go live hormonal acne often in reference to acne that occurs in adult women most often in the jawline with these red painful bumps as well as closed comidones otherwise known as whiteheads on the forehead and it is largely influenced by hormones especially with changes in the menstrual cycle around breastfeeding menopause however truthfully all acne is hormonal hormones are what plays a role in the production of sebum otherwise known as oil some people more sensitive to certain hormones they produce more oil and are more acne prone it have to think about the hormones but adult acne in women tends to have a large hormonal component to it a handful of treatments do in fact target the hormonal component of acne but nothing that you can buy over the counter that you apply to the skin really addresses that issue androgen hormones namely testosterone and the potent form of testosterone dihydrotestosterone are what play a role in hormonal acne hormones like insulin-like growth factor as well as the stress hormone cortisol likewise can lead to more sebum production while acne and adult women can be a sign of androgen excess it not always the case and in many cases hormone levels are actually completely normal it may be the fact that the follicle in certain individuals aka the poor is a lot more sensitive to hormones that are normally present in everyone body so it waste of resources to just check hormones warning signs that there is an underlying problem with the hormones that warrant actual testing of the hormones include parasitism which is the development of hair growth and more of a male pattern like growth on the chest the chin the neck coarse dark terminal hairs that would be a red flag for an underlying hormonal problem that would need to be checked with blood work if you and you pattern hair loss otherwise known as androgenetic alopecia this is a type of hair loss in which the hair follicles are very sensitive to those male hormones and you get miniaturization of the hairs that leads to thinning typically starts presenting as a widening of the central part i have a lot of videos on androgenetic alopecia but if you had a patient who for the first time and maybe a long time or for the first time ever as an adult is getting really inflammatory acne has failed multiple different types of treatment and is also showing signs of androgenetic alopecia this might be a reason to check hormones the sign that there is a problem with the hormones is something called viralization in women that clitoromegaly along with other signs of androgen excess adult acne coupled with problems with fertility would also be a reason to consider more blood work to check the hormone levels likewise if you are having irregular infrequent periods known as oligomenorrhea or if you have had a complete absence of a period amenorrhea that is a red flag that hormone testing may likely be beneficial for you and importantly if out of the blue out of nowhere you have the sudden onset of severe cystic acne that would suggest there may be something underlying going on probably the most common situation that off needing to check blood work is polycystic ovary syndrome here not only can you have inflammatory adult acne but you also can have hirsutism androgenetic alopecia and irregular periods or amenorrhea as well as infertility so if you acne plus some of these other signs and symptoms there doctor is going to want to check some additional blood work to evaluate for hyperandrogenism are they going to check every single hormone no that wouldn make sense first thing they want to check is a free and total testosterone free testosterone is commonly elevated in women who have pcos not always but it is commonly elevated but reasons for hyperandrogenism are not just pcos if you have a total testosterone greater than 200 nanograms per deciliter that actually very strongly suggestive that you might have a tumor in your ovaries producing high amounts of androgens another possible reason besides pcos and an ovarian tumor is some people are born with problems with how the hormones are produced in the adrenal gland and a blood test to check for that is 17 hydroxy progesterone 17 hydroxy progesterone levels greater than 200 nanograms per deciliter suggest a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia if you work done to check hormone levels there checked something called dheas kind of gives us a snapshot of hormone production from the adrenal glands other labs that can be helpful in this situation are checking the ratio of luteinizing hormone to follicle stimulating hormone otherwise known as lh and fsh a ratio of lh to fsh greater than three to one suggests possible pcos if the patient is also complaining of a headache we might check something called prolactin because uh they may actually have a problem in the pituitary gland um a tumor there causing headache and increased amounts of the hormone prolactin and we may check something called sex hormone binding globulin when it comes to these hormone labs though in women it them the right time want to check these levels during the early morning in the first three days of the menstrual cycle it also important that if you are already on any type of hormonal therapy like birth control pills you need to be off of these medications for at least six weeks prior to having these labs drawn in order to get accurate results other relevant labs in this situation are going to include a fasting blood glucose and fasting lipid because in the case of say for example pcos you can have some abnormalities in these profiles as well it may be worthwhile checking cortisol and it may also be worthwhile to check thyroid stimulating hormone to evaluate for a possible thyroid disease speaking of thyroid if you missed my video on the nail signs of thyroid disease definitely check that out i also have another video as a side note on the skin signs of hypothyroid or low thyroid disease so check those out because it kind of you know may go along with what we talking about here you may be interested in that so those are the labs that may be checked but just as a reminder not always is this necessary a lot of adult women have hormonal acne and there have a problem with the hormone levels it may just be more so that the follicles in the skin are a lot more sensitive to hormones so in many cases blood work is simply not necessary it change anything it identify anything new it that you have a problem with the hormones if all you have for example is really stubborn acne and you don have any of these other signs and symptoms so to go through the process of trying to get the blood work at the right time uh fasting in the first three days of the menstrual cycle sometimes it a waste of effort and not helpful to you as a patient more of a headache and it doesn any new information so everything is always taken together when we about a patient it one-size-fits-all approach that you might need blood work but real quick i for hormonal acne in women first is oral contraceptive pills now i have a whole video going into detail about what the best oral contraceptive pill is for acne so check that out i explain more about birth control pills and the treatment of acne specifically it estrogen component of oral contraceptive pills that helps to provide some control in terms of sebum production not only does it lower sebum production but oral contraceptive pills the estrogen component also lowers free testosterone and it also raises something called sex hormone binding globulin again the more sex hormone binding globulin that you have the less free testosterone you going to have circulating around to cause breakouts in the skin oral contraceptive pills also can inhibit the enzyme 5-alpha reductase which is responsible for converting testosterone to the more potent form dihydrotestosterone it dihydrotestosterone that is a key player in not only acne but in female pattern hair loss oral contraceptive pills also can decrease ovarian and adrenal production of androgens with oral contraceptive pills alone you can get anywhere from a 40 to 70 reduction in the number of acne lesions that control pills but another medication that is prescribed for hormonal acne is going to be spironolactone this is a what sparing diuretic it pressure pill but at doses between 50 to 100 milligrams per day it actually can inhibit androgens it can be used alone or in conjunction with oral contraceptive pills so efficacy rates with spironolactone vary anywhere from 33 to 85 percent reduction in the number of acne spots spironolactone also can improve hirsutism and it can be used at higher doses to treat androgenetic alopecia i have a video as a side note all about spironolactone for androgenetic alopecia so check that video out if you missed it i down below so those are medications that can be given to women for the hormonal component of acne they indicated or safe to use in men can men get hormonal acne as i said at the beginning of this video all acne has a hormonal component to it while men can medications we do have a newer medication called when levy which is a medication you put on the skin rather than a pill that you take by mouth and it can be used in men and women and it addresses the hormonal component of acne that hormonal component driving oiliness in the skin it can safely be used in men and women it is a newer medication and for the most part it that is really useful as a standalone treatment but rather as an add-on so for example if you using another type of acne treatment getting decent results adding on this new medication may get you even better results so that everything about hormonal acne on the end slate i recent video all about this new hormonal medication when levy so definitely check that out if you just click on the thumbnail on the insulate it to that video but i hope you guys enjoyed this if so give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen and subscribe i guys tomorrow bye [Music] you	Success
What Your Nails Say About Your Thyroid	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_unnFrtBnfg	Dr Day	take a look at your nails because did you know that they can show signs of a problem with your thyroid gland that right and in this video we be going over the nail findings of thyroid disease but before we get into it make sure you give this video a thumbs up if you like getting your skincare content from a board-certified dermatologist be sure and subscribe turn the Bell notifications on that way you know as soon as my videos go live give me a follow over on Instagram and Tik Tok because I skincare content on those platforms as well nail bindings can be a really helpful early clue to an underlying problem with the thyroid gland what the heck is thyroid hormone anyway you have probably heard people talk about thyroid maybe you even know somebody who has a problem with their thyroid whether it be hyperthyroidism or hypothyroid they probably have to take medication maybe they have to see their doctor pretty regularly for checkups to make sure the thyroid hormone is on track but what exactly is thyroid hormone it is a hormone that helps control our metabolism it for a variety of other bodily functions and it in babies thyroid hormone is made in the thyroid gland a small gland that sits in the front of your neck thyroid hormone which is an umbrella term for thyroxin or T4 and triiodo thyronine T3 T3 is the active form of thyroid hormone T4 is inactive but T4 can be converted to T3 the active form of thyroid your thyroid gland also makes calcitonin another hormone that controlling the levels of calcium in your blood thyroid disease is actually really common you can have too much thyroid hormone or you can have too little thyroid hormone too much thyroid hormone is called hyperthyroidism the most common reason for that is something called Graves disease too little thyroid or hypothyroidism can be due to iodine deficiency or more commonly an autoimmune disease called Hashimoto thyroid hyper thyroidism typically presents with an increase in the heart rate you very sweaty feel jittery and maybe be losing weight and the skin feels warm and damp hypothyroidism on the other hand or low thyroid hormone kind of presents the opposite decrease in heart rate you feel sluggish lethargic maybe experience weight gain the skin actually feels cold and it cold because your metabolism is slowed down but before these signs appear you actually can have nail findings first as an early clue one of the most common nail findings associated with thyroid disease is something called coo nikkia or spoon Nails spoon Nails Nikia Coos is Greek for spoon the reason they actually look like a spoon this is a type of nail distrophy in which the nail plate is depressed centrally and elevated laterally so it literally looks like a little spoon and one way to assess for this is to look at the nail and take a little drop of water and place it on the nail plate if you have spoon nails that droplet of water will actually stay on the nail plate whereas if you don just like a little cup now kilon Nikia or spoon Nails is certainly not specific for a problem with your thyroid it can be seen in a variety of other issues like iron deficiency anemia psoriasis alopecia Arata diabetes it can be present as a result of trauma to the nails whether that be from aggressive manicuring or maybe something related to your occupation it finding actually in young babies so if you have this don you have a problem with your thyroid but definitely bring it to the attention of your medical provider for evaluation it certainly could be an early sign of low thyroid or high thyroid because it can be seen in both but more commonly it is seen in hyperthyroidism meaning elevated thyroid hormone another really common nail finding associated with thyroid disease is basically very brittle nails 22% of cases of brittle nails associated with thyroid disease were seen in people with autoimmune thyroid problems whereas 19.6% were seen in those with non-autoimmune thyroid disease of these cases roughly 14% were seen with hypothyroid or low thyroid that makes sense remember with low thyroid things are kind of dry slow probably have poor blood flow to the nails as a result of trying to keep the body warm Vaso constriction peripherally it have decreased blood flow to the fingertips that your hands and feet often feel cold along with the brittle nails the nail plate can be much thinner you can have little white spots that nikkia and the nail plate can actually lift off that of anlysis this is another really common finding across the board in people who have thyroid disease anlysis refers to a separation of the nail plate from the underlying structures and as it lifts up air gets underneath the nail plate looks like a big white smear a big white spot most often it the tip of the nail but it can expand to move down to close to close to the uh half Moons it looks white but it basically air as that nail plate is lifting off on a colesis like Kon nikkia certainly is not at all specific for thyroid disease it can be seen in a lot of other things uh traumatic manicuring practices it can be seen in pregnancy again with psoriasis people who have hyperhydrosis or excessive sweating can also deal with anlysis now I mentioned however that people who have hyperthyroidism they often deal with excessive sweating so perhaps the anlysis that they deal with as a nail finding may actually reflect to a certain extent the excessive sweating that they may be experiencing due to elevations in thyroid hormone but again it dealing with this definitely bring it to the attention of your healthc care provider they can assess you and your symptoms and determine if it to check blood work to see if you have a problem with the thyroid so I mentioned at the beginning of the video you have hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism low thyroid and high thyroid what nail findings are more common with each of these types with hypothyroidism or low thyroid again that kind of sluggish you may experience weight gain uh dry cold skin the most common nail finding in hypothyroidism is actually fragile nails and that makes sense again because the blood vessels are probably clamping down in an effort to preserve core body temperature you not getting good circulation to the nails so it healthy strong nails so uh fragility of the nail plate is probably the most common finding in hypothyroidism reported in 70% of cases along with that is slow growth now normally the nails grow roughly 3 and 1/2 mm a month which is the equivalent of about a tenth of a millimeter a day but in hypothyroidism it that your nails are really brittle growing very slowly that may be a clue that your thyroid hormone is low and along with that the nail plate itself is thin that is another very common finding in hypothyroidism so you slow growing thin nails and then the fourth most common finding in hypothyroidism for the nails is going to be that on aysus the nail plate actually physically lifting up off of the underlying structures air getting underneath and you get that big white spot less commonly in hypothyroidism you can have something called Luca Nikia which means white spots on the nails the white spots can either be little white dots or lines it lucania is certainly not specific ific for thyroid problems you can have lucania as a result of traumatic nail practices like uh pulling off your nail polish that actually can cause a lucania pushing your cuticles back aggressively can cause lucania less commonly in hypothyroidism you also can have striped nails or nail pitting nail pitting is exactly what it sounds like little tiny Pits on the nail plate this again not specific to thyroid disease you can see it in alopecia area which is an autoimmune disease where you have patches of hair loss but you also can have nail pitting and alopecia Arata you can have it in eczema and you can have it in psoriasis so again it specific but if you nail changes again bring it to the attention of your healthc care provider what are the most common nail findings of hyper thyroidism again that your thyroid hormone is High um maybe from graves disease and the most common nail finding with hyperthyroidism is actually konia the spoon Nails Now spoon nails again not specific for hyperthyroidism and it actually can also occur in hypothyroidism but more commonly it hyperthyroidism again that put a little droplet of water on the nail plate and it stays just in place it doesn got a depression in the middle of the nail plate and the edges are elevated laterally the second most common finding in hyperthyroidism is actually softening of the nail plate kind of crumbly Nails in hyperthyroidism nail growth is usually normal or increased anlysis is actually the third most common nail finding in hyperthyroidism while anlysis is more common in hypothyroidism it certainly can happen in hyper thyroidism possibly because you do have maybe in some cases an increase rate of nail growth and the nails are a lot softer so they off the underlying supportive structures and the nails can be very brittle now a uncommon finding in hyperthyroidism it actually OCC in about 1% of patients with Graves disease is something called clubbing in which the fingers actually look like they are clubbed out the reason this happens is that patients who have Graves disease which is an autoimmune disease they make antibody anti-thyroid antibodies and those antibodies actually combined to um keratinocytes endothelial cells fat cells cause them to make more hyaluronic acid and other glycosamino glycans and that leads to swelling of the tissues around the nail and what appears as clubbing this is not very common and certainly wouldn of hyperthyroidism but it does happen in about 1% of patients who have Graves disease patients with hyperthyroidism also can have thinning of the nails and very uncommonly they can also have lucania what is the mechanism behind some of these nail findings in the case of spoon nails with hyperthyroidism especially it some kind of pro prot or amino acid imbalance in hyperthyroidism you have an increase in metabolism so it that you levels of uh amino acids and proteins to support proper nail growth and that why in that situation you to spoon Nails a nail distrophy patients who have hyperthyroidism because of their increase in metabolism they some cases have a decrease in the protein albumin and that may also be a marker here an indicator of a problem with making healthy nail growth in hypothyroidism however you have uh basically a decrease in body temperature secondary to the decrease in basil metabolic rate that happens from having inadequate thyroid levels and with this your body body temperature and it does that by decreasing blood flow to the extremities that is why patients who have low thyro IID they often complain of cold clammy extremities their hands and feet are always feeling cold it body is trying to maintain core body temperature so it clamps down on the blood vessels that go out to the extremities in an effort to redirect blood centrally to keep you warm as it does that as you can imagine with decreased blood flow to the extremities you delivery of nutrients and oxygen necessary to support healthy nail growth that hypothyroid ISM have brittle nails and slow nail growth on the flip side with hyper thyroidism because the metabolic rate is increased you feel very warm and flushed you have peripheral vasod dilation the blood vessels open up peripherally in an effort to release some of that heat so in that case you actually perhaps get better blood flow and that is why in some cases patients with hyperthyroidism have faster nail growth and in the case of graves disease again that body makes antibodies antithyroid antibodies and those antibodies can lead to increased production from fiber Bloss and of hyaluronic acid and glycosaminoglycans this may impact the nail plate and it underlying supportive structures and it also in some cases can lead to clubbing or increase in what looks like tissue swelling around the around the fingernails of the distal of the of the fingertips thyroid disease is a serious condition whether it be hyper thyroid or hypothyroid those are the nail findings associated with Hyper and hypothyroidism I wanted to share this video with you all because untreated thyroid disease is deadly starts out with things like feeling lethargic or feeling jittery depending on what the nature of the underlying thyroid problem is but I want to emphasize that the nail findings I video they with the thyroid so if you have these don conclusion that you have a problem with your thyroid there are many other possible reasons to have these nail findings but they are a clue early on that you may have a thyroid problem and therefore it thyroid levels or for your doctor to check them so that is why I this video not to alarm you if you happen to have some white spots on the nail don attention to your nails because they certainly can be a window to what going on internally show these to your doctor and in some cases it may be necessary to check the thyroid hormone untreated thyroid disease can be deadly there are also a variety of skin and hair findings associated with thyroid disease whether it be hyperthyroid and or hypothyroid I recently did a video on the skin signs of low thyroid so definitely check that one out if you missed it I go over hair findings and different skin findings and a few of these nail findings appear in that video as well yeah who knew that little gland sitting in the front of our neck could have so much control over our bodily functions but it really does when it gets messed up it really can cause a lot of problems and lead to a lot of distress and getting it back on track it distressing thing to go through so whether you hypothyroidism or maybe you experiencing a lot of symptoms right now and you don can be very distressing to feel like uh your body is you know kind of out of control and you don things are going to get back on track it so always discuss your symptoms and any skin or nail or hair findings that you have with your doctor anyways guys I going to wrap it up here but on the end slate I skin signs of hypothyroidism so check that one out for sure but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen And subscribe I to you

BREAKOUT ON THE FACE *NOT ACNE * ?? DERMATOLOGIST @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfTmc2mXggo	Dr Day	I not everything that looks like acne is acne and in this video we talking about a breakout on the face that is not acne and why now more than ever it about this condition but before we get into it give this video a thumbs up make sure you skincare content from a board-certified dermatologist and you have your bell notifications turned on that way YouTube is going to let you know as soon as my videos go live if you acne or rosacea totally separate conditions seeing a dermatologist there oral antibiotic whether that be doxycycline Minocycline there are a whole host of other similar antibiotics that we use to treat these conditions why well while they are antibiotics meaning they help kill off bacteria they also have anti-inflammatory properties and when used for a limited time they can help clear up these skin conditions so that other medications that take a little bit more time to start working can kick in however a problem that can arise especially if there are inconsistencies gaps in care is that you can end up whether you have acne or rosacea being on these antibiotics for a long time there are risks that can occur one such risk is something called a gram-negative folliculitis it basically something that looks like acne but is not acne and why does this happen it actually starts with bacteria in your nose what there are bacteria that live in your nose and they serve a function they help keep your body healthy it normal to have bacteria in your nose however when you prolonged period of time this can actually affect the populations of bacteria in your nose and skew things in a Direction that there are types of bacteria called gram-positive bacteria and there are types of bacteria called gram-negative bacteria when you are on antibiotics for a very long time one thing that can happen is that the populations of bacteria in your nose they get messed up and all of a sudden you have way more gram-negative bacteria in the nose than you should have usually gram-negative bacteria constitute roughly one percent of the bacteria in your nose but in people who have been on prolonged courses of antibiotics this can get messed up so that you have about four percent gram-negative bacteria colonizing your nose and that is too much now in the majority of cases the skewing of the bacteria in the nose on prolonged courses of antibiotics it doesn antibiotics are stopped the bacteria in the nose they population and everything will go back hunky-dory however in a subset of patients what can happen is that those gram-negative bacteria they start to take over and spill into the skin on the face and they can colonize the pre-existing acne lesions or the pre-existing rosacea lesions and you can get a breakout that kind of looks like acne but is not acne it infection and it skin infection it as like your acne that was there to begin with it your rosacea basically what has happened is these bacteria have taken over a bit and gotten into your pores it gram-negative folliculitis so how long is too long be on a course of oral antibiotics for say acne or rosacea truthfully there is no defined window of time there where you would begin to put yourself at risk for this seemingly rare complication gram-negative folliculitis but we generally aim to keep people on oral antibiotic courses for really no longer than three months for say acne and the goal is to be tapering and transitioning them over to other medications that can be used long term safely to control their skin condition for example in the case of acne you guys have seen a lot of my videos here about different topical retinoids for the treatment of acne tretinoin tazeratine altrino check those out by the way if you rosacea likewise there are other treatments but the goal is never to keep people on these oral antibiotics indefinitely because not only can they result in this rare complication called gram-negative folliculitis but can interfere with your gut microbiome and it also can be a situation where the bacteria in your body become resistant and that mentioned this complication gram-negative folliculitis it thought to be pretty rare roughly four percent of acne patients who are on prolonged courses of antibiotics are thought to develop this condition however it why truthfully a lot of clinicians simply don be a tricky condition to to either recognize as well as appropriately diagnosed suffice it to say it something that a lot of people may actually be missing now at the beginning of the video I pointed out why now more than ever it is important for people to be aware of this condition there is a boom uh what are referred to as direct to Consumer Telehealth platforms largely centered around acne and while these can be great they can be fantastic this is a situation where I do think patients consumers of these direct to Consumer Telehealth platforms may be more at risk for being on oral antibiotics long term and not having this complication recognized as readily because again it looks like acne and it takes in astute clinician to recognize it and to realize that that unfortunately the way most people are accessing Health Care these days it longer The Glory Days of Norman Rockwell paintings comment below and if you know what I Rockwell paintings were you know in an Ideal World any patient with really stubborn acne they would see a dermatologist and they would follow with that exact same dermatologist consistently so that treatments like oral antibiotics could be appropriately monitored tapered other treatments you know added so as to not put the patient at risk for this and as a dermatologist we have the training expertise to recognize this complication but what happening now I mean it for a while is that there are significant gaps in care and inconsistencies and people are going long periods of time without getting any health care and they these different Avenues online so it problem with continuity of care and when you have this issue it is a prime scenario for the development of this type of complication because like I said you know it be missed and you can easily be given a prescription option for an oral antibiotic to calm down the acne but in reality you could be at risk for developing this seemingly rare complication gram-negative folliculitis that looks like acne but is totally different gram negative folliculitis it can look an awful lot like acne to the untrained eye what exactly does it look like there are two different types of ways it can present as a facial breakout the most common type is little pustules and they the cheeks the chin maybe even around the nose and pustules are skin lesions common to acne and they appearing where your acne is so to the untrained eye and I might just think oh their acne is flaring and you can see here why somebody might even restart you on antibiotics not the right path so you they lacking is one of the key lesions of acne it basically a white head or a blackhead very different from a pustule a comidone is just a plugged up pore the stuff within the pore and acne it the protein of your skin it just makes a little plug there with gram-negative folliculitis there are no comedones it not a comidonal process it infection within the pore so it totally different the other type of presentation of gram-negative folliculitis it happens in about 20 percent of cases it nodules instead much deeper and painful another key finding with gram-negative folliculitis is that it often has skin lesions under the nose because again this arises from the bacteria being messed up in your nose so you can have some pus bumps under the nose and then extending to the cheeks the chin area so not only can it look like acne it also can look like rosacea because rosacea has these pus bombs and many patients who have Rose Asia they get stuck on prolonged courses of oral antibiotics another skin condition that might be misdiagnosed in this situation is perioral dermatitis I this but it to rosacea where you get these little bumps around the mouth around the nose so that condition that may be misdiagnosed in the setting of gram-negative folliculitis when it comes to diagnosing gram-negative folliculitis for the clinician the history the patient history and their physical exam findings are key if you have a patient who has a history of being on antibiotics for a prolonged period of time and they what looks like acne but it getting better in fact any patient with acne in their late teens or adults who has really stubborn acne and has been on prolonged courses of oral antibiotics it is definitely prudent to consider gram-negative folliculitis and to do the appropriate tests for it once the diagnosis of gram-negative folliculitis is suspected from a patient and physical exam the doctor needs to take a culture of the pus bomb and here is pretty tricky because those little bacteria that are infecting your pore the gram-negative bacteria they as easy to culture they sensitive to being dried out they love being in a wet environment and that is why they love the oily pore they love that moist environment and so if you take a swab of the pus bomb and you let that swab sit around for too long but before it makes it to the laboratory well you may miss it the bacteria may just dry out and not be something that can be cultured on a plate for the lab to say yes this is gram-negative bacteria that we not be able to grow it out from the swab because the swab is sat out too long and things have dried out the treatment for this condition is actually isotretinoin otherwise known as Accutane commonly here so how the heck is isotretinoin a retinoid going to work to treat a bacterial skin infection it works because the bacteria that cause this infection like I said they susceptible to you being dried out and they love moist environments that they live in your nose where it the mucous membranes and that lit like to take over in those oily surfaces of the pores and the way isotret no one goes to work is it actually suppresses oil production it sibo suppressive so by reducing oiliness in the pore it effectively dries you up and the bacteria can no longer survive in the pore likewise it dries out the mucous membranes in your nose that if you your nose gets really dry well that going to work in your favor in the setting of gram-negative folliculitis where you bacteria in the nose and it your pores basically just works by drying you out not only does it get rid of the facial breakout the facial infection but it also gets rid of nasal Carriage of those gram-negative bacteria that are causative so it puts everything back on track and gets rid of them infection it does take some time but it three months what about for people who can contraindicated for you well there are some other antibiotics that could be tried and I know that sounds counterintuitive why would you treat a skin infection that was caused by antibiotics with more antibiotics it very tricky because you have to give the patient antibiotics that are specific for those gram-negative bacteria that are causing the problem so it ideal path but that is another option to treat the to prescribe a new antibiotic that bacteria for people who can isotreino but to be clear isotreinoin it we is a very effective treatment for acne it rosacea in some cases and in the case of gram-negative folliculitis isotradinoin Works quite well for that as well my goal with this video is not to alarm you and please whatever you do do not self-diagnose yourself with this and even if you could self-diagnose yourself with that importantly you can self-treat it there no cream there detox protocol trust me I somebody out there will try and sell you one but there of this the treatment is Accutane isotretinoin so you have to see a dermatologist and it a lot of times patients who have been dealing with this they have broken trust with the medical system and the idea that you have to see a dermatologist to make the diagnosis of this and to get the right treatment it something that is really not going to sit well with people who are coping with something like this but I want to bring it to your attention because I think it more of in the upcoming years I encourage everybody who has any kind of skin problem to see a board-certified dermatologist I know it people want to hear I know it can be very difficult to find one to get in to see to see one but seeking out alternative Paths of treatment online it can get you into a whole mess of trouble and so that is my recommendation if you are struggling with any kind of persistent facial eruption breakout don self-treat it can lead you down a path that is very problematic and can leave you scarred all right you guys I hope this video was informative comment below and if you things that are not acne but look like it because there are a couple others out there for sure but if you enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe talk

Skin SIGNS OF ZINC DEFICIENCY @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfLREq5BfDM	Dr Day	well hey guys in this video i go over the skin signs of zinc deficiency it cold and flu viruses are really common and you the importance of zinc to staying healthy zinc is arguably one of the most important trace elements to humans there are over 200 different enzymes in the human body that rely on zinc in order to function properly now you can get zinc from human breast milk animal-based foods shellfish leafy greens and legumes now your skin is actually the third most zinc abundant tissue in the body and one of the reasons i love dermatology so much is that the skin is a window to what is going on internally other signs besides what that clue you into perhaps zinc deficiency include depression diarrhea just feeling listless irritable and also poor sleep zinc deficiency in young children can lead to poor growth and sexual immaturity and if not corrected long term can result in death so it important to your body now when we talking about zinc in the skin it abundant actually in the top part of the skin the epidermis and it does a variety of things there it also important in immune function so people who have zinc deficiency are prone to poor healing and they prone to skin infections with things like candida which is a type of yeast and they infections zinc also has antioxidant properties in the skin and is thought to play a key role in mitigating some of the damage upon exposure to environmental stressors like ultraviolet radiation the classic rash of zinc deficiency is a well-demarcated red scaly rash that presents around the mouth on the extremities like the hands and the feet and also in the private area around the anus around the genitals around the mouth the rash classically spares the upper lip so it has a horseshoe or u shape now if the zinc deficiency remains untreated this rash will progress to develop little water blisters blisters and in some cases begin to lead to increased skin cell shedding that can compromise your health quite a bit zinc deficiency can lead to what is called a perinekia basically an inflammation of the skin around the nails the nail folds you can also develop horizontal grooves in the nail plate these are referred to as bose lines as a result of zinc deficiency zinc deficiency also affects your hair and hair loss is one of the most common presentations of zinc deficiency it hair loss called a telogen effluvium now i have several videos talking about telogen effluvium you those videos that really any stressful event can lead to a shifting around of the hair cycle to cause more hairs to shed it the time to be growing hair and as a result you end up shedding a lot of hair but beyond the telogen effluvium zinc deficiency also impacts the hair strands themselves zinc turns out is important for the incorporation of cysteine cysteine is an amino acid that important for the synthesis of the hair keratins and in with zinc deficiency you don therefore there can be some subtle findings when you look under the microscope at the hair strands they obviously going to be more brittle prone to breakage now zinc deficiency can either be hereditary due to gene mutations that you have inherited or it can be acquired hereditary zinc deficiency is otherwise known as acrodermatitis eneropathica this is due to a gene mutation in slc which is a zinc transporter so it leads to defective uptake of zinc through the gut and this presents in babies um either upon weaning shortly after weaning from breast milk because breast milk as it turns out has compounds in it that increase zinc bioavailability so you don those babies until weaning unless the mother has low zinc in the breast milk you also will see it in infants who are not breastfed who are formula fed much earlier and they that rash around the mouth on the extremities and in the diaper area so that hereditary zinc deficiency or cause for zinc deficiency but acquired zinc deficiency is most often seen in people who are alcoholics alcoholics are at risk for a variety of nutrient deficiencies due to the fact that in severe alcoholism they end up subsisting on alcohol only and not eating and they become vitamin and mineral deficient it actually and uh zinc deficiency is is going to be seen in those populations people who have very restrictive diets good absorption of zinc can be affected by other micronutrients in the diet phytates iron and casein can limit the absorption of zinc now if you a well-balanced diet this is not likely a problem for you but if you are following a very restrictive diet it is much easier to get into a territory where you are not only not getting enough zinc but maybe you are having poor zinc absorption then you can have malabsorption as a result of inflammatory bowel disease crohn disease ulcerative colitis if you have had gastric bypass surgery it be a risk factor for you as well and you may need to be on supplementation in the hospital patients who are placed on what parental nutrition basically bypassing the gut they can develop zinc deficiency it adequate adequately supplemented with zinc and in pregnancy you zinc deficiency due to higher demands all right so those are the signs of zinc deficiency that appear on the skin one of the reasons i love dermatology so much you guys is that a lot of times some these skin manifestations they start appearing earlier than the other systemic symptoms like the depression the diarrhea so if caught early then patient can be treated before it goes on to cause more problems how do you diagnose zinc deficiency it kind of complicated because it necessarily as straightforward as you might think the skin changes and knowing the skin changes being able to recognize them is definitely an important step in the right direction to clue you into zinc deficiency however it remember that zinc deficiency and isolation is not always the case you know i mentioned earlier alcoholics they stop eating and so they going to have other comorbid mineral and micronutrient deficiencies so a more broad workup is likely going to be needed but this rash that i to you as well as the hair findings the nail findings and if other symptoms have developed that the right direction now a biopsy can be taken of the rash and it changes characteristic of a nutritional deficiency we see these kind of changes not only in zinc deficiency but also other mineral and micronutrient deficiencies but it can help support the diagnosis early on the skin is going to have a type of degeneration in the epidermis what about a lab test plasma levels of zinc do reflect zinc intake and can support a diagnosis of zinc deficiency fasting zinc levels less than 70 micrograms per deciliter or postprandial which means after eating zinc levels less than 65 micrograms per deciliter supports the diagnosis of zinc deficiency of course we always have to look at the patient as a whole there are a variety of other factors that can influence the plasma levels of zinc and render the test less than accurate hypoalbuminemia which means low protein in the blood low albumin in the blood inflammation and oral contraceptive pills actually can cause the zinc levels to be low and plasma zinc levels can be artificially high if there is any kind of contaminant in the coating of the tubing so when this test is ordered you actually have to get a special type of tube so plasma levels of zinc also vary throughout the day between early morning and late evening you can get a 33 decrease in plasma zinc levels so it because of this it not only do you get a fasting zinc level but you get it early in the morning so if the test was taken later in the day it may not be accurate and especially if you artificially high now once this is diagnosed and treatment with zinc supplementation is initiated these signs they are reversible they they they actually reverse relatively quickly now people who have that genetic condition acrodermatitis enteropathica are people who have malabsorption they have to be on zinc supplementation pretty much for life and they have to be monitored their zinc levels have to be monitored regularly to ensure that their their levels remain good they have to be on three milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day now people with acquired zinc deficiency say due to diet they need to be on one to two milligrams of zinc per kilogram of body weight per day so zinc in summary is really important not only for your skin healing and recovery you can get this rash if you affect your hair your nails and it really really really important for your immune system so having sub-optimal zinc levels put you at risk for not only skin infections but for getting sick really really sick what about just taking a zinc supplement zinc supplementation is popular but you can have too much of a good thing consuming too much zinc can upset your stomach cause gastric irritation and it can actually interfere with absorption of other things iron and copper you can end up developing low copper as a result of unnecessarily high supplementation with zinc so discuss with your treating health care provider if zinc supplementation is helpful for you or necessary for you before just taking a zinc supplement because long-term unnecessarily high levels of zinc they can have adverse effects all right you guys those are the signs and symptoms of zinc deficiency as it relates to skin hair and nails how it who helpful to you guys on the end slate i going to put my most recent video going over the importance of vitamin d in the skin so check that video out but if you like this one give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen and subscribe i to you guys tomorrow bye [Music] you	Success
Unlocking The Secrets: 12 Surprising Skin Signs Of Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EX1x_bcrVgU	Dr Day	skin signs of hypermobile ERS downlo syndrome well hey guys I know many of you have this condition because I have seen your comments across many of my videos over the years and I requests please do a dedicated video on this condition so what exactly is LR stlo syndrome LR Stow syndrome is actually a group of inherited disorders caused by a genetic defect in collagen or something in the underlying supportive connective tissue framework the result of these conditions is that patients have skin that elastic and stretchy and their joints are very mobile as well as unstable they also deal with a variety of problems related to fragility of the tissues and the blood vessels there are actually 13 different types of LR Stow syndrome out there but today we are just going to focus on the hypermobile subtype but all of the different subtypes of lr they are categorized based on the signs and symptoms that they have what the underlying genetic abnormality specifically is and how it is inherited hypermobile LR download syndrome is actually the most common of these 13 subtypes it 5,000 people around the world has this condition while it is the most common subtype as you can see it common in general it tends to be most common in women as a matter of fact the majority of people people with this condition are women though it can occur in Men in contrast to many of the other less common subtypes of AAR danow syndrome one issue is that with hypermobile LR Stow syndrome we don actually know what the underlying genetic defect is like where in the collagen pathway is there a problem and there blood work that can be done to diagnose someone with this subtype for that reason it is actually commonly Miss diagnosed and I believe it common than the 1 in 5000 so identifying the skin signs that I talking about in this video can actually be very helpful in making the diagnosis of hypermobile iller stanow syndrome one of the things you have to keep in mind is that this is a genetic condition so there making collagen and for this reason a lot of things that we talk about on this channel with regards to treatments interventions even lifestyle habits that help improve collagen in the skin not likely to work out here why because you can attempt to boost collagen production all you want in ALR download syndrome but the collagen is still going to be faulty right like for example retinoids work to stimulate the cells in the skin that make collagen the fiber blast to make more but those fiber blasts with alr they have the blueprints they have for making collagen they don correctly with hypermobile lr syndrome the collagen and elastin fibers they are a lot smaller in the skin and they kind of you know if you look at them in cross-section they have this flower like appearance and the reason that small um size and the kind of abnormal shape the support that there in the deeper layers of the skin and within the blood vessels it lacking patients who have hypermobile aers download syndrome the texture of their skin is very soft very silky almost sort of velvety in texture it also very thin and almost semi-transparent you can see underlying blood vessels and tendons on the back of the hands the skin is also very fragile they backs of their hands for example they have a decrease in expression of the gene for fagron fagron is a gene encoded in your DNA in skin cells it gets expressed to result in the production of proteins that are essential for Your Skin Barrier number two is people who have hypermobile alar download syndrome are very vulnerable to bruising this is because collagen is important for the Integrity of blood vessels that course through the skin and deliver nutrients and growth factors because the blood vessels are weak and fragile they leak very very easily and patients with this condition can have you know mild bruising with just ever so slight bumping into things or they can have really serious bleeding issues with bleeding in the skin that goes deep in the tissue there put on the skin that takes away the bruises faster or prevents them from happening but what you can do is prevent them in the first place by wearing protection for example wearing protective gloves bandages thick pads especially if you are going to be doing something where you might hit your hand or you have to put any kind of pressure on any surface but especially the delicate skin over the hands or your elbows or your knees it participating in any kind of contact sport anything that involves repetitive trauma low impact exercises are actually best while supplements are unlikely to boost up collagen there is some evidence that um ascorbic acid vitamin C supplementation might actually be helpful for patients with hypermobile alar download syndrome in reducing bruising possibly it because of course ascorbic acid is important for the function of those enzymes in the skin um and maybe whatever the defect is you overcome it here we really don honestly know enough about the the true root cause problem with the collagen in hyper removable ALR stlo syndrome but that does seem to yield benefit it may also be that vitamin C you know it antioxidant maybe it helps compensate in other ways in terms of some of the poor wound healing and fragility of the skin overall conjugated estrogen estrogen replacement therapy can definitely help cut down on bruising bleeding however one problem with estrogen therapy is that it comes with a significant increased risk especially with long-term use of uh blood clots so it to be right for everyone so the Skin really fra it bruises really easily and next up is related to poor wound healing and how the skin heals from trauma the scars that these patients make are often much larger than the initial injury site for example you get a scrape that line well it takes a it takes longer for that to heal and B once it heals the the scar is much larger than that initial cut was because of the way the collagen is just abnormal and healing and bringing everything together and creating supportive framework the scar ends up being depressed like sunken down they who have this condition they have to be really careful protecting their skin from slightest minor trauma because again prone to bruising and poor healing and these atropic scars but it especially important when um if and when the need arises for surgery to the skin because of the poor wound healing the higher risk of complications whenever you have really poor wound healing there takes longer for wounds to close up and heal part of the delayed wound healing too is not just that the collagen that bringing everything together is you know not the right size and shape but also the blood vessels suffer they big part of proper healing involves blood vessel formation new blood vessel growth coming in and then you know the delivery of nutrient factors and and things to help heal and and build new skin essentially it with alar stanos because the blood vessels are very fragile so they break open they leak there gets in the way of good healing it it can be you know it deal in other words because vitamin C may help with blood vessel fragility vitamin C supplementation may also be helpful in regards to how wounds heal but again it research is needed similarly estrogen therapy because it helps cut down on um bleeding and it also has some benefit for wound healing estrogen therapy may be indicated especially in postmenopausal women with estrogen deficient skin the next skin sign is something called penic pedal papules basically these little yellowish to skin colored bumps that you can see on the bottoms of your feet along the inner aspect of your heels what these are are basically areas where fat in the deeper layers of the skin the subcutaneous fat herniates up through the skin lots of people can have this who don stanow syndrome but it common because again that supportive framework of the dermis is not quite as strong so it herniate out through a lot of people have these don them they don dangerous for the most part however they can be painful and with aers download syndrome hypermobile aers download syndrome they become painful one complication that can arise is that as that little fat pad is herniating out through the skin and you see it with your eyes I mean it doesn break the skin surface but you just see this bulge basically as that it can ENT trap little nerves and you can get this very sharp pain right to those areas can be very uncomfortable ways to avoid penic pedal papules um and to especially if you painful ones is to avoid prolonged standing prolonged standing puts a lot of pressure on the skin of the feet and you know further provides a force basically for the herniation of that fat it just makes sense gravity pressure it even more that can be of course painful for some people you also want to make sure again you any high impact athletic activities be real picky about the shoes that you wear make sure you wear shoes that are really supportive don where you may need to wear Orthotics another thing that can be super helpful for reducing these is wearing compression stockings compression stockings basically squeeze everything back up into place and so they can they can really just kind of help mush that fat that needs to go cutting down on pain weight management is really important too for controlling these because people who um are overweight have obesity that pressure on the skin to herniate the subcutaneous fat out so maintaining a healthy body weight very important some patients have these and they super painful so some things that can be tried are um injection into the bumps of either a steroid or an anesthetic or in some cases actually um deoxycholic acid which may know um by the name kyella yes basically something that can be injected in to dissolve the fat um that a double chin can also be helpful to dissolve the little herniated um subcutaneous fat that in these penic pedal papules but again a lot of people have these and they bothered by them they don next thing um is very stretchy skin hyper elastic skin patients who have this because of the collagen defect they quite a bit and then when they let go it will go back down to to normal right away one diagnostic test uh to support hypermobile ERS download syndrome is something called the rubber glove test basically if you skin on the back of someone it stretches at least 1.5 CM that clue that they have hyper elastic skin those are probably some of the more common and more significant associated with the hypermobile subtype but there are a few other skin findings that may also appear in patients who have this condition that are also found in other subtypes of Aer stanlo syndrome one is something called elastosis perforans serpiginosa this is a lot more common in some of the other subtypes but it can definitely occur in hypermobile subtype as well and it name for a very interesting skin uh problem problem skin finding if you will basically what happens is that you get Extrusion of some of the um like collagen and and and things out up to the surface of the skin and on the skin surface you see this rough bumpy stuff and taking on these kind of bizarre circular like configurations it elastosis perforans because it Perforating right through the skin to appear at the skin surface something you see with your eyes now this can happen often on the sides of the neck it can happen in the on the arms right here um where your arm folds the anticubital fossa the back of the knees it can also happen on the face it texture it can be treated although treatment success is highly variable then the other one um is something called livido reticularis now liido reticularis is actually common for a lot of other conditions and it sort of occurs on a spectrum and what it is is you get these Violet to Dusky appearing patches of hyperpigmentation that it almost looks like a net you most often see this on the legs like the thighs the lower legs these patches can be temporary they can be permanent again they can occur on a spectrum a lot of times you in babies It it goes away it on that sort of side of the spectrum but then in certain like conditions Auto immune conditions like lupus it can be a lot more severe um but in patients with hypermobile AAR download syndrome it it dangerous it comes it goes brought on by Cold exposure it has to do with basically anything that is resulting in decreased oxygenation of the skin lowering of delivery of oxygen to the skin um and basically you have a a colle collection then of deoxygenated hemoglobin and and that with your eyes in that kind of Dusky um appearance this can improve with age and a way to avoid it is to avoid cold exposure always make sure that you are bundling up out there okay then the other thing that um is associated with aer hypermobile type specifically are conditions in a family known as mass cell Disorder so mass cells are a type of cell in your immune system they release histamine make you itchy um cause bumps that come and go those are called ticaria hives spontaneous hives they also deal with a cousin of hives it now I have dedicated videos on both of these conditions dermatographism it it literally means skin writing basically if you stroke the skin these welts come up in exactly where you stroke so it called Skin writing because you could write your name with your finger on your skin and you would get a welt that that welted up in the you know the shape of the words so that it to watch my video on how to get rid of hives fast and I want you to watch my video on dermatographism if you deal with either of these issues manifestations of mass cell dysfunction Mass cell disorder in hypermobile ALR download syndrome because I go into extensive detail all about how to avoid triggers things that aggravate it like rubbing the skin um certain medications can worsen hives Mass Cell release so check that video out when we look at large cohorts of patients who have hypermobile AAR downlo syndrome we also start to see an emergence of strong associations with other skin problems and we can kind of group those skin problems the first is skin problems around the follicle the poor people who have heds as we could say an abbreviated fashion um they are a lot more likely it seems to have acne or to suffer from foliculitis inflammation around the hair follicle and they often also are a lot more likely to deal with a hair follicle condition uh called hyra adontis supera now on this channel I got videos going into detail regarding each of those things also remember they have a problem with inadequate expression of Fagan and when we hear fagron um come to mind is atopic dermatitis eczema fagron really important in Skin Barrier function so no surprise patients who have hypermobile LR download syndrome they often have at topic dermatitis they often have a type of hand ezema called dis hydrosis again I have a video all about that but it is a lot more common in these patients probably perhaps related to fagin also along those lines with problems with the Skin Barrier um around the follicle especially is the dry skin condition keratosis pyls a lot more common in these patients there association with hypermobile aers downlo syndrome and psoriasis all right y so those are the skin signs of hypermobile AAR download syndrome I really hope this video was helpful to you guys especially those of you who struggle with it it is not necessarily super common although like I said I happen to think that it more common than we realize due to issues with underdiagnosing um I really hope this video was helpful for you guys um it going to be found always in a playlist called Skin signs of a lot of the videos I mentioned here are can be found there I go over the skin findings associated with a variety of health problems like um iron deficiency or iron excess I got a video in there related to a lot of different things like thyroid disorder or um High cortisol so check those out if you like these videos on skin signs of but if you like this one give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as

Warning Signs Of Calcium Deposits In The Skin	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHfH3PhNhxY	Dr Day	those little white bumps on your face are not milia they deposits and in today going to be talking about calcium deposits in the skin what they look like how to identify them why they happen and some interventions and treatment modalities that might be offered to address them calcium deposits on the face can fool people because they can look like various other skin conditions like milia or maybe acne scars calcinosis refers to the deposition of calcium in the skin beneath the skin in the muscles or in different organs when the calcium deposits occur in the skin it there are actually four main categories of calcinosis cutus basically reasons why you might all of a sudden have calcium deposits popping up in your skin the first main category is called dropic calcinosis cutus dropic calcinosis cutus arises as a result of some sort of injury inflammation infection or cancerous process in the skin it has nothing to do however with problems with calcium metabolism your calcium and your phosphate levels if checked are completely normal if you have distopic calcinosis cutus you just have calcium that gets deposited in the skin as a result of some sort of injury acne scarring can bring about deposition of calcium into that damaged tissue and it might present with little white firm nodules say on the jaw the cheeks a lot of you guys might be mistaken those little white bumps as milia and you tried creams you you you and they could be calcinosis cutus that you dealing with certain tumors in the skin can cause deposition of calcium the most common skin cancer basil cell carcinoma one might find calcium deposits in those tumors there tumor called pyom matricoma it a rock and often is calcifying maybe you had extensive skin injury say for example you were in a really bad motorcycle accident and you you know injured either your arm or God forbid your face that might heal with distopic calcinosis there are certain autoimmune conditions that impact the skin to a greater extent than other autoimmune conditions for example dermatomyositis Scleroderma lupus erythematosis these are conditions that I pretty much have a dedicated video on with the exception actually of dermatomyositis so if you have these conditions check out those videos maybe in the future I on dermatomyositis but calcium deposits are a big uh finding in these conditions as it relates to the inflammation that comes into the skin because of these conditions especially Scleroderma Scleroderma often is accompanied by distopic calcifications as a matter of fact there is a constellation of symptoms known as The Crest syndrome and the C in Crest stands for calcinosis then there is the r is rodes the E is esophagal dismotility the S stands for sclerodactyly where you have this tapering of the fingers and then the T stands for tasas Crest syndrome some people develop problems with the fat beneath the skin it types of inflammation in the fat that can heal with d Tropic calcinosis and then there are certain hereditary genetic syndromes conditions where you have calcium deposits in the skin for example a condition known as ERS danow syndrome there are actually many different subtypes of ERS danow syndrome I today that you have check out my video on downloads hypermobile type I go into more details with regards to skin findings in that video some people even develop calcium deposits as a result of varicose veins that damage the skin so that calcium levels phosphate levels totally normal there with your calcium metabolism that contrast to the next type of calcinosis cutus which is metastic calcinosis cutus that sounds like cancer which sends out metastases but with metastatic calcinosis cutus you have abnormal metabolism of calcium and or phosphate for example some people develop a problem known as Hyper parathyroidism the parathyroid hormone is abnormally High that role in controlling calcium and phosphorus metabolism in the body so when that problems such as calcinosis cutus sometimes underlying cancers can cause abnormalities in calcium metabolism that phenomenon meaning par around a neoplasm a cancer you can develop metastatic calcinosis cutus as a result of taking in dietary supplements specifically too much calcium carbonate AKA milk alkal syndrome this can not only lead to calcium deposits in the skin but also renal failure kidney failure very dangerous calcium carbonate uh supplements are often taken for indigestion like Tums but if you take too many you don recommendations or maybe you have underlying kidney disease so you don metabolize these things as efficiently well you can de develop calcium deposits in the skin speaking of supplements excessive intake of vitamin D supplements can lead to calcinosis cus metastatic calcinosis cus because it leads to increase in calcium sarcoidosis is also a condition that can lead to metastatic calcium deposits abnormal calcium metabolism chronic renal failure and something known as calciphylaxis which is essentially calcium deposits affecting the blood vessels that cause a very severe and painful type of injury that is you know requires immediate medical attention the third type of calcinosis cutus is idiopathic which means we don happens one of the most common presentations of idiopathic calcinosis cus are um calcific nodules of the scrotum these almost look like little cysts their heart is a rock all over the scrotum and they to remove surgically so it life-threatening thing but why it happens we that is iatrogenic calcinosis cus iatrogenic means it therapy or a medical intervention sometimes we see iatrogenic calcinosis cutus and people who are getting IV calcium gluconate or who are getting calcium and or phosphate through an IV also might develop secondary to the usage of electrodes that have a calcium paste on them and then in little neonates babies say in the niku who are having their heel stuck with frequent heel sticks it can develop a little calcific nodule not dangerous but that is a type of iatrogenic calcinosis cutus now the manifestations of calcinosis cutus vary quite a bit depending on the underlying cause in the case of dropic calcinosis cutus from acne you to have firm white to Yellow little bumps little nodules in the area where you had acne in the past that healed with maybe scarring for the most part calcinosis cutus develops gradually it not as though all of a sudden you have this extensive calcification of the skin calcinosis cutus is often without any symptoms no pain discomfort or itch usually firm white to Yellow little bumps sometimes comprising larger more extensive surface areas in people who have autoimmune diseases like dermatomyositis or Scleroderma the calcium deposits can actually ulcerate and uh release this kind of chalky discharge and they can be tender and painful at that point now aside from milia which can look very similar to calcinosis cutus there are some other skin conditions that also can look like calcinosis cutus for example mosum meluscum are these little firm yellowish to skin colored flesh colored bumps that have a little Central Dell they umbilicated they they molescum virus if you this if it know maybe your child is dealing with check out my video on moluscum I go into detail as to how to get rid of it how to prevent its spread and the different treatment modalities there are available for treating moluscum it can be quite a pain for the individual dealing with it to to go through then there are these little bumps that are um kind of yellowish in appearance might be um confused with calcinosis cutus called xanthomas instead of being filled with calcium these are filled with lipid seen for example in the setting of um abnormalities in your lipids check out my video on xanthomas I go into detail with regards to the underlying uh issues that lead to that and the different treatment modalities that are available but it calcinosis cutus from uh xanthomas as the treatments are different believe it or not you can actually have bone formation in the skin it osteoma C looks a little bit similar but rather than being calcium deposited in the skin it abnormally in the skin and then there is gout a condition where you have uric acid crystals being deposited in little nodules in the skin often times for example on the elbow very very very painful calcinosis cutus can be diagnosed on a skin biopsy you to see these large Amorphis blue crystallin structures I image here so you get a sense of what it looks like and contrast to milia with Mila you and with say Osteo mutus you going to see evidence of bone in the skin the treatments for calcinosis cus will depend on the underlying cause how extensive certain medical therapies may be indicated such as a medication known as deltm sodium thiosulfate proben acid when the calcinosis cutus is localized small a curette which is a little tool that kind of has a sharp uh Circle CLE on the end of it can be used to pop it out of the skin I don that yourself then there resurfacing laser and surgeries to remove the deposits from the skin so I hope this video was helpful and clarifying to you guys that you know there are other bumps that happen on the face and can kind of be sneaky and look like other things um you know as you can see uh calcinosis cutus kind of looks either like milia or just like closed comy dones all right guys so that wrap up with regards to calcinosis cutus calcium deposits in the skin are a very real thing and they can be mistaken for other real things like Mia or uh molus scum so I hope this video was helpful to you guys in clarifying this now on the insulate I video All About sebaceous cyst another thing that you might uh think is a blackhead or a large pore or an acne cyst you try and squeeze it and that can take you down the wrong path so check t video out next if you missed it but if you guys like this one give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe I bye [Music]	Success
Tell Tale Signs Of Copper Deficiency NOT TO MISS	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMx44bBFtMo	Dr Day	copper it video I the warning signs that you are deficient in Copper and you are going to have your eyes open as to how important copper is for pretty much your whole body the skin it is a window to what is going on internally and I over the Striking skin findings that can be identified in the setting of copper deficiency as well as key hair changes copper it is a metal it is very crucial to the function of a variety of different enzymes that carry out essential processes throughout our body copper is necessary for the function of an enzyme that crosslinks collagen and elastin it little enzyme that we about in my videos tyrosinase what does tyrosinase do it creates melanin pigment it build the strong keratin Bonds in your hair without copper good luck building hemoglobin hemoglobin is how oxygen gets transported around in your blood copper is essential for healthy brain development and for the functioning of your nervous system it plays a key role in balance of various hormonal systems plays a pivotal role in the metabolism of iron not to mention copper is an essential co-actor for a variety of antioxidants in our body to even be able to function properly so without copper our body is very vulnerable vable to the damaging effects of oxidative stress copper deficiency is not super duper common although although it definitely can happen and you keep watching to know are you at risk for copper deficiency fortunately copper can be found in a wide variety of foods chances are if you are eating you are getting more than adequate Coober levels Coober gets absorbed from Foods in our small intestine our body is really good at making sure that we don deficient and importantly that we don get too much copper what should you be eating to make sure you are getting good amounts of copper honestly pretty much anything that you want foods rich in Copper include nuts seeds shellfish organ Meats chocolate um but you can even get copper from tap water beverages if you are eating you are getting in Copper like it is not something that you should need to supplement for and remember if you give yourself too much copper your body is going to be like we are full the recommended dietary allowance which is basically the amount that is sufficient to meet the needs of the vast majority of otherwise healthy individuals those levels are established and they your age and your gender I this video on copper deficiency but I have no idea why you copper deficiency so who should we be worried about copper deficiency and who does it make sense to test to Monitor and to recommend perhaps supplementation where appropriate celiac disease is a problem where you have inflammation in the gut as it relates to the consumption of gluten like people who have celiac disease cannot have anything with gluten in it people with celiac disease can develop copper deficiency as well as a whole host of other nutritional deficiencies as it relates in the case of copper to malabsorption of copper in the small intestine because when the celiac disease is revved up there lot of inflammation there the intestinal lining that gets in the way of absorption of that according to the American College of gastroenterology fortunately patients who have cing X disease they have coer deficiency they actually can get back to perfectly normal copper levels within about a month provided they are on a strict gluten-free diet and that they have been given supplementation so their intestine can get healed so that they can absorb properly provided again they have to be on that strict gluten-free diet because it specifically that causes the inflammation that then leads to them being unable to absorb copper properly number two is bariatric surgery weight loss surgery there are case reports of patients who develop copper deficiency after having weight loss surgery when patients undergo weight loss surgery they should have counseling for their nutritional needs because they to likely need to take supplements um given that they are at risk for malabsorption so that is definitely something something that if not accounted for if you had weight loss surgery should I be supplementing with this reach out to your team of doctors so they can advise you on what you should do the other situation is patients who are in the hospital have to be placed on something called total parental nutrition tpn um this is basically um to provide them nutrition and if the tpn does not have the appropriate amount of copper they are at risk um so that is something that a registered dietitian who works in the hospital who manages the nutritional needs of patients um on tpn you know they would need to be accounting for that I have a lot of videos on my channel of skin signs warning signs of various nutritional deficiencies theme in pretty much all of those videos is a group that is at risk for many nutrient deficiencies are patients who struggle with alcohol use disorder alcoholism because alcohol severely impairs absorption of nutrients from food and unfortunately a lot of patients who find themselves um very dependent on alcohol they end up not eating here situation where I think many of you out there watching could actually be at risk and not even realize it and that is if you are taking high doses of zinc supplementation on a regular basis that actually can mess up absorption of copper High you know excessive zinc consumption from supplements can get in the way of copper absorption and lead to copper deficiency copper deficiency has occurred taking as little as well I say as little it milligram of zinc per day for 10 weeks so you don taking Vats and Vats and Vats of supplemental zinc for it to interfere with copper absorption I know it really popular you know people want to pursue say zinc supplementation for acne um or for hydradenitis p ativa and you do need to be careful there um while there is some evidence for zinc supplementation in these conditions not robust but it does exist um you do want to be careful that you are not um overdoing it and putting yourself at risk for copper deficiency but nothing illustrates the skin the hair the total body system manifestations of copper deficiency like the genetic condition Mankey disease this is a hereditary condition where the patients are born with an abnormal copper transporter so they don they have very pale skin and they have these saggy cheeks they also have what called a Cupid very characteristic facial features when you look at their hair it it kind of has this wiry appearance to it and it is often light colored it is very brittle it breaks and if you look carefully at it it has this characteristic appearance called pilli torai basically a helical structure and all of that relates to the fact that copper is so dang important for building the hair and so when you don copper well this is this is the result on the hair these babies have what called failure to thrive they have poor cognitive development they develop seizures if you look at the blood vessels in their brain they they they is essential for building healthy collagen and we collagen for wrinkles but collagen is vital for your blood vessels to function properly so they have a problem there and as a result they have poor oxygenation to the brain collagen really important in building your bones they have weak bones pale skin that has this doughy texture to it and these patients often have hypothermia because they don enzyme that helps with body temperature regulation sadly these babies don very long they usually have a life expectancy of about 3 years so that genetic condition where we like kind of the most extreme versions of copper deficiency affecting multiple organ systems but what about say for example someone who dose zinc or someone who had weight loss surgery um or somebody who struggled with alcoholism like what are the typical signs and symptoms in in an adult Who develops copper deficiency well you can develop very pale skin when adults develop copper deficiency usually the findings include anemia so the red blood cell count goes down as well as neutropenia neutropenia is the white blood cells going down guess what that puts you at risk for infections and copper is really important for a variety of enzymes in the immune system so you you you know you vulnerable to infection they look at your bone marrow they something called ringed Cito blast and basically what these are are cells in which the mitochondria are stuffed with iron why well without copper that iron cannot get out of the mitochondria into the cytoplasm of the cell where it hemoglobin so your body is like aggressively trying to hold on to iron but it can out of the store because copper is so important for the health of your nervous system copper deficient patients will develop what neuropathy um in the lower extremities so the lower legs the feet difficulty walking that feeling of numbness tingling kind of a pins and needle sensation episodes of feeling like the feet are burning very painful and uncomfortable because copper is so important for pigment production um the skin becomes very pale and you can have pre mature graying of the hair copper is also vital for metabolism and so you can actually end up with abnormal lipid levels high cholesterol as it relates to copper deficiency copper is so important for various antioxidant systems to function properly and so that as a result leaves the little nerves vulnerable to oxidative stress they undergo what is like this insulation around your nerves when that myin breaks down you don conduction is abnormal and so then you get um peripheral neuropathy also patients with copper deficiency can go on to develop osteoporosis as well but like I said at the beginning of the video the vast majority of you guys are not deficient in Copper like and I saying that because I know that there is a lot of like push in the supplement Wellness industry to take a copper supplement but what for um if you deficient in Copper there is absolutely no evidence that supplementing with copper is going to have any sort of positive effect on your health and you have to be careful because you can have too much of a good thing now that uncommon because again your body is pretty good at um regulating copper homeostasis but um there have actually been reports of patients developing copper toxicity from drinking water that had been um sort of uh stagnant in Co copper containing pipes and the copper leached into the water supply to such an extent that they ended up getting um copper overload all right y a wrap up regarding the signs of copper deficiency I really hope this video was informative educational like I said I have a ton of videos on my Channel all about warning signs of various health conditions nutrient deficiencies how the skin gives us a clue and they are all saved in a playlist warning signs of Health not to miss which I am going to link in the description box so you can check those out if you want to learn more about the skin signs of various health problems but if you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don

9 SIGNS OF TOO MUCH IRON // DERMATOLOGIST @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUe2dtugHZw	Dr Day	well hey guys let that you are getting too much iron now iron is a super important mineral in our diet it is essential for the formation of hemoglobin in your red blood cells hemoglobin is a protein that is responsible for carrying oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body so you can imagine how devastating it is if your iron is too low iron deficiency is the most common mineral deficiency worldwide but you can have too much of a good thing it this can happen either you have an underlying genetic tendency to take up too much iron that hemocromatosis or it can happen secondary to other things like maybe you to get a lot of blood transfusion so you are getting in a lot of iron that way or maybe you underlying anemia that leads to inefficient red blood cell production and as a result you have too much iron in the body but those of you out there who are otherwise healthy you need to be aware that you could actually get way too too much iron if you chronically take in high doses of iron from dietary supplements iron overload is a possible risk from doing that there isn actually an organ system responsible for excreting and removing iron the only way to get rid of iron in your body is to bleed or to Slough off epithelial cells now because of this a sustained imbalance between the body absorption of iron with its limited abilities to get rid of it can lead you down the path of iron overload what happens when you have iron overload is that it gets deposited in various organ systems including your skin and can lead to organ failure in the case of the genetic condition hemocromatosis where the body just absorbs too much iron these patients develop heart failure liver failure and they develop diabetes because the iron deposits in their pancreas and they also turn bronze it called bronze diabetes their skin turns brownish bronzed and becomes discolored but for individuals who don condition you can get iron overload like I said from other ways and initially can present with some sort of non-specific findings so early signs that you getting in too much iron they non-specific so it actually could go Miss early on people start to feel really fatigued they may get diagnosed with chronic fatigue people who have too much iron in their body they often frequently have pain in their joints especially in their fingers probably one of the earliest signs that you libido and in women a menorrhea these symptoms however are common to a lot of things including simply just getting older living in modern society where we are stressed out all the time having poor sleep so you can see how this is something that could easily get missed early on now if you supplemental iron you know it can actually be kind of irritating to your stomach it can cause stomach pain nausea constipation is very common it also can lead to vomiting and iron supplements actually can interfere with the absorption of zinc if you are taking too much as a side note I have a video on these skin signs of zinc deficiency zinc is is super important for your skin for healing recovery as well as for immune function so definitely check that out if you have any interest in the skin signs of nutritional deficiency on this channel I have a lot of videos just like that anyway moving on so what skin signs might you encounter if you are getting too much iron hyperpigmentation but it a specific type of hyperpigmentation it appearance but in some people it can actually look almost slate gray it frequently in sun-exposed areas so like on your face for example but a lot of people also develop hyperpigmentation on the skin overlying the genitalia and the hyperpigmentation in the skin folds at the elbows and behind the knees women will also develop hyperpigmentation of the aola around their nipples and in some cases you can even see a brownish hyperpigmentation of the eyelid margin scars may actually get darker and if you look inside the mouth sometimes there are hyperpigmented patches inside the mouth iron starts to deposit in the glands in your skin skin and in your mouth including your salivary gland which makes saliva and so people who have iron overload can get dry mouth because they glands aren not making enough saliva that can impact your dental health and make you predisposed to getting cavities the other interesting thing about the hyperpigmentation is that it seems to exhibit some sort of synergy with melanin production in the skin and that people who have this they tan very easily with hardly any sun exposure if you take a biopsy of someone has iron overload you see an increase in the pigment melanin within the basil layer the bottom layer of the epidermis but then you can do some special stains on the biopsy and you can actually see the iron deposited around blood vessels and around the sweat glands in addition to the hyperpigmentation the skin discoloration another classic finding of iron overload as it relates to skin is very dry skin and what is called eiosis a type of dry skin where you have scaliness it scale extreme dry skin as you can imagine iron overload starts to impact your Skin to hold in hydration to lubricate with natural moisturizing factors and when you have too much iron your skin becomes atrophic very thin it can take on a velvety texture and you can develop loss of body hair or sparse body hair like loss of pubic hair loss of hair under your arms people who have iron overload sometimes develop an interesting finding of their nails called Nikia otherwise known as spoon Nails where if you look at the nail plate there central depression like a little spoon and the sides of the nails lift up so it looks like a little spoon and if you place a droplet of water there it will stay in place within that depression now I about different nail findings and what they mean in terms of your underlying health you may be somewhat puzzled if you because if you nikkia is actually a nail finding associated with iron deficiency I talked about it in my video signs you are iron deficient so check that one out but here we interestingly enough uh in the setting of iron overload or hemocromatosis you can develop konia why we sure but there it is it balance in the body iron as I said is essential for your immune system and for healthy immune function but if you have too much guess who also really likes iron bacteria and you actually may be at increased risk for bacterial infections including of the skin common bacterial infections that one might encounter in the setting of iron overload include something called cellulitis which is a bacterial infection that affects the deeper layers of the skin or you could also develop bacterial abses now I have a video All About recurrent boils where we talk about bacterial abses so if that want to check that video out because I go into detail there as to different things that can aggravate that condition and people but yeah if you have too much iron it definitely can put you at risk for bacterial infections now as the iron gets deposited in the liver it leads to therosis of the liver liver disease liver damage and with that comes its own host of unique skin findings one of the things that your liver is tasked with is getting rid of excess estrogen when your liver goes down because it iron uh and you have developed curosis you have elevated levels of estrogen with that comes a skin finding we talked about in its own dedicated video Palmer athema redness on the palms definitely check that video out because there are a lot of other conditions where you can develop Palmer athema that are not as not as concerning as iron overload so check that one out but you from that video that liver disease is one of them and it relates to the liver when the liver is down can lead to uh increased redness from the increase in circulating estrogen people who have liver failure they develop uh jice they develop a yellowing of the skin now these patients with iron overload they also have the brownish bronish discoloration so sometimes the jaundice may not be obvious in the skin the best place to look for jaundice early on is actually under the tongue people who have a damaged liver also will develop what are called spider angomas dilated capillaries at the skin surface related to increase in circulating at this point in the video comment below and let me know if you have been staring at your skin all this time trying to figure out if you are bronze yet here the thing the skin and hair and nail findings that we just went over by the time those manifest you are already at a point where you have been taking in way too much iron way too long and it already in a lot of your organs in the case of secondary iron overload meaning we condition but in secondary iron overload the skin findings are a late manifestation by the time you have the hyperpigmentation the iron levels in the body are already quite High how do you get rid of all this excess iron since the body does not have an organ system to excrete it photomy meaning removing blood the other way is uh something called a Keating medication desferoxamine how much iron should you be getting a day the recommended daily allowance of iron varies from person to person life stage to Life Stage it going to be higher in women who menstruate because of the blood loss you need more iron if you are pregnant because you for iron are quite High uh as well as with breastfeeding adolescents um you know need to make sure they good iron because their bones and things are growing which all require iron but how much is too much the tolerable upper intake level which is the maximum amount that you could take in per day without any adverse effects to your health is 45 milligrams per day for adult men and women now to be clear you are not going to get iron overload from just like eating foods that are iron rich unless I suppose it who eats a ton of organ Meats because they actually have a very high iron level as well as Vitamin A you do have to worry about vitamin A toxicity but unless you are subsisting off of organ Meats unlikely but you do need to be cautious about it if you are someone who takes supplements because a lot of dietary supplements these days have iron and you may take multiple dietary supplements and you can get to iron overload taking dietary supplements with iron unnecessarily over a long period of time that being said supplementing with iron may be necessary in certain conditions so follow the advice of your treating healthcare provider for example in pregnancy you know prenatal vitamins will have iron in them uh so definitely follow along with what your healthc care provider is recommending for you but if you otherwise healthy and you take a lot of supplements thinking that they supplementing your health do realize that if you are taking multiple supplements that have iron in them you could put yourself at risk core iron overload which can be deadly and again your body doesn excrete and get rid of excess iron like it does you know water soluble B vitamins that are frequently found and a lot of vitamins you know you just pee them out with iron it can get stored in these organ systems and build up there and cause organ damage these skin hair and nail findings they pop up right away by the time these appear you already have significant iron overload in the organs that can definitely be very detrimental to your health and you need medical interventions to remove the excess iron taking too much iron definitely can put You In Harm how common is iron overload related to supplements it would say what in too much iron from supplements is acute toxicity uh namely somebody taking in too much all at once causes problems with the stomach lining or children unfortunately you know getting into someone they deadly ingestion with way too much I mean that that because you know it can be quite damaging all right you guys that I wanted to share about iron overload and the skin and hair and nail findings now if you like videos like this all about the skin signs of health problems you playlist on skin signs not to miss cuz I have a lot of videos in there that go over all of the different cutaneous manifestations of different health problems like diabetes High cortisol you name it you check that playlist out and on the inside I all about what red Palms mean so you can catch up on that if you missed it but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don I [Music] bye [Music]	Success
Skin SIGNS OF LOW VITAMIN A // Dermatologist @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwsYxRjC1b4	Dr Day	well hey guys if you board-certified dermatologist and in this video we about the signs of vitamin a deficiency vitamin a is a fat-soluble vitamin meaning it needs to be taken with fat in order to be absorbed into the body it includes retinol retinal and retinoic acid altogether these are referred to as retinoids vitamin a is essential for the function of your immune system and for the health of anywhere where you have an epithelial surface your eyes your lungs your gut and of course for the function of the cells in your skin vitamin a is fondly referred to as the anti-infection vitamin because it plays such a key role in the health of the mucosal epithelial surfaces as well as the function of your immune system so when you don good vitamin a those two things fall apart and you prone to infections like diarrhea respiratory diseases and vitamin a is essential for your eyes not only for the eye itself but for your vision vitamin a deficiency worldwide is the most common cause of blindness in children vitamin a comes from our food from our diet it vitamin a deficiency is actually not that common in developed countries but it countries we can get vitamin a from our diet from food sources like fish eggs milk or the carotenoids in leafy greens and red and yellow fruits and vegetables who is at risk for vitamin a deficiency like i said it developed countries but it really common in areas of the world where there poverty and globally it causes a lot of health problems in developed countries it never encounter or see in our day-to-day lives but people who are at risk for vitamin a deficiency are those who have malabsorption syndrome so crohn have a condition called cystic fibrosis people who have chronic pancreatic inflammation it they also are at risk for vitamin a deficiency because it in the absorption of vitamin a some chronic parasitic infections impair absorption of vitamin a something called giardia you may have heard of some people have chronic giardia in the hospital patients who are given their nutrition through something called total parental nutrition if not executed properly they can develop vitamin a deficiency as well and then people with end stage liver disease it your liver becomes scarred down and this happens most often due to alcoholism sadly but it also can happen due to uh a chronic viral infection called viral hepatitis or it can happen due to something called fatty liver or nash there are a lot of reasons for end stage liver disease outside of the scope of this video but your liver is important for producing what are called bile salts that are needed to absorb vitamin a properly so that becomes an issue in the setting of cirrhosis your liver also makes proteins that are needed to transport retinol around the body so again that is another reason why people with cirrhosis and stage liver disease they develop vitamin a deficiency chronic alcohol intake independent of liver disease can also cause vitamin a deficiency i about this before but alcoholics as part of their disease process they often don variety of vitamin and mineral and nutrient deficiencies certain restrictive diets can also put you at risk for vitamin a deficiency now pregnancy and lactation increase the needs for vitamin a so when we world where vitamin a deficiency is such a common problem women of childbearing age are some of the most at risk groups women of childbearing age and children in developing countries where vitamin a deficiency is more common these groups are some of the most at risk because with pregnancy and lactation vitamin a needs increase and then children their needs you know throughout development are critical so they so when it comes to the signs of vitamin a deficiency the eyes are going to have a lot of issue if you don enough vitamin a something called xerophthalmia basically super dry eyes because what happens is that vitamin a is so important for the cells in the eye itself to differentiate basically become who they for that the cells just kind of turn sort of flat and you get really dry eyes and if that progresses and the vitamin a deficiency is not corrected what can happen is basically your cornea just gets really really soft and it just liquefies it get these grayish white patches on the conjunctiva of the eye it buildup of like just kind of cellular debris because the cells are not like acting right basically it a beto spot now because vitamin a is so important for the production of the pigments in the retina and that information is transmitted to your brain about light and things first you can develop poor night vision but ultimately you can go blind and like i said vitamin a deficiency worldwide is the most common cause of blindness in children you know like i said vitamin a you can think of it as the anti-infection vitamin because it vital to how our body mounts an immune response to things infections and it vital to the integrity of different epithelial surfaces like that line our lungs our intestines you know our gut and our mucosal membranes our eyes so people who are low in vitamin a are at extreme risk for death from infections as far as skin findings the hallmark finding of low vitamin a and vitamin a deficiency is called fernaderma or toadskin i know it terminology anyways it accumulation of keratin which is you know the protein in the skin around the hair follicle you get these rough bumps and it starts out like on the arms and the legs and patches patches of it this is like rough skin and it kind of you know to the untrained eye it might look a little bit like that rough and bumpy skin condition that a lot of people have called keratosis pylorus but it if you have if you have rough and bumpy skin on your arms or thighs you know don deficiency um but you know it really rough bumps um and it starts to involve the face other body sites that the trunk and and then you get kind of dark uh violet to brown patches with vitamin a deficiency you have generalized dry skin uh it is you know i have a video actually on extreme dry skin otherwise known as uh ichthyosis bulgaris and in that video i mentioned that you can get a you can have acquired ichthyosis bulgaria secondary to underlying medical issues and vitamin a deficiency would be one reason for extreme dry skin now when you have vitamin a deficiency it that deficient in so it people with deficiencies like this to have thinning hair telogen effluvium which is basically shedding you know massive shedding of the hair but in vitamin a deficiency you can develop something called hair casts it looks like lice to the untrained eye but it really just kind of build up of the hair keratins and like a little little white encasing around the hair itself and it you know if you if you pick at it it and you can see those actually in other other situations it common for people who wear really tight braids they can develop it or with certain hair styling products but in in vitamin a deficiency you you will often see that in the hair can happen in the hair on the body as well will develop these yeah it sort of looks like head lice but it look at it under the microscope and in contrast to headlights which will just be on one side of the hair shaft the hair cast it in circles the hair shaft so that the hair cast they know when you if you pull on them they so those are the skin findings but the you know the main kind of issue with vitamin a deficiency is that it really puts the individual at a extreme risk for dying from infections because like i said at the start of the video vitamin a you can think of it as the anti-infection vitamin because of its role in not only an epithelial cell function which is important for your lungs your digestive tract your eyes but it system executes uh you know fight against infection epithelial integrity and immune function are essential for keeping infectious things out so when you don vitamin a deficiency wow you are really prone to death from infections and in developing countries where vitamin a deficiency is so much more common in these areas of the world you also have you know not always the best you have a lot of other issues going on in these areas of the world too like you know not access to clean drinking water um you know more infectious things being spread around due to just not able to execute good hygiene um hand washing i mean things that we take for granted um can really just devastate a population of people and cause a lot of disease it estimated that at any given time so right now as of the filming of this video me talking to you 230 million children worldwide are at risk for vitamin a deficiency that is a lot and i already mentioned too you know women of childbearing age are also at risk for vitamin a deficiency because of the demands of pregnancy and lactation so it bubble when you live in a developing country and you don to think about vitamin a deficiency aside from those of you who may have some chronic illnesses that put you at risk for it but you know for otherwise healthy people going about our lives this is not something that ever really has to enter our brain because we have so much access to foods the prevalence of subclinical vitamin a deficiency in india is about 61 actually so by subclinical vitamin a deficiency you know people going around maybe not necessarily with symptoms but if they get sick well they predispo you know they and vulnerable to death but just because vitamin a is the anti-infection vitamin don supplementing because unless you told to by your healthcare provider like say you have an underlying medical problem that causes you to not be able to absorb it properly properly but for otherwise healthy people who have no issue absorbing it from their diet you have to be careful because supplementing with vitamin a you can potentially get to toxic levels it vitamin so it the liver i amount you know somebody innocently thinks that they should be taking a vitamin a supplement and they it actually can dry out your skin lips similar to accutane actually and it happen to be put on something like accutane it is a form of vitamin a then you can really run into problems but um yeah there definitely od on on vitamin a supplements and it get them from your food unless you been told to supplement by your health care provider because you have an underlying medical reason to do so so i hope this video was informative on the end slate i on the signs of b12 deficiency so check that out if you missed it but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don i [Music] you	Success
Do You Suffer From Cortisol Face?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJkYj9KNQtA	Dr Day	so the kids over on Tik Tok are trying to convince everyone and their mother that they have cortisol face I set the record straight you most likely do not have cortisol face cortisol is a hormone that plays a vital role in a variety of different bodily functions however there are several disease States pathologic situations where cortisol is abnormally high and results in a constellation of symptoms known as Cushings including a round face with excessive deposition of fat in the face as well as fluid retention we refer to that as a moon face but you might also call it cortisol face this was first identified by well Dr kushen himself an American neurosurgeon who was taking care of patients with pituitary tumors and noted that they had this finding of excessive facial fat deposition and then of course went on to describe the state of hypercortisolism related to pathologic elevations and cortisol due to all these pituitary tumors when your cortisol is high to the point that it causing true cortisol phase it requires immediate medical attention there are a variety of other things that likely you will develop you might have excessive fat deposition in your upper back that referred to as a buffalo hump osteopenia osteoporosis and a susceptibility to fractures profound muscle weakness deep purple stretch marks easy bruising elevation and liver enzymes High blood sugar hair growth on the face that known as Hyper chosis your pottassium may be way too low now it are all under a lot of stress that can cause our cortisol hormone to be high to spike trust me when I say this those elevations in cortisol are not sufficient to cause true cortisol face otherwise known as moon face moon phas is something that we see when you have pathologically elevated cortisol due to the following conditions so why might you actually develop the constellation of symptoms including moon face related to high cortisol well they ways in which this can happen exogenous Cushings and endogenous Cushings exogenous means something from the outside coming in is causing the problem endogenous means there inside of you that the vast majority of cases of Cushings are due to exogenous reasons specifically intake of medications known as glucocorticoids such as prazone triamcinolone budesonide there are many these medications can be given by mouth in a pill form they can be injected they can be inhaled and they can be applied to the skin we actually use these medications a lot in dermatology to treat a variety of different skin conditions we use them applied to the skin and we also give them to patients orally and sometimes injection and many of our patients have asthma a condition that is treated by inhaled corticosteroids so these are all circumstances in which these medications if not monitored and dosed appropriately and used for the appropriate period of time can actually lead to Cushings I going to show you a case report of a little child whose mother had gone to the pharmacy because he had a diaper rash the pharmacist gave her cazol ointment a very strong steroid she then proceeded to apply that to the quote unquote diaper rash for 7 months what I case report of the child he developed moon face cortisol face he also developed hyper chosis on the face Not only was the child given one of the strongest steroids cazol also in an ointment form making it even more potent it was applied under occlusion under a diaper for a prolonged period of time without monitoring this was in a country where you can just go into a pharmacy and be given cazol you don doctor to see you and to recommend it and prescribe it it can just be obtained from a pharmacist so the child was not being monitored and it babies absorb these things much more robustly than adult skin so all of those factors together this child unfortunately developed Cushings now the good news is this was identified the medication was stopped and the child moon face and other signs and symptoms went away so all that to say that situation where yeah you about it while the vast majority of cases of Cushings are exogenous meaning related to glucocorticoid medications there related to things inside of you 64% of cases of endogenous Cushings are due to a pituitary tumor a pituitary adoma pituitary is a gland in your brain 30% of cases of endogenous Cushings are due to a problem in the adrenal glands the adrenal glands are the glands that sit on top of your kidneys you can have a tumor or other abnormality that leads to endogenous Cushings and then in 6% of cases of endogenous Cushings are what we call ectopic meaning you have some random collection of cells or a tumor somewhere in the body that is just not supposed to be there and is pumping out cortisol this might be in your thyroid this might be in the thymus gland it might be in your pancreas it might be in your lung these are pretty rare okay you most likely don Cushings as a group which includes pituitary adomas adrenal problems and the ectopic sources not very common like I said most commonly it exogenous Cushings the incidence of endogenous Cushings is pretty uncommon it people annually so that common doesn but trust me you probably don and if you did have it you would have many other things going on there another situation where you can develop what kind of looks like a moon phase and some might even call it a moon phase hypothyroidism can cause a condition known as mixa where you have what described as facial plethora you have a lot of facial fat facial swelling that another situation not necessarily related to cortisol but rather hypothyroidism but if you stressed out trust me when I say this the stress is not enough to cause moon face but there stress can impact our skin in a variety of ways stress can impair our immune system cut down on healing it also can compromise skin barrier Integrity leading to an increase in transepidermal water loss those spikes and cortisol also can drive increases in SE production leading to acne breakouts and oily skin stress can also get in the way of healthy collagen production chronically being under a lot of stress likely plays a role in premature wrinkles and the skin signs of aging many skin conditions are aggravated by bouts of stress such as rosacea and psoriasis atopic dermatitis and of course when we are stressed out it tends to impact our sleep quite a bit poor sleep feeds into more stress sacrifices the healing opportunities for our skin and our total body compromises our immune system even further so it creates this vicious cycle a lot of people will be like I don been super stressed out and I know my face looks super puffy well it cortisol face true Moon faes most likely related to probably poor eating habits fluid retention maybe you drinking more alcohol not eating the best food Foods having a high salt diet these all can lead to weight gain and fluid retention make your face look puffy and swollen but it cortisol facei those things can develop if you eat that way in the absence of chronic stress maybe you really good you chilled out and you eating a bunch of chips and salsa and pounding the beers and everything yeah your face is probably going to be a little swollen you might put on weight in your face I it in place to manage stress because it inevitable part of our lives and truth be told you don eliminate all stress because some degree of stress on the body is important it actually strengthens our immune system to have some degree of stress and makes us more robust when you completely eliminate stresses on the body it actually can leave the body quite weak so you do need some degree of stress it is actually healthy for you and some degree of stress is necessary to Foster resilience which is critical for longevity what can you do to make sure that you have good control of your stress I suggest putting good boundaries in place I think people become very stressed out when they overextend themselves because they feel as though they maybe they feel as though they will miss out on some sort of key opportunity in their career if they do not say yes to every little thing possible but if you overextend yourself you become stressed out you obligations or you things as well as you could be if you dial down on the number of things you had committed to I cannot emphasize enough the power of learning to say no to things that are not you know helpful to you or to those around you prioritizing sleep is essential getting in a routine where you go to bed at the same time every night and you wake up the same time every morning can help out tremendously now not everyone be able to do that some people work night shifts swing shifts and it always easy but developing some sort of sleep routine is essential also make sure you diet fruits vegetables lean proteins healthy fats try and not subsist off of processed Ultra processed uh Foods takeout not only is it not good for your body but it make sure you get exercise every day go on a walk you don some intense sport just exercise regularly a sary lifestyle it fuels the Flames for poor sleep and poor health all right that with regards to cortisol phase hopefully this helped clarify it so that you don fall for some ad for some supplement to fix your cortisol face trust me there is no such thing as a supplement that will address Cushings which you likely do not have I hope this video was informative to you on the insulate I my video all about the warning signs of high cortisol meaning Cushing so check that one out next to see the impact that pathologically elevated cortisol can have on your more skin if you guys like this video give

Lichen Planus: WHY YOU HAVE IT & HOW TO TREAT IT	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jCUnudOKnY	Dr Day	well hey guys today we talking about lyan planus what is it why does it happen how do we treat it and what can you expect if you diagnosed with lyan plainis what is lyan plenus it condition that affects both the skin as well as the mucosal surfaces it just one skin condition it many different types many different presentations L and plainness can affect the skin it also can affect inside the mouth the genitals can take on different shapes localized to different areas it can be triggered by certain medications it can affect the nails pretty significantly and it also can affect the scalp the hair and lead to hair loss when it affects your hair follicle that mostly affects adults anywhere from the age of 30 to 60 not super common in young children though it can happen 10% of people who have ly implus on their skin will also have it involving their nails and about half of people who have lyan planus on their skin will have it involving the mucosal surfaces what causes ly implus in the first place it multifactorial meaning there are multiple different underlying causes that drive this process to happen but overall it process an individual for whatever reason gets flared up in such a way that it decides to attack some sort of protein which we haven identified yet that is present on cells that make up your skin and your mucosa known as keratinocytes there is certainly an underlying genetic tendency towards this condition but also any sort of significant physical or emotional stress can bring this about stress triggers so many skin problems and ly and plainness is no exception ly and plainness is one of those skin conditions that uh exhibits what as the isomorphic response otherwise known as kariz basically what can happen is if there kind of skin injury like a cut or you just been scratching aggressively it will actually elicit the lyan planus to come out in those areas of skin trauma it also can pop up though if you have a skin problem like say shingles that occur you go through and then that skin problem resolves well when the skin problem resolves sometimes the immune system in the skin in that particular area is somehow extra revved up and it decides hey let protein and all of a sudden you have ly implus there that isotopic response basically a skin problem arising in an area of the skin where there was a prior skin problem that resolved anytime you get a viral infection whether it be a cold or a flu a lot of times the immune system can get a little confused get a little annoyed and do an autoimmune skin rash and lyan plainist is a classic example of that and a notorious trigger in terms of a viral infection for lyan plainis is Hepatitis C A lot of people will develop lyan plainis in the mouth as a result of a contact allergy to metal fillings which aren those cases when the metal filling is removed um then the oral lyan planus can go away but people can also develop lyan planus after a contact dermatitis to something that you know they were allergic to and came in contact with and then of course medications side effect rare side effects of certain medications are skin problems when you to medication and you read the package insert and it possible side effect known to man it often just say skin rash right well in dermatology we don skin rash we want to know what kind and one of them is like and plainness can come about as a skin rash uh from certain medications so that causes it what does it look like how do you know you have it so it can take on many different appearances like I said at the beginning there are many different types of like planus but I would say the classic stereotypical uh version of lyan planus is going to appear the way it described in textbooks and what we often see is a skin eruption where you have these light pink to Violet purplish slight gray bumps that have a polygonal shape to them you know they above the surface of the skin it called a papule and the they topped almost like a wart they topped and if you look really carefully the have this Lacy white stuff on top of them that a lot of different variants though of lyan planus in terms of the shapes and the appearance that it can assume uh you can have a hypertrophic variant where the bumps have this like real scaly thick stuff on top of it alternatively you can have an atropic variant of ly implus where you have a little bumps usually arranged kind of in a circle and a ring and the center is uh depressed it variant annular meaning ring shape this is often um the type that appears in the genital area and Men on the penis the scrotum can happen in the groin area the little bumps can be clustered together but like I said because likey implus is a condition that exhibits kemner phenomenon uh it often will come out in areas of trauma so it have little bumps grouped in lines a linear configuration some people develop ly and plainness exclusive ly in areas um that are exposed to the sun that known as actinic lyan planus and that variant part of what triggers it is is sun exposure something about you know sun and some people manifest some antigen in the skin that your immune system doesn consequence of that so Sun exposed areas people can have like imp plainist exclusively so that implus um loves mucosal surfaces too because you have that same cell type in mucosal moist surfaces like inside your mouth the genitalia so inside the mouth you will see this kind of Lacy white stuff inside the cheek on the tongue that feel it but you can see it other people develop painful mouth sores you can have very inflamed gums with redness and swelling likey and plainist involving the vulva can actually look a lot like another condition called lyen sclerosis which I have a video on as the side note they can look very similar they can kind of overlap and often times it can be challenging to distinguish the two conditions you will see those painless white Lacy streaks in the vulva often times but you can develop painful sores ulcers itch discomfort in men the genitalia again can be affected as well typically they have a collection of small flat top bumps usually grouped in a circle often involving the glands of the penis when it affects the hair follicles like on your scalp it lyan PLO pilaris you have these little red scaly rough bumps localized over the over the hair follicle and with lyan PLO pyloris it that diagnosed as soon as possible because that autoimmune attack that inflammation extends down the hair follicle wipes out the hair follicle and causes scarring so you get scarring hair loss so that needs to be treated ASAP get rid of that inflammation in there get silence that autoimmune attack so that you preserve the hair now you may have heard that lyan Plano pyloris uh is is associated with using sunscreen I have a video kind of going over that debunking it so to speak Association does not prove causation so check that one out cuz I talked more about sunscreen and Len Plano pyus in a dedicated video it can affect your nails pretty severely pretty significantly uh fingernails one fingernail may be affected are all of your fingernails and all of your toenails the inflammation can involve the um the proximal nail fold and Scar it down yeah a lot of people actually um get misdiagnosed as having nail fungus here fungus really common on the toenails not so common on the fingernails and so if you have been told you know if you have a nail problem you show it to your doctor and they nail fungus um back the bus up because that lot of other nail conditions that kind of look like nail fungus how does one diagnose like implus it patient comes in with a skin problem you can kind of tell just by looking oh this is characteristic of like implus I always do a skin biopsy because there are a lot of other things that look like ly implus so I like to do the biopsy total body skin exam so you may have bumps on your wrists that common location but don if the dermatologist wants you to get undressed and look everywhere because it can be hiding in places you of and finding it is key because treating it early is important for preventing things like scarring how do we treat ly and plainness well a lot of it will depend on the extent the severity the type but a go-to treatment like with many chronic inflammatory skin conditions is going to be a topical steroid to silence that inflammation right you have an autoimmune attack coming in and trying to attack the skin cells so a a topical steroid can quiet that down and and make it go away another option as far as topical steroids is actually it tape it steroids um when you have a a an ingredient under occlusion it really enhances penetration so the cordran tape uh really allows for better penetration of the steroid and that can be especially helpful in this scenario so there intralesional steroids meaning shoot the medicine right into the skin or into the nails numb the area first um and then inject it calone direct inject it directly into the nail to silence that inflammation likewise inject it directly into the scalp it PLO pilaris on the scalp intralesional steroids now I have a video All About topical steroid side effects they definitely can have side effects especially in areas where you have skin on- skin contact like under the arms in the groin area uh or on the face things like stretch marks can form persistent redness steroid acne there are a lot of potential side effects so alternatives to topical steroids would include something called a topical calcineurin inhibitor um maybe you have heard of protopic or elil pimus tacus that is applied to the skin these medications they silence a very specific aspect of the immune system they have fewer side effects and they long-term like on the face and delicate areas so that and of course what can TR no and not do well it can definitely be helpful actually topical retinoids in general whether it be tro Tartine adapalene can be helpful for improving lyan plainness depending on the extent though um a lot of patients will require a systemic medication meaning something that you take by mouth that is is going internally so initially often times uh a patient will be put on a course of prazone which is a systemic steroid not something you but it really wipes this out real fast uh and the the goal is to start that while also starting something else that takes a little bit longer to start working so what are the something else uh there are a lot of options method trxa another medication called aprin suppresses the immune system in a specific way um something called mofen mafel or cellp also a great option depending on the patient of course and um even though it can cause drug induc like in planus it also can treat the other variants is called hydroxy chloroquin goes by the brand named plail that can be pretty effective too for ly implus a retinoid by mouth called acitretin soriatane not going to be right for everyone like women of childbearing age wouldn but uh that certainly can be effective as well adal liab or Humera that actually works pretty well for some cases of ly implus cuz it knocks down a specific little little guy in the immune system that like and plainist it so those are systemic medications you know they do have side effects not going to be right for everyone it will depend again on the extent um thing you you know other things that you failed Etc but um you know your dermatologist can talk about those with you and you know potential side effects and what would be the right choice for you there ultraviolet light uh because ultraviolet light as I the immune system in the skin uh so we can use that to our advantage by using a very carefully selected wavelength and dose to calm down the inflammation in the skin safe unlike going out in the sun where you high dose that damages the skin so phototherapy is actually a great option um because you know it the skin you don side effects internally um the problem with phototherapy is accessibility not everyone does phototherapy not everyone has phototherapy in their area and it also something that you have to come in for pretty regularly and that may not you know that may not work with your schedule but photo therapy is an amazing tool they have inhome phototherapy devices insurance will often pay for them you know your doctor has to write a letter and you know go through all the Hoops to get it approved so it know process and the insurance company may like insist that you jump through X Y and Z hoop before they acques but all that to say like if it is out of the way for you to go in for phototherapy talk to your Derm talk to your doctor about an inhome unit because you may be a candidate for that you know and your insurance might cover it one of my go-tos for likey and plainst in the mouth is really simple it Swish and spit so tacr lius is a medication um that you know can be applied to the skin again it calcineurin inhibitor but it also can be taken by mouth in a pill form uh for suppressing the immune system but a cool thing about the pill form the capsule um for oral ly imp plainist is that you don just take a 1 Mill migam capsule of tacus uh the doctor has to write a prescription for it you dissolve that in half a liter of of tap water and you swish it around in your mouth for 2 minutes and then you spit it out and you do this twice a day can be super effective for oral lyan plist the other thing with lyan plist in the mouth is oral hygiene oral hygiene oral hygiene oral hygiene because um poor oral hygiene bacteria in the mouth it to flare the lyan plainness you know the the inflammation from inflamed gums from bacteria plaque further agitate the immune system to come in and continue to attack those keratin aites in your mouth so what can you expect with this condition like are you going to have to live with this for the rest of your life um is it going to get worse is it going to spread all over honestly the outcome depends on the type that you have for like and plainness of the skin majority of cases will resolve in 1 to 2 years as it once it resolves Oles it often leaves behind a dark mark there dark mark is there especially if you have a deeper skin tone and that is tinure of time a lot of cases in terms of resolving it of course there are topicals and and things that can be done to hasten the clearance of it but it is a it is a waiting game for that hyperpigmentation to clear out for a lot of people but for most people it tends to clear up in a couple of years that being said you know it is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory skin condition about one in five people will experience a second flare up of the skin like imp planus so you know you of the out of the woods but uh you know it it it typically burns out now the mouth on the other hand uh the mucosal surfaces the the genitalia that another story that tends to persist unfortunately for years and years and years uh in the case of ly and plainness though that is triggered by a medication it will actually slowly resolve uh once that medication has been discontinued that and they trying to figure everything out that why your medication history the medications that you take even stuff you take this over-the-counter dietary supplements that all that out there on the table and let them know everything you they can go back and and say is there anything here that could potentially be a drug culprit whenever you have a skin problem that bunch of stuff to fix it I suggest not doing a bunch of stuff um instead what you should try and do this is advice it manage your stress uh try not put yourself in situations overextend yourself to the point where you getting stressed out and or it a toll on your sleep because stress is a major trigger it it really revs this up quite a bit uh so make sure you prioritizing your mental health getting good sleep you want to avoid scratching or picking at your skin because again this exhibits that kemner phenomenon so anytime you scratch um your scratch your skin if itchy unfortunately it can be uh scratching picking using like a back brush back scrubber dry brushing those all out the window you don that with with this if you do have itch instead of scratching uh get yourself a cool compress and apply that right away at the first signs of an itch um or take your moisturizer and keep it in the refrigerator so it that itchy skin while it can help and your dermatologist prescribe you antihistamines which can kind of calm down the itch sensation the medications that are used to treat the skin will help get rid of the itch as well moisturize also um I before but something that underrated for skin um especially an inflammatory itchy skin condition is a collidal oatmeal bath super hydrating soothing um relaxing that that definitely can help and is inexpensive when it comes to LY and plainist in your mouth though um Oral Care Oral Care Oral Care you want to be brushing your teeth twice a day flossing don because plaque don plaque make sure you dentist there is actually an increased risk of certain oral cancers with like and plainness in the mouth uh so don smoke don conservative minimal with your alcohol consumption cuz alcohol in general increases your risk of oral cancer if you got like imp plainist on top of that you don heavily you want to be getting screened for oral cancer regularly too every 6 to 12 months you know your dentist can do that when you go for your dental visits don you goes for everyone but with this it super important because plaque it are really just miserable with oral lyan plainness spicy foods Citrus uh any kind of tomato based thing like pasta sauces Pizza sauces can actually aggravate this and a culprate with any kind of mouth sore mouth problems or a lot of our snack foods these days um they have that intense flavor coating meant to be pleasurable um but it really can agitate the oral mucosa not something you want to play around with when you have ly and plainis in the mouth um like or sharp snack foods you know cereals that you eat in the roof of your mouth ends up hurting avoid those if you have oral lyan planus unfortunately a lot of caffeinated beverages can aggravate the lyan planus in the mouth so that includes coffee colas teas all potentially can aggravate like implus in the mouth also you know oral hygiene is really important don fluoride because it helps cut down on cavities but um consider choosing a toothpaste that is not Mint or cinnamon flavored those tend to burn more in the mouth and can aggravate the oral mucosa maybe choose a kids toothpaste it strawberry flavor those tend to be a lot milder also a lot of the kids toothpaste tend to not be as intensely foamy and that foaming aspect of toothpaste it not necessary for the oral hygiene but it really can you know be irritating to try and you know maybe choose a kids toothpaste that give for a lot of things whether it be canker sores the mouth um or paroral dermatitis cuz those ingredients can irritate the skin around the mouth but also with oral like and plainness choose you know consider choosing a kid toothpaste do really mild skin care you know moisturizers to help keep the skin hydrated and cut down on itch avoid harsh soaps aggressive bathing practices again you don skin can eloc it more more like and plainist and you don long hot showers to dry out and irritate the skin using harsh soaps a bunch of skin care products might cause irritation rev this up just keep it real Bland skin care product is not really going to cure this or get rid of it but skincare products that irritate your skin can make this worse so less is more in the realm of skin care products with likey and plainness if you have the actinic variant that exists in Sun exposed areas sun protection is key I don talking about phototherapy phototherapy would not be a good idea if you have the actinic variant because UV is what elicits the autoimmune attack and that that variant specifically um so if you have that variant you know be as aggressive as possible with sun protection all right y no means an extensive all-encompassing like and plainist video I mean I you could probably have a YouTube channel where you upload videos daily on likey and plainness and have something new to talk about every single day because like I said there are so many variants um locations uh morphologies meaning shapes and and how the skin problem appears different treatments uh etc etc so this you know is kind of an overview of the basics of lyan plainist what you should understand some practical tips for self- care with this condition I really hope this video was helpful to you guys on the end slide I on lyan sclerosis so definitely check that out if you are dealing with this problem in the genital area I give a lot of tips there as far as selfcare as well if you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it

MONKEYPOX OUTBREAK 2022 SKIN SIGNS *UPDATE* DERMATOLOGIST @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=763mRL0SIbo	Dr Day	well hey guys in today some updates for you with regards to monkey pox but before we get into it make sure you are subscribed if you like skincare content from a board-certified dermatologist hit the little bell notification because that alert you when my videos go live definitely give me a follow over on tick tock and instagram because i consistent with skincare content on those platforms as well now unless you probably heard that we increased number of monkey pox cases here in the us as well as around the world now on may 23rd i posted a video here on youtube all about the signs of monkey pox the skin rash however a lot has changed and the new 2022 outbreak with the increased number of cases that we different than prior outbreaks in the past so in this video i with you how monkey pox 2022 is looking different from prior cases of monkey pox in the past first of all what is monkey pox monkey pox is a contagious disease caused by a virus this virus has been infecting humans since the 70s primarily in africa where cases most commonly occur in the us and europe where we now seeing a lot of cases previously we weren was pretty much rare signs and symptoms of monkey pox now during past outbreaks as i outlined in my last video monkey pox typically presented with a fever and a flu-like illness and then the development of a rash occurred starting on the face and spreading to the rest of the body the rash of monkey pox are these little bumps that can go on to be blisters and pus bombs and an individual typically had hundreds of these little bumps usually you know around 200 bumps all over the body this time in 2022 the rash of monkey pox is looking different many cases there are just a few bombs not the hundreds to two hundreds of bumps that we were used to seeing in the past sometimes there there are no symptoms of a flu-like illness and in many cases now in 2022 the rash of monkey pox is starting out in the groin area the genitals or around the anus and in many cases the rash the spots of monkey pox are staying in the original location where they first erupt as opposed to spreading to other locations on the body people might only have one or two bumps the bumps look like a blister they can be filled with pus or they can be an open sore even though there may only be a few bumps this rash can actually be very painful if you have developed a rash i highly suggest you see a board-certified dermatologist there are so many rashes that you don conclusions that you have monkey pox you could be missing something else it best to see a dermatologist for evaluation and management so how exactly do we as dermatologists diagnose this rash it appearance it can look like other common rashes it can look like herpes it can look like shingles or it can look like chicken pox but the arrangement the grouping the location and the history it diagnosis next up we can take a swab of the rash and send it off to a lab for something called polymerase chain reaction or pcr test and that pcr test can tell us if in fact it is monkey pox how long does monkey pox last monkey pox typically last anywhere from two to four weeks that is how long it takes for it to run its course but until the bumps completely go away a person who has monkey pox is contagious how do you catch monkey pox you catch monkey pox by close contact with someone who is infected if someone has monkey pox you can catch it from them through closed skin on skin contact whether that be cuddling kissing or sexual intercourse you can get it from touching the rash or the scabs if you touch an object that an infected person has used like dirty clothing washcloths towels bed linens you likewise can get infected you also can get monkey pox through prolonged face-to-face close contact because it can be spread by respiratory droplets although this mode of transmission is pretty rare and uncommon if a pregnant woman has monkey pox it can be transmitted to the child through the placenta you can also get monkey pox through an infected animal animals infected with monkey pox are pretty common in central and western africa specifically certain types of wild rodents commonly carry monkey pox and you can get it by handling them if they bite you scratch you uh if you handle their dead carcass eating meat from these animals or if you happen to use a product that was made from an infected animal is there a vaccine to prevent monkey pox currently in the u.s there are two fda licensed vaccines that may prevent monkey pox the smallpox vaccine smallpox vaccination if you were vaccinated you may have some protection in theory it may offer about 85 percent protection from monkey pox uh we used to vaccinate against smallpox but stopped in 1972 with the eradication of smallpox so most people under the age of 50 have not been vaccinated for smallpox but if you have it may offer some protection however it outbreaks in years past some people who contracted monkey pox were in fact vaccinated with the smallpox vaccine and still got it so it some protection there vaccine immivune that to what extent either of these is going to actually prevent the current outbreak we won data yet as it stands now the cdc is only recommending vaccination for certain high-risk groups and maybe if you otherwise there are certain things that you can do to prevent monkey pox first of all avoid close contact with someone who is infected do not touch the rash or the scabs of someone who has monkey pox don do their laundry for them don their washcloths don don someone who has monkey pox never underestimate the power of hand hygiene of course be sure you are washing your hands with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if you are traveling or live in central or western africa avoid contact with potentially infected animals these are largely going to be wild rodents you can definitely get it from eating or handling those so avoid those if you live in or will be traveling to central or western africa where it is endemic meaning there all the time what do you do if you come down with monkey pox definitely see a board certified dermatologist for confirmation but if you do come down with monkey pox you aren yourself until it has run its course if you live with other people you to stay isolated from them so that you don are contagious you want to isolate in a separate room away from people and away from your pets can you give this to your pets theoretically you can definitely to certain small rodents whether or not dogs and cats can get this is unknown but at this current time it is recommended that if you are infected with monkey pox that you isolate from your pets from other animals as well as from other people all right y interesting how viruses evolve and change over time the rash that i learned about of monkey pox in my residency i never actually thought i was going to see in real life and now it what i learned about and how it presenting that how diseases and disease processes evolve but i hope this video was helpful to you guys in pointing out how the current outbreak is looking different in terms of the skin rash what to look for and uh let me know in the comments if you or someone you know has come down with monkey pox how has it gone for you uh and if you guys like this video give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don subscribe i bye [Music] you	Success
THE CONNECTION BETWEEN SKIN & GOOD SLEEP ?? DERMATOLOGIST @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3-X84VQxIc	Dr Day	well hey guys as you know sleep is super important for having healthy glowy radiant skin i emphasize this in a lot of my videos that it is one of the most important things aside from sun protection that you can do to keep your skin healthy in this video we about a new study that month in the journal the american academy of dermatology examining the impacts of having a skin issue on sleep and how sleep deprivation has so many downstream negative consequences to your health including the health of your skin but before we get into it make sure you subscribed to this channel if you like skincare content from a dermatologist hit the bell notification because that is going to let you know as soon as my videos go live this paper is a big time review of the literature on how sleep is impacted by having a chronic inflammatory skin condition most of the literature out there focuses on people who deal with either eczema which is known as atopic dermatitis or people who suffer from psoriasis both of these skin conditions can negatively impact sleep quality and that feeds into disease flares but sleep disturbances don stop with those conditions even though there isn quite clear that sleep disturbance is associated with other chronic inflammatory skin conditions sleep is very important for healing and recovery and regardless of if you have a skin condition or not it goes without saying that you need a good night order for your skin to be at its prime healthy and functional protecting you from the outside world did you know that 87 of adults who have eczema report having sleep disturbances and poor sleep getting high quality sleep is vital for an individual physical mental and emotional well-being and being chronically sleep deprived has serious negative consequences on your overall quality of life as well as on your health make sure you stay tuned to the end of the video because we to be going over tips including what is recommended in this paper for getting your sleep back on track did you know that being sleep deprived not only negatively impacts your mood but it also can lead to more lost days of work people with chronic inflammatory skin conditions reporting sleep deprivation also note an increased number of days of missed work and they also have more frequent visits to the doctor because guess what sleep is really important for the function of your immune system if you don you get run down your body is not able to heal properly and you susceptible to getting colds and flus and you get sick more often that leads to more days of lost work and then maybe you stress out about that it feeds into a vicious cycle and having a skin condition overlaid on top of that exacerbates everything tenfold maybe because of psychological distress of having a skin condition maybe you socially isolate and that we know can have negative impacts on your mental health and subsequent sleep quality or maybe you suffer from itch which we know gets much worse and is intensified at nighttime why is this exactly why does itch get elevated and ramped up at night there are a few factors that likely explain this your skin follows a circadian rhythm similar to how you follow a circadian rhythm with your sleep cycle you wake up in the morning or you should and you go to bed at night time your skin kind of follows somewhat of a similar pattern and that certain cytokines which are kind of little messengers in the immune system are elevated at nighttime and these particular cytokines are more inflammatory and they can exacerbate discomfort in the skin including itch and are a major driving factor for itch on the flip side of that in the morning anti-inflammatory cytokines are much higher you also have changes in the hormone cortisol and your body experiences a spike in cortisol in the morning upon awakening and that has an anti-inflammatory effect whereas that level dips down at night time couple that with the inflammatory cytokines and you also have an increase in trans epidermal water loss at night time your core body temperature lowers in order to help you fall asleep and peripherally out in the skin the blood vessels dilate this increase in vasodilation correlates with increased blood flow through the skin and subsequently more trans epidermal water loss and as the skin loses more water it is more prone to the sensation of itch a lot of chronic inflammatory skin conditions get a lot worse at night time interestingly enough there are other chronic inflammatory diseases that are not related to the skin that also get worse at night time this is likely because of the circadian rhythm and changes in the inflammatory cytokines for example rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis and inflammatory bowel disease symptoms can get much worse at nighttime and asthma comment below and if you have asthma a lot of people who have eczema also have asthma and both conditions by themselves can and do get much worse at night time so you can imagine if you exacerbation and your eczema is flaring that is a set up for a poor night of sleep we inflammatory skin condition really really really sneaks in to disrupt your sleep quality is in the itch scratch cycle all of these changes that happen to the skin at night time all of these differences that lead to more water loss more inflammatory mediators they increase the sensation of ish little compounds in the skin called protogens are coming through the skin that sensation of itch is there and when you your ability to suppress scratching behaviors goes out the window and what happens is that as you start to have that itch sensation you scratch scratching elicits an inflammatory response in the skin that further aggravates the underlying skin condition and brings in more itch signals making it more likely that you scratch now with the scratching behavior that coincides with wakefulness and arousals and not you being asleep people who have inflammatory skin conditions like eczema when their skin disease is flaring they actually have lower levels of the hormone melatonin this is a hormone it helps control our sleep wake cycle i have a video all about melatonin supplements where i describe how this hormone works and i also have a video all about applying melatonin to the skin but yeah that hormone can dip down as people are experiencing flares of their skin this study brings to light the fact that people who deal with chronic inflammatory skin conditions they have a higher rate of sleep disturbances and they also have a much higher rate of underlying mood problems especially depression people who have chronic inflammatory skin conditions and are constantly waking up throughout the night time they have a lot of difficulties with day-to-day tasks poor memory they sleepy throughout the day children who have their sleep cycle disrupted from an underlying eczema most commonly these children have a much greater likelihood of having neurocognitive problems as a result of the sleep deprivation and they can have the appearance of someone who has a learning disability or problem with attention or a behavior problem when in reality they are sleep deprived from their poorly controlled eczema and itch scratch cycle keeping them up all night disruption in sleep doesn impact the kids it impacts the parents and or caregivers of the child because as a child wakes up in the night guess what kids don roll over and try and go back to sleep what do they do they wake up and they come in the caregiver some comforting and a lot of times what ends up happening is you have co-sleeping where the child comes in and the parent gives in because the parent is sleepy and lets the child sleep in the back and this is actually associated with poor sleep in both the child and the adults so the adult is now losing sleep they child child gets in their bed and the bed doesn comfortably there waking up the child is still scratching that wakes up the caregiver in the bed it can be a cycle of problems for the sleep quality of not only the child but the caregiver as well and studies show that there is an increase in the anxiety levels of parents with kids who have eczema and there greater incidence of maternal depression in children with eczema and this may explain that because both parties the parents caregivers and the child are not getting good restorative sleep research shows that the co-sleeping that parents give into can sacrifice their sleep anywhere from 40 minutes a night to 2 hours and 40 minutes a night that is a lot of sleep that adults are missing out on when we of skin issues on the sleep quality of adults there is a greater risk of getting into car fatalities if you are sleep deprived being sleep deprived it actually impairs your cognitive function your executive decision making and your response time and in some studies it actually does suggest that it is the equivalent to being under the influence of alcohol if you are sleep deprived we already know that people with chronic inflammatory skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis experience a greater burden of comorbid depression and regardless of having a skin condition or not having depression is very much associated with sleep disorder disturbances so having a chronic inflammatory skin condition plus depression is like a double hitter to your sleep quality studies show that this can impair the onset of rem sleep latency it also can increase awakenings throughout the night and decrease deep sleep the social isolation that can come with having a chronic inflammatory skin condition also can feed into poor quality sleep a lot of people with psoriasis or eczema when their skin condition is flaring they do have feelings of embarrassment i know a lot of you have verbalized in the comments that you have felt this way about other skin conditions that you are dealing with whether it be your acne or your melasma and a few weeks ago i reviewed a paper talking about how having acne can negatively impact someone women were reporting that having acne really got in the way of their social lives their social interactions and their professional relationships so you can begin to see how much having a skin condition really does start to feed into your psychological well-being and your sleep is right up there in making this video i really hope to increase awareness of the fact that having a chronic skin condition whether it be eczema acne psoriasis hidradenitis sapurativa these conditions they take a toll on the individual mental and emotional well-being in many many facets of their lives stop commenting on people i still see this rampant on social media where people just feel entitled to comment about people acne redness on their face or if their face is shiny i mean they always making these off-handed comments those kind of comments really can just be the tipping point for a lot of other problems down the road for these people including poor sleep social isolation if you make these types of comments they not doing anyone any favors it though the person who has said skin thing that you not aware of it or that you them a service by commenting that this video hopefully illustrates to you how much people with skin conditions are dealing with on the back end of things that you don and taking upon yourself to comment on something about their skin is not helpful and in fact arguably can be quite harmful so think about that the next time you feel entitled to make a comment about somebody we do moving forward to help get our sleep back on track first of all if you have an underlying skin problem see your doctor a dermatologist maybe they may be able to refer you to a mental health provider which is really important for chronic skin conditions addressing sleep and mental health are really really vital to getting the disease under control because if these things are not well addressed you can throw steroid creams at a rash and it issues and poor sleep and in psychological distress they are directly going to feed inflammatory responses towards the skin so it those aspects as well in the care you probably have heard about the importance of sleep hygiene it people talk about and it because it seems like you know not as much of a quick fix as we might like it all just take a pill or eat a certain food or do a certain you know handstand whatever is on the tick tock uh and then our sleep would get much better um but in reality you have to do the work of teeing up your sleep hygiene the first thing and i struggle with this and always have is to have a consistent bedtime and wake-up time no matter what time of year it is go to bed at the same time and wake up at the same time this is really important for your circadian rhythm for kids especially if you have a child who you think may have some sleep problems obviously have them seen by their pediatrician i telling you this is a replacement for that but in terms of the bedtime and wake up time being consistent with those times can really help out their sleep tremendously if you your child consider cracking down on that i know everyone has like very strong opinions on that on the internet but uh it definitely can aggravate the problem of poor sleep in children with eczema at least the studies suggest as well as the sleep quality of the adult trust me if you i mean just think about it practically if you are constantly being aroused all night by a small child scratching and rolling around trying to get comfortable you sleep well one thing that can aggravate any type of skin problem issue but especially itch is a dirty room so clean up your room arrow allergens dust mites and mildew mold these can really be triggers for itch and an eczema flare and more inflammation in the skin poor sleep i already mentioned a lot of children with eczema also have asthma as well as adults and the presence of these things in the room actually can aggravate the asthma as well respiratory problems so make sure you regularly you keep your room clean and don stuff that can accumulate dust you know if you have a lot of clutter in your bedroom even if you keep it your room clean it does like it possible to constantly be dusting every little knick-knack and things if you have stacks of like papers and stuff you would be surprised how much dust that accumulates and you dusting all of those stacks of papers or things so try and have a really minimalist bedroom keep the bedroom very dark at night when you sleep or if you sleep during the day time utilize blackout curtains keep it cool and no light and no sound so no tvs in the bedroom that have those little lights uh now we have our devices giving off light all the time get those out of the bedroom make it like completely pitch black makes a huge difference get an eye mask if you think that will help if that block out light further if you live in a city where there noise get some ear plugs or if you live in a building where you have loud people above you get some earplugs to block out the noise i light from our devices can mess up our circadian rhythm quite a bit and this paper actually suggests turning off and avoiding all blue light two hours before going to bed i always said about an hour before bed but this paper suggests two hours i think that is good very difficult but yeah i would encourage you to do that i say very difficult because nowadays our devices like rule our lives so try and try and turn all those things off see if there not something that you can do at night time that doesn think that will really help a lot whether it reading an actual book paper book or listening to an audio file try and do something like that as opposed to looking at a screen it really can help your brain begin to transition to sleep mode try and look out the window at natural sunlight first thing in the morning if you live somewhere where you don doesn you know the time of year you have to get up early and it out for resetting that circadian rhythm maybe consider getting a light box that can help just look at it for a few minutes first thing in the morning it really can get make you quite energized i do this every morning when i get up i make sure to go over to the window open my curtains and look out and that natural sunlight hitting my eyes definitely does help get me going for the day and you want to avoid caffeine in the afternoon avoid eating a large meal right before bed because that can sometimes cause reflux symptoms also try and avoid going to bed hungry you won thinking about food all right as far as your skincare routine i encourage you to do your bathing before you go to bed because as you go throughout your day dust pollen pollutants settle on the skin and conserves an inflammatory trigger for itch that subsequently can keep you up at night likewise after you get done bathing apply a moisturizer moisturizing at night kind of bio hacks if you will i hate that term but it does bio hack the circadian rhythm changes if you will inflammatory mediators and trans epidermal water loss it really helps mitigate some of those factors likewise you for certain skin conditions a lot of times you are advised to use topical medications to apply them at night and this is one of the reasons because as i mentioned earlier blood flow to the skin is increased at night time and so it thought that as as there being lost out of the skin in the case of moisturizers they going to help better but active ingredients might actually penetrate better at nighttime it not like robust research there but for the you know that sometimes it medications before bed because of this you know circadian rhythm difference because of circadian rhythm differences and inflammatory mediators blood flow uh and trans epidermal water loss all right y brought light to i wanted to share with you all to increase awareness of the fact that having skin problems is more than just a surface level issue it really goes into the depths of affecting your physical mental and emotional health and hopefully by watching this video these tips help you get better control of your sleep regardless of if you dealing with skin conditions or not but if you guys

The Shocking Truth About Red Palms And Your Health: Expert Dermatologist Reveals	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGTsRNSn1S8	Dr Day	if you were sitting there staring at your hands wondering why your palms are so red you today sign that there is something going on with your health well hey guys welcome back in today about Palomar erythema erythema is the medical term for redness and specifically we are talking about a pattern of redness that appears on the palms of both hands most often overlying the heel of the hand and sometimes involving the fingers as well what we are not talking about is a pattern of redness that is very common and has an unnecessarily complicated name normal diffuse physiologic polymer modeling we ourselves at some point or another you look down at the palms of your hands they these little confetti-like macules of pale skin interspersed congratulations that you know your hands are responding likely to heat to dissipate heat When approaching Palmer erythema we tend to think about it in two boxes but box number one is congratulations this is totally normal you two is oh there with your health we need to further investigate so let one at a time box number one Palmer erythema that is totally normal why might it be totally normal to have red Palms well maybe you are pregnant the reason for this is that in pregnancy you have an increase in the hormone estrogen increases in circulating levels of estrogen are par for the course with a normal pregnancy not only that but with pregnancy you also have a lot more blood being made to support the growing baby in the case of Palmar erythema it typically appears for some around month number two of pregnancy and it usually resolves within two weeks of delivering the baby although sometimes it can linger around for up to two months it may itch it may be associated with an increase in sensitivity and for that reason I suggest if you are pregnant be really gentle with the hand care products that you use you want to use harsh soaps heavily scented lotions you may find that your skin is just a lot more easily irritated likely related to The increased blood flow in addition to the red Palms your feet may also be read in pregnancy again it once you deliver reason number two that is totally normal and healthy and not a problem to have red Palms is well you inherited this from some family member it this usually appears at Birth but it may appear later on in life and if you have this you know by default there somebody else in your family who has red Palms as well people who inherit this tendency when we biopsy the redness they have an increased density of little capillary Loops running parallel to the skin surface in those affected areas so it born with a tendency to develop reason number three in the box of things that are not a problem totally normal you are fine is well we don you have this and in medicine when we don than just saying we don it the fancy name of idiopathic idiopathic Palmar erythema by default it means that we have to rule out everything else that possibly could cause it and once we rule everything out we don idiopathic and you diagnosis of exclusion so that being said let probably why you clicked into this video These are some medical reasons why you might have red Palms medical problem number one associated with Palmar erythema is liver disease end-stage liver disease cirrhosis of the liver your liver is really important for breaking down estrogen but if your liver is all scarred down and not functioning properly or you have an increase in circulating estrogens and that can influence blood flow and that is why people who have liver disease often develop Palmar erythema 23 of patients with cirrhosis of the liver will have Palmar erythema so it is a clue to liver disease when you hear cirrhosis of the liver you probably think well alcohol right well you can develop cirrhosis of the liver from a variety of different diseases of the liver it end-stage liver disease where the liver has become scarred down that may be related to a genetic disease of the liver like Wilson hereditary hemochromatosis 23 of people with liver cirrhosis regardless of the cause will have Palmar erythema and it because of the increase in circulating estrogens that being said patients who have alcoholic liver disease and cirrhosis of the liver related to alcohol they kind of have another hit playing a role in the red palms and that is the fact that alcohol is a vasodilator that drink alcohol they often appear flushed check out my video on what alcohol does to your skin I go over all the ways it impacts the skin including the skin of people who abuse it so check that out medical reason number two for red Palms is hyperthyroidism thyroid toxicosis eighteen percent of patients with thyroid toxicosis high thyroid will have Palmar erythema because in thyroid toxicosis you also have an increase in circulating estrogen levels we talk talked about this in my video on signs of high thyroid so check that out go into other skin signs of hyperthyroidism there reason number three is diabetes roughly four percent of patients with diabetes both type 1 and type 2 will develop Palmer erythema patients who have diabetes whether it be type 1 or type 2 they suffer problems with the blood vessels and if you recall back to my video on skin signs of diabetes not only did I mention the red Palms thing but you know a lot of patients who have diabetes they also will develop a type of facial redness called rubiosis so this kind of goes along with that medical reason number four for red Palms is a rheumatoid arthritis about 60 percent of patients who have rheumatoid arthritis will have Palmar erythema if you have rheumatoid arthritis and you have Palmer erythema congratulations it because patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have Palmer erythema for whatever reason it being less likely to have deformities of the fingers and it with better hemoglobin levels in comparison to patients who have rheumatoid arthritis and do not have Palmar erythema why that is we don know but if you have rheumatoid arthritis and you have red Palms it is actually a good sign for you rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease there are other autoimmune diseases that also can be associated with polymer erythema namely systemic lupus erythematosus roughly one to four percent of patients with lupus will have Palmar erythema patients who have Lupus can have a wide variety of different skin hair mucous membrane findings these include things like hair loss a butterfly or malar rash they have a very photosensitive and they may have pigmentary changes in different rashes so Palmar erythema would not be an unusual finding in someone with lupus reason number six if you or a loved one is undergoing a bone marrow transplant you might unfortunately develop a condition known as graft versus host disease and in the beginning of graft versus host disease you can develop a type of rock that initially presents with redness on the palms it very classic finding in patients you have graft versus host disease and that is a very helpful finding the Palmar erythema usually like for whatever reason right here on this part of the hand there usually appears anywhere between 7 and 21 days into the course of graft versus host disease so it earlier finding and can be really helpful in finding it early so you can be treated early reason number seven for red Palms are infections now to be clear these infections are not super common and otherwise healthy people these are things that we might be more on the lookout for in ill patients in the hospital namely something called Subacute bacterial endocarditis basically an infection in the heart sometimes can present with redness on the palms unfortunately syphilis is on the rise and babies born with syphilis can be born with rashes on their hands including redness so it can be a sign of congenital syphilis if you who enjoys imbibing and unpasteurized milk products be aware of brucellosis an infection that you can get from that and Palmar erythema is a possible presenting sign category number eight of things that can cause your palms to be red Palmar erythema is poisoning specifically mercury poisoning otherwise known as acrodinia or Pink fortunately we don anymore but it the hands related to mercury poisoning check out my video on those problematic bleaching creams with high mercury in them as they cause a mercury poisoning I Clump smoking in the category of poisoning because you know it is a form of poisoning if you will and smokers can often have redness on their hands certain medications can cause Palmar erythema in one of two ways the first way is because they might have toxic effects to your liver they may cause liver dysfunction which slows down metabolism of estrogen leading to higher estrogen levels and that can present with redness on the palms now that something that any Doctor Who has prescribed a medication that comes with a risk for harms of the liver they going to be monitoring your liver enzymes presumably so that should not happen but any medication that has a risk of damaging the liver you know at high doses unsupervised that could be a presenting finding similar to similar to any liver disease medications that can be damaging to the liver that are associated with Palmar erythema specifically include amiodarone gemfibrasil and cholesteramine then there are other medications that can cause polymer erythema but have no impact on your liver whatsoever and they may cause Palmar erythema because maybe they have some sort of impact on how the blood vessels are dilating in the skin these include Topiramate a anti-convulsant medication and salbutamol while elevated levels of estrogen can lead to Palmar erythema interestingly enough hormone replacement therapy and oral contraceptive pills are not associated with Palmar erythema and then last but not least a potential medical cost for red Palms Palmer erythema is brain cancer cancers make all sorts of things abnormally including factors that improve blood flow vasculature cancers can also make estrogens cancers of the brain for whatever reason can make these things and lead to Palmar erythema and it can be a cancer that started in the brain or a cancer that started somewhere else and spread to the brain okay hopefully at this point you terrified that you have some sort of severe medical illness because your palms are red make sure that you know you weren palms for a long time before watching this video but if you do have Palmer erythema what the heck should you do see your doctor they should perform a complete history and physical to try and get at the root cause of why it is you have Palmar erythema and they likely will order some tests a complete blood count the they they check to make sure you don hepatitis B or viral hepatitis C they likely check a fasting blood sugar they may check a ferritin level and they are going to likely check a chest x-ray as well depending on your history and the physical exam they may even order more blood tests to check for things like autoimmune diseases so it cookbook approach every patient approach is tailored to the patient and their concerns and history and physical all right you guys that is Palmar erythema now if you like these videos on skin signs of Health I have a playlist full of videos just like this skin signs of low iron skin signs of B12 deficiency diabetes I mean you name it watch the videos in that playlist by the time you finish it you first-year Durham resident I um but yeah I have a lot of videos in that playlist that I think you will enjoy so I in that playlist on the answer late so check that one out next but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen And subscribe I to you guys tomorrow bye foreign

10 Warning Signs Of Heart Disease NOT TO MISS | Skin & Nails	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8IBkXpXRUI	Dr Day	well hey guys it Valentine it going to be sharing with you 10 signs on your skin of heart disease not to miss what exactly is heart disease it actually several different types of disorders however most commonly is something called coronary artery disease basically problems with the arteries that deliver oxygen to your heart your heart becomes deprived of oxygen and you have well a heart attack heart disease can be a silent killer meaning many people have it and they don signs and symptoms they skin and nail signs of heart disease can be early warning signs Clues and dermatologists often diagnose heart disease when they discover these findings on a skin or nail exam so don just think we and acne we also diagnose many life-threatening health conditions sign number one is swelling in the feet and the lower legs this is called edema swelling in the feet and lower legs is a clue that your heart is not working properly to pump blood around and circulate many diseases of the heart can cause fluid to build up in your lower legs it if you press down your finger will leave a depression in the skin takes a while to fill back up again it collection of fluid in the lower legs when the heart is not pumping and circulating things around efficiently well there in the lower legs starting with the tops of the feet but over time it will start to creep up the lower leg all the way up to your thigh many different types of heart diseases can cause a build up a fluid in the lower legs whether that be coronary artery disease maybe you have an underlying problem with how the heart beats uh and you develop an arhythmia you can develop what failure so this is an early warning sign that things are not circulating around now if you happen to develop edema once in a blue moon Don other causes of lower leg swelling that are not as deadly as heart disease it not uncommon for example for women to develop lower leg swelling in pregnancy as you can imagine with pregnancy you have a lot more blood being produced in the body a lot more volume to circulate around plus you have the weight of the baby kind of slowing down return doesn necessarily mean you have heart disease when in doubt always show your health care provider any of the things I pointing out it might just save your life number two is blue or purple skin discoloration now It the skin to turn bluish purplish when you get really cold but if your skin remains blue or purple once you have warm back up that is worrisome that you might actually have some sort of blockage in a blood vessel for example there syndrome people can develop these bluish Violet spots on their toes and this is actually a sign of something called cholesterol embolism an embolism is basically something that floats around your blood and can get stuck in a blood vessel and plug get up cholesterol can get dislodged from plaques in your arteries and it can make its way to the little blood vessels in your toes and basically plug them up there are a lot of other health problems that can cause blue toe syndrome it but definitely can be a clue to underlying heart disease medical term for bluish discoloration of the skin is cyanosis along those lines you can develop this bluish purplish net-like pattern usually on the upper thighs but really anywhere now this is something that a lot of people will develop in the cold when they get cold or chilled it called liido reticularis reticularis just means net-like kind of looks like a fishing net of blue discoloration on the skin many people develop this when they get cold but if it persists when you are warmed up that is worrisome for perhaps an underlying problem with blocking arteries and leading to this accumulation of blood in the tissue locally it oxygen is not circulating around properly and you pattern of kind of of cyanosis it important to recognize these signs of cholesterol Emi because not only are they part of heart disease for some people it Emi are getting lodged in other tissues in your body you just can remember the skin is a window to what is going on internally and it provides many many Clues and we can see it and and pay attention but these kinds of things may be occurring in organs like your kidney or your lungs and therefore causing problems with oxygenation in those areas so it really important important warning sign to not ignore liido reticularis can also happen as part of underlying autoimmune diseases most commonly lupus lupus is an autoimmune disorder where there are a lot of different skin findings and liido reticularis is one patients who have Lupus their blood is a lot stickier so they are vulnerable to developing this as well as problems with their heart liido reticularis also can develop with certain medications so it slam dunk oh my gosh you have heart disease so don things just bring them to the the attention of your healthc care provider number four are yellow waxy growths on the skin basically they are cholesterol deposits in your skin they are painless they often happen around the eyes they can also happen on the lines of your palms or on the backs of your uh legs if you discover these definitely bring them to your attention of your healthc care provider blood work is necessary to evaluate the lipids in your blood and your cholesterol unhealthy cholesterol levels require treatment to lower the cholesterol and prevent life-threatening heart heart disease once you get the cholesterol levels under control of medication these bumps can sort of go away however sometimes they don away and there are certain treatments that a dermatologist can perform to get rid of them for example they can be treated with something called electrodessication basically just kind of singes and melts away the little fatty deposit but treating the underlying problem with the blood cholesterol is Paramount again to prevent life-threatening heart disease now these little yellow growths they come in a few flavors if you will one that I know a lot of you guys have asked me about is called xanthelasma little yellow firm bumps around the eyes but you can also develop cholesterol collections Under the Skin it a larger nodule it another sign of a problem with the blood lipids is an eruption all of a sudden out of nowhere of many little firm yellow waxy bumps usually on the Torso the upper back these are called eruptive xanthomas they look like warts or they also look like mum which as a side note I recently did a video All About moles gum these little viral bumps that are common in children but anyone can develop them check that out if you are wondering if that might be what you have but eruptive xanthoma definitely can look like them they have this yellowish appearance with eruptive xanthomas the underlying lipid abnormality on your blood work is usually a very high triglyceride level if you didn dermatologist we don skin we look at the nails as well we are the medical experts on all things nails and nails can tell you a lot about a person look for as a side note I have many videos on this channel detailing different nail findings associated with different underlying health problems like thyroid disease so definitely check those out if you are at all intrigued by things that go on in your nails some patients develop down curvature of the nails and a widening of the tip of their finger this is called clubbing this can be the result of a heart infection heart disease or a lung problem it also can be completely harmless in some people but basically what is happening is you have thickening of the skin around the finger and you also have extra growth of bone there it problems with oxygenation to the tissues perhaps but one way to evaluate for this is to put the index fingers completely together flush and normally you should see a little Diamond space between them that disappears then that have clubbing if you still have that little Diamond space congratulations you do not have clubbing another nail finding associated with an infection in the heart is called Splinter Hemes basically these little red lines that are collections of blood under the nails these are really common they specific for infections of the heart they trauma men tend to have them more so than women but anyone can develop them they psoriasis or nail like and plainness so if you have these don God I have I have an infection in my heart if you have these and you have a high fever and in IR regular heartbeat though that is a clue for something called bacterial endocarditis uh a serious life-threatening infection in the heart as part of heart disease requires treatment with antibiotics you can get a buildup of collections of proteins essentially in different organs including your heart this is called systemic ameloid dois and a skin sign that this is going on and could again be affecting your heart is the development of these smooth waxy lumps um on the skin not only can they be present in the skin the heart but they can be present in other organs really important to identify them because they are a clue that maybe the patient has an underlying systemic amalo dois while those are typically painless you can develop painful bumps on the palms and Soles skin colored little nodules these are called ocers nodules named after some famous doctor who identified them this is another skin sign that you have an infection going on in the heart it called infectious endocarditis those little nodules are important to recognize they usually last anywhere from a few hours to maybe a few weeks they do go away but it is imperative that the patient be treated with antibiotics to treat the infection in their heart and um bloodstream and last but not least you can develop little brown reddish spots on the palms and Soles these are also a sign that you have a bacterial infection in the heart called again bacterial endocarditis these and contrast to the little osler these are called janway lesions again named after some famous doctor who identified them but they are a important clue of an underlying heart infection similar to osler up and go away without any treatment on their own however treatment with antibiotics is essential to treat the actual infection in the heart all right y nail signs of heart disease not to miss do you guys like my little floating heart back there I had to just put it in the background today since Valentine Day is coming up and we were talking all things heart in this video heart disease is no joke it is it can be a silent killer it of the signs to identify not only in yourself but maybe in a loved one who might be you know sick sick in the hospital it really can it really can save the day I clue to what is going on inside internally and dermatologists can save lives just by looking at people so uh hopefully this video was educational to you let us know in the comments if you or someone you love uh deals with heart disease has had a heart attack um it is very distressing to go through if you like these kind of videos on skin signs of medical problems not to miss I have them all saved in a playlist I have a video all about thyroid disease High cortisol you name it I have a

9 Warning Signs Of Selenium Deficiency And Toxicity	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJm0NWQb6Tk	Dr Day	it to see me coming they their boots every day at 11:00 a.m. Central Standard Time watching when the video goes live making sure it about them supplements the supplement industry is scared today we talk about selenium why it is amazing for your skin your hair your nails your total body health and I going to I far as supplements because you can have too much of a good thing selenium is a trace mineral it is found in soil and it gets incorporated into plants that we eat or that other animals eat and they then incorporate it and we eat them and we get selenium what is the deal with this Trace mineral why is it so important it our body because it is part of what are called seleno proteins and many of these proteins are antioxidants have you heard of glutathione peroxidases if you watching a skin care Channel you probably have I glutathione it right and so you need selenium in order to fight off the free radicals the free radicals they to beat down the cell with all of their all of their nastiness um so saleno proteins are a game Cher for our body for helping to put the brakes on unnecessary oxidative stress the damages lipids DNA proteins in different cellular structures gets in the way of things and not only is it a vital antioxidant defense okay it really important for the execution of proper immune responses immune function immune regulation and fighting off infections if you don selenium you the cookie will crumble you have problems fighting off infection you in the world where the selenium and the soil content is low people are a lot more at risk for deficiency they have bigger problems with infections flu outbreaks in certain areas of the world where selenium deficiency is a lot more common thought to perhaps be related to the selenium deficiency allowing for these viral outbreaks to get so out of control what about with the skin well your skin you guys already know okay you already know those of you in the front of the class you already know you already know the skin it what is going on internally and let me tell you when selenium is low you going to be you skin in okay you growing that long strong healthy hair your nails are not going to be scratch their eyeballs out ready okay because these are things that the body does not prioritize when stuff is not where it needs to be okay L healthy hair it great for attracting a mate beautiful not a priority when you are nutrient deficient okay um lower levels of selenium I but lower lower levels of selenium have been associated with more stubborn acne more rough cases of psoriasis and also more rough cases of atopic dermatitis no surprise these are inflammatory skin issues when selenium levels are not good inflammation in the body is going to be more of a problem you able to deal with oxidative stress as readily and a lot of things are going to be problematic more likely to have dry irritated skin and you likely to deal with premature skin aging and compromised ability to handle environmental aggressors ultraviolet radiation is you know really going to be do a number on your skin above and beyond what it does for anyone else skin because your antioxidant systems are not optimized so there a whole lot you can do to help offset that and also you know pollution infrared radiation selenium is really vital for growing hair and if you don have good selenium level you likely will experience excessive hair shedding Frank hair loss and guess what else is not going to be happening to your liking hair pigmentation if your selenium levels Get Low could cause premature graying of the hair check out my video on how to reverse gray hair while it sounds like a pipe dream and unfortunately in most cases it is a pipe dream there are some of these rare situations where if you cusp and you you you you related to something like low selenium that can be corrected right quick that population might bounce back and you can get repigmentation stranger things have been known to happen and it is possible there there skin infections are going to be more of an issue barrier function is not quite right I mean it who is at risk who is at risk that is the important question when you talk about a nutrient deficiency uh mineral deficiency vitamin deficiency you need to figure out who we should be focusing our attention on not everyone in the room in fact I would argue most people watching this video this is not likely an issue okay it probably not you people who are of concern are people who live in areas of the world where the soil is so deficient and they have poor access to food also people who are on what parental nutrition mean they all their food from a tube bypassing the mouth if that tpn as it properly formulated with selenium yeah they eating but when I say the skin is a window to what is going on internally what exactly can go arai when you don have adequate selenium levels the heart is wounded by this you can get a cardio myopathy heart failure it disease do you see this in areas of the world like certain parts of China where the selenium content in the soil is low this is a real problem also uh the selenop proteins game Cher for thyroid function you absolutely absolutely have to have selenium in order to make thyroid hormone things just go south quick okay check out my video on signs of low thyroid thyroid disease is no joke also when the selenium levels are too low your muscular skeletal system gets all messed up you get swollen bones swollen cartilage swollen joints joint deformity it can be debilitating debilitating immobilize you okay also when your selenium is low you can have some mood impacts you might feel depressed you might be increasingly hostile also you have poor memory number one way to terrify a jenzy male just say these two words low testosterone low testosterone when you have low selenium low testosterone okay infertility in men real issue there you definitely can get way too much selenium anything over 400 microgr a day can be quite dangerous and it level if you start taking supplements what happens when your selenium is too high you might wonder well you to be on the toilet okay lots of diarrhea gastrointestinal upset you going to be fatigued while selenium is vital for growing hair too much selenium guess what hair loss it is the Goldie Lock mineral too little hair loss too much hair loss just right the just right for the vast majority of us comes from just eating food okay um so you don want too much hair will fall out also joint pain too little you got deformed joints too much joint pain you going to be super irritable skin findings you skin brittle nails you can get this thick rough warty stuff building up under your nails they can become discolored and you can develop a blistering skin rash I show you a picture of that here because it is very um what YouTube would describe it shocking content to me it not but you know I so we skin rash and you get what I also also your fingernails get all discolored your teeth become modeled and another Telltale sign that your selenium is too high you have garlic breath like you breath is potent pobles this is nothing to take lightly it can progress to Frank neurologic damage the reason I your attention to this is because I noticed this trend where I think these supplement companies they go into Google they go into PubMed and they find out like different nutrients minerals Etc where when low are associated with different types of hair loss and they say oh okay if low causes hair loss then high must be the secret to Long strong healthy hair and they pump a bunch of that mineral nutrient into their supplement selenium like I said anything over 400 microgram a day is getting Into the Danger Zone and I have come across many dietary supplements with 200 microG in a single dose of the supplement and I know what you are team supplement you I take the supplement I up on the dose why should it matter well here just take one dietary supplement they take multiple other dietary supplements which also might contain high low medium amounts of supplemental selenium throw in a few Brazil nuts bam you are in the danger zone you can have acute toxicity but you can also get tox from just chronically overc consuming selenium on like a daily basis recently I did a video calling out the problems with the dietary supplement industry and that they possible side effects toxicities and caution against combining their supplement with other drugs so like I said you might take this you might try a new protein powder that if you don read the label too carefully you don realize they put a multivitamin blend in there that also contains selenium before you know it you day throw in a couple of nuts some a steak at the end of the day boom you are getting into a high level of selenium and it can be dangerous really really dangerous also also there have been cases of selenium toxicity acutely due to very high amounts of selenium and dietary supplements above and beyond what was disclosed on the label this happened in 2008 and it happened again in 2011 essentially outbreaks of hyper selenosis High selenium related to dietary supplements and this is another reason why you have to be careful with dietary supplements they to follow any sort of evidence-based dosing guideline there supplement 200 microgram of selenium there and in the absence of having low selenium there beneficial in any regard they required to adhere to any sort of evidence-based guideline and a lot of times these dietary supplements don have what they claim to have they have higher or lower doses or ingredients that aren nutrifol includes 200 microG of selenium and their hair supplement both their original one and the vegan one have 200 microG of selenium be really careful if you responsible for a case of serious liver failure likely due to a combination of things in the formula and so the 200 microG of selenium in there could also be dangerous for you um anyways guys that important vital but you can have way too much of a good thing and it can be dangerous and things can go south very quickly I hope this video was informative to you on the inside I going to put my video all about the dark side of the dietary supplement industry check that one out next and if you guys enjoyed this one give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don I [Music]	Success
Skin Signs Of An Overactive Thyroid	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwGdvK5O8ww	Dr Day	well hey guys in today going to be talking about signs your thyroid hormone is too high your skin your hair your nails they are a window to what is going on inside and can give you some Clues if your thyroid hormones are out of whack your thyroid is a gland that sits in front of your neck and produces thyroid hormone hormones are basically small chemicals that coordinate activities throughout your body thyroid hormone is responsible for controlling your metabolism and you want just the right amount of thyroid hormone if you have too little you get very sluggish and have all sort of health problems too much you get very jittery and have all sorts of health problems now why might you have high thyroid there are a variety of health conditions that lead to hyperthyroidism the most common is an autoimmune disease called Graves disease you can also have an inflamed thyroid that thyroiditis something called toxic multinodular goiter or something called a toxic adoma you can even have high thyroid because you are basically taking into too much thyroid hormone in the form of a medication that iatrogenic hyperthyroidism the classic finding to say oh my gosh this person thyroid hormone may be out of whack it may be too high is your skin becomes thin you also have thin sparse hair hair loss and because thyroid hormone plays such a role in your metabolism when it is too high your metabolism gets revved up you get very hot and guess what you get very sweaty hyperhydrosis is the medical term for excessive sweating that is a manifestation that your thyroid hormone is too hot if you are sweating bullets left and right in addition to sweating a lot your face becomes flushed very easily and many people who have hyperthyroidism develop red Palms palar athema you know red Palms can be a sign of a lot of problems different hormone disorders and I have a video all about what it means to have red Palms so if you palms right now trying to figure out if you have hyperthyroidism don there are a lot of other reasons for red Palms which I cover in that video with hyperthyroidism your hair density changes it becomes very thin because thyroid hormone plays a critical role in controlling the hair cycle your hair is not all in the growing phase some of the hair follicles on your head are in the resting phase and then shed but when your thyroid hormone is messed up all of that gets confused and so you can develop thinning hair but high thyroid can present in some unusual ways namely pre-tibial mix Eda otherwise known as thyroid dermopathy this is a skin sign specific to Graves disease it pre- tibia because the tibia is a large bone in your lower leg and the skin problem typically happens on your shins on your lower leg but it can also happen elsewhere like the backs of your shoulders the backs of your hands the backs of your feet pretibial mix Adema looks like these very well demarcated pinkish purplish bumps again Over The Shins most often and the skin there it takes on this characteristic po orang appearance like an orange peel with pre-tibial mix Adema you develop edema swelling and as the tissues swell the hair follicles kind of stretch and plump up so it looks like the surface of an orange pretibial mix Adema takes on this characteristic appearance because the skin has become infiltrated with mucin and glycos amino glycans when you biopsy the skin you see all of this muin non-cellular material it takes over and it pushes all the little collagen bundles in the deeper layers of your skin it pushes them apart pre-tibial miedema is much more common in women compared to men four times more common in women compared to men people with Graves disease who use tobacco are much more likely to develop pretibial mix edema why we have something to do with inflammation and the autoimmune Cascade of inflammatory events associated with this disorder pretibial mix edema is very commonly seen with something called Graves opthalmopathy maybe you have seen photographs of people who have Graves disease but can impact the skin around the eyes and the the tissues around the eyes and cause the eyes to bulge out about 30% of people who have Graves disease will have uh Graves opthalmopathy basically the autoimmune inflammation infiltrates around the eye and causes the eyes to bulge out and it can be Vision threatening pretibial mix edema is typically painless it doesn bother people other than the way that it appears but if it goes on and the thyroid disease is uncontrolled it can progress to an extent where it actually starts to impair uh lymphatic flow and you can actually develop lymphadema on top of it but as far as dealing with the pretibial mix edema to a certain extent it may improve with appropriate treatment of the graves disease but other things can be offered like topical or intralesional meaning injected uh corticosteroid moving on to another much more unusual manifestation of hyperthyroid disease it acropachy so thyroid acropachy is a very rare manifestation of graves disease happening in roughly Z .3% of people with Graves disease basically the fingers swell and you get clubbing of the fingernails patients who have thyroid acropachy almost always have thyroid opthalmopathy so the eye manifestation if you take X-rays of the hands with somebody who has thyroid acropachy you actually see part of the bone starts to thicken in the fingertips thyroid acropachy can in affect the fingers or the toes the digital swelling the nail clubbing not only is thyroid acropachy R but in contrast to the other much more common signs of high thyroid hormone thyroid acropachy is something that late stage manifestation of graves disease but high thyroid can also have some other skin manifestations namely people who have hyperthyroidism actually can present with jaundice your skin turns yellow the whites of your eyes turn yellow if you lift up your tongue and look underneath it you can see yellowing that place where jaice appears uh you know there are receptors for thyroid hormone and your skin your hair and your nails but also it function and your liver is necessary for the metabolism of thyroid hormone so when the thyroid hormone is so high your liver has a lot more to do with it and it can become negatively impacted and therefore you can develop jaundice let talk about your nails though because one uh clue for high thyroid is actually something called oncolysis that is a fancy medical term for when the tips of your nails your fingernails start to peel away with anlysis what happens is the nail plate which is the part of the nail plate furthest away from uh like your half Moons it separates from the underlying nail bed and kind of peels away another rare nail manifestation of high thyroid is something called half and half nails or Lindsay Lindsay was the individual who first identified this it with high thyroid this nail find is actually much more commonly seen in patients who have chronic renal failure or kidney disease but it can be also observed in uh some cases of graves disease it because half the nail is white and the the distal part at least 20% of the distal part of the nail kind of has this pinkish look to it and therefore it called half and half Nails we a lot about the skin and the nail but when it comes to your hair you know I mentioned typically patients who have high thyroid their hair becomes much more sparse they develop kind of diffuse hair thinning but because a lot of patients who have high thyroid have high thyroid because they have an underlying autoimmune disease they also are predisposed to develop an autoimmune hair loss called alipa Arana basically your immune system which is you know causing issues with your thyroid it also decides to rebel against your hair follicle and cause bald patches uh alopecia Arata in contrast to other types of hair loss is not scarring so the areas where you lose hair and it goes bald you can get hair growth back in those areas alopecia Arata can involve just localized areas of the scalp or it can be much more diffuse involving all of your your scalp hair it also can affect the beard it can affect the eyebrows the eyelashes the other thing that has been observed in some patients who have Graves disease when it comes to their hair is a hair finding referred to as pilai anula pil anula is a fancy name for ringed hair it typically inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion but in some cases of grav disease individuals can develop pil on body now what exactly does it mean to have ringed hair the hair takes on this almost striped Spangled appearance when you look at the hair strand under the microscope you actually see alternating dark and light and when you look very carefully the dark spots actually have little air spaces in them it pilli anula some other skin diseases that are common in patients who have autoimmune thyroid disease high thyroid related to their immune system is ticaria ticaria is the medical term for for hives um I have videos as a side note on here all about how to get rid of hives fast we talk all about the multiple causes and reasons for having hives it basically you develop these red raised itchy patches anywhere on the body especially aggravated by rubbing or stroking the skin hot temperatures stress and a lot of patients who have autoimmune thyroid disease have uh ticaria now ticaria is grouped into two two flavors there meaning you for less than 6 weeks when you start getting hives daily for greater than 6 weeks it becomes chronic ticaria now the key with hives with ticaria is that each Hive each welt it comes up it itchy but it doesn few hours now you will go on to develop hives elsewhere right next to it but an individual Hive if you Circle it when you first notice it it should not sit there for more than a couple of hours anything lasting more than 24 hours is not ticaria it could though be another condition that a lot of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease may get um it vasculitis is a fancy medical term for inflammation around the blood vessels and it can have all sorts of skin manifestations erario vasculitis patients get hives or what look like hives but in contrast to ordinary hives the welts that pop up they last longer than 24 hours so when you Circle them and they stay there longer than 24 hours that is a sign it variety hives it might be ertic carial vasculitis with ertical vasculitis in contrast to being uh super itchy it often uh painful and burns and with ertic carial vasculitis you know you got inflammation around the blood vessels that inflammation causes the blood vessels to get leaky and you get what perpa is basically leakage of blood into the Skin So if you take anything away from this video If you ever get hives Circle a hive once it pops up and keep an eye on it see how long it lasts if it lasts longer than 24 hours that that it variety hives all right you guys those are the skin hair and nail signs that thyroid hormone is too high now again I do have a video all about the signs that your thyroid hormone is too low so you may want to check that out I have a whole playlist on my channel as a side note if you are new here all about these skin signs of health problems like having low iron having low vitamin D all sorts of health problems that your skin can provide a clue to I likely have a video on anyway you guys I hope you enjoyed this video if so give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe I bye [Music]	Success
Gut Issues That Trigger Skin Problems	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p89Y55zCYrw	Dr Day	It been a trending topic of interest for quite some time now. Now, your gut and your skin, guess what? They are chatting back and forth on a regular basis. So, when there are problems going on in the gut, such as bacterial overgrowth, otherwise known as gut dispiosis, you can have skin findings. Weight loss surgery is of course nothing new, but back in the 70s the procedure was maybe not quite as sophisticated as the procedures that are available today. And a lot of those patients emerged with the skin rash coupled with fever and arthritis and that became known as bowel associated dermatosis arthritis syndrome. You guessed it, the shortand of that is badass. Now today, this condition is still observed, but it can be seen in different gut disorders aside from weight loss surgery. The surgeries have gotten better, but we still have a lot of other reasons to have bacterial overgrowth in our intestines, gut dispiosis, and the skin problem. We going to cover the skin findings, but who gets this? Well, patients who have inflammatory bowel disease would represent a good chunk of those who go on to develop this. inflammatory bowel disease. As a reminder, is sort of an umbrella for two main conditions, ulcerative colitis and Crohn As a side note, recently I did a deep dive on all of the possible skin findings associated with those bad boys. So, definitely check that out after you watch this one if you are someone who struggles with either of those diseases. Some patients have what intestinal bacterial overgrowth or SIBO where you have a problem with the little valve between certain segments of the small intestine that results in retrograde meaning backward flux of bacteria and overgrowth of bacteria and parts of the small intestine and a whole host of symptoms. Those patients can develop the skin problem known as badass. It patients who have appendicitis, dimeticulitis, and peptic ulcer disease. For whatever reason, in these different types of conditions, there might be some underlying anatomical change in the gastrointestinal tract that allows for pockets of bacteria to kind of get out of whack, proliferate, and you can get bacterial overgrowth. Like I said, with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or SIBO, you have a problem with the valve and part of the small intestine, which allows for bacteria to take over retrograde. Patients who have inflammatory bowel disease like Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, you know, they their digestive tract, a lot of inflammation. They can form what are known as fistulas which are a connection like a tube-like connection connecting two body spaces organs that should not be connected. They also can develop what fistulas and the adhesions they can be little nitises of abnormal bacterial overgrowth. At least in the case of inflammatory bowel diseases like ulcerative colitis and Crohn there is baseline increase in intestinal permeability. Now some people might label this as leaky gut. The details of that I think get blown out of proportion. But yes, there is some baseline increase in permeability of the intestines in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The underlying root problem here is that you have gut dispiosis. You have a problem with bacterial overgrowth. And some of that bacteria makes its way outside of the lumen, the little inside of your intestine into the bloodstream. the bacteria along with different bacterial toxins, stuff that the bacteria make. Once it gets into the bloodstream, your immune system is like um no thank you. And your immune system, you know, it keeps you healthy in a variety of ways. And one way it attacks stuff is through the formation of imunoglobulins, which think of them as like a little arrow, okay? You got a bow and arrow. If you the immune system and you see you see like a bacteria floating around and you shoot the arrow, it pierces the bacteria or sticks on the bacteria. Well, now you imunogloabbulin that complex. And those circulate around and guess what? They get stuck in your skin. They get stuck in your joints and are what are responsible for the symptoms of bowel associated dermatosis arthritis syndrome. It is an immune complex deposition disorder. Once those immune complexes deposit get stuck in like your skin and joints, that leads to another inflammatory response where a bunch of cells called neutrfils come in. Whenever there are a lot of neutrfils, you have the opportunity to see well pus. So now that you have some understanding of the behind the scenes of this, what does it look like? Bell associated dermatosis arthritis syndrome is a relapsing condition. meaning you can have a flare up of it and it can go away and stay away for a while and it might come back again at a later time. It consists of having fever, an arthritis which typically affects like the knee, the elbow, might affect some of the joints in the hand and also the ankle. You experience muscle aches, just generally feeling like you have a flu-l like illness, chills, maybe you have night sweats. You revved up in your body. And of course, Germaine to this video and this channel, skin findings that can fool you at first glance, especially when they are in the early stages of developing. The rash of bowel associated dermatosis arthritis syndrome usually starts on the trunk, maybe like the shoulders, the upper extremities, and it tends to spread out as it progresses. Tends to encompass larger body surfaces. It starts out as this little red bump that might look like a bug bite or a little hive. And these little bumps, they might get larger. And they often develop a little pus bump in the center. That a pule. Might look like a blister, but it pestules, meaning there bacterial infection going on there. It related rather to the deposition of immune complexes in the skin and the subsequent influx of neutrfils into that area which leads to the formation of pus. These little pus bumps can extend and involve larger areas. They can be larger lesions. You might even develop ulcers in some cases. In some cases, you might even have a rash on the palms that consists of what looks like little blood blisters. You might even have these spots on the soles of your feet as well. In the setting of a flare up, you might also develop little soores inside the mouth, commonly referred to as cankera sores, otherwise known as aptus ulcers. As a side note, I have a video all about canker sores. If you ever had one, they are miserable. They Check that video out cuz I give a lot of tips and tricks on how to remedy them, how to prevent them from coming back. But if you are in a flare up of bowel associated dermatosis, arthritis, it would not be unusual for you to have sores inside the mouth and you might even have little pus bumps and ulcers and and painful spots on the lips as well. The other skin finding that can show up along with this or might be confused with this is athemma. This is a skin condition where you get these painful tender nodules most often on the lower legs like the shins but honestly can happen anywhere. Arythemodosum is an inflammation in the subcutaneous fatty compartments of the skin. It a paniculitis and it can be seen with a variety of background medical issues and medication. So if you have this, it doesn bowel associated dermatosis arthritis. And in some cases, those little pus bumps, they might develop into a full-fledged ulcer known as pyoderma gangrinosa, which is an expanding ulcer that has these very expansive borders and can go quite deep. Again, can happen on the lower legs, but really anywhere on the body. All right, hopefully I not freaked you out too much at this point in the video. Especially if you do have inflammatory bowel disease or SIBO and you\\ going to develop this? breath because this is very rare. I think I have seen maybe two cases of it in my lifetime. It realm of possibilities, but it can happen, but it which your skin and your gut can be in cahoots when something is going ary. While it is rare, it is more often seen in people who have inflammatory bowel disease, especially ulcerative colitis. It seems to be more common these days in women in their 40s. Not as common anymore in people who have had weight loss surgery, likely due to advancements in surgical technique around weight loss surgery. What do you do once this develops? How is it handled? Well, sometimes it just spontaneously resolves on its own in the matter of a couple of days with no treatment. Yeah, leaving it alone and ignoring it might actually be a potential treatment. Of course, there are more severe, more extensive cases that are going to warrant more aggressive medical therapies. If you have inflammatory bowel disease, whether it be ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease, treating the bowel disease is of paramount importance and medications that target specific aspects of the abnormal immune response in those diseases are needed. But when a dermatologist is called upon to manage these skin symptoms, findings skin lesions, how do we get them to go away? Above and beyond controlling underlying medical problems. Well, again, there is a problem with an abnormal overgrowth of certain bacteria in the digestive tract. So, what do you think we to try and tackle that? Well, we going to prescribe antibiotics, specifically tetracycans and an antibiotic known as metroniditool. Antibiotics will help reduce the burden of that problematic bacteria and they also have some anti-inflammatory properties about them that make them particularly useful in treating inflammatory conditions as well. Also, due to the extent of inflammation causing the joint pain, all the other symptoms, a course of an oral steroid or an IV steroid may be necessary like predinazone for example, just to get that inflammation to die down from those immune complexes. Speaking of immune complexes, remember when they deposit, they incite an influx of neutrfils and that is a big problem with the little pus bump formation as well as just the overall kind of potentially destructive local nature of the skin lesions as they start to possibly expand. So a medication that can work actually really well for anything that involves an influx of those neutrfils is called dapsone. We use dapsone to treat many skin conditions and dermatology because of this anti-neutrifil effect that it has. In some cases, your dermatologist might lean into injecting steroid medicine directly into some of these skin spots, and that might be helpful. However, topical steroids, while a dermatologic go-to for many conditions, are not particularly helpful here. Even though this condition is very unsettling and very uncomfortable to go through, there is light at the end of the tunnel. Like I said, it need to panic. This video is meant for educational purposes, not to scare you to bits. Now, what could you do aside from medications? Is there any sort of supplement that you might take? Well, that is an area of active and ongoing research for which there really isn good evidence that supplements will help this condition. There is one supplement that maybe your gastroenerologist might recommend to you that has been shown to reduce intestinal permeability in people who have inflammatory bowel disease and that is glutamate. Is there any type of diet that could be particularly useful in this situation? We don evidence of any one diet being superior especially given how rare this condition is in the first place. Though some patients with inflammatory bowel disease, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth do benefit from a trial, a period of time at least of what is known as a low FODMAP diet. This is a very specific diet that you should discuss with your gastroenterologist on how to properly execute, but that might be something that also provides you with some symptomatic relief as well. All right, guys. So, that talk about in today throw around the term gut health, gut dispiosis, gut bacteria, but this is a real life problem that affects people. While it it can be very debilitating and as you can imagine, very distressing to go through, there is a true underlying root cause mechanism, immune complex deposition in the skin and the joints, an immune complex disorder. And there are established treatments that can help clear this up. And it responds well in most cases to medication. All right, y recent video all about the skin signs of inflammatory bowel diseases like ulcerative colitis and Crohn You that one next. Also consider watching my video on athemodosum, those painful nodules that can be warning signs of a variety of different health problems such as inflammatory bowel disease.

8 Biotin Deficiency Warning Signs NOT TO MISS | Hair, Skin, & Nails	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmQVNNZvnm8	Dr Day	warning signs you the skin is a window to what is going on internally in today to be covering the dermatologic findings the hair the skin the nail changes that suggest you might be biotin deficient biotin is an essential micronutrient it is a B vitamin commonly referred to as vitamin H human tissues don biotin however bacteria that live in a large intestine can produce Biotin and it found in fruits vegetables nuts seeds legumes whole grains Meats fish and dairy products biotin is an essential co-factor for enzymes known as carboxylases which are really important for things like fatty acid synthesis glucano Genesis the expression and control of different genes biotin deficiency doesn at once its onset in terms of symptomatology is gradual and onset but again the skin can be an early warning sign so what are some warning signs that you are biotin deficient when it com to the skin hyperesthesia heighten sensitivity to light touch maybe you notice that when your hair brushes against your face it feels uncomfortable conjunctivitis or red eyes kind of look like you have pink eye and glossitis which is the medical terminology for an inflamed red swollen painful tongue now if you on this channel with regards to the skin signs of various micronutrient deficiencies you is a common finding so it to biotin deficiency but it certainly can be found all right probably what biotin is most well known for is how important it is for healthy hair growth if you are biotin deficient you can expect to experience thinning of the hair and gradual hair loss not just from your scalp but from the rest of your body as well including sparse thinning lashes brows and eventual total body hair loss if allowed to progress untreated biotin is also important for healthy nail growth people who are biotin deficient develop very brittle nails with splitting of the nails bind and deficiency leads to a characteristic facial rash it is periorificial in location meaning it occurs around orifices like around the mouth the nose and the eyes this rash is scaly flaky and dry in appearance sometimes easily mistaken for sebc dermatitis it can become more widespread and involve the skin around the anogenital area sometimes it might also look like psoriasis or the dry skin condition iosis as with many other nutrient deficiency it is not uncommon to develop dry scaly flaky skin in general with biotin deficiency because the skin becomes dry flaky the barrier is impaired again you don function of those key enzymes you are more predisposed to skin infections with different fungi and yeast so you may develop candidal yeast infections in the skin folds readily as a result of your biotin deficiency check out my video on signs of yeast infection on the skin to go into more Det detail with what those might look like outside of the skin hair nail and mucous membrane warning signs of biotin deficiency you can also start to feel well generally quite unwell and have neurologic problems such as seizures brain fog depression many patients with biotin deficiency also have muscle aches and pain these are non-specific but definitely can go along with biotin deficiency while these findings can occur with biotin deficiency they specific and so you might be freaking out looking at your SE dermatitis on your face worry that you have Biotin deficiency so who exactly is at risk for biotin deficiency this may come as a surprise to you but a a group of people who are at risk for sure are individuals who rather enjoy regularly consuming raw egg whites uncooked egg whites when ingested on a regular basis I talking about once or twice here and there to be cool around your friends I talking as part of your regular diet consuming raw egg whites can easily lead to biotin deficiency the reason for this is that raw egg whites contain a glycoprotein known as avidin which binds to Biotin and affects its absorption fortunately when you cook egg whites this denatures the abidin so it issue patients who are in the hospital and have to be placed on a type of nutrition known as total parental nutrition these patients are at risk for a variety of nutrient deficiencies including biotin if not properly addressed anytime I do a video on the warning signs of any sort of of nutritional deficiency I always have to bring this up but a group of people who are at risk for all sorts of nutrient deficiencies are individuals who struggle with chronic alcoholism alcohol specifically inhibits the absorption of biotin it who chronically abuse alcohol to have low Biotin and put themselves at risk for biotin deficiency as well as a whole host of other B vitamin deficiencies in fact plasma biotin concentrations are low and about 15% of patients with chronic alcohol ISM pregnant and breastfeeding women are also at risk for well low biotin I should say as a matter of fact many pregnant women have low plasma levels of biotin plasma and breast milk concentrations of biotin also can commonly be low in lactating women so if you are pregnant or breastfeeding make sure you discuss with your obstetrician regarding optimal nutrition and if you need to be supplementing with biotin then there are certain medications that can interfere with biotin absorption or enhance its metabolism making your biotin levels low specifically medications used to treat seizure disorders such as carbom mipim phenin phenobarbitol primene anyone who has an underlying malabsorption problem whether that be related to some sort of surgical reection a part of their digestive tract or an underlying medical condition that makes it difficult for them to absorb nutrients from their Foods they there are three very rare genetic conditions that lead to biotin deficiency but if you had that you would know those are usually diagnosed when you serious consequences to being left untreated this is one of the most important takeaways from today is that biotin deficiency is actually super rare unless you amounts of raw egg whites unless you struggle with alcoholism unless you have a very rare genetic Condition it very uncommon to have Biotin deficiency it is readily obtained from our diet if you are eating provided you don some malabsorption syndrome you are unlikely to be biotin deficient it very very unlikely what that you have hair loss related to age or you have CC dermatitis which is common check out my videos on it or you have brittle nail syndrome which commonly affects middle-aged women all right that supplement with biotin will it actually help us out there research to support taking biotin supplements for Hair Skin or nails despite the fact that biotin supplements and Hair Skin and nail vitamins are widely available heavily promoted and heavily sought after for that matter there is a small bit of research that suggests that biotin supplementation might be helpful for the brittle nail syndrome however more research is needed whoop-de-do why not just take biotin regardless well biotin supplementation actually can be pretty harmful why it can interfere with certain blood tests that your doctor might order to check for certain things biotin supplementation has actually led to false positive results meaning the lab test says you have a disease you don have also false negative tests meaning the lab test says you don disease that you actually have why does this happen well when your doctor sends your blood to the lab to be tested for certain things there are different ways to test the blood and certain blood tests utilize a technology known as biotin strip avidin it but if you have very high levels of bio in the blood it can interfere with how this particular test Works resulting in either falsely high or falsely low lab values what are some examples of lab tests that can be affected by taking biotin test to check thyroid hormone test to check vitamin D a test known as the pro BNP this is a test that might be ordered in the hospital to check to see if you are in congestive heart failure for example taking 10 milligram of biotin within 24 hours of having your thyroid test taken can screw up the test and you may be thinking well I taking 10 Mig how big of a deal can it be keep in mind they sneak biotin into a lot of things these days I noticed it in a lot of beverages sport drinks energy drinks Etc there have actually been case reports of people diagnosed with Graves disease when they don Graves disease because biotin screwed up their thyroid tests and also super scary is the fact that biotin can interfere with the blood tests that are run to check to see if if you having a heart attack in fact there is one case where someone actually died of a heart attack and their lab tests were showing that they didn for a heart attack because the biotin interfered with a test known as a troponin so if you are taking biotin it within a week of having your blood drawn in order to avoid having it interfere with the accuracy of these blood tests and of course make sure you tell your doctor that you are taking biotin alert them that you have stop taking it in advance of your appointment so that they know that and know that it might influence the lab test here know about you guys but I don plan out when I attack I do but it generally don calendar so how are you going to know to stop your biotin supplementation in advance of having a heart attack you not so in my opinion biotin is one of those things that is way over hype the research supporting taking all this biotin is just not there there evidence that it really solves any common existing problems aside from of course patients who are the exception that do in fact have Biotin deficiency on the flip side rather than solving any problem it is well established to cause a problem meaning inaccurate false positive or false negative blood work which can be quite dangerous it might result in you getting falsely diagnosed with something it might result in a misdiagnosis or it might result in you well having to go through more lab testing more expensive testing and in today well frankly bankrupt because Medical Care ain all of that unnecessary stress can end up well impacting your hair growth and leading to a telogen of fluvium excessive hair shedding all right guys those are the warning signs of biotin deficiency biotin deficiency is very serious and can be life-threatening if left untreated however it so think about that before going after those biotin supplements cuz they might end up harming you rather than helping you I hope this video was informative to you guys now on the ins slate I to put one of my more recent videos on more warning signs of an underlying micronutrient deficiency so check that video out next but if you guys like this one give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don

TOXIC MERCURY FOUND IN SKIN BLEACHING CREAMS ? @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D9ebGIc5I	Dr Day	Mercury and cosmetics is a really serious issue that we about in today is the skin issue that affects many people around the world whether it be related to Healing acne and old bug bite prior skin injury melasma or an autoimmune condition and skin care products aiming to improve hyperpigmentation have been around sold around the world for a long time unfortunately there still exists a market for mercury containing skin lightening and skin bleaching creams which are very harmful to human health these products frequently either have mercury on its own or in combination with hydroquinone due to safety concerns around Mercury containing hydroquinone creams many countries around the world have banned the sale of Cosmetics containing hydroquinone now I want to make it clear hydroquinone used under the supervision of your treating health care provider as a medication is safe however there are safety concerns with selling hydroquinone in a cosmetic especially when products contain unsafe levels of mercury and safety concerns regarding Mercury containing hydroquinone creams have led to Banning of cosmetic hydroquinone in many countries such as Japan the EU Australia and several African nations since 2006. in 1983 South Africa banned all but two percent hydroquinone and cosmetics and the Ivory Coast has actually banned all skin whitening cream since 2015. in 2016 Ghana issued a ban on all products containing hydroquinone and as you guys know from my videos in 2020 the U.S cares act resulted in Banning of over-the-counter sales of hydroquinone to be clear hydroquinone is safe when used under the supervision of your treating health care provider there are risks and side effects but it is overall safe concerns that legislators have raised about hydroquinone being carcinogenic actually come from animal studies and we don or proof that actually happens in people we treat a wide array of skin conditions of hyper pigmentation for many many years without any evidence that it causes any type of cancer regardless today we are focusing on Mercury not hydroquinone but a lot of times Mercury is added to hydroquinone creams that are illegal despite being illegal these Mercury containing creams can still be found through a variety of online retailers these products are disproportionately marketed to skin of color as well for example there was a paper published back in 2005 which the authors went to a variety of pharmacies in the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City and they found several Mercury containing skin bleaching skin lightening creams being sold this key whitening cream contains chloride of mercury Crema Santa Mercury oxide one percent and dermaline cream ammoniated mercury three percent in addition to harmful amounts of mercury these products oftentimes will contain a strong steroid cream which I want to make it clear steroid creams when used under the supervision of a treating Healthcare provider a dermatologist for example more than safe but not safe to just be buying and using without supervision because they do have some serious side effects and a lot of these skin bleaching creams not only have mercury but they also have steroids but long-term uninterrupted use of steroids such as betamethasone which is what was found in some of these skin bleaching creams can have some pretty serious side effects for the skin thinning of the skin stretch marks persistent redness acne breakouts discoloration and if used in areas where you have skin on skin contacts such as under the arms you can get a lot of absorption in the body and it actually can have some systemic negative effects such as on your endocrinologic system it can impact your adrenal function yeah it anything to to mess around with why exactly are they adding Mercury to these products anyway Mercury salts can inhibit melanin production pigment production unfortunately it particularly effective and its side effect profile is pretty negative not warranting it discoloration working is pretty dangerous to be putting on your skin Mercury salts can be absorbed through the skin and end up getting passed through your kidneys and excreted in your urine in a study of 119 women from California New Mexico Arizona and Texas who are using mercury containing skin lightening creams over 87 percent of them had elevated mercury levels in their body a lot of serious harm can happen from applying these Mercury containing products to the skin it can be absorbed into the skin quite readily and it passes through the kidneys and is excreted in the urine applying it to the skin can lead to some pretty significant discoloration that can be quite disfiguring it can also seriously damage your kidneys resulting in protein loss through the urine and a lot of damage to the kidneys and it can end up having some pretty serious neurologic side effects it can lead to Tremor muscle weakness you can end up with neuropathy in the fingers and hands excessive salivation have you guys ever seen Alice in Wonderland ever heard of the expression mad as a Hatter that comes from mercury poisoning erythritis autism you can develop a Tremor muscle weakness drooling excessive profuse sweating some depression mood changes extreme shyness irritability and slurred speech it called Mad Hatter 1865 Britain hat makers were working and really poorly ventilated rooms with heated Solutions of mercuric nitrate to make felted hats and they were getting a lot of systemic exposure in developing some of these Neuropsychiatric effects of mood changes extreme shyness slurred speech excessive drooling not knowing that they were actually being poisoned by the things that they were using to make the hats these Mercury containing creams can be pretty serious for young children they can develop something called Pink called Pink extremities the hands and feet the skin turns pink and becomes very painful initially they didn happening so they called it Pink disease because the children turn pink but later on they figured out it was mercury poisoning in addition to the pain discoloration profound sweating excessive sweating that has an odd mousy odor is characteristic of acronym these young children can develop a rash as well as serious problems with their gums and loss of their teeth not only is the mercury in these creams harmful to the people using it but it the people around them Mercury can be again absorbed through the skin and it can end up crossing the placenta in a pregnant woman and be seriously toxic to the developing baby Mercury is also excreted in the breast milk so harmful to breastfed babies it can cause negative effects to people who are just around the cream maybe inhaling some of the vapors people using creams with Mercury can end up contaminating their washcloths and towels and then somebody else might end up using that washcloth and towel even if it end up getting mercury poisoning the FDA does not permit mercury in drugs or Cosmetics except under very specific conditions specifically the FDA says that a cosmetic must contain no more than a trace amount of mercury and such Trace amounts of mercury must be unavoidable under conditions of good manufacturing practices and they have to be less than one part per million the other exception is for a cosmetic intended to be used around the eye area where it must contain no more than 65 parts per million or 0.0065 percent mercury in these cases Mercury is going to be used as a preservative and only used if there is no safe or effective non-mercury substitute preservative available despite legislation skin lightening creams are still being sold online through a variety of sites Alibaba eBay Amazon shopping GG and flip card of the 271 online products containing Mercury from 17 different countries over half of them had more than one part per million of mercury which is beyond the threshold of what is allowable in cosmetics and that threshold is not just here in the US it well based on the packaging the majority were manufactured in Asia with 43 coming from Pakistan eight percent from Thailand six percent from China and four percent from Taiwan prior Publications showed Mercury concentrations in these products ranging anywhere from 93 parts per million to 16 000 parts per million that is a lot very harmful to a certain extent Mercury can be stored in the body as well so cumulative exposure over time can result in more of a slow onset building to these really toxic side effects that we talked about recently in December Airy Beauty care night cream from Malaysia was found to contain mercury and then in January of this year uh I apologize I pronunciation pink Kiss Beauty Care muda ramaja saponjang uzia Herbal cream not only did that product have mercury but also had hydroquinone and tretinoin now to be clear both hydroquinone and tretinoin are more than safe but it is illegal for them to be present in a cosmetic this isn theoretical risk there are actual true cases of people who develop mercury poisoning from these products they are harmful to human health how do you know if your product has mercury in it to be clear Mercury and skin care products above the thresholds that I mentioned is illegal so the products that you buy should not contain mercury however there is a Black Market out there of mercury containing products so right now the FDA is keeping a running list of products that they have found and identified to have mercury or hydroquinone and this one brand again I pronunciation hiati glutathione cream white and bright 15 900 parts per million of mercury the other way to know is read the ingredient list reputable products they should have an ingredient list that if your product doesn ingredient list probably not reputable check your labels look for these words mercurus chloride calamel mercuric Mercurio or Mercury if you see any of these words stop using the product these types of products are usually marketed as skin lightening or bleaching creams but they also may be marketed as anti-aging creams products you know touting benefit for improving freckles or age spots a lot of them may be used by adolescents even for acne or to fade post acne marks and it has to be said that this is an issue that disproportionately affects communities skin of color these Mercury containing products are sold in shops and from online retailers that heavily Market to Latino Asian African and Middle Eastern communities disproportionately is going to impact communities skin of color these creams may be promoted online through different social media sites this is the kind of thing you might get a Facebook ad for or you might see on Alibaba or even eBay I these sellers and Distributors who Market these Mercury containing skin bleaching skin lightening creams in the U.S can be subject to law enforcement they can have injunctions have the products seized criminal prosecution so again I want to emphasize these are illegal this is not good manufacturing to contain these take home points of this video despite being illegal skin lightening and skin bleaching creams containing high amounts of mercury are still being sold and marketed especially to communities with skin of color the mercury in these products can lead to Serious harm serious damage to health these adverse consequences can affect not only the user of the cream but anyone who comes in contact maybe with the vapors from the cream or a towel washcloth that has mercury contamination on it or it can also be passed to the unborn baby through the placenta or through breast milk to a breastfed baby this is a worldwide issue but it serious there is some allowable Trace Amounts of mercury in circumstances where it is unavoidable should be no more than one part per million or in the case of products used around the eye 65 parts per million for preservatives and again only when there preservative alternative that be safe or effective check your labels if it says Mercury or any of the other names that I mentioned earlier red flags the terms mercurus chloride calomel mercuric Mercurio or Mercury or a product that doesn list that the FDA has a listing of the names and concentrations of mercury found in these products on their website which I will link Down Below in the description box all right I up here that all about Mercury and cosmetics again illegal not something that you should encounter you know now with the internet it is a lot easier for these types of products to slip through the cracks of legislation and what is legally allowed and so I warning if anybody has been tempted by any type of skin bleaching or skin lightening product it is a huge issue especially in a lot of countries throughout Asia for example this is a really big problem these skin bleaching creams with Mercury can cause a lot of negative effects to people it serious issue I hope this video was informed to you all if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow bye [Music]	Success
5 Warning Signs Of Vitamin B6 Deficiency NOT TO MISS	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjXi-B28zMM	Dr Day	warning signs of vitamin B6 deficiency you do not want to miss vitamin B6 otherwise known as Pur doxine is a water soluble B vitamin that is essential for the function of hundreds of enzymes throughout our body it building neurotransmitters and for building hemoglobin which is what transports oxygen around to different tissues in our body vitamin B6 is also very important for the metabolism of amino acids such as tryptophan now we able to get vitamin B6 from our diet foods rich in vitamin B6 include non- citrus fruits vegetables legumes soybeans fortified grains poultry and fish vitamin B6 is absorbed from Foods in our diet in the small intestine and it active form because vitamin B6 is water soluble it gets excreted by our kidneys into our urine now we don vitamin B6 so we need to be taking it in regularly from our diet provided you are eating a VAR diet you are likely not vitamin B6 deficient the skin is a window to what is going on internally and today we are going to learn about the dermatologic findings that are warning signs of B6 deficiency remember I with the skin we the hair the nails and the mucous membranes for the most part in otherwise healthy people living in the developed World eating not even the most balanced diet frankly at least getting food in regularly are unlikely to be deficient in vitamin B6 but there are several circumstances es that do put an individual at risk for B6 deficiency what are those circumstances well if you live in a resource poor area of the world you have inadequate intake or you follow some sort of fad diet that eliminates many food sources rich in B6 that would certainly be a risk factor individuals who have endstage kidney disease requiring dialysis often have B6 deficiency to some extent now I have many videos on my Channel about the skin findings associated with a variety of nutritional deficiencies and if you watched enough of those videos you know at this point that a group of people who are at risk for all sorts of nutritional deficiencies including B6 are those who struggle with alcohol dependence alcohol use disorder you can also have issues with vitamin B6 levels if you have problems with absorption such as what is seen in Crohn colitis if you have undergone bariatric surgery you also at risk due to malabsorption individuals with obesity may also have problems with adequate B6 levels pregnant women are at risk for B6 deficiency because the needs for B6 go up in pregnancy as it is essential for baby who have preclampsia or eclampsia are also at risk for B6 deficiency certain autoimmune diseases put an individual at risk for B6 deficiency namely rheumatoid arthritis it with rheumatoid arthritis they have an increased demand for B6 they have a higher daily need need of B6 there are also several medications that can interfere with proper B6 absorption B6 levels and so if you are on any of these medications then it address that with your doctor for example if you have tuberculosis and you called ionized you likely need to supplement with vitamin B6 because this medication can interfere with its absorption also a medication called penicillamine and then levadopa which is used to treat Parkinson also put you at risk or B6 deficiency patients who have seizure disorders and are treated with medications for their seizures these medications include phenin carbamazapine and valproic acid and then last but not least the medication hydrazine can also put you at risk for lower B6 levels but what is a skin warning sign that your B6 levels are not teed up the most common skin finding with B6 deficiency is actually a very fluid CC dermatitis now listen a lot of you guys have SE IC dermatitis Don balanced diet you don risk factors it you have B6 deficiency because CC dermatitis generally speaking is one of the most common skin disorders but you can really have a revved up case of it in the setting a B6 deficiency now searc dermatitis if you what we call a papulosquamous eruption meaning you of skin they of have this greasy like appearance it is found in areas where you have hair follicles that requirement but it commonly affects the scalp the eyebrows the forehead the sides of the nose but it also can affect the neck the back the chest and in the skin folds in addition to having these red kind of greasy patches with this flaky scale it can be itchy it can be uncomfortable if you have a deeper skin tone this rash often takes away the color of your skin and it might lead you to think you have Vitiligo it kind of mimics Vitiligo it called post-inflammatory hypopigmentation basically the inflammation from CC dermatitis puts the brakes on normal pigment production and so people with a deeper skin tone will develop these little white patches like for example on the forehead the sides of the face the chest the back and a lot of times they developing Vitiligo um it and it and the good news is once the sebic dermatitis is treated controlled and in this case if it deficiency once that is addressed and everything can heal well the color will return so it color CC dermatitis is related to an inflammatory response against that little yeast that lives on everyone skin called malesia and the reason it thought to flare up so much with B6 deficiency is basically related to b6s role in the supportive framework of our skin and so it weakens well then you get this inflammatory influx that aggravates CC dermatitis now listen dermatologists we look inside the mouth we look at the mucous membranes and if you look inside someone will tell you a lot first of all is glossitis which is the medical term for an inflamed tongue you get this red swollen beefy looking tongue that is smooth and shiny it your little taste buds kind of flatten out and the surface of the tongue looks very smooth the tongue will be burning very uncomfortable if you look inside the mouth further you can see that the mucus membranes in the mouth are red they tender and patients with B6 deficiency will often have sores inside their mouth that is another Finding with B6 deficiency it these from canker sores which I have a video all about as a side note so if you deal with those pesky little canker swords make sure you watch that one but they certainly can be flared up in B6 deficiency speaking of your mouth the other Telltale sign of B6 deficiency although not specific for B6 deficiency is something called angular kitis which I have videos about as a side not but as a reminder angular kitis fancy name for these little red sore spots on the corners of your mouth and what happens is first of all you get a breakdown of the Skin Barrier there that is the primary initiating event with angular kitis and then the yeast the candada yeast that normally live in your mouth everyone has candada yeast in our mouths the normal candada yeast they they make their way to that broken down barrier in the corners of your mouth and they create a little home there where they not supposed to be and you get these kind of white creamy patches inflammation related to that yeast this is candada yeast different yeast from searc dermatitis um and it painful it needs to be treated with um an antifungal cream like um my conazol for example but importantly if it is related to B6 deficiency that obviously needs to be addressed because as I said at the beginning of the video B6 is so important for all these different functions in our body that we really need to um repete that if it is if it is you know truly a deficiency so keep that in mind though that angular chitis is not specific to B6 deficiency it could be related to um wearing dentures that don collection of saliva there that weakens the barri or you drool um so there are other situations in which you can develop angular kitis and it has nothing to do with your nutritional status next up is a skin finding it Trigo basically you get breakdown of the skin in the skin folds you become red inflamed and just like the corners of your mouth that candid yeast can actually get too comfortable in these areas of eroded broken down skin and then you get a secondary candidal inter Trigo on top of the eroded inflamed dermatitis in the skin folds under the arms under the breast in the abdominal folds the groin area between the butocks now the warning signs of vitamin B6 deficiency they sort of wax and wne they start out early on very non-specific outside of these skin findings you may have poor coordination some problems with sensation like an inability to feel temperature or vibration you may also have um nausea but over time you know symptoms become more overriding more prevalent when it comes to your skin this warning sign Heralds deadly deadly events so as I said at the beginning of the video B6 is really important for the metabolism of amino acids well remember I said tryptophan specifically the reason that problem with tryptophan metabolism as it relates to inadequate B6 well that actually can lead you down a path of another B vitamin deficiency niin and once you develop iasin deficiency well you develop something called paga paga is a name for a constellation of signs and symptoms associated with uh nasin deficiency and they which include dementia diarrhea and dermatitis so the dermatitis of paga is photodistributed meaning it appears where the sun shines you photosensitive and it is a very painful red flaky scaly Uzi rash in addition to the rash the dementia the diarrhea if the pagar goes unaddressed the fourth D is death it is deadly so that is something that if the B6 deficiency goes and goes and goes and goes and goes and is not addressed then you can run into the territory of uh paga and that is that that could be quite deadly all right so those are the warning signs you see a doctor you see a healthcare provider how the heck are they going to know um that you have B6 deficiency is this enough no like I said a lot of these skin findings are not specific to vitamin B6 deficiency they examine you and ask you some other things to figure out if you have other findings associated with B6 deficiency such as poor memory poor coordination an anemia remember B6 is important for hemoglobin formation when you don good hemoglobin while that leads to anemia poor oxygen carrying capacity what labs are they going to check are they just going to check your B6 levels no they check instead plasma PLP plasma PLP is what you want to measure to find out if you gives you a picture of the liver concentration um and so um it much more accurate measure unfortunately it that has to be sent out and it takes time to get back so there are some other labs that can be checked that will give a picture of of if this is B6 deficiency they can actually check your urine remember B6 is metabolized IED and um excreted by your kidneys into your urine and so there detected in the urine that can provide some Clues to B6 deficiency called xanthurenic acid lastly they can actually check your red blood cells have an enzyme that relies on B6 called arthy transaminase they can check the activity of that to see if you have evidence of low B6 so those are some of the labs that are indicative of a B6 deficiency and when coupled with these other signs and symptoms well that supports a diagnosis of B6 deficiency but again most patients do not have an isolated B6 deficiency they are often deficient in other key vitamins minerals nutrients so there may be some other warning signs and some other deficiencies going on like hyperpigmentation from B12 deficiency so now that you this point maybe what you well is it a good idea to take a B6 supplement if you are eating a even not the most balanced diet if you are eating food chances are you have adequate B6 and you don about this okay um if you are pregnant contemplating pregnancy talk to your obstetrician about the need for B6 vitamin supplementation and part of your prenatal vitamin ask them about that okay um because again in pregnancy you have a higher need if you have any of these other health problems that I mentioned like Crohn alterative colitis or you of the medications that I brought up make sure you with your doctor about your B6 levels as well as other micronutrients that might be affected in these states but if you have any of these health problems and you supplement I would caution by and large vitamin B6 supplements are safe however if you take high doses of vitamin B6 usually over months to years it can be quite toxic to your nervous system and you can develop neuropathy and problems with motor coordination you can also develop movement disorders and unfortunately even once you back off of the supplements and stop taking them these problems once they start they irreversible it can be deadly I mean you can end up very debilitated with a neuropathy which is damaged to to the nerves as a result of high dose vitamin B6 I check their multivitamins and those energy drinks that seem to love to pump B vitamins in into them um to see like oh my gosh am I taking b6 well listen if it cause toxicity but if you supplements how much is too much exactly 100 Mig or less a day is considered safe where it becomes concerning for vitamin B6 toxicity is anywhere greater than 250 mg per day so that is really where you can run into serious harm to the nerves throughout your body all right guys so this those are the warning signs of B6 deficiency not to miss I hope you guys enjoyed this one on the ins slate I going to put my last warning signs of video as a side note I have a whole playlist on warning signs of underlying health problems not to miss so you definitely going to want to check out some of those videos especially if you have any interest in how our nutrition affects our skin you will have your eyes opened all right guys if you like this one give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don ons screen and subscribe I you guys tomorrow bye [Music]	Success
Carnivore Diet Did This To His Skin	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfMLhVxWzGA	Dr Day	so the carnivore diet caused cholesterol to ooze out of his skin I came across this case report in the Journal of the American Medical Association this morning and I wanted to talk about it because I think it is an interesting illustration of when diet fads can go arve so this is a case of a man who was in his 40s and decided to try the popular carnivore diet that you see a lot of people on social media hyping up hello he about 8 months claiming to feel great improved mental Clarity better energy and he had lost weight he was consuming sticks of butter lots of fat he was eating about 6 to 9 lbs of cheese a day he was adding butter fat and fats to his hamburger over the past 3 weeks he started developing these bumps on the palms of his hands the SES of his feet and his elbows they weren they didn discomfort they weren who went to the doctor and the doctor said oh looky there xanthelasma a type of xanthoma check blood work and his cholesterol was over 1,000 mg per deciliter what this was not normal for him he didn Baseline cholesterol for him was averaging around 210 to 300 mg per deciliter so really high cholesterol and what they seeing on his palms are a type of skin lesion known as a xanthoma it lesion that basically is the result of accumulation of fat in the uh cells of the immune system called macroasia macroasia are an important cell type they cells they just engulf stuff like pathogens and they get Laden with things and in the case of xanthomas that is often the case you have these lipid Laden stuffed macroasia that lead to the formation of bumps in the skin sometimes even beneath the skin although that variant is not as common xanthomas can develop when you have an abnormal blood lipid panel and that might be because of a primary abnormality or it may be secondary to some other health problem there are a few different types of xanthomas and again zanol Asma these flat bumps are the most common they usually present on the eyelids the upper eyelids then often the inner corner of the eye they asymptomatic thick yellow smooth bumps but you can also develop them elsewhere like on the palms of the hands between the fingers on the elbows the knees they brewing you have an abnormal lipid profile so there are primary health conditions that are characterized by abnormal blood lipids they disorders most most commonly going to be something called familial hyper cholesterolemia genetic makeup is such that you have problems with the blood lipids they get too high and you develop xanthomas but then blood lipids can become abnormal secondary to other medical conditions like obesity diabetes as a matter of fact if you watch my video on how having diabetes impacts your skin you xanthomas in that video they may also be an early War in sign of insulin resistance as well as a side note I have a video All About warning signs of insulin resistance this is one of them sometimes you can have liver disease that results in abnormalities with bile flow you might have a condition that is autoimmune that impacts the bile called Primary biliary curosis in these cases you can develop abnormal lipid profiles leading to xanthoma formation secondary to what patients who have thyroid disorders thyroid is so important for our metabolism that if it is abnormal you can have problems with your lipids some patients develop damage to part of their kidney that causes them to lose a ton of protein in the urine they have all sorts of metabolic abnormalities when this is happening it syndrome you get swelling in your legs due to edema and abnormal blood lipids you can have xanthomas as a result also certain medications can disrupt the lipid profile estrogens for example prednizone and oral retinoids which we use in dermatology to treat acne to treat psoriasis to treat certain skin cancers also can disrupt the lipids a side effect of isotron brand named agane is high triglyceride and usually that manageable it of danger but if you couple that bump with a diet that is really heavy on fatty foods it can push you over the edge and you can get xanthoma formation I have seen cases of that before somebody who really really loved fried food and was on a higher dose of iso Treno and developed xanthomas had to um come off of the of the um retinoid so it could be an underlying medical condition or it could just be that you have one of these rare conditions that leads to a problem with the lipids in this man case no doubt diet played a huge role it basically oozing out of his skin not quite that happening with xanthomas such as xanthelasma but one interesting thing I noted about this you notice the um bumps are happening in the lines of his palms the Palmer creases that they show us from this case report now he also had them on the elbows the soles of the Fe sometimes when it Palm it makes you wonder about a condition called familial dbaa lipoproteinemia one of those hereditary conditions and honestly for a patient presenting for the first time with xanthomas in the creases of the Palms you would worry about that because it is a very specific finding to that condition and it also is a very early warning sign sometimes the only warning sign and then you check the lipids and they are you know really high the triglycerides and the cholesterol now why is this something to report in the medical literature like so you get some bumps on your hand if you feel good you have great mental Clarity and you losing weight what you do well this is an alarming sign developing zanol Asma like this is a warning sign for heart disease es schic heart disease having a heart attack if something doesn on the path to to the Cal lab to have the blood vessels opened up in the heart so really really concerning adverse effect of this very Extreme Elimination Diet so the carnivore diet is you know really popular hello and you people claim that they it they have better mental Clarity better energy they feel great the weight loss that they experience has to do with caloric restriction when you cut out pretty much every food group except animal-based Foods except I mean that really limits what you can eat people may have other symptoms that they feel improve on this diet and perhaps it because they have gone on a radical Elimination Diet another thing that leads to weight loss is the fact that when you completely eliminate carbohydrate zero carbohydrate you are going to lose a lot of water weight because carbohydrates glycogen holds on to water so your total body water content drops and when you step on the scale surprise surprise you weigh less but it downside of this diet is it is an extreme elimin diet so you do put yourself at risk for various micronutrient deficiencies namely scurvy which as a side note check out my video on the skin signs of scurvy uh nothing illustrates how critical vitamin C is in our diet quite like scurvy um also poor gut health due to zero fiber to feed the gut microbiome and of course the catastrophe on the lipid panels and Advocates of this diet say oh you don need to worry about cholesterol it fine it cholesterol can be very lifethreatening now what will become of these bumps well if the individual is able to get their cholesterol under control to you know maybe shift to a more balanced diet lower the dietary intake of fats and cholesterol well these May resolve that can happen but sometimes they are pretty stubborn so what can be done to get rid of them if they don that the blood lipids are being managed well treatments like TR chloro acetic acid can help to flatten the mount and help them to clear up also um Electro uh surgery with the Hyer cator tool can basically singe them off those are some things that can be done to remove them but they are concerning now outside of xanthelasma another Finding of xanthomas another way in which they present is they erupt all over this is often seen in people whose triglycerides are high eruptive xanthomas are typically small yellow firm bumps same color actually as xanthelasma the flat bumps they yellow bumps that usually have a red Rim surrounding rim of of redness and they are wrapped usually on the buttocks and like the upper arms for example and these can resolve once the triglycerides come under control but a lot of patients who have these rare less common underlying familial disorders of abnormal lipids you know there of management that goes into to keeping those patients healthy I wonder if this guy will keep going with the carnivore diet or if he will listen to his doctors and change things up to get his cholesterol back to a healthier level and hopefully the xanthelasma maybe will resolve in his case all right guys I hope you enjoyed this video on the ins slate I All About The Dark Side of dietary supplements what they don know so definitely check that one out next if you missed it but if you guys like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don I [Music]	Success
Skin Signs And Symptoms Of Rheumatoid Arthritis NOT TO MISS	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nalryd1NUNA	Dr Day	when it comes to autoimmunity ladies we really get the short end of the stick autoimmune health conditions are more common in women why question for which there answer and we still don picture but like I say in all of these types of videos all right and I know I know you already know the skin the skin is a window to what is going on internally and today we talking about an autoimmune condition known as rheumatoid arthritis and you guessed it these skin warning signs that you could have this debilitating joint disease now rheumatoid arthritis what is it it is an autoimmune condition where the body produces certain factors that essentially attack the small joints in your hands also can attack other joints but in addition to being an arthritis a joint disease there are also non-joint symptoms and body systems that are equally affected including your skin as a matter of fact 30% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis will have some sort of skin finding skin issue like I said women really get the short end of the stick when it comes to autoimmune conditions they common in rheumatoid arthritis no exception three times as many women as men have rheumatoid arthritis typically has its onset around the age of 35 to 50 what causes rheumatoid arthritis well like most chronic diseases it is multifactorial meaning there are multiple factors playing a role of course genetics is a big thing there are even genes that researchers have identified and are actively studying that underscore part of what goes on with rheumatoid arthritis if you have a close family member who is related to you by Blood who has rheumatoid arthritis there is a greater chance that you will have it suggesting that genetic component there is also without a doubt and influence from our environment some sort of environmental Trigger combined with the way your immune system is laid out by virtue of your genetics comes together to attack your joints patients with rheumatoid arthritis they make something known as rheumatoid factor and they make antibodies CCP antibodies and patients with rheumatoid arthritis they deal with episodes of joint swelling redness and morning stiffness meaning when you wake up in the morning your hands usually are super stiff difficult to open up and work but as you go throughout the day and you warm up the joints that calms down the joints become swollen and there side of attachment of the ligaments in our joints to the underlying bone that known as an enthesitis so this is very painful very inflamed unfortunately with rheumatoid arthritis if it goes untreated if these episodes are not addressed well it will literally destroy the joint and it can be very debilitating thankfully in 2025 we have some really really really really fantastic medications to Target this abnormal immune response saving people joints and really drastically drastically changing the uh trajectory of how this disease affects people not to say it no longer uh causes problems for people but it than say 1970s if you had rheumatoid arthritis it was a whole other ball game but um you guys are here to ask about well what sort of skin fun findings might want encounter if you arthritis now to be clear skin findings are not usually an early warning sign they go along with having rheumatoid arthritis there will be other Clues the joint pain will likely come before the skin findings but if you have rheumatoid arthritis or you kind of joint problem maybe your doctors are trying to figure it out are there any things on your skin that could suggest yeah maybe it is rheumatoid arthritis well there are so many different skin conditions that patients with rheumatoid arthritis can have you can kind of think of them in different buckets or categories the first is just sort of nonspecific skin findings that we happen to see in patients who have rheumatoid arthritis first of all their skin is very dry second of all the skin is very fragile prone to tearing and easy bruising especially the backs of the hands there is Market skin fragility on the backs of the hands so if they bump up against something these patients will often get get very prominent bruises they tear easily and the skin itself appears very thin very translucent like you really can see the underlying veins in the hands quite prominently in many patients who have rheumatoid arthritis one very interesting common finding with rheumatoid arthritis is the Palms the hands are bright red check out my video on what it means to have bright red Palms there are actually other conditions AKA pregnancy where you can have red Palms okay so if you have red Palms don rheumatoid arthritis it could be any other number of conditions related to that um in addition to that a lot of patients with rheumatoid arthritis will have a condition known as renod phenomenon and what this is is an abnormal vascular response usually in the hands but also can affect the feet it can affect the tip of the nose and it can affect the nipples it happens upon cold exposure basically the blood vessels respond abnormally they constrict and like the fingers will turn very white they bright cherry red so they go from white to Blue to Red some people have Ray noes phenomenon and there reason for it it deal with and in order to prevent flare ups of it because it can be pretty uncomfortable you have to take measures to make sure that you don hands cold you know wear gloves if you live in a cold climate hand warmers with you but speaking of hands and likely related to the way the blood vessels respond in the fingers you can have many different nail findings with rheumatoid arthritis a common one is something known as oncolysis which essentially is what looks like a big white opaque blob on the nail but what it actually is is a lifting up of the nail plate from the underlying nail bed so you have an area of Detachment and that white blob is essentially air that you also can have very brittle nails nail briging the nails can split the fingertips can take on a clubbed appearance and you can have a nail finding known as a terium which is basically this abnormal fold of skin kind of encroaching in the nail moving away from these non-specific findings that are frequently seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis you also have a category of skin conditions that are rheumatoid arthritis specific like if you have these you have rheumatoid arthritis no one else is getting these and the most common is something called a rheumatoid nodule rheumatoid nodules are bumps lumps that appear over joints often times on the hands in areas of repeat friction trauma they they in about 35 to 40% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis in addition to the joints over the hands they also can form on the elbows the knees the ankles the heels they range in size and they can go up to several cenm in diameter while they open damage the overlying skin ulcerate and cause a greater risk of subsequent infection it distinguished from imitators of rheumatoid nodules recently I did a video on knuckle pads knuckle pads also are these smooth bumps that happen over finger joints usually despite the name they don knuckles but um they can look very similar to rheumatoid nodules so if you have a history of rheumatoid arthritis one would be suspicious for rheumatoid nodule but if you are say a boxer and your finger joints get repeatedly rubbed there probably not a rheumatoid nodule but when in doubt a biopsy can clarify the other very specific skin condition to rheumatoid arthritis is a type of vasculitis vasculitis is inflammation around blood vessels you can develop a rheumatoid vascular it to those factors in the immune system that are attacking the joints and the vasculitis of rheumatoid vasculitis it going to affect small and mediumsized blood vessels and it can affect these blood vessels in any organ but in the skin it bumps that um if you press on them the redness doesn perp and it blood that has leaked out into the skin it run your hand over the surface of the skin and you can feel it sort of within the skin okay there there substance there to touch when your dermatologist takes their dermatoscope and examines your nail fold very carefully they can actually see infarcts there which are essentially areas where the tissue has been starved of oxygen due to this problem with the blood vessels rheumatoid vasculitis can lead to devastating consequences for your fingers causing ulcers on the fingers and Frank necrosis tissue death because it oxygen the skin can develop ulcers and there vasculitis known as urticarial vasculitis where you guessed it ticaria that develop what looks like hives but in reality it vasculitis one of the most specific findings of rheumatoid vasc ulitis is a lesion known as the bywaters lesions these are small roughly a millimeter in size little red bumps again you press on them they don definition and these happen on the fingertips and around the nail folds and again bywaters lesions are specific for rheumatoid vasculitis and rheumatoid vasculitis is specific to rheumatoid arthritis like no one else is getting this other than people who have rhe rheid arthritis last but not least is something that is very specific to rheumatoid arthritis meaning people without rheumatoid arthritis do not get this however this condition is rare it called rheumatoid neutrophilic dermatitis this condition is seen in severe long-standing rheumatoid arthritis so it presenting sign of rheumatoid arthritis or a warning sign you already know you have rheumatoid arthritis it going on for a long time should you develop this skin complication what happens in this skin condition is that you get these episodes these eruptions of red rais bumps that can extend to involve larger areas often times distributed in a anular AKA ring like configuration usually on the arms and the legs the extremities this condition can blister it can ulcerate and of course that opens you up to the risk of secondary skin infections rheumatoid neutrophilic dermatitis parallels flare ups of the arthritis so if you of the arthritis in your hands for example it will often flare up the uh rheumatoid neutrophilic dermatitis this condition does resolve once the arthritis is treated so those are the specific skin conditions to rheumatoid arthritis we also talked about some non-specific skin findings that we see in patients who have rheumatoid arthritis then patients who have rheumatoid arthri Artis are also likely to often have other skin diseases there are certain skin diseases that patients with rheumatoid arthritis often get for example they often get something known as sweet syndrome where neutrophils infiltrate the skin in an unusual fashion people with rheumatoid arthritis are not the only ones who get this skin condition but it does seem to frequently happen to those with rheumatoid arthritis this is just one example of a skin condition that tends to affect people with rheumatoid arthritis but there are many others in addition to these conditions you also have to think about skin side effects from the medications that patients who are treated for rheumatoid arthritis might deal with so if you have rheumatoid arthritis and you problem yes it might be your rheumatoid arthritis or it might actually be the medication that you I wanted to talk about with regards to skin in findings of rheumatoid arthritis a debilitating condition if left untreated but as with anything in the skin if you problem show your doctor show your rheumatologist if you have a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and you follow with a rheumatologist they are very Savvy with regards to skin findings in their ra patients and they may already work closely in conjunction with a board certified dermatologist that they can refer you to in these cases of more extensive skin problems but let me know in the comments does this video surprise you a lot of people find it bewildering that the skin can do so many strange things in the setting of underlying health problems but again it is a window to what is going on internally if you guys enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don

10 Side Effects Of Obesity On The Skin	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQfb9Odb330	Dr Day	obesity is a serious issue in today video we the side effects of obesity on your skin obesity fundamentally Alters how the skin functions letting the ground work for a variety of skin concerns and skin problems Having excess adapost tissue disrupts your hormones leads to excess inflammation and impaired micro circulation of good blood flow the skin is impacted in several significant ways with obesity there water content in the outermost protect layer of your skin leading to compromised barrier Integrity water is necessary in this part of the skin for the enzymes that maintain the Skin Barrier to function properly as a result of compromised barrier Integrity you have an overall greater tendency towards dry skin losing water from the skin but also a greater risk for skin infections due to a compromised barrier that otherwise would be protecting you from the outside world excess atopos tissue disrupts hormone profiles commonly patients with obesity have elevations and hormones like androgens insulin insulin like growth factor and growth hormone these elevations in hormones signal to the sebaceous oil gland to make more oil this can lead to more stubborn acne as well as CA AKA oiliness patients with obesity have alterations in the integrity and the structure of collagen it seems as though deposition of collagen can expansion of the skin with obesity also patients with obesity have a hormone disruption known as leptin resistance leptin is a hormone that also plays a role in good strong healthy collagen production as a result the mechanical Integrity of the skin is not quite as robust and there and faultier wound healing excess body weight with obesity puts a lot of pressure on the valves in your vein this leads to problems with return of blood back to the heart and overall pooling of fluid in like the lower legs and the feet for example there lymphatic drainage with obesity especially namely in the lower legs and there is overall poor micro circulation also contributing to overall poor wound healing I have a lot of videos all about dry cracked heels dry feet how to deal with it there are a variety of reasons why this might be happening but obesity is a common reason to have pretty significant dry cracked heels not just the heels but patients with obesity tend to have a buildup of dry thickened skin on the heels the arch of the foot and the great toe these are areas of the foot that bear a lot of weight excess body weight actually can alter the anatomy of your feet can cause a variety of problems for the feet including thickening of the skin and dry skin on the bottoms of the feet this dry skin on the bottoms of the feet also is associated along with the other things we already talked about with an increased risk of infections of the feet such as foot fungus AKA athletes fo toenail fungus patients with obesity often can get a bacterial infection between their toes aasma caused by a bacteria known as corini bacteria this also can happen between the web spaces between the fingers of the hands as well patients with obesity have an increase in insulin this impacts the skin in a variety of ways one way is a thickening of the skin in specific Locas resulting in the development of these velvety dark brown grayish raised areas espe especially on the neck but also the cheeks under the arms the backs of the hands this condition is known as acanthosis nyrians and it warning sign of insulin resistance concerning for diabetes the increase in insulin coupled with excessive friction in skin folds also for whatever reason favors the formation of ACR cordons which is a fancy medical term for skin tags commonly happen in areas where you have skin on skin contact and a lot of friction like under the arms and the skin folds also the sides of the neck the overall tendency towards dry skin in patients with obesity due to compromise and barrier Integrity likely explains why we often see patients with obesity deal with a condition known as keratosis pyloris otherwise known as rough and bumpy skin or chicken skin basically that decline in water content in the outermost protective layer results in a slowing down of the turnover and shedding processes the natural exfoliation of dry skin so you get a buildup of dry skin in the hair follicle leading to these little rough bumps often on the upper arms the thighs also the face patients with obesity are inclined to form stretch marks due to the stretch on the skin coupled with problems in collagen integrity and the laying down of good strong healthy collagen and an overall reduction in gene expression for procollagen necessary to make strong healthy collagen patients with obesity also have an increase in receptors for cortisol which weakens collagen integrity the excess androgens associated with Having excess adapost tissue like I said signals to the oil gland to make more oil and is associated with more stubborn acne adapost tissue synthesizes testosterone an androgen that can lead to more acne and oiliness also patients who have obesity have a reduction in something called sex hormone binding globulin as a result they have an increase in overall free available testosterone to signal to the oil gland to make more oil not only that it uncommon for patients with obesity women with obesity I should say to struggle with heroism which is facial and Bonny hair growth in a male pattern speaking of hair growth never quite works out in our favor we have excess hair where we don do want it Having excess Androgen signaling can result in miniaturization of the hair follicles on your scalp and the development of androgenetic alopecia otherwise known as as pattern baldness this affects both men and women and of course the excess testosterone the excess androgens leading to more oil production can lead to CC dermatitis a inflammatory condition where you have these patches of eczema with this scaly flaky stuff coupled with an overgrowth of malesia a yeast that thrives in oily conditions patients with obesity have larger skin folds when you have skin folds you end up with skin- onsk skin contact which under go friction colle of sweat in these areas patients with obesity make more sweat at Baseline so the sweat the skin folds breaks down the Skin Barrier even further in these areas resulting in what is commonly referred to as an inter Trigo inter Trigo is a medical term for just a rash in the skin folds but inter Trigo can easily become colonized with microbes and you can get an infection commonly Canada yeast can cause an inter Trigo check out my video All About inter Trigo and candidal skin infections because I give a lot of tips and tricks on how to deal with this but this is one complication one side effect of obesity is inter Trigo and it can be very debilitating very uncomfortable I want to talk about what happens to your legs and the skin on your legs with obesity at Baseline a greater tendency towards dry skin but Having excess body weight puts a lot of pressure on your legs we already talked about how putting a lot of pressure on your feet leads to that dry thicken buildup on the bottoms of the feet but when we your legs it takes quite a toll over the long run especially first of all you get problems with the veins in the lower legs the little valves which are quite delicate can pressure over time they give out those little valves are what play a role in bringing blood back up to the heart properly that coupled with the contraction of your leg muscles so if you not happening so you get a pooling of fluid that extravasates out into the surrounding tissue that stasis this causes an eczema of the skin becomes very itchy uncomfortable and it breaks the skin down so you get the development of these ulcers also you have slowed and impaired lymphatic drainage from the lower legs as well so you have a condition known as lymphadema basically chronic leg swelling with overlying significant skin changes coup with the fact that you don efficiently especially on the lower legs which for everyone is a territory that challenging to heal wounds on but couble that with the background issues going on with obesity problems with circulation the problems with immune function the alterations in hormones and the disruption in collagen Integrity you have a situation where you have these ulcers they can become secondarily infected and patients who have obesity are at much greater risk for an infection that commonly happens on the legs known as cellulitis it is a deeper tissue infection that enters into the skin through like ulcers and cuts and then spreads outward requires antibiotics and once it happens it kind of further damages the surrounding tissue and causes even more impairment in lymphatic drainage now on top of all of these things you get inflammation of the fatty tissues in the skin it as a peniculus but it unique in the lower legs of patients with obesity who have been dealing with stasis in the veins Venus stasis lymp edema it lipodermatosclerosis this happens basically as a type of inflammation in the fat but it changes the skin on your legs initially you get these red itchy large areas on usually The Shins over time though that becomes sort of thickened bound down we refer to that as indurated tight it and again you might have the overlying ulcers you might have also the overlying eczema and over time that becomes very thickened very bound down and your legs take on the appearance of what is described as an inverted champagne bottle very debilitating very uncomfortable and requires a variety of therapeutic approaches Maneuvers to alleviate things like compression therapy a variety of interventions there are whole clinics dedicated to lower leg stasis dermatitis Etc so those are some of the more common chronic conditions that patients with obesity will likely eventually face if not already also there are a variety of skin conditions associated with obesity psoriasis a chronic inflammatory condition is notoriously associated with obesity also hydradenitis stiva even at topic dermatitis can be significantly worse in the background of obesity we refer to obesity as a disease because it fundamentally Alters the physiology of a person to have excess adapost tissue every organ system is is impacted that is why it is approached as a disease because there are all of these moving parts for managing complications and problems associated with it so weight management is lifesaving most patients with obesity will develop insulin resistance diabetes which also comes with many of the things we about in today whole host of other health complications obesity is increasingly common especially in young children weight management can be life saving I hope this video was informative to you guys now like I said a lot of patients who have obesity they also develop insulin resistance now on the Insight I to link my recent video all about the skin signs of insulin resistance not to miss you check that one out next if you missed it but if you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow bye [Music]	Success
Lipedema Causes And Treatments Explained	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sP_dijz37w	Dr Day	well hey guys today I want to talk about lipidemia what is lipidemia what causes it and what treatments are available lipidemia is a condition that primarily affects women it involves the disproportionate symmetrical abnormal accumulation of subcutaneous fat in the lower legs lipidemia sounds an awful lot like another condition lymphadema but make no mistake they thing in contrast to lipedema with lymphadema there accumulation of subcutaneous fat but rather there is impairment in lymphatic drainage resulting in accumulation of fluid and lower leg swelling lymphadema might be the result of obesity but it might also be the result of a surgery that damaged the lymphatic lymphadema can be unilateral affecting one side or bilateral whereas lipedema is bilateral both legs lipidemia is a chronic and Progressive condition as it progresses it can impair lymphatic drainage so you can have both lipedema and lymphadema lipedema primarily affects women it thought to be related to estrogen it has its onset in puberty and may get worse with pregnancy these are periods in a woman increase it like I going on with you that you don family there is often a positive family history of lipidemia in patients who have lipidemia because of the role of estrogen in this condition it primarily affects women though rarely it can affect men in certain situations that might lead to high estrogen levels in men such as curosis of the liver what is going on in lipid Dema what causes it well more research is needed to fully understand the underlying pathophysiology meaning disease development process that leads to lip Adema but as it stands now it appears to be related to an increase in size and number of fat cells as well as a problem with the blood vessels being too leaky and too fragile blood vessel fragility leads to leakage of fluid and protein into the surrounding tissues and the generation of inflammation when you look at someone with lip Adema what you going to notice is that they have symmetrically voluminous legs that are disproportionately enlarged in comparison to their trunk their torso may be slim but their lower legs appear large lipidemia leads to the appearance of column-shaped or lobular legs it spares the feet the toes which leads to the characteristic cuffing sign in contrast lymphadema does not spare the feet or the toes or the hands and you will get swelling of those tissues as well in lymphedema but like I said lip Adema as it progresses can impair lymphatic drainage so you may have some overlap speaking of progression how does this condition progress it progresses through three characteristic stages stage one the overlying skin appears smooth no abnormalities are detected and the underlying fatty tissue is homogeneous meaning all the same in the second stage however the overlying skin appears uneven and you can feel subcutaneous fatty nodules that for the patient are tender and uncomfortable and once the condition progresses to stage three their lobules of fat skin folds and some overlying thickening of the skin the tissue has a nodular structure lipedema at first glance can be easily confused with other conditions some other features of lipidemia aside from the abnormal accumulation of fat in the lower legs is that these nodules are very tender likely related to the fact that the blood vessels are leaky these patients bruise quite easily their overlying skin can be exquisitly sensitive to a light touch or pressure lip AA is aggravated by prolonged standing or sitting and it may be alleviated in terms of symptoms by lying down this likely has to do with return of fluid to the heart as we are lying down as our legs are more elevated that likely alleviates some of the symptoms one of the things for patients who struggle with lipidemia that can be very frustrating is that they to lose weight losing weight definitely can help because it just offloads some of the pressure on the lower legs in particular however as a patient loses weight whether it be diet and exercise weight loss surgery that actually doesn of the legs because that enlarged fatty tissue is not responsive to diet and exercise many patients with libema do have overweight or obesity in these cases weight management is a super important part of managing this chronic progressive condition in terms of improvement in mobility and reducing complications s however weight loss alone does not reverse lipidemia and as they lose weight their trunk will be thin their face will be thin but they still have volume in the legs the condition progresses the fat cells increase in both size and number abnormally leading to the accumulation of fat and this over time can impair Mobility significantly that coupled with the pain can make it quite difficult for patients to exercise and unfortunately might contribute to unwanted weight gain which further worsens their symptoms the proliferation of the fatty tissue as it progresses to stage three and you have obvious skin folds that can lead to skin friction rubbing breakdown of the skin and increase in skin infections inter Trigo is a common complication at this point inter Trigo is just a term we use to describe inflammation of the skin and the skin folds inner Trio can then lead to an increased risk of like candidal yeast infections a candidal inter Trigo check out my video on signs of skin yeast infection I talk more about it there and how to manage that complication lipidemia can progress to a point where it actually becomes more challenging for patients to even walk because they develop almost a knock needed stance that can impair their Mobility how do you know if you have lipedema well it health care provider because an accurate diagnosis is key there are many conditions that could easily be confused for lipedema lymphadema could be confused for lipedema also many patients might have overlap of both lipidemia and lymphadema there known as lipo hypertrophy patients with hypothyroidism can develop a condition known as mixa where you have these large plaques on the lower legs that could easily be confused for lipedema so an accurate diagnos is important you may have to undergo some Imaging tests to look at the underlying lymphatic tissue the blood vessels Etc early diagnosis is key because this is a chronic and Progressive condition and early intervention can make a difference longterm as far as the trajectory and overall impact on quality of life one of the most important things is maintaining an active lifestyle doing regular exercise is important for improving circulation and improve uh return of any fluid through the lymphatics back up to the heart now again this is not the same thing as lymphadema but you easily can develop lymphadema along with it and the condition does worsen with prolonged standing but exercise May improve it the other thing that is a must with lip Adema is compression wearing compression garments compression stockings up to the thigh is really important to help compress some of that and reduce the burden of pressure on the lower legs also super important for reducing the symptoms of sensitivity and pain that these patients experience of course you need to be very careful as the skin does bruise easily related to those leaky blood vessels this is a main stay of management in the early stages of lip idema later on however patients would benefit from either manual or mechanical lymphatic drainage complete physical decongestive therapy involving either manual or mechanical lymphatic drainage coupled with compression garments is the go-to for lipedema once it advanced stages then there intervention specifically lipos suction to remove some of that abnormally enlarged fatty compartment liposuction actually can really be a game Cher for lipidemia not only in reducing the volume essentially debulking but also in alleviating symptoms symptoms of pain discomfort it can really make a huge difference and those improvements can be sustained after the surgery all right guys so that is lipidemia it condition that a lot of women struggle with it misunderstood a lot of women for example who have this condition might be told by a passer by like you need to go on a diet you need to exercise more you need to lose weight and while those things are very important for this condition they don there specific directed therapies that may be indicated so I really hope this video was helpful and informative in clarifying what this condition is what the Outlook of it is like and provide you some understanding of what the potential treatment options are that are available now speaking of estrogen on the insulate I video on warning signs that your estrogen is too low so check that one out next if you missed it but if you guys like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don I

Signs Of Viral Infection Not To Miss | Skin Rashes	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VycJ_8ua5go	Dr Day	have you gotten sick yet this year that video I skin warning signs not to miss that you have a viral infection or that you have recently been sick with a viral infection it more likely to be getting sick with colds flu diarrhea because we spend more time indoors in close proximity to one another quick PSA wash your hands good hand hygiene is one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of colds and flues to keep you from getting sick or getting other people sick viruses are notorious for causing what are referred to as viral exanthem and exanthem is a fancy name for a rash that is typically widespread and often accompanied by just sort of symptoms of being unwell like fever headache malaise sore throat perhaps swollen lymph nodes now adults can get viral rashes however there are significantly more common in young children one thing about viral exanthems is they are in your face they really alarm people what the heck is going on I am breaking out all over oh my gosh it patient to have a viral rash but the good news is viral rashes are all bark no bite they typically go away on their own leaving no scarring behind and they don be itchy and you might have a bit of a headache feel unwell so those symptoms can be treated of course with topical moisturizers steroid creams that address the itch and if necessary a little bit of Tylenol for like the headache but you really don they will go away on their own however it health care provider because like any rash any skin problem there are dupes other things that look like the rash that are not that rash and so you need to make sure you know what you dealing with in no particular order probably one of the more common viral exanthems that again more common in children but young adults get this as well it Rosia literally translates to fine pink scale it often happens after a viral illness including maybe you had a virus pass through your body and you never actually really got sick but it did this the typical presentation starts out as a round oval pink spot usually on the back but can happen Elsewhere on the body the spot is anywhere from 2 to 10 cm in diameter a lot of times patients don even notice this because again sometimes it following roughly 10 days days you start getting an eruption of smaller spots that look very similar in a more widespread and symmetric distribution usually on the Torso the back the legs the arms classically the typical presentation however spares the face The Palms the hands the soles and the feet this rash usually lasts anywhere from 6 to 8 weeks it kind of evolves through stages and it often ends up getting real flaky and scaly sloughing off and then it goes away sometimes times if you look in the mouth you might have sores in your mouth what are called petii look like little blood blisters and you might even have a geographic tongue as a side note I have a whole video on geographic tongue that is quite enthralling so make sure you check that out after you watch this video of course so that unquote typical presentation however there are atypical variants it can present in other ways there is an inverse petasis Rosia in which the rash erupts in atypical locations the face the hands and the feet iasis Rosia and black patients is a lot more likely to take on these atypical presentations black patients are a lot more likely to have more widespread eruption of their rash and they are more likely to have their rash accompanied by lymph node swelling black children in particular are more likely to have Pinas Rosia of a particular atypical presentation where rather than these round rashes on the body they have these almost like little bumps small bumps often on the face the scalp and for whatever reason in black children the course the duration of the rash sometimes is a lot shorter 2 weeks generally speaking petasis Rosia lasts on average anywhere from 6 to 8 weeks and then it goes away sometimes however it lasts much longer 6 8 months even once it starts lasting that long it called petasis Rosia Pur Tans meaning it it does go away while it goes away and doesn Black pap patients it often leaves behind post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation dark spots or hypopigmentation light spots and this takes a long time to fade away but eventually your normal skin color will return it will go away now the rash of petasis Rosia while it is associated often times with having a viral illness the rash is not contagious so if you have the rash you it to anyone else and for the most part you people however do experience a recurrence if you have petasis Rosia I suggest sticking to very gentle skin care don scrubs on this rash cuz the skin is trying to recover especially if you have a deeper skin tone using scrubs harsh cleansers Etc on the skin can create a lot of irritation that makes that hyperpigmentation even more stubborn and take longer to fade just stick to mild cleansers and fragrance-free body creams lotions moist izers which can help if you are experiencing any itch associated with the rash pis Rosia can look like some other types of rashes including syphilis so don doctor while very confident that you have petasis Rosia goes ahead out of an abundance of caution and checks to make sure you don syphilis is not uncommon these days as a side note I have a whole scintillating video all about the warning signs of syphus not to miss so definitely check that out and also it can look look like ringworm so they may scrape some flakes off look at them under the microscope to make sure you don next viral rash I want to talk about is something called gonat crossy if you have young schoolage children this is something that you might want to know about doesn although I have seen a case or two of it in an adult more common in children 6 months of age to 12 years of age this can be seen after RSV respiratory sensial virus which we lot of cases of that lately not fun it also can be seen with Epstein bar Virus Infection saaki Echo virus and hepatitis B while this often happens as a viral rash to these viruses or other viruses it also can happen after a bacterial infection like a strep infection over the course of roughly 3 to 4 days your child will develop these little flat and raised spots usually pinkish in color and sometimes they like these little blisters associated with it those are called vesicles first on the thighs and buttocks then the upper arms and finally the face it lasts at least 10 days but usually anywhere in the ballpark of 2 to 8 weeks like pis Rosia it ever get this again although there exception to every rule of course in contrast to petasis Rosia which gets very scaly gonat crossy there typically no scale so no flaky stuff also in contrast to petasis Rosia with gonat crosy it almost never involves like your torso or your back sometimes it can exclusively involve the face these cases appear to almost always be associated with Epstein bar Virus Infection children who have atopic dermatitis are more likely to get gonat crosy compared to other children all right that doesn harmed by it there child has a deeper skin tone there may be some post-inflammatory pigmentary changes but eventually their skin goes back to their normal color and the rash of gon Frosty is not contagious number three is laterothoracic exanthem this is a rash that happens on one side of the body girls are more likely to get this than boys it can happen as a result of exposure to viruses that cause colds flu upper respiratory tract infections viral diarrhea this starts out under the armpit in the groin area as like these little red raised bumps Sometimes some flat spots mixed in there as well and it gradually extends outward down the side of the Torso it can extend into the groin it may spread to the face the genitalia and the hands but it stays on one side of the body with time the little tiny bombs that kind of come together into these larger areas the older spots sort of turn gray in the center and it kind of looks like this more inflamed dermatitis before going away a lot of times a child might have a little bit of a fever swollen lymph nodes and they might have diarrhea if it stomach flu again not dangerous not contagious and once it goes away it gone and for the most part they don get again but as you can imagine this scares parents they what you take your child into the urgent care of the ER a lot of times they know what petasis Rosia sometimes you know the atypical presentations can really fool non dermatologists I mean it something at least that I was taught in medical school I didn until my Dermatology residency speaking of going to the ER urgent care I want to talk about another situation let me know in the comments are you allergic to penicillin because you were told you allergic to penicillin based on an experience you had as a child that you don want to hear what I have to say so it is not uncommon for people to experience a viral illness related to Epstein bar often consists of having fever being incredibly fatigued having swollen lymph nodes once you virus it incubates in your body for about 4 to 6 weeks then you experience what 2 weeks in which you just don feel particularly well a lot of people you know they don um they have a really bad sore throat maybe they go to the Urgent Care and maybe it viral infection or a bacterial infection a bacterial sore throat strep throat so what happens is they penicillin like ampicillin and a lot of times what will happen is that ampicillin in the background of a viral infection because remember penicillin is an antibiotic it bacterial infections the Urgent Care thinks that perhaps you have a bacterial infection so they give it to you but you really have a viral infection what happens is your immune system body whatever is like Epstein bar virus plus penicillin let get diagnosed as being allergic to penicillin it allergy though and I that because if you told as a child that you had an allergic reaction to penicillin but you don remember it you don details of it it what actually happened and that you don penicillin how will you ever know isn it dangerous if you penicillin to take it it scary thing to tease out allergists can help you figure out if you truly are allergic to penicillin or if you had this reaction based on having Epstein bar virus which isn allergy it rerouting of the immune system as a way to to describe it that causes this rash the rash is typically widespread and brownish In Color rais Spot and it goes away so in summary these rashes they all go away without any treatment they sign that most likely a virus has passed through your body viruses do weird things and uh if you were ever told that you had a rash after getting penicillin as a child could have been Epstein bar virus that you actually had not a true penicillin allergy all right guys so that of a viral infection now let one thing straight here by no means means is this a comprehensive video of all viral rashes rashes related to a viral infection I should say you know we we have herpes virus infections we got herpes cold sores I already have videos on a lot of these things but today non-specific viral rashes that can pop up if you get like a cold a flu a stomach flu as is common this time of time of year I really hope this video was helpful to you guys I hope you are staying healthy not getting sick and that this is just pure entertainment for you knowledge is power I hope if you have young children at home that they not sick hopefully this saves you a bit of stress in the future all right guys if you enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up

Signs Of A Yeast Infection Not To Miss	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ese3OjYzUL8	Dr Day	well hey guys in today talk to you about yeast infections when people hear yeast infection what comes to mind is vaginal yeast infections however there are a variety of different yeast infections on different body surfaces and in today to cover what those are I over the signs and symptoms and I going to be touching on the different treatment approaches when we say yeast infection what we candada Canada yeast while it causes yeast infections it normal microflora we are colonized with candid yeast at the time of birth throughout our digestive tract it perfectly normal for it to be present on your skin on mucous membranes in your mouth it your genital urinary tract there are checks and balance systems in place to make sure that you have just the right amount of it and when those things go Ary for reasons I video you get an overgrowth of candid yeast causes different types of problems you get skin and mucosal membrane infections having a healthy immune system is key for keeping the balance of candid yeast in place so people who are at risk for yeast infections are those at extremes of age very young babies whose immune system is not quite developed and the elderly whose immune system is starting to decline in function anyone who has an underlying imuno deficiency also certain medications that um alter your immune system or lower it put you at greater risk having diabetes being on antibiotics for a prolonged period of time pregnancy is a big one that can put you at risk for developing yeast infections many women suffer with yeast infections during pregnancy for someone who is experiencing malnutrition they at greater risk because nutrition is key for the health of your immune system one of the most common nutrient deficiencies worldwide is iron deficiency I have a video on signs of iron deficiency but an issue you can run into with iron deficiency is a greater risk for recurrent yeast infections and having a primary skin disorder such as psoriasis like imp plainis or an irritant contact dermatitis also increases your risk of developing a candid yeast infection let normally are in our mouth they of our normal muc postal microflora and so when they have an opportunity to overgrow No Surprise can lead to problems in and around the mouth probably have heard of thrush young babies can develop this again because your immune systems are still developing also though people who are at risk for for thrush are people who smoke that is because smoking messes up your immune system and puts you at greater risk for infections again people who take antibiotics increase risk of thresh people who wear dentures why well poorly fitting dentures specifically cause a lot of sometimes friction in the mouth collection of saliva that creates a moist environment that favors candid yeast also patients who have to inhale steroids boy mouth can get yeast infections in the mouth you have these white creamy almost membranous patches and you have these red areas that are sore can be along the gums on the tongue the roof of the mouth anywhere in the mouth really then there a lot of smokers get and some people are predisposed to get just because of the anatomy in their tongue and that something called median rhomboid glossitis there red inflammation on the back of the tongue and often times although not always if you look at the roof of the mouth right above that little diamond you that kind of white creamy exate or just red and inflame it lesion because it little diamond is resting up against the roof of your mouth like and repeatedly in contact can transfer some of that candid yeast to the roof of your mouth then you also have angular kitis basically a yeast infection at the corners of the mouth you often see this in individuals who wear dentures who smoke um people who drool a lot and basically what happens is saliva collects in the corners of the mouth saliva is an irtin it breaks down the Skin Barrier the Skin Barrier becomes impaired the yeast that naturally live in our mouth can take over in the corners of the mouth you get this painful cracking to treat a yeast infection in the mouth requires of course addressing the underlying risk factors making sure that you um have dentures that fit properly maybe uh try sleeping on your back if you who drools a lot in your sleep quit smoking all of these things are super important but then to treat the yeast infection it nistatin or miconazol usually or clotrimazol and in some cases you may have to take an oral antifungal medication called fluconazol another whole category of yeast infections is a candidal in Trigo so in Trigo is an umbrella term that refers to skin rashes in the skin folds under the breast under the arms in the abdominal folds it can be any number of skin conditions there are many different types of inter Trio candidal inter Trigo is just one and the reason why candidal inter Trio is uh you know a presentation is just the whole nature of skin when it is um folded skin on skin contact leads to trapping of sweat moisture friction mation of the outermost layer of the skin which breaks down the Skin Barrier and leads to a scenario where you can get overgrowth of the yeast there and patients will develop these um kind of reddish patches with an overlying kind of creamy white exate and then at the edge of the rash you that are easily deflated so that clue of a candidal inter Trigo can be really really painful very uncomfortable often times patients have inter Trigo of some other variety um and it controlled and because of all the inflammation from their other type of in Trigo well then they get a secondary infection on top of that they have a candidal in Trigo so they need treatment for that as well again risk factors diabetes poor health is um also something that patients who have obesity often deal with or patients who lost a lot of weight and have a lot of loose skin redundancy there can cause you know friction moisture trapping Etc the name of the game here is keeping the area dry using things like uh lifting up the folds and Fanning them out with just a fan to keep them dry you can even use a blow dryer on a low setting also they sell uh powders that are absorbent can absorb some of the moisture using barrier creams to lubricate the skin surface and reduce fr can also help in preventing recurrences D bur very soothing and help dry up the skin you just reconstitute the D buros in tap water and then you soak like a washcloth in it apply it to the affected areas um and then uh let the area fully dry can really help soothe and uh calm down the inflammation in the skin there and help with healing the inter Trigo but you have skin folds between your fingers interweb spaces there is a type of yeast infection that you can get either between the fingers or between the toes it mytica basically you get breakdown of the Skin Barrier in the web space it red cracked and has that overlying white creamy pseudomembranous exate very very painful and while of course the uh General risk factors for yeast infections you know are are often seen not always a lot of people get this who do wet work meaning their hands are always being exposed to water maybe they wash dishes by hand for example and they get trapping of moisture plus detergents um between the fingers for example and it breaks down the skin there um also people who wear Rings uh create a lot of friction and then when they wash their hands the soapy water traps gets trapped up under the ring and dries there and then is being rubbed into the skin and then you know the web spaces can kind of break down and then become colonized with candida yeast it can be very painful very uncomfortable candidal enter Trigo in addition to modifying risk factors and keeping the area dry lubricated also can be of course treated uh with an antifungal like clotrimazol miconazol or nistatin moving on to what probably comes to most people going to be a vaginal yeast infection very UNC comfortable to deal with um often uh will involve overgrowth of candid yeast in the vagina as well as uh in the vulva there white curd-like discharge coming from the vagina extending onto the Volva it can be very itchy very painful a burning sensation it also can extend to the nearby skin folds it can be triggered and aggravated by sexual intercourse pregnancy is a time where women become more at risk for getting this but honestly any woman can get it at any time for the most part it straightforward to diagnose and treat with a um anti- fungal again um you see a theme here uh intravaginal pesy trimol miconazol again however some people do deal with what cyclic Volvo vaginitis basically recurrent flares of inflammation of the vulva and the vagina with yeast infections that come and go with the menstrual cycle can be very uncomfortable and a lot of this is not only um related to yeast but also is kind of aggravated and brought out by contact with irritant so for example um women who might be using soap down there which we don um and uh detergents douches feminine hygiene products those things uh are irritating to begin with but they easily get trapped in the skin FS there forther breaking down the barrier and can cause a lot of irritation and irritant contact dermatitis and patients often cope with recurrent bouts of this it becomes very painful it can really become a fullblown chronic disorder that is not so straightforward to correct uh because there are often a lot of other things going on is it you know it contact dermatitis plus the overlying yeast um and so it often requires care under a dermatologist to address the different aspects as well as a gynecologist like I said what comes to mind when we hear yeast infections is almost always like a vaginal yeast infection but men can develop genital yeast infections as well specifically one called balanitis which is just a medical term for inflammation of the glands of the penis and it to develop a candidal balanitis um namely in men who are not circumcised and also very common common in men who are not circumcised and have diabetes because again you have trapping of moisture uh maybe the individual is washing with soaps and things and again that detergent residue gets trapped up under the foreskin causes an irritant contact dermatitis erosion of the barrier and very favorable environment for yeast it becomes very painful you get cracking it again consistent with the theme and treating this is going to be again topical antifungals clol miconazol uh Nystatin as well as counseling the individual on um how to change up their hygiene practices you know you you should only be washing um with just warm water no soap and make sure uh to after you retract the for skin to leave it and allow the area to fully dry before replacing it I bet you didn you can have a yeast infection around your nails and on your nails absolutely a candidal perania so perania is just a medical term for infection around the nails and it can be acute and an acute perania meaning oh my gosh this is very painful uh came out of nowhere is usually due to bacteria chronic perania can be due to candid yeast however and it usually starts out in a nail fold um the folds around your nails you know they place where stuff can get trapped moisture and it starts there especially in people who maybe do really aggressive manicures and are pushing back their cuticle as well as always doing things that expose their fingers to cold wet conditions this can cause a lot of irritation around the skin folds and open up that skin allow for the yeast to overgrow in those areas um and it can be very uncomfortable people who um develop this you know it can extend to The Nail plate so what you end up seeing the nail folds will be tender and swollen you actually get lost of the cuticle and the um nail fold will kind of be lifted up and then you can get discoloration of the nail plate it could be yellow or green in appearance and you can get a lot of transverse ridges all related to Canada yeast and also you know when you press on the nail a little bit of puss may come out the key here is to keep the Hands Clean dry warm you know people who tend to get this in addition to maybe having some other risk factors like diabetes smoking are people who are frequently exposing their fingers to cold wet conditions like someone who is a fisherman um or doing farm work uh maybe their fingertips don and they get a lot of mation coupled with maybe aggressive manicure practices or biting the Nails biting the skin around the nails you know you start getting hang nails and maybe you chew on them absentmindedly uh again candada is naturally present in your mouth so of course it becomes a situation where you can easily transfer that to the nails and get a candidal nail infection it can be very painful and very uncomfortable all right y yeast infections I hope this video was informative to you and educational shed light on the fact that there are actually several different types of yeast infections at different body sites now I have a video on another type of yeast called malesia which also can get too comfortable on our skin on the ins slate I signs of too much malesia yeast so check that one out next if you missed it but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe I bye [Music] he [Music]	Success
HOW TO DO A SKIN CHECK AND WHAT TO LOOK FOR ?? DERMATOLOGIST @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2yE86kWCPY	Dr Day	well hey guys it skin cancer awareness month and in this video i do a skin check and examine your skin to look for potentially pre-skin cancers or skin cancers you are new here welcome my name is andrea i dermatologist i upload a ton of skincare content here on youtube please consider subscribing if that is of interest to you or follow me over on instagram or tick tock i post on those platforms a lot too the american cancer society recommends that people do self skin exams once a month especially people who have multiple risk factors for skin cancers and if you risk factors for skin cancers check out my recent video on know your risk i go over some of the most common risk factors for skin cancer so check that out but do you know anyone can develop a skin cancer even if you don factors and knowing your skin examining it is a good thing and maybe can help you catch something early on when should you be doing a skin check like i said the american cancer society says once a month that good idea now it doesn when you do it but i mean practically speaking it makes the most sense to examine your skin like when you gotten out of the shower out of the bath before you naked so you can really look at all the skin and obviously you don have any makeup on that could be obscuring things so after the shower is typically a good time now first of all starting out you want to face a mirror and you want to be in a room that has good lighting and you just want to look very carefully at all surfaces of your face your neck the ears and your arms as well as your chest and your stomach women should examine the breasts lift up the breasts and look underneath the breast if you have a lot of abdominal folds you want to make sure that you as well lift up your arms and check in the underarm area and then take a careful look at the backs of your hands and the palms of your hands look between your fingers and look all around your fingernails then you want to take a seat and look very carefully at your thighs as well as the tops of your feet in between your toes and your toenails then grab yourself a hand mirror and take a look at the soles of your feet very carefully then bring that mirror up to the back of your legs look at the backs of your calves you know one leg at a time and the backs of your thighs one leg at a time then you want to stand up and with that hand mirror you to take a careful look at your buttocks and your back so you the lower back and then you bring that mirror up around and look at your upper back take a careful look at the back of your neck and the back of your ears then you also want to take that hand mirror and look very carefully around the groin and the genitalia a lot of people don melanoma can develop in the genitalia lastly do not forget to take a careful look at your scalp as best you look through the scalp take that mirror make sure you your ears all right so that examine your skin but what the heck are you looking for you know most people have freckles moles all sorts of things that are harmless uh and it can be hard to tease out all that background noise from something that may be potentially suspicious like an early skin cancer or god forbid a melanoma so how do you kind of tease out all that noise so it can be challenging to tease out just like the background noise of normal skin spots from something that could be potentially suspicious so here are some common things that are perfectly normal on a skin shack and as you do your skin check each month you going to come to realize that yeah i had this mold forever and it not changing so first of all you gonna probably see moles that you for a while moles otherwise known as nevi they dangerous very very very very very rarely they do go on to form to turn into a skin cancer moles are typically small they uniform in size shape they can be flat or raised they and they very very very very very rarely turn into a skin cancer now people who have a lot of moles that is a marker for an increased risk for melanoma so having more than 50 moles is a risk factor for melanoma but yeah they especially on sun exposed areas then some people have what are called atypical moles otherwise known as dysplastic nevi now these differ from common moles in that they they can be a little irregular in appearance they can have a few different colors kind of brown and tan to them they may be a little irregular in texture the vast majority of these atypical moles they are completely harmless they never change or do anything harmful but in some cases they can change and melanoma can arise in a dysplastic nevis and an atypical mole having a lot of atypical moles does put you at increased risk for melanoma having more than five the increased risk however that comes with having more than five dysplastic nevi the increased risk for melanoma is actually pretty small so don these just keep an eye on them with your monthly skin checks number three is a congenital mole or a congenital nevis congenital means it something you were born with these are really common often dark brown sometimes almost black congenital nevi may have a hair growing through them and they can be raised they vary in size from small to large and with large congenital levi there actually is an increased risk of melanoma so if you have a congenital nevus that is the size of the palm of your hand or smaller very very very low risk of that ever doing anything you know turning into cancer or anything like that but if you have a congenital nevus that large portions of your back or your buttocks it trunk nevis just because of how it looks that does come with an increased risk of melanoma and those patients actually need to be followed more regularly another skin finding that you may identify especially if you were in your older years is an actinic keratosis this is a skin lesion that is hard to see for a lot of people but you can feel it so i didn to run your hands over like your forehead your ears all of your sun exposed skin if you feel something that you look at it very carefully it of red appearing that could be something called an actinic keratosis actinic keratosis they can evolve into a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma so it identified early and treated they really common especially in people who are a paler complexion and who have a lot of sun damage they after the age of 50. it somebody under the age of 50 to have actinic keratoses but i mean i impossible it they feel gritty sometimes they can kind of tingle itch actinic keratosis can pop up on the ears the head and neck the backs of the hands the lips and they feel a little rough gritty then another common skin lesion especially as you get up there in years is something called separate as seborrheic keratosis this is brown to tan kind of waxy in appearance almost seems like it skin like you know somebody just came up and stuck this this thing onto you and sometimes they get caught up if you and then the skin underneath bleeds and then they grow right back these are they they kind of look like warts but they completely not harmful they don skin cancer they going to change into a skin cancer they are not dangerous but those are something that often gets referred to a dermatologist to say hey is this new thing that me something to be scared about so that something that you may already have on you you may have already been told by your doctor don the barnacle on the ship of life a lot of people refer to them as i don i don could rub people the wrong way but yeah they anything to do with sun exposure or sun damage it doesn like we have the full story there nothing that can be done to prevent those from occurring i do have a video by the way on separate keratosis including the treatment escada so if you video out i description box so those are some common bumps that you may see on your skin certainly not an exhaustive list of possible skin findings but just some common ones but what about melanoma the thing about melanoma is it can actually overlap in appearance with a lot of these normal appearing things but it something that just kind of all of a sudden stands out to you as this wasn there before or this just doesn you know it stands out it ugly duckling sign because it doesn on the surface of your skin so if you got a lot of moles freckles or severe keratosis or whatever a lot of sun damage the melanoma is going to be like something that just stands out to you as different and it can it can change in appearance from month to month it uh it melanoma are typically very irregular if you draw a line down the middle of it it can be a few different colors within a melanoma brown and black most common but it can be skin colored tan melanomas may bleed easily or ooze it can be uncomfortable and again it going to be something that that comes out of nowhere and just suddenly looks very different so that would certainly be something to urgently bring to the attention of your health care provider if you have a dermatologist let them know that you have a new skin finding and you need to be examined if you see something new on your skin that just doesn feel right or something on your skin that seems different you don know what it is but it hunch that something is different not what it once was definitely bring it to the attention of your of your dermatologist because a lot of times patients will come in and they this mole is kind of freaking me out it looks different there different about it i can finger on it and even for the dermatologist looking at it pull out the germatoscope take a look at it it may not even really seem too you know objectively that different but a biopsy is done a lot of times those do actually end up being skin cancers so your hunch that something is off that that is actually a very helpful clue that you know further investigation may be needed so i hope this video was helpful to you guys you know skin checks there they can be a slippery slope i don doing them any more often than once a month because you can get a little bit too nervous about certain things and it can be a good idea especially if you have a lot of moles and things to just go ahead and take some photographs of certain areas if you was this here last month was this here this you know if something is new or not just so that you yourself overly anxious about things it that way if something new does actually pop up you can show that to your dermatologist in some dermatology clinics that do a lot of skin cancer they doing total body photography to monitor new or changing lesions so that may be something that your dermatologist is already doing for you but if not you know or if you don access to a dermatologist consider taking some photographs especially if you lot of moles that could be very helpful if something new pops up then you have that to compare to so in the description box i factors for skin cancer you don to miss so if you missed that video definitely check it out i the end slate but if you like this one give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen and subscribe i guys tomorrow bye [Music] you	Success
Menopause Skin Changes No One Talks About	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok7rLc0AZV0	Dr Day	surprise menopause it can affect your skin many people are well aware of this however in today be talking about a particular skin change that might happen as you go through menopause and thereafter which I almost never hear people covering maybe you have this you have this all of a sudden where did it come from why is it happening how do I get rid of it it is so uncomfortable what is this mystery skin finding I speaking about dry cracked feet painful buildup of dry skin on the bottoms of the feet and in many cases the palms of the hands as well this is known as curaderma climac tyum now it doesn happen to everybody it common but it definitely happens and like I said it tuned to the end of the video because I practical tips and tricks for simple atome remedies to alleviate this improve it and I medical therapies that might be offered to you by your doctor to help it go away with menopause there is a decline in the hormone estrogen this is what leads to many of the symptoms women experience as they go through menopause our skin feels that decline in estrogen estrogen plays a key role in stimulating the fiber blast cells within our dermis to produce collagen so while it about 1% of your collagen each year starting in your 20s when women go through menopause they lose substantially more because they do not have that stimulus in addition to that with age and with menopause the epidermis the top part of the skin atrophies it gets thin the outermost protective layer of the stratum corneum is is not as Compact and tight as it once was it Loosey Goosey if you will the bottoms of your feet and the palms of your hands the stratum corneum the outermost layer is really really really thick in this area the reason for kerma clima teracom is thought to be related to the decline in estrogen this usually starts out as these like painful rough thickened areas on the bottoms of the feet in areas of the feet where you are bearing the most weight but over time those thick bumps if you will come together to involve more of the surface of the bottoms of the feet and also can impact the palms of the hands women who develop this range anywhere from the age of 47 to roughly 69 it can happen anywhere within a year to 10 years of going through menopause it also has been observed in younger women who undergo a surgical menopause like have their ovaries removed for example letting further support to the role of estrogen in this skin condition related to menopause is the fact that many women have their cermac clima tacum improved significantly with hormone replacement therapy even with topical estrogens while you may not have full-blown Catera clima tacum you might have noticed that your feet are a lot more vulnerable to dryness the skin in general is more vulnerable to dryness as we age and in particular with menopause because with that decline in estrogen we also are having less production of moisture retaining factors within our skin our barrier Integrity is compromised and so our skin is just a lot more vulnerable to dryness and that can lead to the development of callous on the bottoms of the feet dry cracked feet clima terum curaderma however is painful it common in women who have high blood pressure and obesity dry cracked feet as a side note is more common in people who have obesity it the case of the feet aggravated by poorly fitting shoes that rub don provide good Arch P it also can be made worse by walking barefoot what can you do to address this um know this is not sponsored but you guys know I fan of petroleum jelly this is Vaseline brand petroleum jelly I have right here but you can get the store version of this save yourself some money get the big jar though after you get out of the shower or the bath slather thick thick layer of this stuff to the bottoms of the feet the palms of the hands and cover with socks and gloves this can really help soften that outermost thickened stratum corium the reason to cover with socks or gloves is it really enhances the outcome by effectively providing an occlusive shield around that petroleum jelly barrier petroleum jelly itself is very occlusive not to mention petroleum jelly helps lubricate the skin surface reducing frictional forces that lead to further skin thickening make sure that you wear shoes that fit you properly may not be the best time to be doing flip-flops that can aggravate this try and keep your feet covered if you keep your feet covered throughout the day with socks at least it reduces the impetus for transepidermal water loss out of the skin and can help reduce the dryness significantly the other game-changing skincare product again not sponsored is going to be this um if you welcome but everyone else has already heard about this probably numerous times from my video this is the carousel intensive foot repair as a name applies it acid those are cat litics they go in there and they break up the glue between those outermost skin cells helping to exfoliate smooth everything out after a shower apply this it jelly base similar to vaseline apply this those active ingredients will get in there and dissolve up that dry rough stuff apply it to the feet after a shower or bath and apply it to the Palms as well and again cover with socks and gloves that will really enhance the penetration of those active ingredients down through that thick wall of stratum corneum after you apply this though be sure to wash your hands because if you touch your face and transfer the residue from of that product to like your eyelids it can cause a lot of eyelid irritation ingredients that are particularly helpful for this are going to be ammonium lactate which is the salt of lactic acid Ura which we already mentioned salicylic acid glycolic acid can also be very helpful here these like I said they get in there and they help to break up that stuff and smooth it out I don pedicure salons to like file this stuff down because that actually can end up making it worse a topical retinoid might also be offered although penetration in these areas is limited instead what might be discussed with you if you candidate is an oral retinoid like something called sorotan which is used to treat psoriasis this medication however is not without risks it has side effects so it and therefore may not be an option for you but the other option is maybe you someone who is interested in hormone replacement therapy this appears to be driven by the decline in estrogen hormone replacement therapy can help clear it up mitigate the symptoms get you back to the Palms and Soles you had before menopause however not everyone is a candidate for hormone replacement therapy always discuss that with your healthcare provider aside from hormone replacement therapy topical estrogen can actually help clear this up now I talked about topical estrogen cream for wrinkles but I don it in that video for this condition for dry cracked feet we see ads out there for using estrogen cream for wrinkles to replace the declining estrogen locally in the skin boosting up collagen production yeah it can work but it also can be pretty helpful for dry crack feet it particular outcome but the loss of estrogen is what is thought to underly koderma clima teracom and there are case reports of women who develop it and try all sorts of treatments ammonium lactate oral retinoids and it estrogen that got them the relief now that to get those results it so we need more research but it definitely can be an effective option for some whether you have this or just new onset dry cracked feet keep in mind that a combination of different uh treatments might get you the results that you are looking for coupled with lifestyle modifications that includes again wearing shoes that fit you well that are supportive don friction and Trauma to the skin letting go of walking around Barefoot moisturizing the heck out of your feet wearing socks if you have obesity weight management can also help quite a bit by reducing the load on the feet it clear whether addressing your high blood pressure helps to get rid of the Cadera clima terum like I said a lot of people who develop this also have high blood pressure but that being said it important to address high blood pressure with your healthc care provider regardless of Kat Derma clima tacum or not now before you click out of this video going all right I to the store I things I what I have oh oh back the bus up because there are some other things that could look like this but are not it so it provider to confirm that this is actually what you have because it really that common in the grand scheme of things it does happen I cases of it but it that happens to every person that goes through menopause so just keep that in mind other things that might look like this include athletes foot which you can develop um or psoriasis certain nutritional deficiencies it is a clinical diagnosis meaning your doctor looks at it and talks to you and decides that are really needed although if they not sure they might take a scraping of it to look for fungus no dermatologist is ever in the wrong for taking a scraping of something and looking for fungus cuz let me tell you dermatophytes which is the fancy name for fungus that causes athletes foot jocket ringworm toenail fungus they are sneaky they sneaky and they cause rashes that look like all sorts of things so never in the wrong for looking for that um but all that to say

How To Tell If You Have Skin Cancer | Dermatologist Tips	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJZ0qy4tPLY	Dr Day	how to tell if you have skin cancer May is melanoma awareness month now melanoma is one type of skin cancer but there are many other types scamac cell basil cell Merkel cell which is a lot rarer and as a side note I have videos going in depth on all these different types of skin cancers and they can be found in my skin cancer playlist you definitely need to check that playlist out because I give a lot of life-saving tips if I say so myself with regards to how to check your skin at home signs of different types of skin cancers but how can you know if you are dealing with a skin cancer what are some signs what are some things that you should be looking out for in comparison to other types of cancer the good news with skin cancer is that well it easier to find because well you just have to look whereas some types of cancer that happen internally they hiding in there and there way to find them early on with skin cancer if it cases it can be removed and treated and that however if a skin cancer diagnosis is delayed the skin cancer can grow and as it grows it can put out little Roots depending on the type of cancer it can take over a larger area and in many cases it can turn into something that is a lot more stubborn to treat requires a more involved surgery to remove um or you know potentially depending on the subtype of cancer could become more potentially life-threatening say for a melanoma something you may not realize about skin cancer is that it can happen pretty much anywhere it can happen obviously you know maybe what comes to mind is Sun Exposed Skin because many types of skin cancer are related to cumulative sun damage um but really you can get a skin cancer in places where the sun doesn of your feet the genitals you can get skin cancer in your scalp your eyelids the lips your ears so you really have to be very comprehensive when looking out for a skin cancer skin cancer also can pop up in your nails your fingernails your toenails I suggest checking your skin at home on a monthly basis and this is especially helpful if you who has a lot of moles at Basel but honestly anyone can benefit from doing this now you want to be really comprehensive when examining your skin and doing self skin checks you want to look at every spot you want to make sure you part your hair and that you taking a careful look at your scalp you want to get a mirror and be able to examine your back you want to be able to examine the backs of your thighs check out my video on how to do a skin check at home because I go step by step outlining the process in a streamlined fashion for an efficient total atome skin check better yet get somebody else to help you out two sets of eyes are always better than one Speaking of which fun fact hairdressers are our biggest Ally in the skin cancer detection space because they detect many skin cancers in the scalp early on they bring them to the attention of their client and say hey I I think you should get that looked at skin cancers can happen at any age but they are more common the older you get risk factors for certain types of skin cancers include cumulative sun exposure throughout your lifetime if you sunbathing you got a lot of unprotected sun exposure that definitely is a risk factor also if you have ever used a tanning bed that certainly puts you at risk being a paler skin type having multiple moles having multiple moles that are atypical in appearance also having um light eyes red hair lots of freckles also people who have a weakened immune system who are immunosuppressed say for example you have had an organ transplant you have to take medications to suppress your immune system to prevent your body from rejecting your organ transplant well that is an at risk group for different types of skin cancers they need more intensive monitoring by a dermatologist skin cancers can also happen in areas where you have had a skin injury such as a chronic wound that hasn properly that is a potential site exposure to ionizing radiation is also a risk factor um say for example you were treated with ionizing radiation for a Cancer and well now the skin in that area is more at risk for developing skin cancers because the radiation does alter some of how your body surveys for cancer what does skin cancer look like well it can take on a variety of different appearances many things you might be under the impression are just like a pimple or a h skin tag could in fact be a skin cancer but as a general rule of thumb here are some tips a worrisome feature is a mole that starts to change in appearance now when it comes to moles that are dark in color if they start to change appearance you really want to look at them for the following features because these following features are suspicious for perhaps a melanoma they melanoma the a stands for asymmetry if you have a mole that all of a sudden becomes asymmetrical meaning you draw a line through the center of it and it not the same on either side that is potentially concerning the b stands for borders there are regular shaped Borders or or sort of blurred borders that would also be worrisome color is the C having multiple colors or a change in color all a sudden an area where it black or there be worrisome d stands for diameter anything that becomes larger than say the head of a pencil eraser roughly 6 mm in diameter that is something that may be worth paying more attention to because potentially could be signs of an evolving uh skin cancer speaking of evolving that is what the E stands for so basically something that has evolved to have these changes and is you know kind of becoming different as time goes on that is more worrisome so that moles that you have that might be changing or dark spots that may be changing in line with potentially worrisome for melanoma but another sign outside of the abcde Ugly Duckling sign basically if you stand back especially if you who has a lot of moles you stand back you look at yourself and yeah you a lot of moles but there looks different it stands out and maybe you never noticed it before um but it just looks unusual in comparison to your other moles it Duckling sign but there are also many non- melanoma skin cancers and truthfully these are actually a lot more common than melanoma they become increasingly more common as you get into your older years they can take on the appearance of of a dome shaped growth sometimes with an overlying dilated blood vessel or maybe you have this rough scaly patch or you may have this stubborn sore or ulcer that just does not seem to heal speaking of things that don cancer if you especially but really anyone if you get what you think is a pimple and it does not go away that is suspicious pimples while you can continue to get many pimples an individual pimple should go away on its own so that is worrisome something that looks like a ward could potentially be a skin cancer a rough scaly patch or a area of the skin where it looks almost like a scar or has a waxy appearance certain skin cancers can take on the appearance of a pink reddish growth that sort of dips in the center a sudden appearance of a brown or black streak in the nail is also a worrisome finding that you would want to bring to the attention of your healthc care provider a skin spot concerning for a skin cancer may have some symptoms associated with it it can itch it can bleed can have a pins and needles tingling sensation because sometimes little blood vessels Co throughout the skin cancer and that more prone to bleeding or little nerves are coursing through it and getting trapped and that and needle sensation or causes pain or itch or discomfort but by and large people who develop skin cancers um you feel otherwise healthy that is one of the tricky sneaky things is that a person who develops a skin cancer for the most part is you know going about their life healthy as a horse so to speak doing everything that they normally do normal appetite no fevers night sweats you know it like you know it critically ill or just not feeling yourself or feeling fatigued or unwell um that per se most people are are feeling well doing skin checks at home can really help you out because you can monitor your moles your spots and if something is changing again it it to your dermatologist early because if caught early the outcomes are much better how does a dermatologist diagnose skin cancer well they examine your skin um they look at the given skin spot of concern with something called a dermatoscope we can look for certain features but if it is something that is truly worrisome for a skin cancer a skin biopsy will be needed and that sounds really scary oh my gosh a biopsy a skin biopsy is not as scary as it sounds it involves just putting a little numbing medicine in the spot and removing the spot and depending on the size location stitching it up but uh it Dermatology visit so when you make an appointment with a dermatologist they examine your skin if they find something or the spot that you they biopsy right then and there so the biopsy is the skin spot that taken out the biopsy is put into a bottle with preservative in it and that is sent to a dermatopathologist so the dermatopathologist takes it and their lab technicians process it into um slices and they look at the tissue under the microscope and they look for cancer cells and if they find them they put that in their report um they also comment on the extent and and things of that nature they may in some cases take the biopsy and do some special laboratory tests on it special stains markers for cancers once all that information is comes together in a biopsy report then the dermatologist can go from there in a lot of cases the biopsy is the treatment is the cure they got it all out with the biopsy that you know especially if if caught early sometimes that that cases more treatment would be needed such as a another surgery to make sure to get it all out and in some cases depending on the location the size the type of uh skin cancer you may need to have a special type of skin skin cancer surgery um called Mo surgery Mo surgery basically is a surgical approach to removing um skin cancers where where you take little pieces piece by piece to make sure you get all of the cancer out but at the same time because you going in this step by-step fashion and you microscope at the time of removing it the the the surgeon is actually taking taking the skin cancer out piece by piece and taking it over the microscope and looking at it saying did we get it all no all right let some more all right did we get it all all right no let more well we got it all so that surgery works and the reason that it so helpful is it has the highest cure rate for different skin cancers and it tissue sparing meaning they have removed the least amount of skin from you possible to ensure getting all of the cancer out and when we areas on your face you can imagine that that not a whole lot of wiggle room speaking of which in some cases your um dermatologist U Mo surgeon will need to do a special type of repair to cover the area that they have cut out so that might involve a flap or a graft or something of that sort all of that is a bit above and beyond the scope of today are some general pointers on how to tell if you have a skin cancer in the description box I will link um some websites where you can look at images the reason I don video is that they are a bit graphic in nature and YouTube will remove the video if I include them so I will put them in the description box they are publicly available so you can go and look at them there also check out my skin cancer playlist where you can learn all about basil cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma you can learn about melanoma you can learn how to do a atome skin check you can also learn about how to prevent skin cancer and you can learn about how to get ready for your first dermatologist appointment so I have a lot of videos in there that I think will be helpful to you all and are relevant to bring up in this month of melanoma awareness all right guys I hope this video was helpful to you if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don

Don't Miss These 15 Signs Of Atopic Dermatitis!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyhHBNf_WCE	Dr Day	well hey guys today I sharing with you 15 signs you might have been born with an impaired skin barrier these are skin findings manifestations that we often see in people who have an underlying problem with their skin barrier as a result of maybe things that they inherited as far as issues with barrier proteins lipids often these things can be identified in patients who have a topic dermatitis the first one is something called White dermatographism now dermatographism basically is skin writing it is something that a lot of people experience where if you stroke the skin you get a hive that appears in the shape of the marking that you made by stroking the skin and usually that red and Rays white dermatographism on the other hand is a little bit different in that first you get a red line from stroking the skin and then within about 10 to 15 seconds it turns completely white and it can stay like that for you know 60 or more seconds we see this in patients who have atopic dermatitis also sometimes can be seen in patients who have allergic contact dermatitis white dermatic graphism can appear with even just the slightest bit of stroking in terms of the pressure it in adults than children with atopic dermatitis and it also is a lot more common on the lower body in comparison to the upper body number two is hyperlinear Palms if you look at your palms of your hands you see a lot of little tiny lines maybe on this part of the hand or even over your fingers this is something that a lot of patients who have atopic dermatitis or iosis vulgaris will often have hyperlinear palms and it is associated with an inherited defect in something called fagin also patients who have keratosis pyloris or food allergies may also have an increased association with hyperlinear Palms so take a moment look at your palms number number three is something that I think needs rebranding because it doesn sound so nice it neck basically the neck is delicate skin it if you have atopic dermatitis it common area to develop flares of your eczema and the skin can become thickened and discolored you get post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation but then the skin can just get thick from The Chronic rubbing of like scratching and it can take on this dirty appearance parents and parents of children who develop this may think that the child has not been doing a good job bathing themselves and they may go in the you know bathroom with them and say let and really that is the opposite of what you want to do because it dirty it is discolored and thickened and rubbing it aggressively only makes the problem worse this can improve with good control of the atopic dermatitis consistent use of moisturizers barrier creams emolion number four clue is you get itchy whenever you sweat sweat on the skin surface isn regardless of if you have a problem with your Skin Barrier but for patients who have atopic dermatitis sweat can really be problematic patients often get very itchy their skin starts to tingle whenever they get sweaty and this may be related to a direct effect of components in your sweat being irritating and aggravating to eczema it may have to do with the fact that sweat leads the skin to lose more water and become more prone to dryness and irritation but it also is thought that patients who have atopic dermatitis their sweat glands may be a little leaky below the surface of the skin and sweat actually leaks out into the dermis and generates an inflammatory response to trigger eczema itch discomfort if you do have problems with sweat on the skin surface as an atopic make sure that you take measures to keep the skin cool and dry when you are exercising and also try as best you able to rinse the skin of sweat after you about sweat with atopic dermatitis relates to that little yeast that lives on everyone skin called malesia a lot of patients who have atopic dermatitis they actually develop an allergy to certain parts of malesia and when you sweat that malesia comes through the sweat gland and you also have um kind of almost an allergic response to that little yeast this can also play a role in itch and flares of the eczema on the head and neck number five is prominent horizontal lines of your lower eyelid this is called Denny Morgan present from a very young age some patients with atopic dermatitis you can even notice this around the time of birth in contrast to periorbital wrinkles wrinkles around the eyes that we get as a result of age these appear from a very very early age and in contrast to wrinkles around the eyes Denny Moran folds aren loss of collagen in the supportive framework but rather the result of inflammation in the skin may be also aggravated by rubbing of the eyes leading to accumulation of fluid around that area and you get this prominent little wrinkle under the eyes Denny Morgan folds are not specific to atopic dermatitis they can also be identified in patients who have other inflammatory conditions around the eyes speaking of eyes another Hallmark of at topic dermatitis having an impaired skin barrier goes along with this tendency to develop seasonal allergies allergic rinitis and as a result a lot of patients develop what shiners basically dark dark under eye circles this has to do with the congestion of fluid in the little veins underneath the eyes couple with the fact that that area of of the eye that under eye skin is thin it underneath is more obvious so it looks dark and discolored you may have some overlying thickening of the skin from chronic rubbing and you may also have hyperpigmentation as a result of the inflammation further adding to that dark discoloration those who have seasonal allergies as part of their atopic dermatitis seasonal allergies are really common uh they often will have a prominent nasal crease basically from seasonal allergies pushing the nose up they get a little horizontal crease you see this a lot in young kids who have atopic dermatitis seasonal allergies they nose yes that is that is not permanent it can improve with time but if you consistently do that it may become more of a fixture this is something that a lot of people notice on themselves and may not realize it dermatitis it per follicular accentuation basically skin colored to dark little tiny bumps overlying the hair follicle and if you look to the side you can really notice it it upper back the chest it can improve in appearance with consistent use of moisturizers to help replenish moisture in the outermost layer of the skin and to help improve barrier function and limit penetration of irritant and water loss then you have wool intolerance w l wool intolerance this is not an allergy extreme discomfort flares of eczema when you come in contact with wool and it thought to be a mechanical irritant effect of the wool fibers whether or not this aggravates your skin is also related to the wool fiber for example Marino wool which I guess is a more delicate fiber doesn patients who have a topic dermatitis and an impaired skin barrier it about the you know the coarse wool fiber then a lot of patients with atopic dermatitis not all experience queenan sign or hers sign basically thinning of the outermost outermost third of your eyebrow starts to get thin you can even have loss there this is not specific to having an impaired skin barrier an atopic dermatitis you also can see this in patients who have hypothyroidism it more obvious in patients who have a lot of facial atopic dermatitis going on a lot of inflammation and once it comes under good control the Brows can grow back so it is leading to the brow loss in that area the inflammation from the impaired barrier of atopic dermatitis and the flares of the eczema number 11 sign chelitis chelitis is fancy medical term for chap lips a lot of patients with atopic dermatitis readily develop chapped lips with little cracks that can be very painful uncomfortable peeling of the lips and this is something a lot of adults with a toping derus experience and it deal with this as an adult with atopic dermatitis like a course that can happen with atopic dermatitis is you have it as a child and then it burns out it kind of goes away and then as an adult you have these little reminders and one of them is um chap lips having a tendency towards chap lips and this can be made worse by coming in contact with irritants so for example the flavorant an adult toothpaste mint cinnamon can really aggravate the chap lips certain lip balms can be very irritating or because you have an impaired skin barrier is part of your Constitution right you were born this way even though the eczema has kind of burned out it still part of you st gets into the skin more readily so you are more susceptible to developing allergic contact dermatitis becoming allergic to something in a product that you have been using and that can often be a lip balm because you got chap lips you using lip balms and therefore you can go on to develop an allergic kitis on top of just your Plain Jane kitis from being an atopic so for this reason I always Point people on the direction of using plain petroleum jelly on the lips because it is free of possible allergens that can you know be a problem especially if you have an impaired skin bearer all right the next sign see it lot in young children but adults certainly can develop it as well it called petasis Alba it round hypopigmented uh patches kind of have a little fine scale to them this is more obvious in people who have a deeper skin tone it dermatitis you is very sensitive irritated inflamed and as a result you kind of develop what called post-inflammatory hypopigmentation often happens on the cheeks but really anywhere where you have a topic dermatitis and it said it who have a deeper skin tone um and it can easily be confused with Vitiligo or it can be confused with petasis um versacolor Tina Versa color which is related to malesia yeast and it also can be confused with sebc dermatitis another eczema but it patients to with atopic dermatitis to develop these oval round patches where the skin color starts to fade a bit the good news is once the eczema the atopic dermatitis is treated is managed is controlled you consistently to really help with the barrier function while your normal skin color can return so there aside from these light colored patches the next sign is just overall what described as poor meaning pness of the face especially like around the nose this may have to do with a combination of just the vascular sort of changes with all the inflammation um or just a result of rubbing and maybe to a certain extent some post-inflammatory hypopigmentation number 14 it who have an impaired skin barrier to develop these non-specific hand and foot rashes dermatitis um hand and foot eczemas now of course you can have on the hands a specific type of hand eczema called dis hydrosis which I have a whole video about okay these little blisters that come up on the sides of the fingers and itch like none other but aside from that you can just have bouts of hand eczema hand dermatitis that non-specific where you don those little blisters and likewise on the bottom of the feet but um this is just kind of a non-specific thing and in kids like teens and tween there something called juvenile plantar dermatosis basically they develop sometimes painful flaky scaly and deeply fissured areas mostly on the weightbearing surfaces of the soles of the feet and it can be made worse or brought out by friction poorly fitted shoes or a lot of sweating happens more so in teens and tweens who have really sweaty feet or if they particularly breathable or they stay in like tight fitting shoes for a long prong period of time they can develop this as well um and it can be quite painful all right so the last sign that you may not have ever thought about um it of those little you know reminders of the eczema that you had as a kid because it tends to happen you know an adults it the nipples can be very painful and why patients develop this is not clear it probably again related to just this inherent issue that those patients have With Their Skin Barrier and the clothing that you wear may be causing a lot of friction in this area irritating the skin and it can be lead to cracking scaling itch now women who are breastfeeding develop can develop something quite similar a nipple eczema but in patients with atopic dermatitis out you know who aren can develop this too again um what I recommend here you know see your dermatologist there are treatments that can be offered here but you need to protect that skin with a good Barrier cream petroleum jelly or even diaper rash cream here can really make a difference all right guys those are 15 signs you were born with an impaired skin barer I really hope this video was helpful to you guys if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow bye [Music] he	Success
Warning Signs Of Carbon Monoxide Poisoning NOT TO MISS	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYcK5LgdQjo	Dr Day	welcome back to another episode of you guessed it your skin your skin go ahead and say it with me is a window to what is going on internally and wouldn love to know some skin warning signs as well as nails that you are well being poisoned the most common cause of poisoning is carbon monoxide and yes there are skin findings there will be skin signs what the heck is carbon monoxide anyway carbon monoxide is deadly because you can can odorless it incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons found in gasoline and propane our bodies can be exposed to it through inhalation or through absorption through our skin which is uncommon our skin is a barrier to the external world but yes carbon monoxide can be absorbed through the skin one might be exposed to carbon monoxide from the exhaust of gasoline or propane powered devices or through smoking tobacco cigarettes marijuana or other smokeables carbon monoxide levels in the body are measured by something known as carboxyhemoglobin and we into what exactly that is and why it is so deadly and how your skin is going to warn you that that is getting too dang high it and to a certain extent we all have some amount of carboxyhemoglobin in our body most otherwise healthy people who do not smoke things have a carboxyhemoglobin concentration of around 1 to 3% people who smoke it around 15% quite high but carbon monoxide will start to affect you make you feel ill and lead to symptoms once the carboxy hemoglobin concentration is anywhere from 10 to 30% you might be exposed to it from smoking from car fumes maybe you have a gas cooker that is malfunctioning or was improperly installed propane or gas fuel compressors house fire smoke or methyl chloride paint stripper and again you can get carbon monoxide poisoning from inhalation and from skin exposure most of the time you monoxide poisoning because you are exposed to carbon monoxide in a poorly ventilated area like a room or a garage for example a lot of people where I live especially have generators and you should never run these generators in your garage because that enclosed space you can get way too much carbon monoxide and it can be lethal why is carbon monoxide so bad for us why does it poison us it it poisons us because like I said most people if you just walked into a room full of carbon monoxide you to know it odorless you can it you can is it gets into our body and it affects the protein hemoglobin in our red blood cells it gets into the red blood cells and affects that protein hemoglobin hemoglobin is what carries oxygen around it picks it up in our lungs from the air that we inhale and it offloads it to different organs tissues throughout the body that require oxygen which is our whole body okay so this is a big deal to be effective your hemoglobin when your hemoglobin is low you can around well what happens here it is essentially poisoned by the carbon monoxide and it causes the hemoglobin to hold on to the oxygen so tenaciously it refuses to donate it appropriately to tissues so in other words your body becomes deprived of oxygen your tissues get hypoxic dangerously low inadequate amounts of oxygen to explain it in more simple terms carbon monoxide poisoning is a form of chemical Suffocation chemical asphixiation even though your lungs are inhaling and exhaling air that poison that you ability of the oxygen to be delivered to the body so what are the warning signs that you have carbon monoxide poisoning to be clear the skin signs which I know I important the skin signs once they appear you are in a serious danger zone initially carbon monoxide poisoning usually presents with these very non-specific symptoms of headache nausea you might vomit just feel unwell lethargic maybe a little foggy and you might have a little bit of chest pain but because these are such non-specific findings maybe you go to the doctor with these you might easily get misdiagnosed as having a cold a stomach flu especially during cold and flu season when hey guess what this is even more likely to occur because people are closed up inside running heaters Etc and are more likely to be exposed to carbon monoxide as opposed to when we are enjoying the Summer Breeze Outdoors so um yeah the initial symptoms are very non-specific and could easily be brushed off but as the carbon monoxide builds up in the body and poisons you further then you start having a lot more serious signs symptoms you can develop full-blown arhythmia heart failure you can go into respiratory failure lose Consciousness have basically all the equivalent of a heart attack an organ system that is most vulnerable to carbon monoxide poisoning and to a certain extent may never bounce back is your nervous system the nerves in your body can be permanently impaired that might leave you with a permanent disability you might have a permanent problem with memory with cognition may be permanently impacted it might even frankly change your whole personality this definitely can happen it can also lead to persistently low blood pressure due to damage in the autonomic nervous system a skin warning sign albeit it shows up later on once the levels are quite high is your skin is cherry red bright red I can see on this man skin finding which I you an image of because it YouTube doesn like this they cause this severe blistering skin rash with Frank necrosis death of the skin and the unfortunate thing here too is that a lot of people say they house fire they might be misdiagnosed initially I just looking at it as oh my gosh you got a thermal burn like the fire burnt your skin oh no no no no it actually the carbon monoxide poisoning starving the underlying muscles tissues of oxygen so they necrose and the skin essentially dies off there blood flow to the skin it just dies you get this bad blistering rash and death of the skin it can be quite deadly it might be observed on your hands your legs your back your ankles then it can impact your fingernails as well your fingernail beds might be bright pink and for whatever reason this type of poisoning seems to disrupt the normal shape of the little semicircular uh Half Moon white tip of your fingernail you see what I looks almost like it chunk coming out abnormally all right so those are the skin and nail findings associated with carbon monoxide poisoning very very serious people who are most vulnerable to this are going to be older adults who live alone so you might not even be aware that carbon monoxide poisoning is a real thing you may have no clue that it happening to you until it you live alone no one on the fact that you might be acting a little weird and you might just lie down be super fatigued and feel like oh I coming down with something and then you know you odorless gas continuing to poison you so one of the most important things you can do aside from making sure that you do not utilize paint thinners in an enclosed area you follow the instructions you don fueled car car in an enclosed garage for example and hang out in there that will poison you one of the biggest game changers this can really save your life is to get a carbon monoxide detector because these bad boys will go off when the carbon monoxide starts to go up and before it gets to a point where it could be dangerous if you have a carbon monoxide detector and it goes off you want to get the heck out of there and call the fire department um because yeah um don you suspect carbon monoxide it really can save your life highly highly recommend having one they um really a a lot of people simply are not aware of the harms of carbon monoxide and that it is the most common cause of poisoning um so how is it treated the hope is that treatment is initiated early enough before too much damage has ensued so in most cases the treatment is going to be 100% oxygen high flow sometimes they will put a two Mo down your trachea and just pump the oxygen in that way or if it bad you you are of carboxyhemoglobin are so high they might actually treat you with hyperbaric oxygen so that in which it much better than having to have the treatment right like that is what we want so get yourself a carbon monoxide detector if you don all right guys let me know in the comments are you interested in more videos on skin warning signs that you are being poisoned I could do a video on heavy metal poisoning um let me know if that in but I really hope you enjoyed this video if so give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen And subscribe I to you guys tomorrow bye [Music]	Success
Signs Of Gut Inflammation NOT TO MISS | Skin Problems	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FlCkXxX5tw	Dr Day	gut health gut health gut health is it just me influencers will not shut up about gut health signs that you need to heal your gut how to heal your gut how I healed my gut naturally don twisted there are many inflammatory pathologies that can occur in your gastrointestinal tract and guess what when these things happen not only is it not good for you but you guessed it you guessed it that window to what on internally yeah the skin there are signs and that talk about in today said there are a variety of different reasons why you might have inflammation in the gut many different conditions their Hallmark feature is some sort of gut inflammation but today we specifically going to talk about two conditions known as inflammatory bowel disease these include Crohn and ulcerative colitis these conditions tend to wax and Wayne come and go there medications that can control the inflammation and the symptoms and help people stay healthy untreated uncontrolled can be quite debilitating because the inflammation not only makes you feel horrible but it significantly impairs your ability to digest food and absorb nutrients from your food putting you at risk for various nutrient deficiencies the reason people get these has to do with the complex interplay between your genetics your environment certain exposures and of course how your immune system responds likely as a result of well your genetics these two conditions have a lot of similarities they overlap especially in how they might lead to different skin findings which we they have some very specific features that distinguish the two ulcerative colitis this is inflammation specifically in the colon and it continuous meaning a continuous stretch of the gastrointestinal tract will be involved as opposed to Crohn where you have inflammation in the gut that can happen pretty much anywhere in the gut and it skips areas so you have an area of the gut that healthy unaffected interspersed with areas where there on these two conditions also differ in how the inflammation affects the gut alterative kitis the inflammation remains in the mucosa of the gut whereas with crohn full thickness it involves the full wall of the gastrointestinal tract of the given segment that is involved in speaking of involvement ulcerative colitis very often involves the rectum part of your lower gastrointestinal tract in contrast Crohn not involve the rectum when it comes to how your skin might be trying to show you that there is some inflammatory bowel disease going on whether it be ulcerative colitis or Crohn can break it down into three main categories the first is specific specific skin findings reflect skin involvement that is identical to what going on in the underlying gastrointestinal tract inflammation now now because ulcerative colitis the inflammation is only within the mucosa you don ulcerative colitis like you do with crohn unique to Crohn them in alterative colitis the other category of skin findings are known as reactive these are seen in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn they there is some sort of antigen for which the gut is reacting and the skin is also reacting there is cross talk between the gut and the skin and then third you have Associated conditions these are conditions that are not specific to the inflammation in the gut but rather are commonly seen in association in other words if you have these conditions it doesn bowel disease quite the opposite most people who have these conditions don have inflammatory bowel disease but if you have inflammatory bowel disease whether it be Crohn colitis there is an increased chance that you will have one of these conditions so a aside from these three main categories you also have to consider the category of skin conditions related to underlying nutritional deficiencies such as malabsorption vitamin deficiencies which commonly can happen in ulcer of colitis and Crohn disease if left untreated today we not going to talk about those but I do have many many videos on the skin warning signs of various vitamins micronutrients such as zinc deficiency iron deficiency B12 deficiency let talk about those specific skin findings seen with crohn ulcerative colitis because they reflect skin involvement secondary to what is going on in the gut full thickness in other words number one is paranal meaning around the anus fissures and perianal fistula fissures are essentially tears and fistula is like a tube like connection between two organs those two organs are not supposed to be connected so for example the G gastrointestinal tract and the skin should not be connected but that can happen due to the inflammation affecting the skin and the gut of Crohn not only is this painful but it puts the person at risk for infections and abscess formation and as a result of the chronic inflammation the patient can develop little skin tags around the anus now I pictures as I like to in today because many of the skin findings we covering today are very graphic in nature they occur in Intimate areas and are not acceptable to show in a YouTube video number two specific skin finding with crohn colitis is going to be well oral Crohn disease you can have Crohn involving your mouth your lips can become very swollen your gums can be very swollen if you look at the mucosa inside the mouth the mucosal surfaces like the roof of your mouth or along the gum line you will see what looks like cobblestoning this change is exactly what you will end up seeing of the gastrointestinal tract the gut will show this cobblestoning cobblestoning is pretty specific for Crohn ulcerative colitis the third specific finding it disease and this can result in the formation of nodules lumps bumps cysts that contain the inflammation characteristic of what is going on in the gut these often crop up in the skin folds as well as the extremities so the arms and the legs the troubling thing about metastatic Crohn be quite stubborn as a matter of fact even treating the Crohn gut sometimes is not adequate to get these metastatic Crohn resolve sometimes they need to be removed surgically in order to alleviate the symptom and the finding so those are the specific skin findings again you not going to see those with ultra colitis just with crohn then you have the other category that you can see in both diseases known as reactive skin conditions some sort of antigen that is being expressed in the gut cross reacts in the skin you have that gut skin axis that one has to consider and this is a case so the most common the most common skin finding with crohn it video all about this condition athema no doome results in the development of these painful tender nodules most often on The Shins the lower legs but truthfully they can happen pretty much anywhere including in rare cases on the face a lot of patients who develop it they are worked up evaluated for a possible inflammatory bowel disease if the history fits Athea no doome you get these nodules but it inflammation in the fat in the skin it called a peniculus athem no doome especially in somebody who has a history of inflammatory bowel disease definitely needs to be investigated with a biopsy because it can mimic some other lumps and bumps that can look very similar but are quite different and again are more common in people who have inflammatory bowel disease the next condition has to be one of the most in my opinion devastating things to cope with for any patient but is something that patients with inflammatory bowel disease might develop it it starts out actually as a tiny little pus bomb very rapidly turns into an ulcer that enlarges and is quite deep and literally can expand has a sort of expansive border can expand to take over the entire area now these often might happen on the lower legs but they can happen anywhere including the face the arms they actually commonly happen in patients who have inflammatory bowel disease around the S of a stomach peristal pyoderma gangrenosa and one sneaky thing about this condition is that it tends to come out in the setting of course of an underlying pathology like inflammatory bow disease when there is some kind of trauma it the same as kemner which we talk about in my videos on psoriasis so the reason I uncommon for it to appear after there been some kind of cut surgery domma formation if you go say to the Urgent Care to the emergency room or to another doctor even that this condition and what it looks like a non- dermatologist they might think that it debed it which is basically taking surgical instruments and removing dead tissue however that will make this worse due to the pathog thing so it important that it be carefully evaluated and this is a condition that requires a pretty deep biopsy to evaluate it disease that is a diagnosis of exclusion meaning you need to go through a variety of different tests to make sure it something else cuz there are a lot of things that look like this but are not it including certain infections so it quite an involved workup it debilitating and again it expands and can take over large areas and put you of course at risk for infections and it can go very deep and this is another case where the gut disease course like how inflamed your gut is or if your gut is treated doesn course of the pyoderma gangrenosum so specific treatments may be needed there really help like something called cyclosporin medications that Target uh something called tnf Alpha can be particularly helpful and those are also helpful of course for inflammatory bowel disease intal lesional meaning inject right into steroids to calm down the inflammation are another example of possible treatments for this but it really challenging tricky condition if you have this if you develop this you should be going through a lot of other tests to make sure that you don something else going on besides inflammatory valve disease that it is that and to exclude other things that look like pyoderma gangrenosum speaking of pyoderma gangrenosum let the other reactive skin finding scan Crohn it vegetans This is basically pyoderma gangrenosum of the mouth you get little pus bumps and ulcers that form on the lips and inside the mouth especially um inside the cheek like padag gangrenosum this is really a stubborn condition to treat it requires the use of oral antiseptic mouthwashes tacus that is put into water and you swish around that medication that targets certain aspects of the immune system aggressive oral hygiene because again here where you have some reactiveness in other words there might be triggering it and in the mouth your mouth is full of bacteria and all sorts of things so you really need to have aggressive oral hygiene in addition to medications that Target that inflammation speaking of sores in the mouth patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn likelihood I should say of developing canker sores otherwise known as apus ulcers these are round shallow painful that happen in the mouth and not everyone who gets these has inflammatory bowel disease they are pretty common actually but they can be a lot more common in those with inflammatory bowel disease and there here with being predisposed to developing these both because you have inflammatory bowel disease but also have to be careful because these can be more likely and triggered in the setting of certain uh vitamin deficiencies mineral deficiencies for example iron deficiency B12 def deficiency folic acid deficiency all of which are more common in people with inflammatory bowel disease so you kind of have two things going on that lead to an increased risk as a side note I do have a video All About canker sours how to cope with them things to do to reduce the chance of triggering their formation why they happen so check that video out because canker sores they not fun then patients with inflammatory bowel disease they are for certain types of vasculitis so vasculitis is essentially inflammation around blood vessels and there are many different vascules one such condition is known as cutaneous polyarteritis no DOA this involves inflammation around small and mediumsized blood vessels and results in the development of these tender nodules most often on the lower legs this is a condition that needs to be distinguished from athema no doam because they look very similar this is a vasculitis however in contrast aeod doam is a peniculus meaning inflammation in the fat this is inflammation around the blood vessels but at the surface of the skin they can look very similar then there is another type of vasculitis called necrotizing vasculitis this again most commonly happens on the lower legs and it presents with what is described as palpable perpa essentially the inflammation leads to uh blood leaking into the skin that meaning when you press on it it does not blanch in contrast to like a tan jaasia which is a dilated prominent blood vessel when you press on a tan jaasia it Blan it goes away but perpa does not and perpa can also kind of look a bit well purplish it is raised there to it because it is you know within the skin that inflammation is raising up the Skin So if you look to the side and you shine light on the skin you can see that there you can just run your fingers over it and you can feel that there is some substance it is palpable necrotizing V vasculitis can be quite deadly for these patients because because it can result in Frank tissue death and serious infections patients with inflammatory bowel disease are also at greater risk for thrombosis clots and this can lead to a variety of skin issues as well then last but not least in terms of the reactive conditions is a blistering disease known as epidermis fosa acquisita meaning you acquired it these are the development of tense blisters and they can go on to scar are so that is another situation where the skin reacts to the inflammatory bowel disease by virtue of some antigen and leads to destruction in a specific way to result in deep tense firm blisters that can go onto scar then last but not least let talk about Associated skin conditions which a lot of patients with inflammatory bowel disease they to have other skin diseases for example psoriasis pretty common actually for patients who have inflammatory bowel disease to also have psoriasis because they share certain underlying genetic markers risk factors that also are responsible for the abnormal way the immune system responds to certain antigens eczemas are more common as well as hydradenitis supera an intensive form of acne known as acne conglobata pylon Nal disease which I have a whole video about and dissecting cellulite as a scal disorder a lot of patients with inflammatory bowel disease might have a couple of these follicular occlusion disorders they may have three or four of them severe acne hronis ativa pylon disease and dissecting cellulitis these are conditions that fall under the umbrella of follicular occlusion disorders and you can have multiple of them also patients who have inflammatory bowel disease more likely to develop Vitiligo an autoimmune disease where the immune system gets confused and attacks the melanoides the pigment producing cells so you get areas of the skin the hair where you lose melanin pigment and it turns bone white check out my video All About Vitiligo I give a lot of information about it in that one all right y regards to signs that you have an inflamed gut but keep in mind inflammatory bowel disease it niche of an inflamed gut there are other inflammatory diseases of the gut other issues going on with the gut and so when people say gut health most of the time they don about they terminology in order to sell you something all right y video was informative and helpful on the ins slide I video All About athema no doome so check that one out next if you missed it but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe I bye he [Music]	Success
SIGNS OF HEAT STROKE & EXHAUSTION ?? DERMATOLOGIST @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dz5YMwdRuXE	Dr Day	well hey guys the heat is on it has been insanely hot all around the world i heard the uk had a record high last week and so with those increased temperatures comes an increased risk for heat related illness and death like heat exhaustion and heat stroke your skin the largest organ system it is right there at the interface trying to keep you safe by evaporative cooling through sweat blood flow so in this video we going to be talking about the signs the symptoms of heat related illness what to look out for and who is at risk but before we get into that make sure you are subscribed if you like skin care content from a board-certified dermatologist hit the little bell notification because that will let you know when my videos go live with extremes of heat comes an increase in heat related deaths either from heat exhaustion or heat stroke or actually cardiovascular disease heart attack and stroke did you know that in the us heat is the leading weather-related killer heat-related death is actually preventable through outreach and intervention so my hope in making this video is to hopefully educate you guys on what to look for and how to reduce your risk of heat exhaustion and heat stroke i you all and then we signs and symptoms of heat stroke and heat exhaustion tip number one is to look out for people at risk including yourself who is at risk very young children and babies because their thermoregulatory system is still developing the other group as adults over the age of 65. i in recent videos that as we get into our wiser older years our thermoregulatory systems are not as sharp and we related illness not being able to produce adequate sweat to cool the body people who drink alcohol in excess alcohol is dehydrating people who are overweight or obese are more at risk for heat related illness anyone with a history of heart disease or high blood pressure and certain medications that affect either blood flow to the skin thermoregulation or sweat production these include blood pressure medications beta blockers diuretics also certain antidepressants antihistamines drugs alcohol and that certainly can impair your thermoregulatory system and lead to dehydration so drinking a lot of alcohol in the sun it these extremes of heat certain metabolites of alcohol are actually photosensitizing make you making you at greater risk for a burn speaking of which if you have a sunburn that makes you more at risk for heat exhaustion because when the skin is burnt it as good at keeping you cool the other risk factor is if you have heat rash otherwise known as milliaria or people commonly refer to it as prickly heat i have a video all about this it basically a rash related to the sweat glands when you rash the sweat glands don properly so you yourself as efficiently putting you at greater risk for heat related illness and then people who over exert themselves in the heat are you know seemingly an obvious category for the most part this is people who you know you might deem as weekend warriors somebody who decides that they to go out and do a bunch of yard work but maybe they of shape or somebody who think i weekend and they really aren necessarily in the best shape and the extremes of heat make them a riskier group throw in you know a few beers into the mix and that can really be a setup for heat injury so look out for your friends family loved ones people in the neighborhood who are over the age of 65 or you know maybe have some underlying health issues these are these are groups at risk tip number two is to stay hydrated don to drink make sure you fluids water electrolyte beverages avoid sugary beverages like sodas kool-aid because these actually can end up being dehydrating likewise avoid alcohol and extremes of heat you may want to stick to cool foods like salads chilled soups as opposed to warm foods that further increase your body temperature most people don heavy hot meal when it out that is almost a defense mechanism because if it lately uh that little increase in body temperature is is actually unbearable so stay cool wear a fabric that is moisture wicking and breathable this is not a time to be wearing leggings leggings trap heat and sweat up against the surface of the skin create a lot of friction that can kick off heat rash number three limit the amount of time that you are outside uh and stick to times of the day like early morning or at night time when the sun has gone down and the temperatures are cooler this is beneficial not only for the heat exhaustion thing but also in reducing your exposure to those damaging uv rays that can lead to skin cancer speaking of uv rays make sure you are protecting your skin from the sun by wearing sunscreen and sun protective clothing seeking shade the reason for this is that as i said at the beginning of the video if you get a sunburn your skin ability to work to keep you cool is down so do what you can to make sure that you don a sunburn and by avoiding being out midday sun when it that will also help quite a bit and number five for the love of god do not leave a child a loved one or a pet in a car including if the window is cracked the car will get so hot uh that is actually where you get serious illness and death of both children and pets unfortunately is like oh i grocery store really quick i crack a window and leave you know bowser in the back seat please do not do that or with your child and the reason heat stroke is so deadly is because basically your thermoregulatory system that your brain and your skin communicating to one another to keep you cool that shuts down and you literally begin to heat up and cook your internal organs it is a medical emergency specifically heat stroke is when the body temperature exceeds 104 degrees fahrenheit or for those of you who do celsius that basically the combination of environmental heat exposure and collapse of the central nervous system to thermoregulate let exhaustion this can be a precursor to heat strokes heat exhaustion is actually more common in somebody who is doing prolonged exercise in the heat basically your muscles heat up and that heat exceeds what your body can dissipate through sweat evaporative water losses to cool the body the symptoms of heat exhaustion are going to include heavy sweating weakness you can have a headache the skin is cool pale and clammy this is important in distinguishing a heat exhaustion from heat stroke and you are excessively sweating uh you have weakness fatigue and heat exhaustion check the pulse because it of times the individual is going to be having muscle cramps nausea vomiting can occur sometimes if you check the temperature it exhaustion but what about heat stroke that actually two types of heat stroke you have exertional and non-exertional and they exertional heat stroke is what happens when you because again the muscles are contracting generating heat beyond what can be dissipated by your body thermoregulatory mechanisms of producing sweat evaporative water losses to cool the body and redistributing blood flow to to help keep the body cool and the precursor to that may be heat exhaustion then you have non-exertional heat stroke again exactly like it sounds this is going to be more common in somebody who is maybe chronically ill elderly or very young and this is going to be in a situation where you have extremes of temperature but there exercise precursor you know activity precursor as an exertional exertion is not necessary it what we you have extreme temperatures heat waves and people who are predisposed to heat stroke heat stroke has a very high risk of serious illness and death if not treated early it is a medical emergency features are a body temperature over 103 degrees super super hot in contrast to heat exhaustion where you had cold clammy skin and a lot of sweat production here you have dry hot skin and so the skin is no longer producing sweat and you feel very hot typically the skin is going to be very dry except in the case of exertional heat stroke which may have been preceded by heat exhaustion where you were making a lot of sweat then the skin may have may still be damp headache is common dizziness loss of consciousness in contrast to heat exhaustion where you had a weak pulse now you very fast throbbing pulse so those are the symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke but just to kind of recap with heat exhaustion you clammy damp skin whereas with heat stroke you although not always skin and with heat exhaustion you profusely whereas by the time you get to heat stroke you sweat and by definition with heat stroke the temperature is over 103 degrees at least whereas with heat exhaustion the temperature actually may be normal with heat exhaustion you very weak pulse whereas with heat stroke you pulse both are deadly can lead to death or significant injury to your internal organs so i hope this video was helpful in clarifying the signs and symptoms of heat related illness definitely check out my video on milli area otherwise known as heat rash i give tips on how to handle that as well but again to remind you having heat rash is a risk factor for later heat exhaustion and or heat stroke because of that impairment and the ability to cool the body through sweat production definitely be very mindful of your animals small pets especially are at great risk for death as it relates to heat especially if you have a dog with a flat face uh they not able to pant that themselves as well whatever you do please do not leave your pets in a car i don anybody in a car i cannot re-emphasize that enough be careful with exercising your pets too small dogs they can handle the heat and and especially the little dogs the cement asphalt sidewalks get incredibly hot we have the luxury of walking around with shoes pets do not and they that heat and their little bodies cannot handle it they can easily overheat so be very careful with your pets and you know you may have to just play fetch inside this is not safe for animals and again please i beg you do not leave a dog or cat or any animal or any child or any person in a car even if the window is cracked anyways you guys this video was meant for educational purposes uh heat injury is very common now with the record high temperatures all over not just in the us but it is an increasing only common cause of death and in the us it is the most common weather related cause of death so definitely something to be up to date on protecting your skin from the sun as always is key i hope this one was helpful if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe i bye

WHY YOUR SKIN COLOR CHANGES | Dermatologist @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl-9hwoLF2o	Dr Day	well hey guys have you ever wondered what causes skin color to change skin color is largely governed by the pigment melanin which is made in the skin by a specialized cell type called the melanocyte they make it and there are these little structures that they put it in called melanosomes and they little packets of pigment skin color is determined by the type of pigment that the melanocytes make as well as the size and distribution of those little pigment packets melanosomes there are two main types of pigment you melanin which is brown black and Theo melanin which is red yellow and it melanin to pheo melanin that governs your skin color now once melon and pigments are made in the melanocytes they then they make their way to the keratinocytes they and that pigment gets carried up to the top of the skin where you see it with your eyes now of course melanin pigment is not the sole determinant of skin tone and skin color other things influence it like blood flow inflammation which can cause leakage of blood into the skin and that breaks down giving the skin a brownish yellowish Hue you also have deposition of pigments from elsewhere things that maybe you ingest or things that you elect to introduce yourself like tattoo ink now that you have some basic understanding as to how it is that skin gets color you can begin to understand how it is that skin color changes let where your skin color changes Vitiligo Vitiligo is a condition where you lose pigment completely and patches why does this happen it happens because your immune system mounts an attack against the pigment producing cell the melanocyte in those areas where the immune system is rebelling against the melanocytes you are not able to make pigment therefore the skin loses its color and turns bone white in those areas this can involve just a few patches here and there or it can involve a more widespread area it makes it so that the melanocides they don properly in a given area of the skin Vitiligo can also impact those Melania sites that are responsible for your hair color so you can lose hair color not only on your scalp but also in your eyelashes your eyebrows other body sites then you have pityriasis Alba I have a whole video all about it it affects people who have atopic dermatitis AKA eczema but something about the inflammation of eczema can temporarily take away the pigment it starts out actually as like light pink scaly dry patches that then turn white and then eventually that scaliness kind of resolves with time once the eczema is under good control the skin color in those areas does come back so it cause for concern coming in at number three on my list of random things that cause skin color to change is something called HIPAA post-inflammatory pigmentary alteration that sounds like a mouthful maybe you have already heard of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation AKA dark spots left behind after something healed but you can also have post-inflammatory hypopigmentation okay light spots that are left behind so you can group these two issues together for whatever reason inflammation in the skin can make the melanocytes want to make more pigment or it can actually suppress pigment production so your skin May heal with a dark mark it may heal with a white Mark so long as the underlying inflammatory issue is under control that skin color can go back to your normal skin tone with time the longer the inflammatory issue has been going on the longer it will take to get your skin color to go back to your normal skin color so the key here is to treat the underlying issue early and make sure it is under good control you can also develop this if you scratches the skin a lot or if you someone who picks absent-mindedly which can often happen when people are under a lot of stress as a side note I have a whole video on skin picking disorder I highly suggest you check it out because I give a lot of tips there on how to stop picking your skin because post-inflammatory pigmentary alteration is one side effect of skin and picking number four is like hannification lycanification is actually not really a pigmentary issue but rather skin thickening but as the skin thickens it appears darker why might the skin thicken anything that chronically rubs at the skin whether that be chronic scratching chronic picking the skin will start to thicken in response to that you often see this in people who have atopic dermatitis because it is a very itchy skin condition they can scratch the scratching causes the skin to thicken and it appears dark and discolored now once the underlying issue is stopped or controlled namely the underlying cause of the friction whether it be scratching rubbing once that is under control and no longer an issue yes the lichenification can improve and go away and the background skin tone can return to normal the rate at which that occurs and the likelihood of that occurring will be influenced by how long the frictional process was going on because the skin is thickened and Air areas of electronification in introducing steroid medicines directly into those areas with an injection can sometimes really help them out quite a bit and also help cut down on the sensation of itch helping you to cut down on scratching behaviors we have newer medications that Target specific arms of the immune system that can really help patients out a lot who are dealing with skin conditions that are itchy and leading to lycanification number five on this random list is one we have talked about in a lot of videos and it is melasma melasma often occurs on the face but honestly it can really happen anywhere where you get sun exposure brown patches with what are referred to as angulated borders and this has to do with UV exposure upregulating pigment production but it also heavily influenced by hormones especially hormones that come from birth control pills or related to being pregnant definitely can drive melasma ultraviolet radiation from the Sun definitely makes melasma worse but we have have also come to learn that visible light from the sun makes melasma much worse so in addition to all of the melasma treatments we channel in the past sunscreen is imperative for protecting the skin from those UV rays but we have come to learn that sunscreens that are tinted with iron oxides may also offer some protection against the visible light that does Drive melasma especially in deeper skin tones speaking of sunscreen sun damage is a major reason for skin color changes that become more obvious as we get older now of course sun damage can lead to dark spots known as solar lentigos basically UV rays trigger populations of melanocytes to grow in number make more pigment and so you get brown spots those are called solar lenticos AKA sunspots UV rays From The Sun Also can damage the deeper layers of the skin this is called elastosis and it can give the skin a yellowed appearance idiopathic guttate hypo melanosis idiopathic is medical speak for we don know what causes it but it seems as though it of sun exposure idiopathic gut hate hypomelanosis you get these little droplets of hypopigmentation little white spots in areas where you received a lot of sun exposure the forearms the lower legs are common areas check out my video on white spots on the arms and legs I think it link it down below idiopathic guttate hypomalanosis we go into more detail there as to what it is poi keloderma of savant is another type of sun damage with a lot of characteristic color changes you have red brown patches you also have white spots and you have areas of hyperpigmentation all mixed together most common on the sides of the neck the upper chest it damage and then you have more end stage sun damage called dermatoporosis just like osteoporosis thinning of the bones you have dermatoporosis skin thinning related to cumulative sun exposure over your lifetime most obvious again on the forearms and one manifestation of that is something called stellate pseudo scars basically look like looks like did somebody come at you with a razor blade on your forearm you scar no it so fragile that it just spontaneously makes White Scar Tissue number seven is medications there are a ton of medications out there that actually can cause skin color changes I have a whole video I know I keep saying I have a whole video but otherwise we all day reiterating some of the same things I whole video on medications that change your skin color can change the color to black brown yellow check that out common medication that a lot of you may have been prescribed at some point that can lead to you discoloration in the skin the bones the eyes the inside of the mouth or really any organ system actually is minocycline this isn very common but it definitely occurs it monitored for so that the medication you know could be stopped or changed if any signs that this is occurring and there are a few different ways in which Minocycline can cause discoloration the first is a blue black discoloration in a pre-existing scars this most often is obvious in people who maybe have been taking Minocycline safer acne if they have acne scars the scars may start to turn blue black that is a adverse effect of Minocycline doesn common but it can the second is a blue gray discoloration that happens on the forearms and The Shins the third is a muddy Brown discoloration that happens in Sun exposed areas and the fourth uh not so common is a muddy Brown discoloration that happens in Prior scars not related to sun exposure though number eight on this random list is keratinoderma keratinoderma is a yellowish orange discoloration of the skin and primarily in people who have been taking in a lot of beta-carotene this comes from eating a lot of yellow orange fruits and vegetables like mango papaya squash pumpkin carrots or dairy products butter cheese milk it also can happen secondary to an underlying medical problem where maybe you have a problem metabolizing these foods like it can be seen in people who have hypothyroidism some people who have liver disease and it also can be seen in people who have diabetes it dangerous now if it underlying medical condition that needs to be addressed don develop this from eating a lot of carrots it permanent once you cut back on consuming those or eat less of them then the skin color can return to your Baseline skin tone keratino Derma is going to be a yellowish orange discoloration it tends to occur a lot on the nose the sides of the nose but also the palm homes and souls because these compounds these pigments they are secreted in your sebum so the oil when you have a lot of oil glands around your nose and sweat which you have a lot of sweat glands on your palms and Soles so that it and like artificial light or after you pretty common in babies because one of the first foods that is often introduced is like pureed carrots or squash or pumpkin so they can develop it temporarily it alarmed about and it goes away you know as they grow up and start eating other things and their bodies mature but if you beta-carotene rich foods you may develop it from time to time again it harmful the only situation where you know it related to an underlying medical condition like thyroid disease or diabetes number nine is tinea versicolor otherwise known as pityriasis Versa color now this is a very common skin condition that tends to you know flare up in the summer months when we sweating a lot it a yeast that naturally lives on everyone some people are more vulnerable to this than others it tends to be more common in tropical environments where you have a lot of humidity and sweat and what it does is this um little yeast your body amounts mounts a certain response to it that leads to a rash that leads to these brownish kind of rough scaly spots that heal with white spots so you have brown spots white spots sometimes you can have some pink spots in there it can itch but sometimes it doesn at all it chest your back you can happen on the sides of the neck I have a whole video actually recently on signs of too much yeast and this this is one where you get a little overgrowth of that that yeast causes this problem so check that video out because they give tips tricks strategies for managing it controlling it and preventing recurrences number 10 is vitamin B B12 deficiency vitamin B12 deficiency is sine of B12 deficiency is actually hyperpigmentation most common on the backs of the hands the backs of the feet like especially over the knuckles but also on the palms especially in the creases that definitely a sign of B12 deficiency which is nothing to play around with inadequate intake is one cause but you also have pernicious anemia and a variety of other underlying medical conditions that can lead to B12 deficiency check out my video on skin signs of B12 deficiency we go over a lot more of them in that one as well as you know causes and the like so check that one out in anything that goes wrong in your skin you can either blame genetics or your hormones hormones is actually a pretty broad category there are tons of different hormones but one hormonal condition that can cause your skin to change color is something called Addison hormone disease that specifically is is a problem with a part of your adrenal gland called the adrenal cortex where you can or cortisol aldosterone is essential for controlling the salt and fluid balance in your body so it for like your blood pressure and fluid balance and then of course cortisol is a stress hormone that is vital for pretty much every function in your body so it a serious disease most cases these days are caused by an autoimmune issue but historically uh tuberculosis is a major cause of Addison their skin turn tan they look inappropriately tan like have you been using the tanning bed but they also develop a lot of hyperpigmentation in the skin folds any areas where they have a lot of like skin friction a lot of pressure Addison life-threatening you can imagine if you don control your blood volume you know that cortisol you know that life-threatening so they have to be on um exogenous hormones for life to control that um so yeah that that underlying hormone disease that can be life-threatening Addison women are oftentimes also will lose Androgen dependent hair growth namely they pubic hair all right number 12 I need you guys to chime in in the comments if you have this because it common it reticulated papillomatosis these little brown spots that merge together into larger patches it happens on like the chest the back the neck under the arms and you know if you go on Google Google will tell you the internet will tell you that this is rare rare is relative because in dermatology it common I in my life it recognize for most dermatologists it actually probably a lot more common than is reported in fact you know if you went into a room and had everybody take off their shirt I guarantee you would find a lot of pieces of carp they just not diagnosed carp can also easily be misdiagnosed as tinea versicolor they look similar but in contrast to tinea versicolor carp is not likely related to malassezia yeast but rather a little bacteria detia papillomatosis for whatever reason this bacteria causes certain populations of skin cells to divide too much or proliferate and so you get this pattern of dark patches and this skin condition is not dangerous it bacteria seems to be responsible for it and it it to cause symptoms but it bothers people cosmetically the treatment for it is a course of oral antibiotics typically Minocycline and the Minocycline can clear it up but a lot of times it comes back and in many cases it will eventually burn out and go away on its own but some people deal with it on an ongoing basis for patients who struggle with it persisting and recurring for years and years and years it does become a bit of a balance because one of the most effective treatments like I said is a course of oral antibiotics Minocycline most commonly but also some other types of antibiotics but antibiotics you know they risk for um you know digestive problems with your gut microbiome they can have side effects one of which we talked about in this video Minocycline hyperpigmentation so it becomes a balance of exposing you to the risks of the medication versus like this condition which is you know sometimes just not going to be cured by the the antibiotic courses the antibiotic courses kind of clear it up temporarily and sometimes it lot of times it comes back so it becomes a you know an individualized Pursuit some cases actually can improve with a course of Accutane and other people get good results actually with topical retinoids to serotine but if you have a large surface area of carb that really practical all right y right there those are 12 random causes of skin color change by no means is this an exhaustive list so if you color change I don this as the end-all be-all list and feel like oh I must have one of these 12 things there are so many other skin conditions where you have skin color changes out there we have barely barely barely just skin the surface this is just a random mishmash that I pulled together for educational purposes only and you know to illustrate to you guys how complex skin is and hopefully to help you further understand that when it comes to skin issues it one-size-fits-all approach and the Skin Care industry you know it right there at the tip of the iceberg with things that Target dark spots but as you can see lurking beneath the surface there are so many different types of dark spots each with their own treatment path cause Etc some of which go away on their own so always keep that in mind and keep that in mind when somebody is chouting the benefits they received from a given skin product may not be because they have the same issue that you do and it may look similar but it may be totally different you know here in this video you saw two examples of skin discoloration one caused by yeast and one caused by a bacteria both of them look very similar treatments are going to be entirely different I hope you all enjoyed this video now on the end slate I put my recent video on how skin Works where we go over more about the different layers of the skin to give you a better understanding of skin biology so you know some of these terms like epidermis dermis keratinocyte differentiation that way you are better equipped to understand a big organ system your skin I hope you all enjoyed this video if so give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don I [Music] thank you [Music]	Success
SKIN SIGNS OF FOOD ALLERGIES ?? Dermatologist @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yhaHqOxgRo	Dr Day	well hey guys have you ever developed a rash or a skin problem and thought to yourself could this be a food allergy if so you today sharing with you these skin signs of food allergies food allergies happen when your immune system mistakenly thinks that a given protein in a food is somehow a threat and it reacts to it anytime you eat that food almost any food can cause an allergic reaction but some foods are responsible for most food allergies and young children the most common food allergies are going to be milk eggs peanuts tree nuts fish and shellfish whereas for adults food allergies most commonly are to peanuts tree nuts certain fruits like apples and peaches fish and shellfish now of course anyone can develop a food allergy but food allergies are a lot more common in people who have atopic dermatitis which commonly goes by the name eczema um people who have hay fever and or asthma there are three main types of food allergies number one IG mediated food allergies IG stands for imunoglobulin E it makes in response to an allergen in a given food that you are allergic to these types of food allergies are the most common and importantly the symptoms present within seconds to minutes of you ingesting the food of all the three types of food allergies this type is the one that um can be associated with life-threatening allergic reactions otherwise known as anaphylaxis the other type of food allergy is non-ig mediated now as the name implies it does not involve IG instead it involves other cells in your immune system and in contrast to ig mediated food allergies this one can take a little bit longer for the symptoms to arise after you have eaten something even more confusing is the third type of food allergy mixed IG and non-ig you can basically have overlap between the two for IG mediated food allergies within seconds to minutes of eating the food that you are allergic to you you your mouth your tongue and you might develop ticaria that for hives now I have videos all about hives hives there are a lot of different causes for hives not every Hive is due to a food allergy but in some cases food allergies can trigger hives hives present as these red swellings they very very itchy importantly though with hives you each Hive only lasts a few seconds to minutes no more than a few hours you can go on to develop more hives Elsewhere on the body and you become very itchy as you start scratching this can elicit the appearance of more hives the cells of the immune system are all rubbed up they mediators that lead to vasod dilation of the blood vessels bring in a lot of fluid you get these localized swellings known as hives some cases you can develop swelling of the lips the tongue the throat you can develop something known as angioedema profound swelling of the lips the tongue and the face angio EMA is profound swelling of the face the lips the tongue the back of the throat can be associated with shortness of breath wheezing I mediated food allergies they can cause a lot of abdominal pain stomach pain and diarrhea you might also have sneezing itchy watery eyes but as I mentioned IG mediated food allergies can lead to the life-threatening allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis anaphylaxis will start out with many of the symptoms I just outlined but very very quickly things take a sharp turn for the worst difficulty breathing the heart rate goes up you have a sensation of impending doom your blood pressure drops you can lose Consciousness it is life-threatening another constellation of symptoms that is sort of a variant of IG mediated food allergy is something known as the oral allergy syndrome basically the person is allergic to pollin but the immune system gets a little confused there proteins in certain foods that look like the pollen allergens and so when you ingest these Foods you get tingling itching in the mouth the tongue the oral allergy symptoms do not uh end up leading to anaphylaxis oral allergy syndrome though is interesting because it nuts but when you cook the fruits or nuts it denatures the pollen like allergen that your immune system is confused by and you have no problem with it yeah let me know in the comments if you ever get like an itchy mouth eating raw nuts but if you eat those nuts baked in something you have no problem no skin rashes with that one but you can have some swelling of your lips I want to tell you a story of a really interesting subtype of IG food allergy it alag gal syndrome Alpha gal sounds like like a boss babe Alpha gal is a sugar found on the cells of many mammals so this allergen is found in pork be be venison rabbits um it gelatin because that comes from uh pork or beef and it products so people who have Alpha gal syndrome they have to avoid avoid any foods with Maman derivatives likewise you you know have to be very careful of sauces that are cooked in animal fat it classical IG mediated food allergies these folks don hives itching watery eyes uh within seconds to minutes of eating meat it actually takes several hours but it is an IG mediated food allergy here it gets even weirder this food allergy is actually not triggered initially by eating meat it tick bite a tick bite sensitizes you to this Alpha gal Alpha gal I laugh whenever I say that Alpha gal sugar that is present in many mammals um and thereafter you are you know pretty significantly allergic the offending tick is most often the lone star tick although other ticks possibly can trigger this so people who have this they they they can eat reptiles they just can eat Maman stuff all right but yeah many of the same symptoms shortess of breath wheezing hives itchy watery eyes potential to go on to anaphylaxis moving on to the signs of non-ig mediated food allergies these are a little different and again they take several hours to develop sometimes even days after eating the food that you are allergic to and the rashes are more non-specific they tend to be red itchy they can look like eczema they tend to get dry thickened and cracked you can have symptoms of heartb burn indigestion but in contrast to ig mediated food allergies there typically no diarrhea with this type of food allergy you actually can develop um bright redness around the anus and in the genital area in some cases you can develop even blood in your stools now with the mixed IG and non-ig mediated food allergy you can have some overlap in the different symptoms that we just alligned what foods are the culprits now as I mentioned in the beginning of the video when it comes to the IG mediated food allergies the most common in children at least are going to be peanuts milk eggs tree nuts fish and shellfish whereas for adults the most common IG mediated food allergies are peanuts tree nuts fruits shellfish and fish but there are a lot of different other things out there that can cause the non-ig mediated food allergy symptoms herbs and spices turmeric and the kumin compound into turmeric specifically you can develop an allergy to that and you can end up with itchy rashes around the mouth a culprit for non-ig mediated food allergies is going to be food additives and food dyes Carmine which is added to meat to prevent it from oxidizing to keep it that bright red color some people are allergic to that aado which is something that is added to butter and cheese to give it that bright yellow look anado is also added to lipsticks so some people may have allergic actions to their lipsticks tartrazine another food additive and cocal red which is a Dye then of course you have preservatives in Foods some people have non-ig mediated allergies to like mutilated hydroxy anisol of course a lot of people have allergic reactions to sulfites sulfites are added to prevent Browning they found in dried fruits wine molasses pickled foods vinegars a while back I did a video on Foods causing facial faal redness and you video that a compound in several types of foods and spices is called cinam Malahide cinam Malahide can bring about uh vasod dilation and potentially can trigger hives for some people or if anything flushing and facial redness some foods have a high cinam alahh content including well cinnamon certain spices like cloves tomatoes and chocolate unfortunately yeah the cinam alahh activates something called trp V channels and that blood vessel dilation and redness we can allergies without a talk on histamine containing foods I get a lot of questions about this actually now this isn but rather a pseudo allergen the most classic example of this is actually quote unquote histamine poisoning um and this happens because some fish especially tuna mael they have something called histadine and if those fish spoil bacteria break down the histadine into histamine and you can get uh when if you eat spoiled fish basically you can get something called scoid poisoning basically from that Mega dose of histamine you do you get a bright red rash on your face your chest your upper back burning mouth pounding headache your heart rate goes up your blood pressure can go down you feel like misery um this doesn anaphylaxis but the treatment for this is anti-histamines and it tends to resolve within you know a couple of hours fortunately but it miserable for people it poisoning so that extreme case of taking of ingesting a lot of histamine histamine is not an allergen but it up a lot of the symptoms of of of itching and and hives some people are just very sensitive to histamine in Foods as well so other foods that are potentially high in histamine are fermented foods because the bacteria break down histadine these include aged cheeses dry sausages and like fermented soybean nutto some plant foods have a high histamine content eggplant tomato avocado and spinach the amount of histamine is going to be very variable uh you know depending on the season and you know where was cultivated and all of those kinds of things but all that to say some people are really sensitive to histamine in foods and it can lead to skin rashes itching and symptoms of you know an allergic reaction let me know in the comments if you are sensitive to histamine so how do you go about figuring out if you have a food allergy these are the symptoms that we covered in today diagnosed you need to see your health care provider this is not something that you can diagnose yourself when you see your doctor they know how long after eating the Su suspected food was it that you developed the symptoms how severe were the symptoms have you ever had these symptoms in the past or is this the first time that this has ever happened how much food did you actually eat when these symptoms came about is there a family history of food allergies do you have eczema do you have asthma do you have seasonal allergies these are some of the questions that you want to be prepared to answer if you suspect that you have an allergy to a food then there are some different types of tests that can be done to determine if you are allergic to a food namely skin prick testing which is going to test for those IG antibi IES or they may order a blood test to look for those now those tests they they have their flaws and sometimes they identify a lot of stuff that you even allergic to so it those be done by you know an allergist who knows how to interpret them and taking into account your history and you know really understanding if it actually a relevant allergen to you just because you react to something on an allergy test it doesn actually relevant once the allergy is identified well then you know the treatment is avoidance in the throws of of of hives check out my video on tips for hives I go over some things to keep in mind to keep the hives from getting worse things like cool compresses putting your clothing on gently um cool moisturizers I give a lot of tips in that video um the treatment for for flares of hives and these allergic symptoms by and large is going to be antihistamines for serious allergic reactions like worsening shortness of breath increased heart rate dropping your blood pressure concerning for anaphylaxis that emergency um they treat you with medications to control your blood pressure and get all of that under control and if you have a history of those more serious allergic reactions you EpiPen an epinephrine auto injector in case you are ever again uh exposed to that allergen you can you can give yourself that epinephrine shot to protect you from developing anaphylaxis now if you have a life-threatening allergic reaction anapilis you are going to be given um a an EpiPen and that the brand name they go by a few other names basically a shot of epinephrine um that you would administer if you exposed to you know something that you were allergic to food allergies in young children a lot of them grow out of them with time but I want to along with the treatment though I really want to emphasize how important it is to see a healthcare provider you know especially with young children I think a lot of parents get very stressed out and they think oh this might be a food allergy and they try and start making all these adjustments in their diet and I caution against that don Extreme Elimination diets especially in a young child elimination diets in a young child can have serious consequences to their growth and development so I don that definitely see your child pediatrician you know if necessary a short trial of an elimination of a suspected food allergen may be recommended um but I wouldn cutting stuff out without you know talking to them being evaluated properly because like I I said there it very sad there are a lot of case reports out there of you know children who developed profound nutritional deficiencies because they were put on these um you know elimination diets which were not only unnecessary but you know obviously harmful to them you know it atopic dermatitis as I mentioned at the beginning of the video a lot of you know people who have at topic dermatitis eczema they are at an increased risk for food allergies but the food allergies are not necessarily what eczema the eczema the skin problem yes that you know if they have a true food allergy and they can develop these symptoms of hives and things but it not you know they own separate Towers living in one neighborhood if you will so they hear you know they hear oh eczema higher risk of food allergies and they say oh maybe there eczema wors and they try and eliminate things and that can lead you down a dangerous path in many cases um likewise you know hives as I mentioned at the beginning of the video hives is a big category of different there are a lot of different types of hives many different causes of hives food allergy is not really a very common one um so you definitely would want to see a health care provider um for evaluation of your hives otherwise known as ticaria uh ticaria can be triggered by like having a cold or a flu it can reflect an underlying thyroid problem some foods actually can just make hives worse but they example alcohol uh can make hives worse or consuming hot liquids but those foods are not actually the root cause of the hives in a lot of cases um so just keep that in mind that you there are a lot of potential causes for hives not just food allergies anyway y you guys y videos on you know skin signs of X Y and Z on the ulate I recent video on these skin signs that your cortisol is too high so definitely check that one out next if you missed it but if you enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe I bye [Music]	Success
Warning Signs Of Gout NOT TO MISS	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zASiA8DxNH0	Dr Day	well guys welcome back to part I don know 67 in the uh you said it you said it I see you there in the front raising your hand already ready to interject with the tagline cuz I know you know all right you are you student and go ahead and say it for the class the skin the skin is a window to what is going on internally and because of that people are often surprised to learn that dermatologists overlap and work with a lot of other types of doctors very commonly we end up being in cahoots with those doctors that address all things autoimmune and Joint related AKA rheumatologist and one condition where we often come together to help out is gout so if you gout this is the video for you or if you your family has gout you need to watch this video okay because having someone in your family with gout that is a blood relative that means there chance that you might might deal with gout in the future what the heck is gout anyways sounds like one of those ancient things that you only hear about when you go to the art museum or when you are I don literature but oh no no no no gout is Al live and well what is gout gout is a problem where you have too much uric acid and the uric acid gets so high that it forms monosodium urate crystals that deposit in your joints in your subcutaneous tissues and also your kidneys okay and that deposition occurs in different attacks because gouty crystals deposit in your kidneys it can really wreck your kidneys cause kidney failure not a good thing and can lead to the formation of these lumps and bumps in your skin why does it attack your kidneys well for healthy people normally we excrete uric acid through our kidneys okay into our urine boom that when you have too much those crystals form and they deposit in the kidneys as well as the joints and cause damage why might your uric acid be so high well like most things that cause issue in our lives always always always always blame your parents duh if you have a parent who has gout there might get it too not everyone that case but hey if you know mom or dad or your uncle or whatever had gout just start pointing fingers at them they are likely to blame excess uric acid in the blood usually is precipitated secondarily to some sort of event some sort of thing that went on that caused your uric acid levels to increase usually it related for example diets high in U animal protein are wellestablished triggers of a gout attack and are problematic for gout specifically red meat and seafood also if you drink alcoholic beverages beer wine spirits moderately or at high levels that can trigger a flare of gout high intake of refined sugary food sweetened with that high fructose corn syrup or fruit juices which are high and fructose sugar Having excess adapost tissue being overweight having obesity also certain medications like diuretics aspirin cyclosporin increase the risk of gout if you have kidney disease to begin with your kidneys don efficiently you can get the formation of these crystals and attacks of gout then the body can overproduce Uric acids secondary to conditions of increased cell proliferation namely what are known as myo proliferative disorders basically the bone marrow is cranking out blood cells at an abnormally high level and that can result in increases in uric acid also some people have anemias that cause the cells to blow up it hemolytic anemia the cells lice bill out their contents and that can cause high levels of uric acid and gout aside from these precipitating factors and of course genetics family history there also is going to be a component of it related to your age now men are more likely to deal with gout the thing about gout is that the uric acid levels they have already been high for some time it elevated about 20 years before you have a gouty attack so in males gout levels increase at the time of puberty and Men usually experience their first attack of gout in their 40s women on the other hand we have it a little easy because the estrogen hormone protects us from gout however with menopause and the decline in estrogen we lose that protection and women often experienced their first gout attack in like their 60s or do these crystals come out of the sky and beat you over the head with a sledgehammer well that feels like but that happens when uric acid crystals form you get an acutely painful swollen RedHot joint often times it like maybe a joint in your foot or your finger but in some cases it involves multiple joints the first attack often feels the most brutal if you those people who refuses to go to the doctor when you feel unwell okay the attack untreated will last usually around 7 to 10 days now after the first attack you might be able to buy yourself some time you might only experience another attack maybe several months later in a situation where you have perhaps overindulged in alcohol or red meat or seafood or maybe you dehydrated you took a medication some sort of inciting event but if you continue to not go to the doctor go untreated you will have more frequent attacks of the gout and it can really be debilitating and again th those uric acid crystals can deposit in your kidneys and destroy them untreated gout attacks will become more frequent over time they will last a longer amount of time and more joints will be involved so all this talk about joints obviously that involves the joint doctors the rheumatologist but but guess who um often might Identify some gouty related skin issues the skin doctors your dermatologist so monosodium murate crystals can also deposit in the skin and you can get these nodules that deposit in the skin full of the crystals these are known as gouty tofi often like on the finger and the ear are common sights or can happen over the elbow joint as well gouty tofi may also pop up over the joints of the feet these nodules are full of this white chalky material and as the noil is enlarge the chalky material can break through the skin and oo the spot is squeezed you can extrude some of this material it kind of looks a bit like dried toothpaste tophaceous gal over time will destroy the joints kind of invades the um tendons around the joints and can be very destructive and lead to permanent disability frequent gouty attacks also can lead to the development of what is known as a panniculitis panniculitis is fancy medical speak for inflammation in the Deep Fat compartments this results in the formation of these lumps usually on the lower legs that contain the monosodium urate crystals over time can break through the skin and ooze fluid that contains the crystals untreated gout is no joke not only is it painful not only is it uncomfortable but it is destructive these toei lead to skin problems of the affected area they destroy the joints and again you can develop full-blown inflammation in the fatty compartment so treatment is a must how is it diagnosed well your rheumatologist might insert a needle into an affected joint aspirate some fluid and look at that under the microscope for the little crystals but in the case of tophaceous gout the TPI you know they may be biopsi looked at under the microscope and boom you have the diagnosis made by your dermatologist how is gout treated the approach to treating gout in a simple overview involves treating first the attack then managing it so that you lower the Uric acid levels and keep them low and then of course treatments to prevent recurrences and there are a lot of different medications that can help treat and control gout I get into all of those treatments but I will say there are many lifestyle factors that you would want to implement and be careful of avoiding certain things if you do deal with gout so as to avoid while destroying your kidneys first of all you want to be more moderate with your animal protein consumption animal protein is a common trigger for gout so back off on the red meat and the seafood also organ Meats in particular are very problematic for gout I would just avoid organ Meats alog together if I had gout you also want to avoid sugar sweetened sodas and Juice because that is a fructose load that will precipitate gout low to no alcoholic beverage consumption if I had gout I would not drink any alcohol the other Foods you have to be careful of are different yeast extracts like if you consume nutritional yeast if you have excess adapost tissue you have obesity weight management weight management definitely can help lower uric acid levels and reduce recurrences now if your gout is related to a medication that you might be taking say for high blood pressure a diuretic you need to check in with your doctor and figure out there another option out there because that medication is just not worth the gouty attacks because again they and take do a number on your kidneys which you know you you only have two and you don to destroy destroy them because that no good along those lines be really careful of your hydration status try and make sure that you take measures to stay hydrated for example if you get sick you get a flu you get a illness gastrointestinal illness it really important that you make sure to stay on top of getting plenty of fluid intake because when you may become a little dehydrated that can precipitate Crystal formation and a gouty flare up all right guys that what I wanted to talk about in today video I know it was scintillating mindboggling and maybe this is the first time you have ever heard that you can have a picul litis well you want to check out my last video which I about athema no doome those painful tender nodules on the lower legs why does that happen watch next but if you guys like this one give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don I [Music]	Success
Discover The Root Causes Of Geographic Tongue!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRXcbptD7S8	Dr Day	today 3% of you out there who have geographic tongue otherwise known as benign migratory glossitis this is a condition involving your tongue where you have these red smooth patches in a map-like configuration it comes and goes and the patches tend to move around on the tongue why do you have it and is it a sign of something sinister going on internally listen before you go running to Google to terrify yourself if this is the first time you called benign meaning it now why you have it good question we don this appears to be a lot more common in women than men while it can occur in children it primarily affects adults there because it that someone else in your family has it so you can blame your family there also a strong association with having geographic tongue and a variety of inflammatory conditions especially psoriasis in fact many people with psoriasis will exhibit geographic tongue before they even notice skin psoriasis or joint symptoms there however with bouts of geographic tongue and flares of psoriasis they don and go together there association with having geographic tongue and what are called inflammatory bowel diseases namely ulcerative colitis and Crohn can lead to things going on in your mouth and your lips in a variety of different ways and geographic tongue is just one of these ways several people with geographic tongue have a tendency to have conditions that are allergic in nature such as seasonal allergies hay fever allergic rinitis asthma atopic dermatitis some people even have certain food allergies although geographic tongue is not a sign of a food allergy and again consumption or exposure to the food allergen does not necessarily trigger a bout of geographic tongue but they do seem to go together certain medications also can trigger bouts of geographic tongue namely lithium a medication used to treat bipolar disorder as well as certain medications used to treat high blood pressure oral contraceptive pills may also be a trigger for geographic tongue in some people for the most part geographic tongue doesn terms of symptoms they don notice it unless someone points it out or they happen to look in the mirror however it can burn and sting what going on with the tongue when you have a b of geographic tongue well the working theory is that there inflammatory response going on and that inflammatory milu negatively impacts the normal turnover and maturation processes of the cells comprising the the tongue the keratinocytes these are the same types of cells that comprise your epidermis just think of your skin when the epidermal turnover processes are a little screwy maybe because the skin has become dry you get patches of dry rough skin texture or you may get little rough bumps around the hair follicles or you may get pore clogging and lead to acne breakouts well those normal turnover processes that occur in the epidermis they likewise have to happen on your tongue and certain things may be messing up that normal turnover and maturation rate and that to the development of these red smooth patches and a map-like configuration on the tongue and some people again have symptoms of tongue sensitivity almost like with certain skin conditions you also can have a heightened sensitivity to things that come in contact say with your face like certain moisturizers burn and sting same thing can be going on with your tongue now for patients who deal with bouts of geographic tongue it provider especially when you are in the midst of a about a bit to have it evaluated because there are other conditions that happen on the tongue that kind of looks similar for example thrush which is just a common name for a candidal infection on the tongue also a condition known as ly and planus can create a lacy like pattern on the tongue and sensitivity discomfort as a side note I have a video All About lyan plainness check that out with certain nutritional deficiencies you can develop a smooth swollen inflamed tongue that known as atrophic glossitis and initially that might look a little bit like geographic tongue so as always don deal with geographic tongue what can you do about it like is there anything that you can do to maybe control it especially if you have symptoms of like burning and stinging well your doctor can prescribe some things to help alleviate the discomfort a topical anesthetic can be prescribed that you swish around in your mouth to sort of numb the tongue and alleviate some of that dis Comfort there inflammatory component going on that drives this a lot of patients see success if they are given a prescription for something called tacus tacus is an immunosuppressant when a patient has an inflammatory condition of the tongue or in the mouth one thing that can be beneficial is to take a pill of tacus dissolve it in water swish that around in your mouth like a mouthwash spit it out it medication in the mouth surfaces calm down the inflammation and get you some relief we use that to treat other inflammatory conditions in the mouth like ly imp planus which can definitely be very painful I suggest aggressive oral hygiene regular flossing and brushing your teeth and I know you thinking but this is my tongue yeah but your whole mouth can Harbor bacteria and things that create an environment of inflammation that is pro-inflammatory in a negative way that impact the differentiation and maturation of the cells that make up your tongue so regular flossing to keep the gums healthy the spaces between your teeth clean brushing your teeth can all be super beneficial for just helping cut down on bacteria in the mouth that might aggravate this regular visits to the dentist of course for your routine dental cleaning don when it comes to oral hygiene the devil is in the details because the toothpaste the mouth es that you choose might actually be aggravating uh I always suggest to people whether it be for this or anything going on in the mouth consider a trial of a kids make sure it has fluoride for cavity prevention but kids toothpaste tend to have gentler flavors mint cinnamon spearmint peppermint winter green these can be very irritating in the mouth um cinnamon for example has cinam alahh causes o dilation can bring in a lot of inflammation activate something called trpv1 channels bring in specific aspects of inflammation that can aggravate this for you the other thing about some of the kids toothpaste I have found is that they don much of the detergents the foaming ingredients that help distribute the toothpaste around but also can be very irritating in the mouth uh so that another reason to consider choosing the kids toothpaste you also need to be careful of your dental floss though choose a dental floss that is not flavored a lot of them are you might consider getting a water flosser as well that may help with the gum health and cut down on problematic bacteria in the mouth aside from oral hygiene you might need to be careful with what types of snacks Foods Etc you choose and beverages because certain spices can aggravate this mint again cinnamon I always warn people who have this or get canker sores or have oral like and plainness I warn them about Doritos I just use Doritos as a common name example but really there are a ton of different snack foods like Doritos that have this feature in common I that aggressive flavor coating which is delicious all right but it really can be tough on your mouth and of course those types of snack foods often have sharp edges that you know can leave your mouth just feeling raw if you eat them regularly or you maybe eat a little bit too much they can really tear up the inside of your mouth certain cereals Captain Crunch intense flavors rough surfaces that can be hard it say you have to eat completely mushy soft foods but these kind of snack foods that are like very very very flavor intense and sharp you might want to avoid also chewing gum it can be a blessing and a curse chewing gum is helpful chewing sugar-free gum with Xylitol in it as a sweetener and yes I know that that can be helpful for the bacteria you know cutting down on bacteria and your teeth reducing plaque but certain flavors might actually aggravate the symptoms in your mouth if you have burning and stinging so be aware of that like the bubble gum flavor is probably the safest cinnamon mint that can be aggravating also certain candies you want to be careful of like pop rocks probably not a good idea if you have migratory glossitis or or you have anything in your mouth any kind of oral mucosal condition cuz it can just be very aggravating water everyone on social media likes to tell anyone with a skin problem just drink more water right but drinking water is very good for your teeth plain water it oral hygiene it cuts down on mouth dryness and it also just helps to move things along and prevent tooth decay it can be very helpful for reducing tooth decay to just drink regular water don drink sodas juices things like that but if you have geographic tongue and it doesn any symptoms you can just be like your little personal Quirk you don necessarily have to do anything although of course I do suggest everyone to have good oral hygiene but you don necessarily need to modify things but if you you know you are actually uncomfortable I would suggest doing some of these things or trying some of them out seeing if they help anyways guys I hope this video was was informative to those of you out there who have geographic tongue it not super common but I know a lot of people have it now like I said it can look like several other things uh so on the Insight I videos on a white tongue and I go over different things that can be going on on your tongue many of which look like Geographic tongu so check that one out next if you missed it but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen And subscribe I to you guys tomorrow bye [Music]	Success
Signs Of Tuberculosis NOT TO MISS (Skin)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVfvBB3RwYU	Dr Day	what in the Tolstoy works of classic literature is going on right now we are currently experiencing here in the US one of the largest outbreaks of tuberculosis in Kansas City yeah you heard it tuberculosis that disease that you read about in classic literature where they got the consumption because it literally is as if you have been consumed from within by this infection it was once the leading cause of death in the United States in the early 20th century referred to as the white plague because people were so sick with this they become very pale and hence the name the white plague fortunately through the advancement of medicine we were able to make tuberculosis pretty uncommon we still have outbreaks from time to time it here we have this large outbreak in Kansas City and it is a highly searched topic right now because people are freaking out tuberculosis is caused by a bacteria called micob bacterium people who have symptoms of tuberculosis can release bacteria when they talk or cough it is highly contagious if the person has symptoms now tuberculosis infection can happen in one of two ways the active infection which is what you read about in books right fever night sweats weight loss being really ill with consumption coughing up blood but then there latent form where the bacteria remains dormant in your body hibernating you don fine and I know what you wait a minute wait a minute pause pause the minivan there because what are you doing you a pulmonologist you infectious disease what are you doing coming on here talking about tuberculosis well ladies and gentlemen those of you who tune in to the vids on a regular basis you already know the line cuz I for over 8 years and what is the line what is the line the skin is a window to what is going on internally and you guessed it tuberculosis the consumption can impact the skin there are skin signs there are warning signs that you tuberculosis and that to talk about today so tuberculosis can impact the skin by one of three ways first is the bacteria can actually be directly inoculated into your skin through a cut skin injury a procedure that you tuberculosis spread throughout your bloodstream and creep on out to the skin in a disseminated fashion third you can have extension of tuberculosis from a underlying lymph node or bone where the tuberculosis is brewing it just extends all the way through breaks right through to the skin who is at risk for getting tuberculosis is it something that you just going to pick up walking the dog outside or watching Netflix on the couch probably not people who are at risk are those who live in close contact with someone with active tuberculosis not Laten active like they releasing the bacteria especially if you Happ to live like in close quarters maybe in a nursing home a health care facility a dorm Barracks that situation where tuberculosis outbreak can be more of a pressing issue if there people who work in healthcare people who work in healthcare are more likely to be exposed tuberculosis isn in the United States anymore but it is still a really active ongoing issue in many other countries so if you visit those countries and you somebody who has active disease you at risk while tuberculosis is very contagious not everyone who is exposed to someone who has symptoms will actually get tuberculosis it that part of why you might get it has to do with guess what guess what you can blame all of life you don that goes wrong with your body just point your finger to Mom and Dad your genetics likely play a role and whether or not you experience full-blown active tuberculosis all right getting into the skin signs there are a variety of different skin bumps lumps Etc that happen or can happen should say with tuberculosis and a big factor in how the skin responds or if it responds at all has a lot to do with your immune system and if you have ever been exposed to tuberculosis before for example a lot of people in countries where tuberculosis is an ongoing problem may have received the BCG vaccine so their immune system is going to respond a lot more aggressively to the presence of the bacteria people who have a really weak fragile immune system they have underlying immunosuppression or people who take medications that suppress or alter their immune responses for example medications known as biologics that alter certain arms of the immune system for many of these medications your doctor will check to make sure you don have latent tuberculosis incubating in your body because going on one of these medications could cause it to wake up and for you to have a full-blown active infection let cutaneous tuberculosis getting inoculated into the skin through skin injury trauma procedures piercings tattoos micro needling resurfacing laser or trauma anything that punctures the skin as that opportunity most commonly going to happen on the face the hands and the legs and you develop what called a tuberculous Shanker this bump appears anywhere from 1 to 4 weeks after it was introduced into your skin so it doesn the day after you got a penetrating injury it starts out as a painless raised bump and then eventually develops into an ulcer that is not symptomatic not tender the ulcer is very shallow and the edges are undermined you might actually have a multiple going up a path following along lymphatic drainage along with a swollen lymph node that pattern of spread is known as sporo troid and there are a lot of things that can do that this is one example now if somebody who has been exposed to tuberculosis before has had had the BCG vaccine they may respond differently to inoculation of the bacteria into the skin with something known as lupus vulgaris now to be clear it it autoimmune disease lupus systemic lupus emosis and lupus vulgaris not the same thing as a syone I have a video all about the skin signs of systemic lupus emosis check that out but to be clear we call a lot of different things lupus that are totally different from them lupus vulgar is a form of cutaneous tuberculosis that is basically a reinoculation into the skin so their immune system reacts a little bit differently than just a bump that ulcerates they get this sort of infiltrated plaque that starts out small and slowly over time enlarges lupus vulgaris typically will heal with a scar in one area and then become active in an adjacent area so it evolving and as you can imagine it because it quite disfiguring this is something that in areas of the world where tuberculosis is more common you might see cases of this especially in young children often on the lower extremities like the thigh the lower leg and the gluoy tuberculosis or a prector wart named because Pathologists doing autopsies may have developed these by doing the autopsies and being exposed to tuberculosis bacteria through the autopsies so that wart it looks like this warty mass and it is inoculation of the bacteria into the skin of someone who has been exposed to the bacterial infection before this presentation is going to happen in someone who has really good immunity against the bacteria most common going to be on the hands it also can happen on the knees the elbows the feet then you have the or official presentation or official as in around orifices the orificial presentation is secondary to having Advanced disease like you with this and the bacteria is extending into the mucocutaneous Junctions like around the mouth around the nose around the eyes then you have what to as milary tuberculosis milary because it looks like little bumps all over the skin in a disseminated fashion about the size of a millet grain if you seen millets kind of small and you have these like firm reddish pink brown little tiny bumps that can ulcerate this happens as a result of hematogenous meaning from the blood spread you are really ill with tuberculosis you feel really sick and it is a very poor prognosis if not treated you likely can go on to die if you have this presentation a more focal version of that hematogenous spread from the the blood up to the skin is a tuberculosis abscess can form as well like a boil that causes the overlying skin to break down you can have the formation of a sinus tract aishi you guessed it it can kind of look like hydradenitis supera now if you have HS don think you have tuberculosis these are all really rare but given that we the midst of one of the larger outbreaks we have seen in the US it worth knowing about and talking about then you have scrofula Derma this is tuberculosis that gets into the skin via extension from an underlying sort of nidus of tuberculosis like a lymph node commonly or bone this occurs in association with pulmonary tuberculosis like if you happening it alates interesting thing about this presentation is that it actually might heal in some rare cases by itself without any treatment all right y tuberculosis caused by a bacteria it sneaky little specimen we have antibiotics that treat it it involved treatment protocol and again it kind of depends on what you have going on worth knowing about in the setting of this large outbreak and also worth knowing about because as I everything is what you think it is there are certain lumps and bumps that you might believe are X Y and Z but there a whole host of other possible things that it can be and while this is not like a super common thing all right you somebody on Tik Tok selling a serum that happen it does happen and and knowing about it is half the battle all right y be common but is popping up and we seeing more and more of it is Measles yes measles uh can be quite deadly and we so on the ins slate I video all about the rash of measles its presentation the timeline of events not to miss so check that one out next if you missed it but if you guys like this video give it a thumbs up share it

Signs Of Scleroderma NOT TO MISS	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3fnD8eBcPo	Dr Day	so after my recent video on signs of lupus I got a number of requests please talk about Scleroderma so that this video is about what exactly is Scleroderma it in which basically you overproduce collagen you guys are aware of collagen in our skin in fact most of us are seeking ways to increase collagen production because normally it declines with age and that wrinkles and the visible signs of skin aging or part of part of what leads to that but with Scleroderma you overproduce collagen to a point where it leads to areas of hard thickened skin and not only the skin but it can affect internal organs your joints and depending on the type of Scleroderma you have it can be more life-threatening whereas other types remain more localized to affect certain areas so what are some signs of Scleroderma well it systemic Scleroderma and there localized Scleroderma so localized Scleroderma as it implies remains localized to confined areas and within localized Scleroderma there are also different types of localized Scleroderma one that I know a lot of you guys have because you morphia with morphia you have one or more patches of thickened skin and initially it can kind of have a violet appearance especially at the edge of it it be comfortable then you have generalized morphia where you have multiple patches with generalized morphia you have multiple patches on different areas of the body these patches can come together into two larger areas and it can extend to the deeper um parts of the skin then there is a linear variant linear variants present while in a line and they can often be a line of kind of thickened skin where you have loss of some of the tissues can happen on the legs it can happen on the head and neck um on the face there variant named Inu disa where it involves the forehead and the face and the scalp and the tissues can be lost and you can get some disfigurement as a result so that systemic with systemic Scleroderma that implies that um it internal organs within systemic Scleroderma you also have two different variant you have limited systemic Scleroderma meaning it localized and appears as thickening of the skin usually below the elbows and the knees but also can involve the head and neck but then you can have hardening of internal organ systems such as the digestive tract and the kidneys with limited Scleroderma patients often have involvement of their fingertips they develop these little sores and a notably they can develop little hard calcium deposits then you have the diffused systemic variant where where you have more generalized involvement of thickening of the skin and involvement of internal organs usually over weeks to months you get hard thickened skin over multiple areas it can become so involved that you develop immobility in the joints such as the hands the jaw and this variant generally involves one or more internal organs such as the lungs the kidneys these areas of hard thicken skin they feel well thick kind of appear waxy and they almost feel as if they anchored to the tissues underneath within the affected areas of skin thickening you often have loss of hair and because of the increased deposition of collagen in those affected areas of the skin it starts to compromise the efficacy of the echine sweat gland so sweat is necessary to cool the body so you can have areas of what anhidrosis No Sweat production these areas can also become very dry and patients often times have a lot of it associated with this there can be overlying skin color changes it dark hyperpigmented and as I said when it is in its active advancing stage you may see this sort of purplish Violet border a lot of patients with systemic sclerosis develop a salt and pepper appearance to the skin on their upper back the chest and also in the scalp along the hairline if you develop this this is a really important warning sign of systemic sclerosis and important to be evalu valuated by your healthcare provider like I said it can involve the joints to such an extent that they become stiff immobile have difficulty using your hands and also um unable to open the mouth very wide a lot of patients who have varant of Scleroderma develop almost kind of a mask-like appearance to their face again they have a lot of collagen deposition in the skin so it Scleroderma can affect uh children and adult Ence and depending on the variant if it extends down deep to the muscles the tissues well it can impact U bone growth so for example very rarely they may have um a problem with the development of say a leg or it can lead to muscle atrophy and again tissue loss when it affects the face as an inom that can be quite disfiguring patients with limited systemic sclerosis often have involvement of these little sores and ulcers on their fingertips they have these like pinpoint pitted scars on the fingertips these patients also often have these very prominent dilated tasas little mates of prominent blood vessels that you can see on the palms the cheeks the upper chest so that is a Hallmark feature all in all it called Crest um you have the calcinosis um and then you have some other findings including Tean jaasia now speaking of other findings along with with Crest you have something called Ray nodes so if you nodes it is basically cold sensitivity where your extremities like your fingers your toes your ears as well and your nose can be very sensitive to cold temperatures you experience like your fingers turning from white to blue and then red and to be clear a lot of people have this Ray nodes phenomenon but they don Scleroderma um they don syndrome it rain nodes but it can go along with crust calcinosis Ray nodes and I explain the other things in a moment um but again it involves the fingers and they become very narrowed the fingertips become narrowed due to loss of tissue there and so that sclerodactyly and then um they also have the Tean jaasia it can affect the uh motility of the esophagus they can have heartburn difficulty swallowing this condition when it impacts internal organs it often targets the digestive tract as I said patients you have the constellation of symptoms that fall under our Crest we dismotility um and they can have digestive upset a lot of patients will have diarrhea constipation abdominal bloating and because of the digestive problems often times these patients experience weight loss that is unintentional aside from the digestive tract a lot of patients with this condition also have other um problems with their health high blood pressure they can have an irregular heartbeat and they can have shortness of breath so those are some of the signs of Scleroderma again there are a lot of different variants and it can involve the skin and internal organs in different ways and who gets Scleroderma well most types are primarily in women except the linear variant happens in men and women equally it can happen at any age again children and adolescen can develop it there is an association with Scleroderma and exposures to silica dust but that Association requires further research to delineate so just because you have this it doesn silica dust exposure so as far as the seriousness of the condition it really depends on the type that you have but medications that Target the immune system to calm down whatever it is that is driving the excessive collagen production in the skin probably some sort of Auto antibody that stimulates the cells that make collagen to do so in appropriately now a question I often get from you guys is like I have Scleroderma can I take collagen supplements and the answer to that is we don you know the research on uh collagen supplements in and of itself is still still requires a lot more studying in order to answer key questions like dosing what groups it is effective for so we really can but the systemic variants definitely impact internal organs like the kidneys the lungs the heart so there are medications that are necessary to control the disease process can be quite serious quite debilitating and it can severely restrict someone can impact their ability to move their face their hands so it know runs the Spectrum in terms of symptoms and manifestations but I hope this video was helpful and pointing out some of the signs of Scleroderma on the ins slate I video All About signs of lupus so check that one out next and I have a playlist all about skin signs of health conditions not to miss where I have lots of videos similar to this on conditions like heart disease thyroid disease so definitely check that out if you are at all curious as to how our skin is a window into what could be going on internally and all of the different findings associated with different health problems but if you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen And subscribe I to you guys tomorrow bye [Music] a [Music]	Success
Why You Have White Spots On The Nails	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvYbDuzKY24	Dr Day	have you ever left your toenail polish on Just a Touch too long or maybe you been wearing artificial nails for a long time you go to take them off and all of a sudden you see these bizarre looking white marks on your toenails maybe your fingernails they could be spots they could be lines and you going oh my gosh have I developed some gnarly nail fungal infection do I have some sort of mineral or vitamin deficiency am I dying from the inside out listen before you continue on this Panic train take a deep breath because in today talking about these mysterious white marks on the nails white spots white lines the medical term for this is Lucan Nikia there are several different types of Lucan Nikia white spots and many underlying potential root causes we going to cover some of the most common in today understand the basics of what leads to white marks on the nails the white marks on the nails can appear that way due to reflection of all W lengths of visible light off the surface of the nail obscuring the underlying nail bed vasculature this is known as a true Luca Nikia when you press on the white Mark it actually going on in the nail itself Not underneath the nail and this implies that there is a problem going on at the level of the nail Matrix specifically the distal nail Matrix the nail Matrix houses the Machinery the cells that build your nail plate and some sort of trauma or injury to the distal nail Matrix which is that little white half moon that you see with your eyes some sort of problem going on there leads to abnormal keratinization and the cells are not quite turning over right almost like the cells in your pore when they don pore a blackhead a white head otherwise known as a comeone well here instead of that because there get this funky looking white spot true lucania is different from another type called apparent lucania apparent lucania in contrast to True will blanch when you press on it and the reason is because in contrast to True lucania which arises due to a problem in the distal nail Matrix apparent lucania has to do with some sort of compression of the underlying blood vessels that make up the nail bed so it not a nail Matrix problem and that might be related to something causing compression of the blood vessels swelling tissue edema and it gets a touch more complicated in that you can have something called a pseudo lucania pseudo lucania happens due to something causing direct trauma to The Nail plate in contrast to true and apparent lucania pseudo lucania are these white marks it can be spots or lines that if you scrape at them this white chalky material comes off the reason for this is that something external some sort of problem external caus disruption in the ability of those nail cells to lie down properly so it flaky scaly skin on the face except in this instance it scaly nail cells on the nail plate it called a pseudo lucania doesn do with a problem in the nail Matrix and it doesn the nail bed it is a Surface nail issue the most common lucania is a true lucania where you have little white spots and this is most often seen in young children related to trauma of the nail distal Matrix it won you press on it one nail may be affected or several Nails may be affected different Nails may be affected in different ways and the spots can change as the nail grows out the most common myth I hear about these nail spots is that they are a warning sign of low calcium or low iron that while underlying nutritional deficiencies definitely can different of lucania they do not cause this punctate true lucania that you see commonly in children or people who have maybe had manicures it trauma to the distal nail Matrix not an underlying nutritional deficiency some cases you might develop these little white spots secondary to an underlying chronic skin condition or hair loss disorder like alopecia Arata or psoriasis the other true lucania are the formation of transverse white lines that run parallel to the little Half Moon these were first observed and described as me nails they mm in diameter these were first observed in association with arsic poisoning they can be seen about 60 days usually after exposure to arsenic but this is not the only cause of these horizontal White Lines a true lucania you also can develop these transverse White Lines a true Lucan secondary to trauma and often we see this in people who maybe forget to trim their toenails or like to keep their toenails long or they wear tight fitting shoes you know real narrow pointy toe shoes that compress the toes together creates a lot of pressure on the free edge of that long toenail and that leads to trauma of the distal nail Matrix because this is a true looking Nika and the formation of those horizontal white bands you can also develop these as a result of other things that traumatize like the nail folds and lead to damage to the distal nail Matrix such as if you develop a wart in this area and you go to the dermatologist and they freeze it with that liquid nitrogen spray well unfortunately a bystandard injury of that treatment might be to damage the distal Matrix and lead to the formation of this true lucania it provided you are not continuing to have that liquid nitrogen spray for the rest of your life now you might need multiple liquid nitrogen spray treatments to get rid of the wart so it might take a long time for this to go away if that something that you develop other traumas to The Nail folds can lead to the formation of these transverse White Lines such as trimming the cuticles pushing the cuticles back aggressive manicures provided the underlying root cause is addressed it does take some time for this to grow out the fingernails grow roughly a millimeter every 6 to 10 days so it does take some time for this to grow out once the underlying root cause has been addressed alleviated and removed trauma would lead to the formation of these transverse White Lines only on the nails that are affected by the trauma but if you see someone or you yourself have developed white horizontal lines that affect all 10 fingernails all 10 Toes that is more worrisome that there on internally that might be affecting the nail Matrix we see this with patients who take chemotherapy medications to treat cancers chemotherapy can impact the nails in many different ways check out my video All About chemotherapy and Skin Care around chemotherapy I give a lot of tips and warnings about what might happen but it definitely can lead to the formation of these because it affects those cells in the nail Matrix now I know the word toxin gets thrown around a lot in the wellness space and is very vague so let toxic can lead to the formation of horizontal white lines on the nails a true Lucan Nikia because it is damaging the nail Matrix horizontal lucania might also be seen with underlying nutritional deficiencies or underlying autoimmune disease namely lupus athetosis check out my video all about the warning signs of systemic lupus athmos I do mention in that video that Nails can be affected and the development of a true lucania is one such way and who here likes to hike at Al altitude well that can put a lot of wear and tear on your body due to the altitude you can develop something known as Everest nail seen in people who will hike Mount Everest which is very taxing on the body due to well hypoxia the oxygen content up there is not that great and it affects the body in many different ways including of course your nails because the cells are vulnerable to that hypoxic injury also the medication used to treat and prevent altitude sickness acetazolamide might also contribute to a certain extent to the formation of true lucania let about apparent lucania not a problem with the nail Matrix but rather a problem with the nail bed apparent lucania can be seen if your albumen a protein in the blood gets way too low this might happen if you have underlying kidney disease or severe malnutrition when the albumin drops so low it leads to a problem with sweat swelling due to the inability of your blood to retain fluid it leaks out and so this can essentially result in tissue edema in the nail bed leading to an apparent lucania it see the formation of these pale bands that are parallel to the uh half moon to the lunula what about vertical white lines have you ever seen those on someone longitudinal lucania could be true or apparent true in that it affects the distal nail Matrix causes of this might include underlying hereditary diseases something known as deras disease can lead to vertical white lines alternating with vertical red lines known as candy cane Nails longitudinal true lucania may also be due to some sort of abnormality in one part of the nail Matrix such as the growth known as an Ono matricoma you also can have a longitudinal apparance lucania Amia will blanch of course with compression and it problem in the nail Matrix but rather you guessed it the nail b a parent lucania is in the bed a nail bed tumor known as an onop papiloma can lead to the formation of a vertical white line that goes away with compression all right now that we causes of true versus apparent lucania or white spots white lines what about pseudo lucania that to do was something coming and sort of causing problems from the outside into the nail itself making it crumbly and if you or to pick at it you get this powdery white stuff if this is happening on your fingernails or your toenails the most common reason for this is actually secondary to nail Cosmetics repeatedly exposing the nail plate to artificial nails nail glue or to nail polish remover can actually damage the nail plate in those areas mess up the uh nail itself make it kind of mushy white and crumbly also can dry out the nail and lead to a pseudo lucania so it nail matrix it nail bed it injury of the nail plate itself locally disrupting the ability of the nail cells to remain lying down in the nail plate these nail Cosmetics essentially lead to the dehydration of the nail keratin and so those nail cells lift up and you get flaking the other reason for a pseudo lucania remember not a problem with the Matrix not a problem with the bed is actually a fungal infection this is known as superficial white Ono mosis the nail fungus invades the nail plate and causes these crumbly white spots this is most commonly going to be something that happens on the toenails it rare very uncommon to have nail fungus of the fingernails if it finger nails and you artificial nails or doing nail Cosmetics manicures nail polish probably related to that but if it toenails one might need to consider it could be a toenail fungus all right guys so that categories of white spots on the nails remember there affects the nail Matrix there lucania which affects the nail bed and then there do with something coming exter internally and causing trauma to the uh nail cells of the nail plate leading to basically they lifting up and flaking around lucania can be punctate meaning little spots it can be horizontal it can be longitudinal now lucania can go away provided you know what the underlying root cause is and you treat and control that for example if you poisoning there there that spots for example if you have a white superficial onicomicosis causing a pseudo lucania those crumbly white spots well you with oral antifungal medications the topical antifungals are unlikely to cut it um at least most usually requires a medication given by mouth so that it can make its way into the nail itself and it does take time you want to be really careful with your nails practice gentle Nail Care no pushing the cuticles back I don clippers just be really gentle keep the nails trimmed short especially the toenails because that pressure on the distal tip of the of a long nail can lead to those horizontal white lines also limit the application of things to The Nail that can be very irritating can cause contact dermatitis such as nail glues nail polish removers or even nail polish itself which can contribute to drying out of the nail make sure your shoes fit well tight poorly fitted shoes can cause a lot of pressure on the toenail leading to lucania also you might need to have your gate analyzed abnormal gate maybe there say in your hip or whatever and you not putting even pressure on your feet and you kind of turn in your your foot maybe you have a neuropathy for example related to I don maybe you had a cancer treatment that left you with neuropathy well that can lead to abnormal gate unnecessary pressure on the nail and ultimately lead to the formation of lucania frequent use of moisturizers provided you allergic or irritated by them can also help I petroleum jelly around the nail folds to help prevent the access of ear tense that could cause a contact dermatitis and further slow nail growth also helps to protect the nail Matrix from unwanted moisture getting up under there moisturizers with Ura lactic acid salicylic acid glycolic acid all can really help with the health of the nail plate as well so those would be some interventions that you might consider but again you root cause and go after that otherwise you really hope this video was helpful to you guys on the insulate I put my recent video all about why you have those pesky vertical nail ridges and how to get rid of them so check that one out next but if you guys like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow bye [Music] no	Success
Why Your Thyroid Is Making Your Hair Fall Out	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3YNJi6_ANE	Dr Day	Oh, I And the category is balancing your hormones. Yes. Whenever someone gets on the internet claims they have a supplement or some sort of headstand maneuver that hormones, just scroll on past, walk away because endroinology really, really complicated field. Lots of different hormones. All right? It checkbook. All right? It You subtracting there. What hormone are you talking about? And what is actually going on? What is actually wrong with you? Well, I think a lot of us are aware of the fact that thyroid hormone is one of those that can get out of whack. Either it can be too high or too low. It hormone is super important for many different processes in your body, such as controlling metabolism and energy needs. And I already got a video all about the skin signs of your thyroid being too low. Hypothyroidism is a lot more common than hyperthyroidism. And a testament to that fact is just looking at the view count on my skin signs of hypothyroid video versus my skin signs of hyperthyroid. All right, they that tells you everything you need to know. But while the endocrinologists do the hormone thing, dermatologists, we are doctors not just of the skin, but the hair and the nails. And I got a video on how thyroid being out of whack impacts your nails. So, you guessed it. Today, we the hair. We your hair might be trying to tell you something about your old thyroid. So thyroid hormone is really instrumental in regulating hair follicle cell division and entry into the growing phase of the hair cycle. So much so that there are many obvious hair changes that occur in the setting of different thyroid disorders. Thyroid hormone is necessary for the hair follicle cells to divide. And I forming and making hair is actually very energy demanding. requires a lot of ATP, the cellular currency. It requires healthy blood flow to the follicle to bring in growth factors. So when you have hypothyroidism, that cellular division slows down and you have a decrease in the number of hairs that are actively in the growing stage of the hair cycle. Anigen, the duration of antigen, the growing phase is shorter when you have low thyroid hormone because you getting that good kick in the pants to divide your hair follicle cells. When I say it if you have hyperthyroidism, meaning too much thyroid hormone, it your hair either. Why? Well, it creates a lot of oxidative damage, reactive oxygen species and cellular death. So, it too is bad for your hair follicle. Everything say, being in balance, in alignment, as they like to say. Who knows what they talking about? But yeah, thyroid hormone you want to have just right. Even mild little tweaks in your thyroid hormone levels in your blood can directly impact the hair follicle and the hair cycle. So when you have low thyroid, not only will you experience hair loss, but it pretty stressful on your body and it not getting the proper signals necessary for the hair to go into the growing phase. Instead, the hair shifts around your head like, not getting told to do what we need to do, so we\\ around. you get more hairs that end up in the resting phase, the shedding phase, and about 3 months after after it takes about 3 months. 3 months after the thyroid hormone becomes too low, well, you meaning hair just coming out. This is not permanent hair loss, all right? It just hair that is to eventually have a new healthy hair come in. But with the loss of that proper thyroid signal, you don necessarily get that reintroduction into the growing phase, which is called antigen. So you get this massive shedding. Like it a 100 hairs a day, but if you hypothyroidism, you shedding a ton. You it thing, which it makes me reflexively gag to pull hair out of a drain. Nasty, nasty, nasty. Don what it is about wet hair out of a drain. Um, so you that and we phenomenon in other hair videos before. It can happen um after any sort of stressful event whether it be you got in a car accident, you had a major surgery, you had a viral illness, you lost a ton of weight relatively quickly, you went on a crash diet, um maybe you ran a marathon, or maybe you had a baby, okay? because that shifts all the hormones around and everything gets kind of out of whack and it birth a human and lo and behold your hair is like woo let experience that massive shedding. This is you know sort of another example of that but rather than the fact that it stressful which is a part of it the other key fact as to why this happens with low thyroid is that thyroid hormone is really what is getting the hair follicles to be in the growing stage. I mean, it directly coaching, if you will, the hair follicle. So, that experience. But furthermore, when you have low thyroid, um you my video on signs of hypothyroidism, you kind of have dry skin. Hypothyroidism also leads to dry, brittle hair that going to be a lot more vulnerable to breakage. So, hair can become brittle and prone to breakage. That the natural aging process. also can become brittle and prone to breakage with a lot of heat styling, different chemical processing. You use that flat iron a lot, maybe you don protectant, it definitely can become more vulnerable to to breakage. And certain hair textures are going to be even more at baseline vulnerable to breakage because of the way they shaped. Okay? They have a curvature to them and therefore they more prone to breakage at certain turns of the hair as opposed to straighter hair type. If you add hypothyroidism onto that, not only are you getting a lot of shedding, not only are you getting a reduction in hairs actively in the growing stage, but now you getting a lot of breakage. And breakage plus shedding together, you get all of this in your hands. Oh my gosh, it psychologically distressing to say the least. What about hyperthyroidism, though? Okay, surely, like I said, you know, don is bad, then then more must be better. Uh-uh. Too much, like I said, harmful to the cells, creates too much oxidative stress, and you can get diffuse hair loss with hyperyroidism. Plus, it affects the hair shaft integrity. You have a hair shaft that is not as strong, the tensile strength, meaning if you took the hair and you pulled it like this, it snapping. So, you get um brittleleness in a sense. So hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, you know, while hyper is not as common as hypo, they both can happen and they both obviously have pretty direct impacts on your scalp hair. Not to mention hair on the rest of your body, especially with hypothyroidism. You might experience a loss of your eyebrow hair. The lateral aspect of your brows may begin to thin. That my video all about uh brow growth serums. I compare minoxidil to let lates roane to lates for brows. Definitely check that out. But you know it important to first and foremost know why you have a given problem. And in this case if it abnormality causing lateral brow thinning you need to address your thyroid. Okay. All the lates all the ro gain up there you know that secondhand thing. you need to to address the thyroid because thyroid hormone is so important for the rest of your body that you can thank your hair for falling out and freaking you out and cluing you into the fact that you need need thyroid hormone. One of the most common reasons to have low thyroid hormone is an autoimmune condition known as Hashimoto common in women. And one of the things with regards to hair is not only will you experience a lot of the things that we have talked about here with regards to excessive shedding um fewer hairs in the growing stage, brittleleness, dryness, dull hair, but with autoimmune hypothyroidism, Hashimoto increased likelihood of developing another type of hair loss, autoimmune hair loss, because Hashimoto autoimmune thyroid disease. What autoimmune hair loss are you most likely to get? It I have a whole video talking about alopecia ariata. As a matter of fact, about 5% of patients who have alopecia ariata, an autoimmune hair loss also have subclinical hypothyroidism, meaning they symptoms of low thyroid yet. But the fact that they have alopecia ariata should be kind of a warning sign to at least entertain the idea that the person might have um autoimmune thyroid disease especially women. This is a lot more common in women likely related to genetics. Now alopecia ariata looks a lot different than excessive hair shedding, brittle hair or diffused hair loss. With alopecia ariata, it alarming to experience in that all of a sudden because of the nature of the way the immune system sort of attacks the follicle, you get this sudden clump of hair that falls out and you have a smooth patch of bald. This too can impact your eyebrows or other body sites, not just the scalp. Often times it will resolve. You may get other patches of involved hair loss in the future. There Sometimes people develop it and it goes away and doesn times it becomes this chronic on andoff thing that you have to deal with. There are medications that address the alipcia ariata which I discuss in my video all about it. Now in contrast to just hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism with alopecia ariata the extent of alopecia ariata isn the severity of the thyroid disease. meaning you could have profoundly profoundly low thyroid hormone like and just very mild case of alopecia ariata but they are associated especially in women. There related to this video per se, but there autoimmune thyroid disease, Hashimoto and vitiligo, another autoimmune condition, this time skin and sometimes hair as well, where the immune system attacks the pigment producing cells. So, you get loss of pigment um leading to patches of bone white skin, but it can impact the hair follicle cells and you get loss of hair color. All right, let talk about another type of hair loss related to your thyroid. And that is actually the most common type of hair loss to affect both men and women. It called androgenetic alipcia. And androgenetic alopeescia involves a shrinking of the hair follicle. And a lot of this is related to again your genetics as well as another hormone dihydrotestosterone otherwise known as DHT. It that signals to the hair follicle to shrink. And in women, this can result in a widening of the central part and um the frontal hairline, some hair loss as well as loss of hair in the sides of the scalp. And a lot of it, you know, is genetic. But if you have a thyroid disease, there is a greater likelihood that you have also concominant androgenetic alopecia or female pattern hair loss. As a matter of fact, an estimated 52.2% 2% prevalence of androgenetic alopecia in post-menopausal women. There 31.5% prevalence of low thyroid. Low thyroid is pretty common, especially in post-menopausal women who have female pattern hair loss. Like alopecia ariata, there overall severity of the hypothyroidism and the extent of the female pattern hair loss. With age and especially with menopause and the decline in estrogen, our hair changes a lot. It changes in texture. It changes in thickness. The growth rate slows down and the hair shafts get thinner. And of course, if you have a tendency towards androgenetic alopecia, that will become more obvious. And if you that, there can often be an association. Plus, you the thyroid hormone at the level of the follicle. So it can make pattern hair loss much more uh involved, much more significant to have all of these multiple factors on on top of one another. All right. And then last but not least, a another type of hair loss that is more common in menopausal women and can be mistaken uh if not appropriately evaluated for other types of hair loss. It fibrosin alopecia. Fronttoal fibrosin alopecia is a variant of lychen planus an inflammatory skin condition that affects the hair follicle. You get inflammation that comes in around the follicle and creates these rough bumps with the surrounding bit of redness that involves the frontal scalp. And it really important that this be identified and diagnosed early because if it goes untreated, what happens is that inflammation that comes around the follicle, it wipes the follicle out and a scar forms. Once a scar forms, the hair will not grow back. There is an association, a pretty good association um with hypothyroidism, low thyroid and frontal fibrosin alopecia. About 22.9% of patients who have frontal fibrosin alopecia also have low thyroid. So with frontal fibrosis alopecia, not only do you get those little bumps around the hair follicle and then eventually you get hair loss and scarring of the follicle, over time what happens is the process just moves its way back and you really really really start to get receding of the frontal hairline um all the way back and it it quite it drastic. Not to mention most cases will have some degree of eyebrow involvement as well with loss of the brows. So now you eyebrows as well. You might have frontal fibrosis, alopecia, coupled with low thyroid and just overall loss of of the lateral aspect of the eyebrows. You can start to see how not only is it hair loss, but now it becomes a question of the brows as well, which you know that is hair, but usually we about hair on a on our scalp. Funny enough, aside from alipcia ariata, frontal fibrosis alipcia also can affect body hair like underarm hair, pubic hair, hair on your legs. But that where diagnosis is key. So clearly you can see I made a rhyme. There I go again. Poet and I don see that thyroid hormone, it important directly for healthy hair growth. And that when our thyroid is not operating properly, we good appropriate levels of thyroid hormone or either we have too much or we have too little, it has a huge impact on our hair. Also having these disorders of the thyroid, namely hypothyroidism, puts us at greater risk for other hair loss disorders like alipcia ariata and female pattern hair loss, otherwise known as androgenetic alipcia, as well as frontal fibrosin alopecia. Speaking of which, speaking of which, check out my video all about frontal fibrosin alopecia. It to open your eyes, especially if you one of those menopause age, pmenopause whose hair has been thinning. You been losing hair, and you now that I\\ there to do for me. Wrong. Watch that video. Your eyes will be opened wide. All right, y one. If so, give it a thumbs up. Share it with your friends. And as always, don I [Music] Heat. Hey, heat. Hey, heat. [Music]	Success
Sun Allergy or Something Worse? Know the Signs	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag1V3Nw58MU	Dr Day	Contrary to what the internet would have you believe, not everyone actually likes being in the sun. Some people burn incredibly easily. But if you have that one friend who\\ the sun. questioning, actually is. And we about sun allergy. In today allergy is kind of a common umbrella term for a variety of skin conditions known as photo dermatitis. basically dermatitis, a rash that develops when you go out in the sun, likely as a result of exposure to ultraviolet radiation. What happens is ultraviolet radiation, it makes a variety of damaging changes in your skin and your immune system can come in and recognize that in a really robust and unfortunate way and cause uncomfortable rashes for you. One of the most common photoermatitis reactions, eruptions, is something known as polymorphis light eruption. Basically what happens is your immune system reacts to the ultraviolet radiation. You get a rash usually in sunexposed areas like the arms, the face, the upper chest. And it polymorphis because the rash, the dermatitis can look like well many different types of dermatitis, maybe little itchy bumps, little blisters. The rash usually starts within hours to days of being in the sun. What usually happens is that people who have this, it flares up in the spring. It bothers them throughout the summer months. Then come fall, it starts to die down and go away, and then it the spring again. Now, I have a video that does a deep dive on polymorphis light eruption where I give more details with regards to specific medications and treatments for this, but there for it, and it tends to bother people each year, year after year. Some people mistake polymorphis light eruption for what heat rash. Polymorphis light eruption in contrast to prickly heat or heat rash happens as a result of the ultraviolet radiation. Heat rash happens because the sweat glands get kind of plugged up due to heat sweat production and you get these little itchy bumps where your sweat glands are. So that difference. Another type of photoermatitis is actually something called actctinic paraggo. This is not as common. It American countries, common in Mexico, and it of Native American descent, but it tends to affect the face. In fact, about 10% of people, it just affects the lips. Lip involvement is very common. It looks like really, really intense, dry, chapped lips, very uncomfortable lip swelling. Then it also, of course, can involve the upper arms, the chest, sunexposed areas. And it eczema. It uncomfortable. In 45% of cases, the eyes will become red and inflamed and just look irritated. That conjunctivitis. Who here has ever dealt with hives? If you have, you need to check out my video all about how to get rid of hives fast because they are very uncomfortable, but hives is an umbrella term for a variety of different herdicaras, solaria, the development of hives upon exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun. In contrast to polymorphis light eruption, which actually because it can take on a variety of shapes and forms could be hives. But the hives of solar erdicaria happen within a few minutes. Whereas with polymorphis light eruptions, it hours if not days after exposure. Solar urtdicaria, the hives, you know, they very itchy, they their skin swelling. Hives typically come and go. An individual hive doesn last more than an hour or so, but you may get other hives in the surrounding area that was exposed to ultraviolet radiation, but once you come inside, the rash will die down and go away. If you don probably what you encounter is a photoermatitis caused by something that you have either come in contact with or you sensitivity. And medications are actually a big trigger. Medications can cause either a photoallergic reaction which is a type of eczema in sunexposed areas or they can cause a phototoxic eruption leads to what looks like an exaggerated sunburn. Now I have a video that does a deep dive on these two different types of conditions. But medications that can make you sensitive to the sun include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which a lot of us take from time to time when we get a headache or joint pain. So it might not be something that you regularly take and you might miss the connection. Ibuprofen, neproxin, peroxyam all can cause suninduced rashes. The other medication that dermatology because we prescribe it a fair amount for a variety of skin conditions is doxycyc. Check out my video on doxycycline cuz I talk more about this there. Also sulfanomides. The medications called trimethoprim sulfomthoxazol commonly referred to as bactrum. Maybe you got a UTI and you were prescribed this medication and it made you sensitive to the sun. You didn contact dermatitis. In contrast to like where you that makes you sensitive to the sun, something that comes in contact with the skin makes the skin very sensitive. And a common reason for this, especially this time of year when we fun outside, socializing outdoors, attending events, you know, being our hostess with the mostest selves, you might actually develop a really miserable blistering rash. Usually the rash erupts in a grouping of a line shape, a line configuration, phytoermatitis. You came in contact in most cases with a plant that has sorens. And when you the mostess, or maybe you bartender, good chance it was a citrus fruit like limes. We call this a margarita dermatitis because a lot of people might be at the beach, an outdoor picnic or whatever, juicing limes in the sun. And that lime juice gets on your hands, your wrists, and the furins within that interact with sunlight and cause a miserable rash. Not just limes, but any citrus fruit, orange, grapefruit. Not just citrus fruits though, there are other plants. For example, especially if you do a lot of yard work or you are in landscaping, you do some sort of outdoor occupation, gardening, queen ans lace will do this to you. Fig plants are another one. Parsnip and celery is another big one. Celery as well. This is an issue for people who work in the fields harvesting celery. People whose occupation involves harvesting celery, this is an occupational hazard. Perfumes can make you more sensitive where you have applied them, especially on the sides of the neck. We see this a fair amount like a chronic over time discoloration related to spraying perfume on the neck and going out in the sun. Now more modern perfume formulations don necessarily contain anymore the types of essential oils I guess that had the furummerance namely something called musk amret oil of bergamont but any perfume could potentially make you a little bit more sensitive to the sun. So just as a general safety precaution I often tell people don your neck or on your upper chest. Instead I like to spray a little bit on my hip underneath my waistband. Then the other category of photosensitivity are there are a wide variety of underlying medical conditions that come with photosensitivity. Rosacea, rosacea flares commonly triggered by ultraviolet radiation, but also a variety of autoimmune systemic and skin conditions, namely lupus. I have a deep dive video on lupus. You need to check that out if that family member, friend, or even an enemy deals with and you want to learn more about it. Often the rashes of lupus are brought out by exposure to ultraviolet radiation. And one thing a lot of people don photosensitivity is that lupus is a a big category of different manifestations of this autoimmune condition. Sometimes it times it lupus aithmitosis. You have joint pain, kidney involvement, total system involvement can can happen. even even your brain um can be affected by lupus. For a lot of patients with systemic lupus athemmittosis, if they go out in the sun, they have a flare up. Not only do they get the rashes of lupus, but then their immune system is like all revved up and and it makes their other symptoms much worse and flare up like the joint pains. It even triggers them to have a flare up of their kidney disease in some cases. It it really can kick off a a series of unfortunate events for people who have lupus. If you have lupus, there is a good chance that you are really, really, really dialed into your sun protection because, you know, you know, you association of ultraviolet radiation with photosensitive rashes. You also need to be really careful of sun exposure while you comes through window glass can trigger these things. UVB from the sun is a type of ultraviolet radiation. It by window glass, but UVA, the longer wavelengths comes through and it can affect your skin. If you baseline photosensitivity, it longwave UVA that is often the culprit. So, you close to a window. Again, a lot of people are not going to make this connection. That is sunlight that is the aggravating factor. Sun protection is key when you things. As much as I say sunscreen every day, sunscreen sunscreen, sunscreen. If you have a true photo sensitivity, you really want to be maximizing all the other sun protective behavior. Sunscreen is not a shield of armor. It encourage more of a focus on sunprotective clothing. Long sleeves, long pants, hats. You know, if you got lupus, a UPF face shield is a must for a lot of patients with lupus because their skin disease can be triggered. If you have rosacea, if you have, I didn mention this, melasma is another photosensitive disease. You really want to rein in as many sunprotective behaviors as you can besides sunscreen. Sunscreen imperfect for a variety of reasons, which I fails. Um, check those out. You know, under application. There are a lot of pitfalls to sunscreen. So, you really want to rain in the sun protective clothing. Seek shade when you are outdoors. That can minimize the amount of UV that hits the skin. Not sufficient, but again, doing all the things that you can, it really adds up. and limit the amount of time that you are outdoors during midday. That the UV rays are most intense. Now, when it comes to treating these specific skin conditions, topical steroid medications, which I know people feel like dermatologists throw those at everything, but they do calm down the inflammation, allow the skin to heal. And when prescribed and monitored, they treatments. They may be offered in variety of these situations. Anti-histamines may be you know paramount for especially in the case of solar ericaria for getting those hives to calm down and to help with itch. This will come as a surprise though actually phototherapy can can be a game changer. Phototherapy involves the dermatologist applying select wavelengths at very calculated doses of ultraviolet radiation to your skin. You a minute isn in very specified quantities, it can actually kind of train your immune system to chill out and help, especially with uh polymorphis light eruption. It can really help quite a bit. And solar urtdicaria, that dermatologist might be able to offer you. Not all dermatologists do phototherapy, unfortunately. It very unfortunate actually that photothapy is not more widely accessible because it therapy for so many skin issues. Should be more widely available. In many of these conditions, there support something called polypodium, which is a dietary supplement that can actually help mitigate the amount of damage in the skin caused by ultraviolet radiation. Check out my video on is a safe supplement to the extent that we know. You know, supplements, they regulated like medications are. All right, y talk about today. Sun allergy, kind of a vague term. There are many skin conditions, even others that we didn get into today. These are some of the more common that are caused by sun exposure and uh require, you know, aggressive sun protection and specific interventions to address and alleviate and can be very debilitating, very uncomfortable. I hope this video was helpful to you guys. Watch out for those margaritas this summer. Now, a lot of people comment in my videos, I think I allergic to sunscreen. Yeah, that is a possibility. Some people are allergic to sunscreen. on the end slate. I to link my video all about sunscreen allergy because it can get confusing. Am I allergic to sunscreen or the sun? So, check that video out next. But if you guys enjoyed this one, give it a thumbs up, share it with your friends, and as always, don subscribe. I tomorrow. [Music] Bye. Heat. [Music]	Success
5 Warning Signs Of Heavy Metal Toxicity NOT TO MISS	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7AhmaITexU	Dr Day	Don Don metal detox. I swear if I see one more heavy metal detox protocol on the internet, I screen and flick that person in the forehead. Let toxicity. What it actually looks like when you have been poisoned by heavy metals. And by the end of this video, you of what can happen and why these things are really gimmicky and you shouldn waste your money on them. So, heavy metals are chemicals that are naturally found in our environment. We are exposed to them on a regular basis and spoiler alert, for the most part, they don harm us because remember whenever you hear the word toxin, you got to say toxicology. Toxicology. And a core principle is it the dose. Not only are we exposed to harmless amounts of heavy metals every day, but some of these heavy metals are not only benign, not harmful, but they bodies to function properly. Meaning, we actually need some heavy metals in our lives. So, what happens when things get too high? Why would that happen? Well, we might be exposed to toxic amounts of heavy metals environmentally like through industrial processing exposures, chemical plants, maybe through contaminated food sources. A heavy metal becomes toxic when our body metabolize it, excrete it is too slow and it builds up in our body and in our organs. Heavy metal number one, lead. Lead is a heavy metal that actually has no physiologic purpose in our body. Like there lead. And if we ingest or come in contact with too much lead, well, it it You eat paint chips as a child? Well, children are really vulnerable to a lead toxicity and old lead based paints. They would chip off, flake away. You might also be exposed to lead if you work in a PVC manufacturing facility or in battery manufacturing. And another possible route is through explosives. The reason lead is so toxic is it deteriorates the bloodb brain barrier that allows for leakage of fluid into the small space that is your head and you get an increase in intracranial pressure which is not ideal for your brain. You start to have a lot of serious neurologic problems. often presents with sort of non-specific findings like abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, confusion, malaise and it leads to anemia and kidney failure and it interacts with sulfers that are part of the bacteria in your mouth and that leads to the formation of these bluish purple deposits along the gum line. You see the gum turns this bluish black purple and the formation of what is known as mis lines. These are horizontal white lines that go back and forth, not up and down, on the nail. They can affect the fingernails and the toenails. And if you watch my video all about white spots on the nails, we talked about these. If you didn to lunch? Bars snick. Now, wait a minute. I know there the audience. You technical and be like, actually a metaloid and not really a heavy metal. But I can all intents and purposes, arsenic is heavy metal exposure that can be quite deadly. In fact, a lot of people might use it to well, poison you and and and unal alive you, as is popular to say on social media. Well, you might be exposed to arsenic if you are exposed to a lot of pesticides, fungicides. It what is used in rat poison. So, if you accidentally snacked on that would not be good. Wood preservatives. The biggest serious arsenic exposure is in certain areas in Bangladesh. The groundwater is contaminated with arsenic and this is really where one might see several cases actually of arsenic toxicity. The skin is actually the most sensitive organ to arsenic and you will develop hyperpigmentation but not just any hyperpigmentation. Usually like this little dark brown spotty hyperpigmentation. It could happen anywhere on the body, but seems to have a predilction for the eyelids, the face, also in the temples, the neck, your nipples, and you hyperpigmentation under the arms and in the groin as well. And the interesting thing about it is that interspersed with the little dark spots of hyperpigmentation are lighter spots. So, if you stand back, it might look like little raindrops on a dirt road. Dermatology, we things. And that is the classic description of arsenic poisoning rash. You might actually have the odor of garlic. A garlic body odor is characteristic of arsenic poisoning, garlic breath. Patients who have arsenic poisoning, they often can go on to develop vomiting, nausea, muscle cramping, heart failure, kidney failure, lung disease. I mean, it is it bueno. But people who are exposed to arsenic chronically like in the case of those individuals who are consuming contaminated drinking water often in addition to the sort of hyperpigmentation that I described they will also go on to develop these little warty rough keratosses as they often on the palms of the hands. These are known as our cenical kerattosis that actually can go on to form skin cancers. Chronic exposure to arsenic puts you at risk for a variety of cancers, but especially skin cancers. Mercury. Maybe back in the day someone told you about the mercury and a thermometer. Don break it. It in which you might be exposed to mercury is if you happen to get your hands on a black market skin lightening skin bleaching cream. Now, I have older videos on my channel warning about these. They have very high oftent times amounts of hydroquinone which again it not the poison it that hyperpigmentation but high amounts very irritating plus often has high amounts of topical steroid in the medication too much for like putting on the face and and many of these have been found to be contaminated with mercury leading to mercury toxicity all in the name of getting rid of dark spots. It is deadly. So be really careful in that regard. Also, if you are in the mining profession, you might be exposed to mercury and it is also part of the paper manufacturing industry. When it comes to the skin and body manifestations of mercury toxicity, it or pinks disease. And again, this is another situation where young children are going to be a lot more vulnerable, show the signs and symptoms a lot earlier. They vulnerable. listlessness, weakness. A lot of non-specific findings in the beginning of mercury toxicity tend to have loss of appetite. A commonly reported finding is light sensitivity like they cannot stand the light. The skin has this characteristic pink appearance usually starting out on the tip of the nose. The fingers and the toes also turn pink and this progressively starts to deepen in coloration and it kind of spreads in this like net-like pattern. The mercury is toxic to the little nerves. You develop this peripheral neuropathy where you have extreme pain, swelling, discomfort of the hands and feet. They become very cold and so they turn blue and then they also turn red. And of course, they become very swollen. While you won smell mousy. That is a notable finding with mercury toxicity. And again, it damaging to those little nerves. So, in addition to pain, also itch. I about this before, but pain and itch, they the pathways, I mean, they much same same side of a a coin. So, yeah, intense itch of of the skin. Because of the neurologic issues, you can experience hyperhydrosis, which is fancy medical speak for excessive sweating coupled with that mousy odor. A lot of patients go on to lose their teeth due to the inflammatory issues going on in the skin and the gums as well and they will lose their hair. Alipcia and because of the toxic accumulation of mercury, not only is it harmful to the hair, but also told you guys we are the doctors of the fingernails and they might just fall off. Number four is going to come as a surprise to you cuz this is one of those Goldilocks things. You say toxin, I say toxicology because it it vital, right? Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide. But hey, yeah, Goldilocks, let me tell you something. Iron overload, too much iron, overdosing on iron is actually the second most common cause of intoxication in pregnancy. So you can see where tipping the balance one way or the other is just not good. How might we be exposed to too much iron? It supplements. There hereditary disorder called hemocromattosis where you do have a problem with iron overload. But for those of us who don iron supplements unnecessarily. Well, it can lead to iron overload. Also, maybe you are drinking water that is contaminated with too high amounts of water. It also can be released from certain types of cookware. Usually presents with gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea, vomiting and goes on to lead to vomiting up this kind of bloody like vomit and having blood in your stools. Then all the way to frank liver disease uh a coagulopathy uh I mean really serious. Your heart fails, your kidneys fail. I mean it multi-organ thing going on. And how is your skin going to be a warning sign that this is happening? Well, a lot of patients who develop iron overload, their skin kind of takes on this bronzel-like appearance. Almost looks like they have a tan, but they don And sometimes rather than being bronzy, it can be a bit slate gray. Number five, the final heavy metal we talk about today is thallium. So thallium is something that it it might be released through coal burning, a primary way, also in smelting of copper, zinc, iron ores. But the case I saw was actually someone who unfortunately was dabbling in the illicit drug arts, if you know what I mean. Drugs like cocaine and heroin can be contaminated or contain thallium. And that is one way. Not only these illicit drugs, but also certain herbal supplements have been found to be uh contaminated with thallium. The funny thing about thallium is that back in the day before we really knew how dark thallium could get, um it was actually, and this just sounds wild knowing knowing what we know about thallium now, um is that it used to be used as a treatment for ringorm and to get rid of unwanted hair and that is just really scary. It it really damages the nerves quite a bit. two to five hours after exposure to thallium, you would develop this very painful peripheral neuropathy. So, your fingers, your toes, you they to be really painful, might even cause some problems with walking. But about 2 to 3 weeks after the exposure, you going to get a sudden boom, hair loss. It follicle and you get, you know, frank hair loss, which is why it like, wow, you mean to tell me they once tried using that to treat unwanted hair? I mean, go big or go home, quite literally. Now, you also can develop this red scaly rash all over your body. Primarily also on the palms and soles, a lot of scaliness, flakiness, which is like, wow, I can using this to treat ringorm. Uh, and you might also develop an acne eruption on the face. Acneform meaning looks like acne, but it got videos all about acne eruptions. If you really want to get if you really want to get deep in the dermatologic arts, you recall from the video that drugs can cause drugs, medications can cause acne like eruptions characterized by the development of pestules. And these rashes, in contrast to true acne, lack comedy. So there blackheads and white heads. And the little bumps, the pimples, if you will. They more or less look pretty similar. They development. So you can develop an agnopiform eruption in the setting of thallium toxicity, thallium poisoning. Because it you also can have issues with sweating. You can either have hyperhydrosis which as a reminder fancy medical speak for excessive sweating or the opposite anhydrosis fancy medical speak for no sweat and uh no sweat andhydrosis is deadly especially if you are in a hot climate because sweat as a reminder is not there to detoxify. Okay, sweat is produced to cool your body. It is a thermo regulatory thing helps keep us cool. When we cannot sweat either because we thallium or maybe we genetic disease where we don sweat glands. Well, you can get heat stroke quite easily. It can be deadly and you can quite literally cook yourself. Okay. So, you can imagine that an individual dabbling in the illicit drug arts in a hot climate is a dangerous mix. not anything I would recommend um you do for therapeutic purposes expose yourself to thallium but we are exposed again to a lot of these things on the regular okay so just keep that in mind like it it amounts of these things uh absorbed through the skin inhaled ingested um through environmental exposures but in our everyday lives we low nonharmful amounts so that really big take-home home point. Whenever someone says toxin, I want you to say toxicology, right? That see what they do. Be like, it well as a variety of other things, exposures and and you know, your overall health. Like I said, children are, you know, more vulnerable to these things. But for the most part, you know, in the developed world, these things are pretty rare. I mean, you can encounter them. um maybe you dabble in elicit drugs in which case you know you got to be careful with that stuff. It for you for many reasons and this is one such example. But um you know iron is essential. Iron formation of blood. So you got to get that that right level there to to say um if it now that you hair, the nails, the mucosal membranes can do when you have heavy metal toxicity. Why am I so like eye rolly at heavy metal detoxes? They mumbo jumbo nonsense. When somebody truly has a heavy metal toxicity, this is not the route that they go to treat them. These tees, colonics, cleanses, that is all smoke and mirrors. And if those things truly did work, why are you doing them? Why are you doing them? Um, do you have lead poisoning? Do you have mercury toxicity? I think not. But if you did, if you do, you probably not upright watching this video. You to the emergency room. So, don for this stuff. It the wellness space. You You can Not only that, let did work. Why would you want to remove all the heavy metals from your body? Spoiler alert, cobalt and it know, is vital vital for formation of your blood cells. So, why are you going to pull out all that? Also, like I said, iron essential for life. Why are you going to pull out all that details that are left out of the smoke and mirror show that is the Wellness Grip? So, stay away from those nonsensical heavy metal detoxes. If anything, they your wallet at the very least, but they can actually, you know, put you at risk for health problems depending on what the heck goes into them. All right, y highly requested video, the signs of heavy metal toxicity. I really hope it was informative to you. If you liked it, you on the ends slate uh because we do a deep dive on the skin warning signs of carbon monoxide poisoning. Not something you want to play around with. Okay, so watch that one next so you the know. Um but if you guys like this one, give it a thumbs up, share it with your friends, and as always, don forget sunscreen and subscribe. I talk to you guys tomorrow. Bye. [Music] heat. Hey [Music]	Success
Signs Of Measles NOT TO MISS (Skin Rash)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lmix5N_AoRU	Dr Day	but don see it in your career they told me as a medical student well here it is 2025 and over the past several years actually we are seeing a rise in cases of measles which was once thought to be pretty well controlled on its way to hopefully being eradicated is resurging in fact we just had a couple of cases of meal here in Houston Texas where I live today I thought it would be appropriate to do a video on the skin signs of measel what is Measles it is a highly highly highly contagious viral infection one of the most contagious viral infections in fact meisles virus persists in the Air 2 hours after an infected person has left the illness that measles causes at its best is a really uncomfortable Illness but at its worst it kills about one to three children out of a thousand who are infected with measles will die 30% of those infected will have serious serious complications this isn like a flu whatever you get over it and you develop really debilitating long-term problems such as deafness blindness it can cause inflammation in the central nervous system causing analitis seizure it can cause inflammation around your heart and within the muscle of the heart leading to heart problems that put you at risk for serious complications including death measles can lead to a precipitous drop in your platel counts it can have a really life-threatening blood clotting problem as a result measles infection can impact the kidneys leading to kidney failure necessitating dialysis the consequences of measles on the lungs can leave you vulnerable to a pneumonia which actually is a common reason for death from measles and measles can lead to gastrointestinal disease profound diarrhea putting the individual at risk for dehydration also can cause mouth sores and make it difficult to eat and in developing countries around the world where measles is endemic people are at risk for malnutrition with misles virus infection if a pregnant woman is infected with measles there is an increased risk of fetal harm premature labor premature delivery and death of the mother and something almost no one talks about when it comes to measles is that it can wake back up decades later and cause something called Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis basically severe inflammation in your central nervous system in your brain that is life-threatening so what are the signs and symptoms that you been infected with misles well once you misil virus it takes anywhere from roughly 7 to 11 days before symptoms develop this is known as the incubation period some people during this period of time will have a fever they spotty rash and they may just feel sort of unwell as the virus is spreading throughout their bloodstream but a lot of people just don at this point it 12 Days After you have been exposed that you really start feeling ill you get a fever loss of appetite just feel very unwell during this stage you develop what are known as the three seeds cough Kiza which is basically a stuffier runny nose and conjunctivitis red eyes and 2 to 3 days into being sick if you to look inside your mouth a lot of people have these little spots that are called copx spots they pink and they happen opposite of your molers those little spots usually last about 24 to 48 hours so this pral period of feeling unwell having cough coriza conjunctivitis and the spots inside your mouth that usually last anywhere from 2 to 5 days and then and then the rash erupts starting on your face and behind the ears in the scalp the rash is not itchy and it consists of oval flat pink spots anywhere from roughly a half to 1 cm in diameter starts on the face and characteristically behind the ears also can involve the scalp and within the next 24 to 36 hours it spreads to involve your chest your back your entire trunk your arms and legs typically spares The Palms and soles of the hands and feet that once the rash erupts it coincides with having a very high fever of 101° f or 38.3 de C the rash does not scar it doesn starts fading within the next 3 to 4 days develop helping a purplish Hue then kind of turning this coppery color and then getting really flaky and scaly before it goes away completely usually the recovery period is about 1 to 3 weeks of having a persistent cough but if a person has that high fever for greater than 3 days of the rash coming out usually Heralds that they to have one of the more serious complications so how do you get measles measles is spread from person to person but like I said it highly contagious coming in contact with an infected person is how measles is spread it virus lives in the nose and throat mucus of an infected person so it can spread to others through coughing and sneezing now measles can also be contracted through contact with air droplets if other people breathe the contaminated air or touch an infected surface then touch their nose their eyes their mouth they can become infected the virus again can live for up to two hours in an airspace importantly only humans spread measles measles spread from person to person animals your pets they do not get or spread measles and if an infected person has been in a room that measles virus will persist there for 2 hours and can go on to infect another person when they come in that room people who have measles they can spread measles pretty quickly pretty widely to people who have not had measles before or who have not been vaccinated how long is somebody contagious someone with measles is contagious starting about 2 days before they even begin to feel sick or know that they have measles and they remain contagious for usually around 5 days after the big rash has erupted people who are most susceptible to measles are infants who have lost the protection that they had from their mother in utero the unvaccinated and imuno deficient if an unvaccinated person travels to an area of the world where measles is endemic that is a really high-risk situation in fact these most recent cases in Houston had to do with somebody traveling somewhere getting measles and bringing it back before the Advent of the measles vaccine a lot of young children would get measles maybe even some of you watching this had measles as a child you might think so what what the big deal well like I said at the beginning of the video one to three out of a thousand children who are infected will die 30% of those will have one of these more serious complications so it great that children do survive unaffected and have lifelong immunity but a lot of children suffer tremendously not to mention some people can not be vaccinated as a result of their immune system they have problems with their immune system so they are unvaccinated and vulnerable the rise of vaccine hesitancy and resistance to vaccinate young children coincides with the increase in cases of measles the measles vaccine is given in two doses lasting protection occurs in 95% of children who get just one dose of the measles vaccine but a second dose of the vaccine can offer 99% protection so it really really important to to vaccinate your children to prevent this serious life-threatening viral infection that is highly contagious and can kill a lot of people when someone is sick with measles virus there done to stop the viral infection really all that can be offered are things that are considered supportive making sure that their fluids are managed if they developing some sort of serious complication that would need to be intervened on a child with misil maybe given paracetamol cetamin importantly never give a child aspirin in the situation is contraindicated due to the risk of something called rise syndrome measles is a major cause of death in children in lowincome countries and it particularly dangerous if a child has vitamin A deficiency so high doses of vitamin A actually can be given and have been shown to be effective for lowering the number of deaths from measles and hospitalized children measel virus is spread by droplets the virus is really hearty and can remain in the air after someone has left the room you can easily get it if you have not been vaccinated all right guys that is a wrap up with regards to the warning signs the rash of measles I was taught I was like never going to see this unless I did a rotation in a developing country where measles was endemic that I was unlikely to ever see it but here we are in 2025 and we are seeing a lot more cases of it which is sad because it is a preventable viral illness that can otherwise kill children and I when I say that the measles vaccine has been used for decades and decades and is very safe all right guys so on the inside I recent video all about the warning signs of other viral infections how the rashes look so check that one out next cuz we are in cold and flu season and a lot of viral infections are circulating around I hope you guys are all staying healthy and free from illness if you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don I [Music]	Success
Food Poisoning Symptoms NOT TO MISS: Scrombroid Poisoning	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-rt71u_y-0	Dr Day	Oh, you to sneak a leak myself. When it comes to people who are insufferable, they make appearances. You want to get away from them really, really fast, they want something from you. Time, money, who knows? Just run in their mouth. It takes a brave soul to reach into your back pocket and pull out this phrase, but the payoff instant. And that is, uh-oh, explosive diarrhea. Got to go. Sadly, sometimes you might actually experience explosive diarrhea because, well, you ate something funky. You went to that food truck, ignored that little voice in your head saying, their hands in there all day? you prepared something yourself, and you didn after you went to the bathroom. All right, I see you guys in bathrooms. Not you guys, but you know, you guys in general, public, how people wash their hands. It time, we get a little up. And I know what you dermatologist. Why are you talking about a gastrointestinal illness? And to that I say, are you new here? Have you not heard the mantra? Go ahead and say it with me. The skin. Repeat it. The skin. I promise this isn skin. It is a window to what is going on internally. Honestly, there aren skin warning signs of food poisoning. It would be great, but a lot of times that is one situation where you can develop a very striking, prominent skin rash in the setting of a particular type of food poisoning. It can throw you for a loop. You might be confused. Other people who ate the exact same thing, maybe unaffected, and you\\ going on? Am I allergic? Kind of looks like an allergy to the untrained eye. We are going to break it down. I have come to learn from interacting with you guys over the years that a lot of you all are fans of fish in your diet. I did a video a few years ago talking about that study on the association of tuna and melanoma. I also had a video earlier this this year, last year, time is just melting together on eating sardines for anti-aging purposes. I myself do not eat things with faces as you guys know. But but there is a situation when it comes to eating fish that can land you in the house of pain, give you a rash and confuse you to no end. And that is scromboid fish poisoning. If you like, is that? something that you have to pay a lot of money for and you little teaspoon full of it and you going to leave with $150 out of your pocket and an empty stomach. But scrum scrumbboid is just fancy terminology for different types of fish in this family. includes tuna, mackerel, bonito, the butterfly kingfish. I this one. Kawaii. Kah Hawaii. I think that that typically have a dark meat. Occasionally, you problem with other fish, but these are the main players. These fish contain a chemical called histadine. However, when they allowed to get to a temperature greater than 15 degrees C because somebody was out to lunch and didn the bacteria multiply and they turn that histadine into scrumbbotoxin, which contains histamine. And it histamine that will jack you up. And I know what you know, I cooked the fish. I smoked it. I boiled it. I poached it. I put it in What do where it water bath with like looks like a science experiment. Yeah. Heat does not destroy the scrambotoxin. Destroys the bacteria, but it Here amount of histamine, the amount of scrobotoxin and histamine in the fish varies depending on the rate of decomposition within the fish. So in other words, its tail may be off, but its head may be fine. Okay? So say for example, you went out on a fishing trip, you caught a bunch of tuna and you were slack. You you didn didn got too warm. Well, you might chop that up, serve it, cook it, poach it, boil it, what, however you do it. um put it on a plank and some people are eating it and they it and you get sick. Is that because you part. You ate the funk of the fish. They didn two people might get sick whereas other people are just fine. And you can see how that might think, fish? No one else got sick. this type of food poisoning look like? Well, it starts within 30 minutes to an hour of consuming the fish. You initially feel warm and flushed. Then you get this impressive impressive bright red rash. Face, upper chest, back. It it histamine. Basically, itch, heat, warmth, redness. It this rash and think it reaction because yes, histamine plays a role in allergic reactions, but here there immune response to something that you have developed an allergy to, but rather it is the effect of a toxin present in the fish that is primarily histamine. So the skin clue that it the history obviously and not oh I allergic to tuna is also the fact that if you look at the rash it flat. There is no raised aspect. People who have food allergies shortly after consuming the problematic food they will develop flushing and hives. Hives are raised wheeling um is what that called. You don just get flat redness within the skin and it have a burning sensation in the mouth. Histamine can jack you up. I mean, it it it doing all kinds of things in our body. But here it it will start pounding. You intense headache in many cases. Better be near a bathroom because abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting are possibilities. You might feel dizzy, have difficulty breathing, your blood pressure can get too low, causing you to pass out. For many victims of scromboid fish poisoning, they turn a corner within about 3 hours and their symptoms will resolve. Not everyone, however, again, it a lot of it depends on the individual, their overall size, how much they ate, how much of the toxin was present, and so it can take much longer to recover. But you don have to suffer with scrumboy fish poisoning. You can take an anti-histamine. That medications that will shut these symptoms down, alleviate them. If you take a fast acting antihistamine, you will get relief pretty shortly. For example, dyenhydramine acts pretty quickly. Most people this will resolve and they won But for some people with more intense poisoning symptoms may go on for a couple of days. they may need to continue to take antihistamines. Ideally, those that are non-sedating such as satyazine, fexophenine. Also, there are in the H2 class, a little different. These aren allergies. These include submitine and renitadine. They act a little bit differently in terms of their anti-histamine effect, but they can be helpful in these situations. The important take-home point here is that scrumboid fish poisoning might happen to just you and no one else who ate the exact same fish. It reaction. There is no wheeling. Because it Epinephrine, aka an epipen, and steroids do nothing. There response coming in here. It toxin doing its thing. It allergic reaction. Because it allergic reaction, you are free to safely consume that type of fish again in the future, provided, of course, you store it properly. You don funky one. All right? It on ice in the refrigerator, eaten shortly thereafter. Um, so for example, if this happened to you after eating tuna, well, you can eat tuna again in the future. The other take-home point is while it this toxin in the fish, the bacteria is not the problem once you become sick. You You produced. The bacteria is not what makes you sick. It reason, antibiotics, which are used to treat bacteria, they don rid of the symptoms. It anti-histamine. That is a treatment of choice. And you eat these fish again. It is not an allergy. How do you prevent this from happening? Well, you want to make sure, especially those of you who fish, okay, and you catch these types of fish and you eat them, you prepare them for your friends and family, you don that person that gives your your friends scrumoid food poisoning. Uh they they will not be coming back to the fish fry in the future. No sir. Here is a clue that the fish is funky. If it has a peppery taste to it, that is the taste of decomposing fish. That being said, if the fish tastes fine, it is not a guarantee that it cuz the fish tasted fine and other people didn wasn make sure that freshly caught and killed fish are immediately put on ice or in the refrigerator and eaten that day. The FDA actually requires fish to have a histamine level less than 50 mg per kilogram of weight. So, again, it the poison, it there fish. Once it gets over 200 mg per kilogram of weight of the fishoo, that is that is pretty hazardous. I bring that up just to emphasize the point that it dose makes all the difference. In this case, you have a bacteria that has been allowed to proliferate in the fish because it got too warm, decompose the flesh, produce this toxin, and it toxin, not the bacteria, that ends up making you sick. The toxin includes histamine which is responsible for all the symptoms. But in contrast to histamine produced from an allergy in your body. This is not an allergic reaction. It toxin. Um it immune system is producing. So much different. Not an allergy, not an infection, but you might have explosive diarrhea. And if your friend did this to you, don the future. All right, y what I wanted to talk about with regards to food poisoning, skin warning signs. There aren many, but on the ends slate, I to link my recent video all about warning signs of heavy metal toxicity. Check that one out next. Your eyes will be opened wide as to well, you know the mantra, the skin, it it does not lie. It does not lie. It if you just look at it and know what you are looking at. All right, y enjoyed this one, give it a thumbs up, share it with your friends, and as always, don subscribe. I tomorrow. Bye. [Music]	Success
Painful Red Bumps on Legs? The Truth About Erythema Nodosum	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTrhwM_xFmk	Dr Day	you mean to tell me you look like that and there go out partying last night and wake up like that uh-huh uh-huh sounds suspicious listen if you painful red bumps on your lower legs this this right here is the video you need to watch because this is a real thing it happens freaks people out it very mysterious looks like somebody came at you with a baseball bat quite frankly feels uncomfortable you probably want to know what it is well there is a chance what you known as athema no doome the development of painful tender nodules bumps usually on the lower legs but also can happen on the thighs the upper arms very very rare cases happen on the face and the neck initially maybe you get one but over a couple of days seemingly out of nowhere you get multiple usually bilaterally they start out red they and you don you temperature sure it your joints can be a little stiff 50% of cases your ankle will be swollen painful these bumps are poorly defined like you can turn to the side but if you look at your leg at a certain angle you can see this bump they can range in size maxing out at around 20 cm they can be quite large over the next couple of weeks these start to turn this kind of violet brown color then get greenish yellow much like a bru and eventually go away sometimes however they can ulcerate meaning you get a big sore overlying the bump so this is athema no doome it is a type of panniculitis panniculitis is fancy medical speak for inflammation in the Deep Fat and there are a lot of different types of penices woo getting real fancy there with the language women are a lot more likely to get Eman no doome they more likely than men to be precise women are just a lot more likely to get conditions that are sort of autoinflammatory in nature however in kids before puberty girls and boys equally likely to get aeod Doom what is going on what is the cause aeod doome is a type of hyp sensitivity reaction basically something happens in your body and we moment something happens in your body something goes through you and your immune system gets so flustered Rebels and it does this weird thing in the Deep Fat in your legs usually but again thighs possibly upper arms rarely face and neck so it reaction kind of like some sort of allergic response only not quite the same but you get where I cases 55% of cases no one will ever know why you had this no cause is identified all right so going in just accept that in a lot of cases we never figure out what the original trigger was because a lot of things come through our body different Critters they don necessarily acutely make us feel ill we don the time Athan no doam crops up there no objective finding that you ever had any issue so it figure out exactly what the cause is but in many cases aema no doam can be triggered by some sort of infection this time of year most commonly it be like strep throat or a viral illness like the flu which woo we are having a rough flu season you also might get some kind of gastrointestinal illness food poisoning that could trigger it tuberculosis we had an outbreak of tuberculosis quite recently check out my video on skin warning signs of tuberculosis it will blow your mind also also sexually transmitted infections like clamidia common possible trigger for aeod doam different fungal infections and parasites like if you go camping and drink water out of the streams without treating it properly you can get a little critter called Giardia which will have you on the toilet in the house of pain but it infection that triggered it it might have been it might just have been an abnormal immune response against a medication that you took for example sulfonamides and Amoxicillin these are medications used to treat different infections so it can be hard to tease out if it was the drug or if it was actually the infection that you had but those are medications that commonly can trigger this non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs we the overthe counter pain relievers like ibuprofen Naproxin oral contraceptive pills silicates iodide and gold salts aside from infection and medication triggering this the other Bugaboo are different inflammatory conditions I looking at you inflammatory bowel disease including Crohn kitis if you colitis this is something you might have to deal with at one point in your life because when it comes to inflammatory bowel disease they can they can sneak on in to the skin let me know in the future if you want a video on skin signs of Crohn colitis hopefully I can put that together for you guys at some point some of the signs are a bit shocking if you will and not necessarily YouTube friendly so I digress sarcoidosis a condition that uh involves inflammation in pretty much any body sight um but can pop up with athema no doome check a chest x-ray and both uh sides of the lymph nodes in the lungs are often enlarged it adenopathy and the constellation of symptoms of Eman nodosum and the enlarged lymph nodes in the lung observed on chest x-ray is known as lrin disease a subset of sarid doas then the other bucket of conditions that cause abnormal inflammation and immune response are Cancers different cancers a warning sign that you have certain cancers might actually be athe and dooom now if you have athe and dooom don freak out it doesn cancer but it need to be investigated Leukemia Lymphoma those are diseases of the blood and the immune response can react unfavorably with these painful nodules then there besets disease comment below if you ever heard of it it autoimmune condition and Atheon nosm is possible speaking of situations where the immune system can get pressed bothered and Confused uh are you building a human inside of your body if you are well you of cases of aeod doam happen in pregnancy so are these nodules dangerous are they harmful no very rarely they might kind of entrap some of the surrounding fat you develop a type of basically lipoma a little fatty nodule not dangerous but for the most part the bumps themselves the athem and no doam clear up and go away rarely they can come back again and it can be something that you deal with for 6 months maybe even years you deal with recurrences that likely if someone has an underlying condition like ulcerative colitis Crohn this medication and it triggered it the lumps themselves of athema nodosum the condition the peniculus which is what it is okay it around the fat to form those nodules that is not really as worrisome like yeah let it run its course it we can talk about some things that might be offered but it pressing thing the most pressing thing is figuring out what underlying thing might you have and again remember 55% % of the time there to be identified okay so we kind of have to go on a bit of a Witch Hunt your doctor might order a bunch of tests one thing your dermatologist is going to do is do a really deep biopsy to confirm a diagnosis rule out other possible penices cuz like I said there are quite a few of them out there they order blood work they testing to make sure you don tuberculosis perhaps they might order a chest x-ray they might check your stool for infection they fishing Expedition looking for any possible trigger they to make sure you don underlying cancer or that this isn manifestation an early warning sign of some like autoimmune disease okay so they to make sure that they anything but given that these bumps are uncomfortable not pleasant to deal with how can they be treated to get you some relief well it kind of depends on what the underlying root cause is for example rest is going to be very helpful you going to want to take it easy get some rest because again you often just don feel well and have poor energy when you might prescribe you a medication called culine which is actually used to treat gwn but can work in a specific way to address this abnormal inflammation to help clear These Lumps up also compression can alleviate the discomfort just by kind of squeezing them down the pain also might be treated with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug like ibuprofen however if that was the cause cuz remember medications can trigger it then that would be a no-o which is why a lot of the treatment to alleviate discomfort symptoms revolves around making sure you know what any potential underlying cause is also your doctor might want to prescribe something called prazone a steroid that quiets inflammation however they would not want to do that they absolutely would not want to do that if your aeod doam has been triggered by an infection like tuberculosis because woo that would be Bad News Bears also would be contraindicated if you have certain underlying cancers to just go giving you an immunosuppressant like that um so wouldn some might be appropriate also there medication that is given by mouth called potassium iodide again some cases of athe oosm are caused by that but uh it also can be a treatment provided it wasn so keep in mind if you have this the most pressing thing is figuring out is there some underlying more pressing cause for it it usually just goes away on its own however and for the most part doesn doome painful bumps on the lower legs most commonly all right freaks people out understandably and is very uncomfortable let me know in the comments is this something that you you have dealt with and how did it go for you share your experiences down below but if you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow bye [Music] h [Music]	Success
Korean Rubber Band Hack Claims To Slim Your Face Naturally	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dGdzwHxFAA	Dr Day	y rant today about something that was shown to me on Tik Tok and I know what you what did we tell you Andrea stay off of that stupid app all it does is show nonsense of course yes I know but hold my hand because what I saw today is just like what is happening to society so I get on the app there that was shown to me on my for you page of this guy with uh rubber bands around his ears claiming that this is the latest Beauty Trend in Korea of putting rubber bands or hair ties around your ears in an effort to De puff your [Music] face is it just me has Korea become the New France in America meaning like we can just say that something is popular in Korea and all of a sudden it has this mystique and everybody wants to do it it doesn sudden it just sounds a lot better and something that we must buy and have and own and possess or do to ourselves and this is one example I mean don wrong Korean skincare love it if you new here I have a lot of reviews of Amazing Korean skincare products I love their sunscreens I mean I am team Korean skincare 100% but not everything that the internet claims is like a popular Korean beauty trend is even a popular Korean beauty Trend first of all let alone something that is necessarily worth reproducing okay like so be really Discerning with those claims Maybe this is something that people there are actually doing but should you reproduce it heck no putting rubber bands around your ears is not a good idea it going to slim or depuff your face okay why do people believe that it depuff the face well they claim that it is sort of mimicking lymphatic massage there if anything it can be harmful because you can cut off circulation to the delicate skin of your ears cause skin irritation and problems waking up with a puffy face can be related to a number of of things it could be an underlying medical problem something serious like a thyroid disorder or some other endocrinologic abnormality or it could be an allergic reaction so first and foremost what is the cause of your facial puffiness the facial swelling determining the root cause is always key and that involves seeing a healthc care provider not wrapping yourself up in rubber bands like an old newspaper most of the time it up with some degree of a puffy face a lot of times it retention maybe you had a high salt meal the before it could also be related to how you slept your sleep position but the solutions to this common issue are very simple very practical so this whole wrapping rubber bands around your ears is not only ridiculous but is just like so unnecessary so how can you depuff the face first thing in the morning well you want to just get a cool compress and gently apply it to the skin they sell those facial ice rollers you can put in the refrigerator and roll on the skin surface surf it will help push that fluid accumulation out of the tissues back to your heart and depuff the face and when it comes to fluid accumulation and puffiness where it really shows up when you wake up is in under eye puffiness and that actually can make it look as though you have dark under eye circles using a cool compress under the eyes or some cool hydrogel under eye patches can really de puff very quickly and just to brighten up and rejuvenate the look of the skin under the eyes very quickly because eyelid skin you know is very delicate so it fluid accumulates there but it more obvious when you get it to go away so you get that gratification caffeine applied topically can also help constrict the blood vessels and help push some of that fluid away it doesn work for everyone but some people respond really well to topical caffeine personally I love using those hydrogel under eye patches are they medically necessary do you need to use these to deep puff your face are they a must have in your morning routine absolutely not it personally find to be very effective at just deep puffing the under eyes and I cycle through different ones I brand loyal currently I Dermatology brand ones the brightening under eye patches they do have caffeine as well as a variety of other hydrating ingredients I kungu has these black tea hydrel under eye patches that are also amazing I thinking about using those again at some point if you like it and it doesn cause irritation they definitely can be effective if if you store them in the refrigerator apply the patches on to the under eye area chilled it will really maximize that deep puffing effect it amazing and you don necrose your ear skin when choosing hydrogel eye patches choose those that are free of essential oils or fragrance because eyelid skin is very delicate and prone to irritation so just be aware of that the other thing that can make a huge difference in morning puffiness aside from just cool compresses is your sleep position so if you are able to sleep with your head ever so slightly elevated that will really help drain fluid back to your heart as you sleep and make it less likely that you wake up with a puffy face sleeping on your back can also be a GameChanger I trained myself to sleep on my back years ago and it has made a huge difference in the appearance of how my face looks when I wake up in the morning I don used to sleep on my side or on my stomach I would wake up with puffiness on one side of my face related to sleeping on my stomach or my side and now that I sleep on my back I don that issue and it also will be most obvious to you in the way that your under eye area looks cuz again the skin there is delicate it obvious when there and it terms of the benefit when that is reduced make sure you hydrated and drinking fluids water because that can also make a difference in fluid retention now people go overboard with this in their claims they make it seem as though you water bottle away from gloriously bouncy dewy wrinkle-free skin and if only you had another glass of water in the day you wouldn up prune but truthfully making sure you stay hydrated can make a huge difference on fluid retention the other thing that is huge is the sodium in your diet if you you like to Salt your food you cook with salt this is by and large more than fine where the sodium issue becomes a problem and where people run into problems not just with looking coffee but with high blood pressure I mean it and cutting back on it can have a huge impact on your health comes from processed um ready-made Foods hand soups TV dinners fast food package snacks make sure your diet includes fresh fruits vegetables lean proteins try cooking for yourself rather than relying on readymade meals because the sodium content in those is very high and here and there it definitely can take a serious toll on your overall health as a side note it was recently unveiled that a trigger for atopic dermatitis might actually be a high sodium diet because we know that sweat can be a trigger for atopic dermatitis and it salt load in the skin from a high salt diet can be a trigger for flares so it it uncovering what what the association there really means suffice it to say it does appear as though there is an association with high sodium diet and you know flares of stubborn eczema try and be more conservative with how much alcohol you drink whether it be for the puffy face but just to your health in general conservative with alcohol consumption means if you stick to no more than one drink a day if you day sorry that drink it is what it is I don rules and be really mindful of your alcohol portions here in the US we have portion Distortion and so often times a beverage is actually two servings of alcohol so be really mindful of how much alcohol you are consuming it takes a toll on your cardiovascular health not to mention it impairs your neurologic function you a substantial chunk of deaths are actually related to alcohol consumption so there between enjoying a glass of wine with a meal or having a beer here and there to celebrate something or a mixed drink and having alcohol be such a part of your daily life that you require it to relaxed unwind and you feel on edge when you don signs that you really need to talk to somebody maybe about cutting back on your alcohol it it really can be very damaging I believe that people can enjoy alcohol in moderation if they know what moderation is and they adhere strictly to moderation that said in the United States in particular we have larger portions and so that goes along with our alcoholic beverages you happy hours and things like that it adds up but if you can be really strict and restrict yourself to that moderate consumption of no more than one alcoholic beverage one serving per day for women no more than two servings per day for men then I think there reason to advise against that completely abstaining 100% from alcohol you going to get any arguments for me I don with not drinking alcohol there downside to not drinking alcohol drinking too much alcohol will show up on your face the next morning in the form of puffiness more prominent eye bags so all of this to say like there are very simple straightforward interventions that cost you no money well with the exception of the hydrogel patches but honestly you just use a cool washcloth and achieve a similar effect there really is nothing that you should have to invest much in other than behavioral change in a lot of cases to make a difference in morning puffiness tying your ears up not only is not going to work but it unnecessary I don are doing this I think it is just made up to get clicks and Views because somehow Korea has become the New France you know there about French people they whatever they you please tell me are people actually doing this are they actually putting rubber bands around their ears because I to tell you stop doing that it going to De puff your face it going to help with lymphatic drainage to remove fluid from the tissues back to your heart you you may be wondering just ignore it why why pay attention to it but this stuff picks up so much traction and it becomes a thing where people are convinced that this is a good thing to do and unless we talk about why it bad thing to do people are going to continue to just follow things that they see on Tik Tok and there is so much bad information on that app I mean on social media in general research shows that by and large this is where people are getting their health care information from is Tik Tok that research shows people are not calling up their doctors and asking questions instead they can you really blame them because let face it nowadays healthc care is very difficult to access no matter where you live or who you are it challenging so I understand people wanting to take matters into their own hands educate themselves but unfortunately there information out there and it can be very challenging to decipher what is good and what is bad because I have actually seen people with with credentials putting out really bizarre and bad information and so this is even more problematic than just a random influencer being like hey guys I bands because when it comes from like a healthc care provider then people are more inclined to think that it is legitimately a good thing to do all right guys that is about it let me know in the comments what you think of this trend but if you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow bye

Only Eating Fast Food Does This To Your Skin	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3M8yAgdHWU	Dr Day	everything in moderation right [Music] tell that to the internet moderation does not get clicks and Views moderation does not go viral currently there is a Creator over on Tik Tok who goes by the name Jelly Bean sweets who has been going viral Millions upon millions of views uploading videos of herself eating large quantities of fast food daily sometimes multiple times a day and people have a lot to say about what she of her supporters voice their concerns regarding the impact this is going to have on her overall health whereas other people have taken inspiration from her and are creating videos along the lines of eating like jelly bean sweets for a day you guys watch my videos to learn about skin Health skin conditions skincare products from a board-certified dermatologist so what the heck does this video have to do with that well I have seen a lot of people commenting what is the impact of eating fast food daily on your skin our skin it is going on internally eating fast food daily as your diet especially large quantities as is being shown in these videos it let anyone impact how your skin looks how your skin feels and it can aggravate many skin conditions fast food intake in the United States and let worldwide it it has really really increasingly taken off since around the 70s and a lot of it has to do with the fact that it convenient it it was cheap these days nothing is cheap in many cases we just don time to prepare healthy meals maybe you live somewhere where you don access to nutritious Foods grocery stores and fast food is just what is available you have to feed yourself what is it about fast food though that makes it problematic for your health if you are eating it every single day especially in large quantities like this fast food is hyper palatable it to taste really really good it is is typically very high in salt very high in sugar and very high in fat not so good with the fiber tends to be very anemic on the fruits vegetables maybe you might get a lettuce leaf here and there that being said many fast food chains over the years have implemented healthier options into their menus but at least the research I that most people unfortunately don choose those options companies brands they things don keep putting out those types of products they well the money one of the biggest issues of eating a diet that contains a lot of fast food daily is the fact that these foods are not actually very filling they tend to not have much in the way of fiber they don micronutrients however they are very calorie dense a small amount of food for a lot of calories so it actually becomes very easy to exceed your caloric needs and put yourself in a caloric Surplus and put on a lot of excess adapost tissue Central osity meaning a lot of fat in your midsection is in and of itself very dangerous for your health something people always ask about talk about when it comes to food diet and here in particular is isn way going to cause you to have oily skin and acne now I don at any one food or type of meal and say if you eat this you because we don those lines whatsoever it necessarily about one food one food group one type of meal it about an overall pattern of eating today we are talking about how a pattern of eating predominantly fast food can impact your skin this can aggravate acne lead to breakouts and can make your skin a lot oilier as you eat this way you can develop hyperinsulinemia high levels of insulin this along with increases in androgens can lead to increased oil production from the sebaceous gland not to mention these foods are very inflammatory the inflammation The increased oil production all can trigger breakouts not only from the hormonal aspect but like I said this type of food has very little in the way of fiber fiber is very important in our diet for the health of our gut microbiome the gut the skin there communication and so inflammation in the gut can directly impact the health of your skin including different inflammatory skin conditions speaking of inflammatory this way of eating is very void in many anti-inflammatory compounds micronutrients antioxidants while eating a predominantly fast food diet definitely can aggravate acne make your skin oily keep this in mind if you see someone with acne if you see someone with oily skin and they happen to be eating something from a fast food restaurant please do not tell them oh if you just changed your diet you wouldn have acne because in the vast majority of cases people have acne as a result of their genetics not because they ate a Burger the messaging around food and skin can become very confusing and frankly problematic if you do not interpret it with the Nuance but today we are just talking about this very extreme way of eating primarily fast food or at least fast food on The Daily now we talked about inflammation this generates a lot more inflammation in the body and it deprives you of those good anti-inflammatory compounds that you might get from a more Whole Foods diet or at least making sure that you get the Whole Foods in in some way shape or form I would be remiss as a dermatologist to not bring up psoriasis now psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition where you have these plaques of scaly red skin but it also has a lot of internal health problems joint problems cardiovascular disease patients with psoriasis do seem to have a struggle with weight management and we know that eating a diet like this not only makes it harder to maintain one range because again these foods are calorie dense nutrient poor it easy to exceed your caloric needs eating this way leads to an incre in that adapost tissue which drives more inflammation throughout the body putting out inflammatory mediators which directly feed the psoriasis psoriasis is an inflammatory condition then there also hyra Nittis ativa an inflammatory skin condition where you get um basically boils large lumps often under the arms the breast the skin folds they drain they scar down they get these what are called sinus tracts very very uncomfortable and like psoriasis that is fueled by inflammation now it something that you naturally are born with a tendency to develop so it your fault that you have it but if you have that and you eat like this again I and there I this daily be prepared for the high likelihood that your htis suppurativa flares the other condition for which there seems to be an association with fast food consumption is atopic dermatitis commonly called eczema some research suggests that if you eat a diet high in fast food your odds of atopic dermatitis increased by 20% there is a 70% increase in the odds of severe atopic dermatitis in adolescents who eat a predominantly fast food diet severe being the type of atopic dermatitis that again requires more involved treatments to get under control some of what is thought to underscore at least from research the increased propensity for more severe atopic dermatitis with consuming a lot of fast food actually relates to the burden of sodium consumption for atopic dermatitis eating a high sodium diet may lead to more severe disease and it sodium actually is making its way to be localized and stored in the skin to skew an inflammatory localized profile and aggravate the a atopic dermatitis more research is needed to tease that out but it does appear as though eating this way if you have atopic dermatitis is not going to help you out I mentioned insulin resistance recently I did a video which I highly suggest checking out on the skin signs of insulin resistance and it can show up in your skin in the form of what acanthosis nyans it of velvety dark skin thickening that can be seen on the neck the sides of the neck the back of the neck the knuckles the cheeks the sides of the face it really can happen anywhere but it associated with insulin resistance because there are receptors in the skin for insulin when it from eating a diet like this well that insulin can bind to receptors and cells in your skin and cause them to divide too much and thicken the skin you also can develop skin tags these little soft growths often in areas of friction like under the arms under the breasts and when you have insulin resistance when you have an you know High insulin levels if you ovaries to make more Androgen hormones which directly impact oiliness in your skin can cause um pattern hair loss thinning of your hair adapost tissue excess adapost tissue like I said especially that Central adapost tissue it acts like almost like its own working organ system at you know it gets to a point where it one of the things that it can do is increase your it puts out testosterone androgens which have these impacts on our skin and our hair leading to oiliness breakouts a fast food Centric diet is not going to age well likely because the high sugars and the forine carbohydrates that make up this type of diet lead to the formation of what called Advanced glycation end products basically sugars that glom onto proteins and that can lead to premature wrinkling now we all have some degree of advanced glycation end products as part of the natural aging process but eating a fast food Centric diet will increase accumulation of those gives the skin this sowed appearance as well contributes to skin yellowing furthermore a diet like this is depriving you of those anti-inflammatory antioxidant compounds that help Empower your skin to defend against environmental aggressors that contribute to premature aging so you yourself a disservice for the youthfulness of your skin and if you new here I oh my God how can we avoid aging at all cost but we don age our skin because that premature or excessive decline in skin quality from a functional standpoint remember skin is an organ it just Aesthetics we want to preserve Integrity as long as possible keep it healthy the last way way we talk about in which this type of diet can negatively impact your skin might come as a shock to you like I said eating this way is calorie dense so in your mind you might be under the impression that eating this way at least means that you are overly nourished but the reality is because of how poor these foods are in micronutrients it you might think to become micronutrient deficient um eating a predominantly fast food diet can actually put you at risk for scurvy vitamin C deficiency mind you this is not common in the developed world but it does happen and we have seen cases of patients who eat predominantly fast food like we talking fast food 10 to 14 times a week developing scurvy that is the name of the constellation of symptoms that develop when you become deficient in vitamin C because there vitamin C going on in a fast food diet it fresh fruits and vegetables and so you can develop scurvy what happens with scurvy well it impacts the collagen vitamin C is critical for building healthy collagen when you don good vitamin C the collagen really suffers your skin becomes very prone to easy bruising because uh the blood vessels which need good strong collagen to stay intact they they they very fragile at that point so you get easy bruising the blood vessels through your gums are fragile so you get bleeding gums and you also have changes to your hair namely the formation of what are called cork screw hairs these little spiral hairs and vitamin C is a very powerful antioxidant so again this relates back to you know age your skin by eating this type of diet so it all right y in which eating fast food every day can negatively impact your skin but I want to make a few points here first of all if I wasn everything in moderation right like I know I this as I this with a cheeseburger in hand like everything in moderation okay we talking about people who subsist off of fast food it is a very real issue um that is complicated people do it because of various circumstances the other thing I want to point out with regards to this Creator the skin changes I mentioned here I has these changes I want you guys to realize that what you see in these viral videos is not always what behind the scenes we don picture of things so don person not specifically talking about this individual eating this way can impact your skin negatively as it relates to your overall health and along those lines just because you see somebody online doing this it picture of what is really going on you don swallowing the food spitting it out um you you just don you don that a trend of a lot of people wanting to copy this Creator because she very famous for doing this a lot of young people wanting to copy it thinking that it will not be harmful you know when you really young you tend to take risks more readily that you would not once you get a little more seasoned with life so that parent of a young child these are the kinds of things that they might encounter on Tik Tok and be influenced to copy because they just seem okay so keep that in mind not everything you see on the Internet is real let me know in the comments though what do you guys think of this whole Jelly Bean sweets thing of her going viral for doing this I got to tell you she there are other people on YouTube who are YouTube famous for doing very similar things um and again we don know the full picture of what is going on in these people assume anything I hope you guys enjoyed this video if so give it a thumbs up

This Is Scary! Fake Botox And Illegal Butt Injections	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgGSzKJoGZ4	Dr Day	social media is fueling a fire that has always been a burning but now the forest is a blaze we must evacuate what the heck is she talking about I am talking about the intense pressure people are feeling these days to have cosmetic procedures filler Botox however there is a serious Underground Market of counterfeit injectables that people are seeking out maybe to cut costs and the consequence are quite deadly the CDC is now looking into illnesses caused by bad Botox this happened in Illinois and Tennessee two people in lasal County were hospitalized after they got injections from a nurse who was working outside of her Authority they developed symptoms of botulism which includes muscle weakness and difficulty breathing what is botulism botulism is an illness that can be potentially life-threatening caused by Clum botulinum a bacteria people get this from contaminated food as well as in some cases from wound contamination of course with everything it poison it produced by this bacteria is actually something that can be safely administered to not only improve the visible signs of aging in the form of dynamic wrinkles wrinkles that are apparent when you move but also is used to treat actually a whole host of medical conditions non- athetic things such as hyperhydrosis toricos I mean migraines for example iatrogenic botulism meaning botulism that you get from a health care provider super super super super super rare these cases that are popping up are coming from people who are going out seeking injectables from people who are operating outside of their scope of practice or really have even no medical license whatsoever in many cases operating out of their homes it serious in these cases the people are you know hospitalized with things like blurry vision a droopy face difficulty breathing and like I said it can be potentially life-threatening why is this happening ABY and Allergan are the only authorized suppliers of Botox however like I said there for unregulated injectables Botox as well as filler and the issues here are manyfold first of all you have problems with Purity there can be many contaminants in these fake Botox products that cause serious harm to patients also there safety um there appropriate concentration is there uh and there allergen Abby they allow anyone access you you have to be credentialed and qualified to obtain um Botox Cosmetics so for the random person who wants to start doing Botox out of their bedroom with no qualifications or credentials they accessing these counterfeit products they actual Botox there are people out there who are essentially practicing medicine illegally without a license doing these procedures remember Botox while it may seem like you know in the same category as getting highlights put in your hair it is a medical procedure there are complications that definitely can occur albeit rare when done in the clinical setting with someone who is well trained qualified experienced to be doing it but it should be going to someone receive just last week actually these two women were arrested here in the Houston area a mother daughter Duo they were arrested during an undercover sting in Cypress this week that 26 about this arrest well the mother and daughter came here to the house behind me hoping to charge $6,000 for those illegal butt injections instead they were met with an undercover cup and arrested on site 56-year-old consell delbo and her daughter 18-year-old Isabella delbo are both being charged with unlawfully practicing medicine without a license the mother also facing an additional charge drug charge for knowingly delivering a controlled substance court documents show that the women were planning to inject an unlabeled brown liquid into the posterior or butt of a customer that customer an undercover officer the documents also show consell delbo also gave a Xanax to the undercover cop for the purpose of relaxing before the injections Health experts are urging caution about getting injections outside of a licensed professional pre silicone injections in my estimation are dangerous uh they know even though they were done in the 60s and officers also seized illegal substances um the major offenders division from HPD is asking anybody else who may be a victim to come forward reporting from Cypress Jade flurry Fox 26 News a woman says she paid $8,000 for a cosmetic procedure that led to complications and regret she said it was performed by woman who was arrested alongside her daughter in an undercover illegal butt injection sting This Week ABC 13 that people are talking about now all across the country and Jessica we starting to learn more about the people who say they yeah Briana since our story aired on Wednesday four women have come forward calling Houston police with some Horror Stories the two women we spoke to tonight say the mother has been in rejecting people for more than a decade neither She nor her daughter are licensed to practice medicine in 2022 this 32-year-old mother wanted some enhancement just to get bigger butt cuz it that like I want to do it she said she got a referral from a friend saw the work she saw me pictures of other girls and she even said she travels to go do strippers and lawyers said she done lawyers teachers and went to a home in conro where the woman injected her backside with an entire bottle of this on three different occasions it was supposedly hyaluronic acid gel but that it is she says she paid $88,000 6 months later she regretted it the side of my butt would get really really red and sore to touch and I pretty sure it was infected right now it feels like marbles all over my butt it does the woman who wished to remain anonymous called Houston police after seeing this I was in shock I was like whoa 56-year-old Consuela Maria dalbo and her 18-year-old daughter Isabella under arrest following an undercover HPD Sting the motherdaughter duo arriving in Cyprus Wednesday afternoon thinking they injections for $6,000 HPD said all set to do the procedure they found out they were dealing with an undercover officer the two are charged with practicing medicine without a license over here have a ball Consuelo she says also injected her lips regret going to her I do another woman tells ABC 13 she suffering for nearly 15 years and shared photos in 2010 she says she got calf injections from Consuelo and ever since she infections causing severe swelling and pain she calls the whole or deal a nightmare tonight we wanted to ask the mother and daughter about these accusations they have no attorney of record we got an obscene gesture don former clients warning people about the dangers of using someone who licensed according to the District Attorney mother and daughter could be upgraded this woman wants accountability that she goes to jail she does and pay everybody back so they can go get fixed and get the stuff out of their body that I hope Jessica Willie ABC 13 Eyewitness News and here it here they have been doing this for 10 years right like how have they gotten not only how have they gotten away with doing this for 10 years but it really says something that they have been able to sustain this business practice for 10 years meaning have clients people that they are servicing albeit illegally and very unsafely how how is this you know it really just speaks to a demand and you might ask yourself well why are people going this route like maybe it a cost issue but this mother daughter Duo they were charging pretty steep prices so when we it is they issue with injecting something that is not you know regulated it is counterfeit uh it standards for purity safety quality um there often in these types of things there are things that within the injectable that are contaminants and can cause serious adverse effects not to mention the other you know major issue is when someone who doesn qualified is not trained has no has no right to be doing this to people just points and shoots quite literally the potential adverse effects that can occur everything from blindness stroke really deadly so you have that and then another huge risk especially since in a lot of these cases uh the injectables are being done in a non-clinical setting uh where you don and or sterile uh injections uh people are getting serious infections and it infection that oops let antibiotics and it type of infections that people can get with injectables that are done like this outside of a clinical office with a licensed certified qualified physician um it this is a type of bacterial infection that is associated with these types of things and it is not as simple as oh just take some antibiotics and it away oops these bacterial infections um are really really hard to treat the other issue and I before in other videos with regards to risks of even certain skin care products is the uh risk which is quite great here for what is called a foreign body reaction basically you are putting things into your body that like I said can have contaminants and maybe even the concentration of the uh injectable is not quite right your body can react negatively to that uh your immune system will try and wall that stuff off and create what reaction this can lead to the formation of nodules hard lumps and that can be permanent and very disfiguring it to me that these women got away with doing this for over 10 years it really speaks to the demand for these procedures that that people are willing to put their life at risk and I really think a lot of it comes down to a lack of maybe understanding awareness that these are serious medical procedures um because we see it so much online uh and you know your favorite influencer is going here and and there celebrities all seem to have it it creates a um fomo you know fear of missing out I have this I think a lot of people too become victims to this type of thing when they are in a you know dark place if you are out here living your life um you content and you think to yourself hm I I filler in my lips I think that would be look good I want to try it I are you really going to go to some random woman and her daughter in in their home and have it done um you know no I would hope not that not going to be the way most people go but a lot of people are going that rout and you have to start wondering why is it a such a great pressure is there a psychiatric component to it as well a lot of people struggle with body dysmorphia and I think these people in particular can fall victim to this type of thing because it will the mental health issue will get to such a extreme level that they to put their lives at risk let me know in the comments have you guys heard of this I hope this video was informative and bringing awareness to this and a lot of times people online I to get annoyed at dermatologists online who are creating content who always announce himself as board certified they that who cares who cares but knowing that your phys provider is board certified is really important and a lot of people don that means that think it bragging point but it so I actually have a video explaining what it means to be a board-certified dermatologist um I down below in the description box check that out because it really explains why that is the best route to go for when you are seeking out um a cosmetic procedure is a board-certified physician who has expertise experience training qualifications and answers to a governing body um and you know has to maintain a license and adhere to ethical standards so check that video out if you were at all confused but let me know in the comments what you guys think of this if you enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe I bye [Music]	Success
The Skincare Trifecta - What A Dermatologist Really Thinks	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaj05x0SM8I	Dr Day	what do I really think of the skincare Trifecta circulating around Tik Tok you guys asked for it let guys welcome back to the video If you not aware right now over on Tik Tok there skin care side of things regarding the use of three skincare products and a couple of creators two in particular claim that using this routine really just got them significantly clearer happier healthier looking skin so without further Ado I some of the talk so you get a little bit more background on the skincare Trifecta I lovingly call it the trifecta um so my cleanser and I do this twice a day every day I don morning but I do everything else every day twice a day so I do the dial antibacterial hand wash um I like the white tea scent this is my cleanser it what I use to take my makeup off sometimes you have to double cleanse if you have cake face she is chef then um I go in with my retinol which is Neutrogena retinol Pro um I started off with the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair in the jar work up to her and work up to your retinol it burned I was flaking like a snake I had breakouts cuz I was purging it was no bueno I wanted to go back home but I pushed through and I glad I did then for my moisturizer I use Gold Bond um I go back and forth between this and another Gold Bond but the diabetics dry skin relief Leaf body lotion so that dial this Neutrogena and goldbond and every damn day my skin gets better I had hormonal acne I had terrible skin texture my my makeup would not sit on my face I El tobl I for a lot of other people too love you bye so basically it reol there about the essence of this routine it simple effective you cleanse to remove dirt oil and SE bump from the skin surface you moisturize to help with barrier function and you use a Retinol for the anti-aging properties of improving collagen dark spots redness hyperpigmentation improving skin texture it se but uh prescription strength uh retinoid certainly can help clear acne and if you have acne you may find even using a cosmetic re retinol to be to some extent beneficial all right but let individual products promoted in this routine what do I think about those do you absolutely need these are these really the best what let hand wash of this routine I would say be cautious with the dial hand wash is definitely not something I would recommend people use to wash their face now that being said there are unicorns out there that wash their face with hand soap Dawn dishwashing detergent and do just fine okay they are perfectly fine they don their skin is just please just punch with that but generally speaking it can be very irritating for a lot of people because dial hand wash is not a mild cleanser by any means the pH is such that it can be quite disruptive to Your Skin Barrier and my main issue too with dial in particular dial antibacterial hand wash so you name it is that it has balconi chloride and antiseptic in it which on paper may sound good cut down on bacteria that might contribute to breakouts but in reality uh should we really be using that on our skin daily for what indication exactly because because when you put undue pressures on your microbiome with regards to antimicrobials it can have some untour effects namely emergence of resistant microbes it can change your skin microbiome and when we about Benz aloni chloride there is the concern of just putting it out there in the environment as it rinses down the drain going out into the world and impacting bacteria and things that later on could make us sick and while they been exposed to this they have a selective pressure maybe it influences how susceptible they are to the medications we use to treat diseases caused by these things so I fan of just the use of antibacterial hand soap hand wash bar soap for just basic hygiene purposes now of course there are situations where it is warranted maybe around surgery depending on the surgical site especially but by and large it is something that I encourage people to shy away from one thing I forgot to point out here you know I frequently recommend using a benzo peroxide wash to help cut down on body odor under the arms the feet and it acne and you may be saying well what about that causing bacterial resistance in contrast to benzalkonium Chloride benzo peroxide has not been shown to lead to the emergence of antibiotic resistance in contrast using benzol peroxide when you do have to use anti microbials antibiotics actually helps cut down on the overall risk of emergence of bacterial resistance so it other words but it has been raised as a concern with balconi chloride uh when it comes to washing your hands for example we know that washing your hands with an antibacterial hand wash is no more effective than just washing your hands with a plain hand wash um but instead you are just putting pressures on on the bacterial communities on your skin and out in the environment to develop resistance so not a huge fan in that regard and like I said can be really drying really irritating i instead will suggest people to just use a mild basic cleanser a facial cleanser cleanser of you recommendations here on this channel with regards to mild cleansers I put a link Down Below in the description box to some of my favorites but listen if you are using dial hand wash and that seems to have made a difference for you you know don though you have done something wrong that the Durham Police are going to come knocking at your door and and take it pry it from your cold dead hands as they like to say now what about the moisturizer if you guys are new here welcome I am a fan of Gold Bond moisturizers I use them myself and many of them are formulated and promoted marketed as moisturizers for body and for face there out there when it comes to moisturizing people are like can I actually put a body cream on my face you can now some people find that because body creams are thicker in consistency they feel a little heavy a little greasy doesn work out for everyone but I always suggest people try their body creams or body lotions on their face because there them that says you can do that they great moisturizers and if you tolerate it it works for you well it just saves you a lot of you know having to buy this that and the other keeps things even more streamlined so huge fan of that see no problem with Gold Bond being the moisturizer of choice Gold Bond has a ton right ton of moisturizers youall know my 2023 Gold Bond favorite like I discovered and it was you know is a product product I continue to use and see benefits from although I using it on my body is the Gold Bond age renew retinol it texture it has retinol in it it also has Ura and some peptides hyaluronic acid so you know you could do the Skin Care D fecta I don and just use a cleanser and this moisturizer if you really wanted to keep things as minimal as possible because it does have retinol in it okay let about retinol I can lot of people are using one of my favorite cosmetic retinols Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair regenerating retinol or their um retinol uh Pro Plus those are great options from Neutrogena I retinols because Neutrogena a Johnson and Johnson company theyve been doing retinols for a long time they earned my trust long before I was ever on YouTube as a over-the-counter cosmetic retinol to recommend to patients and you will see me recommend it over and over again full disclosure I am sponsored by Neutrogena I do a lot of sponsored promotional content over on Instagram and Tik Tok with them so there is that but like I said I have been a long time user recommender a fan of Neutrogena products and their retinols are some of the best in the industry in my opinion I also have recommendations for other retinols out there um if you interested in those and then the description box I some other retinols I recommend um if you just want to have a list of some options all right so cleanse moisturize retinol why the retinol and do you absolutely have to have a retinol in order to achieve clearer healthier brighter more radiant happier skin um no you don well it helps to improve the rate at which the skin cells of the epidermis mature so you do get smoother clearer skin in that regard it also helps to normalize the turnover of the cells lining your pore so it can help cut down on blackhead and whitee head formation by smoothing the skin surface out you get not only an improvement in texture but you also start to get an improvement in barrier function you know like one of the creators pointed out uh she had a lot of irritation in the beginning that it actually enhances and improves the Integrity of Your Skin Barrier improves production of some of the components of Your Skin Barrier and if you deal with um hyperpigmentation a retinol can help in improving in improving hyperpigmentation and it also with long-term consistent use will get converted to retinoic acid in your skin and it will stimulate production of collagen improve collagen production and that can have a wrinkle smoothing effect and it can just improve uh firmness plump up the skin so it has anti-aging benefits retinol is probably one of if not the most evidence-based cosmical that you can come across um that and you know a handful of other ingredients but it really is the one that it incorporate anything for an anti-aging effect it would be retinol but it would really really really be I mean if you not already doing it it in this Trifecta so I don how good can this routine be that is sunscreen sun protection um I sure these use sunscreen but it not part of what they call the trifecta um I does cuz I but um yeah sun protection is imperative for uh you know keeping your skin healthy long term wearing a sun protective hat when you seeking shade not going out and trying to get a tan not only does attempting to tan prematurely age your skin but it makes all these issues that you seeking to improve with like the retinol um significantly worse and like resistant to any potential beneficial effects you might you might achieve with the retinol so without without sun protection the retinol is completely useless now um all I had to say like is a retinol a must have like um you know you can kind of almost feel a bit fomo if you tried a retinol you found it too irritating it didn and now you Tock after tick tock of gals with clear radiant glowy skin telling you oh my go retinol is what got me here um love my retinol retinol retinol and you oh my god I you know you don use retinol it is not a must have to helping to improve your skin as long as you and staying consistent with the basics of cleansing and moisturizing and you know maybe reassessed whatever cleanser it is that you dial um and you texture so much worse well it drying out your skin because it know a little harsh so you know these gals may be the exception in the in the dial handh cautionary note okay so that that statement you hear over and over again across the board what works for one person will not work for another so be cautious of the dial hand wash make sure you the Sun um you know other stuff can be helpful potentially depending on where it is you definitely see improvement with certain ingredients myself and I recommend them in certain situations but they haves and don cannot get to skin Improvement without these if you have an underlying skin condition you know sticking to a really basic skincare routine of cleansing moisturizing it will support your skin but it need that difference and what that is for you will depend on your diagnosis and you the individual so seeing a board certified dermat ologist is really the right way to go about getting on a path to controlling whatever it is that you are affected by um whether it be acne rosacea melasma there skinc care routine per se that is going to guarantee improvement from those things in most cases there treatment that while some of these things can improve with time we see that all the time in dermatology people spontaneously going away clearing up a lot of times you prescription treatment or an over-the-counter treatment you to need specific guidance on what to use but all that to say um this is definitely not the worst Tik Tok Trend I have seen out there um I think uh it great that people have found benefit from just a basic routine of cleansing moisturizing and retinol um and I happy that it over-the-top unobtainable path to stratum corneum destruction all right y have seen heard read about the Skin Care Trifecta over on Tik Tock um have you ever heard of someone washing their face with dial hand wash or let me know if some of you I I from some of you admitting that you wash your face with uh Dawn dishwashing liquid gasp I don continue to have you watching my videos I am being sarcastic um Dawn is not something I would recommend people wash their face with I caution people with hand eczemas as a side note um to be really careful with Dawn dishwashing because you can get dishwashers hands aggravate your hand EXO because this a strong detergent action I mean it there and break up oil and grease stuck on your Pan um not meant for skin uh but like I said there out there who who are doing just fine washing their face with Dawn dishwashing liquid all right y enjoyed this quick and to the point video on yet another skincare Trend over on Tik Tok probably by the time it goes up the trend will have passed and people will have forgotten about it and there skincare hack all right y like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don I [Music] bye	Success
Bryan Johnson's HAIR LOSS REVERSAL SUCCESS	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrbjPuQ726Y	Dr Day	well hey guys welcome back to part two of Brian Johnson video I the different treatments he is trying to reverse his hair loss I started to lose my hair and go gray in my late 20s I Now 46 it keep the hair I have today I walk you through my protocol what I do on a daily weekly and monthly basis I also going to share with you some special tips on how we gray hair preliminary results but we encouraged now it that the best time to work on your hair is before you start losing it a lot of people wait until they start seeing a lot of shedding don hair care immediately now if you your early 20s mid 20s good time to start taking note that it otherwise it you dealing with hair loss the most important thing is knowing what type of hair loss you have there are many types of hair loss and getting the right diagnosis is key otherwise you can try a bunch of things and they may not be effective and As He suggests treating hair loss early is key to getting the best outcome now the most common type of hair loss in both men and women is something called androgenetic alopecia this is a type of hair loss where the hair follicles for whatever reason are exquisitely sensitive to the Androgen male hormones specifically the potent form of testosterone dihydrotestosterone this binds the Androgen receptor and the hair follicle and causes it to miniaturize turn into a little baby velis hair first thing I do in the morning every day is I wear this red light therapy app it has 312 laser diodes you put on the head you turn it on it battery powered and so I can walk about and do my morning routine without having to sit down it increases uh blood flow and also stimulates hair follicle activity the studies on this are pretty good it treatment we do but still it the stack and so all these little things add up so every day 6 minutes lowle laser therapy otherwise known as photobiomodulation is a light based therapy that uses red and near red wavelengths of Light which are absorbed by selective Targets in the skin and the hair follicle and that generates a Cascade of events that has a cellular outcome namely improving cell metabolism the target is actually something in the mitochondria called Cox and that initiates a Cascade that leads to an increase in production of ATP the energy source and ultimately that stimulates cell proliferation cell metabolism this treatment also can lead to dilation of blood vessels bringing in more blood flow and growth factors low-level laser therapy whether it be something that you pursue in office an in office treatment or something that you do at home is actually a pretty effective treatment option for androgenetic Alopecia as well as another type of hair loss called alopecia Arata there have actually been many randomized control trials looking at low-level laser therapy for androgenetic Alopecia and there are data analyses that analyze all the available research and all in all those analyses conclude that yes this is an effective therapeutic modality to consider for androgenetic Alopecia across all the randomized control trials looking at low-level laser therapy for androgenetic alohia they consistently show an improvement in hair density and hair length photobiomodulation works with hair to increase the duration of the growing phase of the hair cycle that benefit of using it is not only an increase in hair density but also an increase in the length of the hair because you are prolonging the antigen phase of the growth cycle and it something that you actually can do at home in order to achieve the results that you laser therapy you need to do it a couple of times a week so coming in for treatment that often may not be doable for everyone but it can be effective done at home there are a variety of devices on the market looks like he using a cap it long as you are willing to use it consistently so it has to be something that fits into your routine and another advantage of them is that they can be combined with other treatments many of which we things like minoxidil for example they can also be effective for people who are considered non-responders like they don results from the other established therapies out there what are the side effects of doing this typically mild irritation as possible a little bit of itch redness but by and large they generally well tolerated how long does it take to see results from something like this typically anywhere from 16 to 24 weeks although you may see some improvement a little bit earlier all right let on his scalp all right the next thing I do is I apply this topical to my scalp on a daily basis you of topicals like Rogan and minoxidil 5% both are effective we added a bunch of other goodies to our topical formulation we found it in the evidence and then we had a a local compounded Pharmacy make it for us so we and you can take that recipe share it with a compound a pharmacy and have them make it for you kind of a hassle I know but it can also go to uh groups that sell these these formulations they may not have all the things we got you know the basics like Mo oxidil uh then cool but we really tried to create the most powerful hair formulation and that hopefully it to know the things we with on the topical I apply it once a day you can apply it twice a day morning and evening so really your preference 5% minoxidil is one of the most established treatments for androgenetic alpia it FDA approved for the condition you can buy it over the counter without a prescription and we the other stuff in this formula in a moment do you actually need these things are they beneficial but long story short 5% minoxidil it is a go-to for androgenetic Alopecia it effective typically on thinning and and hair loss on the vertex part of the scalp the top of the scalp little bit less so for thinning on the sides but all that to say it definitely can be effective however some people just don respond well to it the drug itself minoxidil actually needs to be converted to Minoxidil sulfate that and it works to then increase the number of hairs in the growing phase of the hair cycle if you before you have to be aware of the fact that initially it makes more of your hair shed that about that hairs would have shed anyway it moving things along more quickly to get the hairs back on track in the growing phase of the hair cycle in order to maintain the results with Minoxidil you have to keep using it um and then when you stop your hair loss will go back to where it was had you never used it so it something you have to continue but it certainly does work for many people although not all because again it has to be converted to Minoxidil sulfate that is actually the active form that requires an enzyme it appears as though some people don levels of that enzyme or the activity of it is a little low they don people who don with mon oxidil they can get a little bit better results when combined with topical troan which is thought to increase the expression of that enzyme the sulfo transferase needed to get monoxy in its active state Also troin may enhance penetration of minoxidil down into the follicle some people who get suboptimal results with Minoxidil alone or don results when they either combine it with low-level laser therapy or if they just try low-level laser therapy like a laser cap at home then they seeing some results so all that to say if you for you um there are some other avenues to go to either get it to work or they want to pursue aside from an oxil but it it one of the most evidence-based things for androgenetic Alopecia and both men and women now he which is very effective there is a 2% strength which you also can buy without a prescription that is marketed mostly for women if you are a man you are unlikely to respond to the 2% strength if you to the 2% strength it and so just keep that in mind I just tell people to go ahead and get the 5% his compounded formula also contains finasteride oral finasteride that you take by mouth is actually FDA approved for androgenetic alpia it so the way finasteride works is it actually inhibits an enzyme that converts testosterone over to this more potent form dihydrotestosterone enzyme is called a five Alpha redu so it reductase inhibitor when you take it by mouth there can be some side effects which many people do not care for and so the idea of having it just to the scalp just to the follicles is desirable so is topical feride effective there is some research to suggest that yes topical finasterid certainly can be effective one study suggested that it is even as effective as the oral however one caveat is that that study only looked at out to 6 months so it term it has the same efficacy but overall it the scalp in theory there are less side effects uh less absorption the absorption is very low that being said topical faside is not completely side effect free reports of side effects include anything from just redness and contact dermatitis of the scalp some people develop Li headedness other people in these studies developed elevated liver enzymes some people had headaches dizziness also um testicular pain I also noticed that his formula has caffeine now I have a video on here all about caffeine for androgenetic alpia topical caffeine that you apply to your scalp it androgenetic alpia it shows uh very good penetration into the hair follicle which is always a challenge with you know ingredients is penetration so yeah it definitely can get into the follicle caffeine is an antioxidant anything that puts undue oxidative stress on the follicle kind of can push things over the edge for more miniaturization but it also inhibits something called phoso diesterase and the consequences of that are an increase in cyclic amp which ultimately promotes better cell metabolism proliferation the clinical studies we have on it do suggest it can be effective can be as effective as 5% minoxidil this formula I noticed also has aoic acid now ayic acid is an acne treatment it it videos on my channel regarding aoic acid there is some evidence that it can inhibit 5 for reductase so makes sense to consider it it anti-inflammatory and then melatonin has a track record of efficacy for androgenetic Alopecia not robust but it definitely uh shows promise there quite a few studies showing positive effects on hair growth maybe through its antioxidant effect or through an anti- andrin effect in the description box I going to link my video going into more detail regarding the studies on topical melatonin for androgenetic Alopecia so check that out if you more info tea tree oil so tea tree oil is interesting it that has anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial compounds in it I always caution against taking straight tea tree oil and putting it on the skin including your scalp because you can develop pretty horrific contact dermatitis all that to say there is one study that looked at tea tree oil for androgenetic Alopecia again because it does have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial compounds the study looked at a combination of tea tree oil and diclofenac which I noticed his formula also contains diclofenac is an anti-inflammatory so the study looked at a a combination of minoxidil diclofenac and tea tree oil versus minoxidil alone for androgenetic Alopecia those getting the three ingredients showed an earlier response in terms of their hair started improving earlier in comparison to the minoxidil only I would say more research is needed also notice he oil in there now a lot of people sing the Praises of rosemary oil for hair growth I will warn you that there one study looking at it and the study that showed that it was beneficial for androgenetic Alopecia showed that it was as beneficial meaning as good for androgenetic Alopecia as 2% minoxidil remember 2% minoxidil is not very good you know it rosemary oil is as good as 2% minoxidil is basically like saying e doesn appear to be that great more research is needed on rosemary oil but uh doesn surprise me that that was included some of the other things in this formula perhaps could be anti-inflammatory um biotin is the one I always side eye to what extent that going to be beneficial you know biotin is really important for healthy hair growth applying it to the scalp I am not sure that a lot of people take various hair growth supplements that that have high doses of biotin despite the fact that taking biotin supplements in the absence of a confirmed biotin deficiency does not help the hair growth and can have negative side effects namely the highd dose biotin in these supplements interferes with the accuracy of blood work that you might be uh um you know that might be necessary for evaluating certain things like oh are you having a heart attack oh is your thyroid messed up um all right so overall though I would say the the formula looks pretty good makes sense you know if you going to go out of your way and compound something it can start getting expensive the thing in there that evidence-based is minoxidil um but everything else in the formula you know it makes sense to have it in there and it may be adding a little bit extra a little bit of extra support moving on what else is he doing and then one thing we do to enhance the benefits of the topicals this and others is we do Micron needling uh we with this so we did it for a while and then we did so many things in the blueprint protocol it kind of got pushed out so we think it think it also a little worried because I was doing uh so many things for my hair I was doing PRP and Micron needling and we were a bit worried that I was causing too much trauma to my scalp so just a note that I do sometimes pair micr needling with the topical Micron needling shows promise for androgenetic alyia creates these little tiny Channels with these little teeny tiny needles and that does a few things it stimulates growth factors to come in and potentially help improve the health of the hair follicle so that you get reversal of miniaturization in theory and it may also activate wound healing Pathways but importantly and kind of what he is getting at here is it allows for enhanced delivery of topical so those ingredients in his formula have a better chance of getting in to the scalp into the follicle in office micr needling shows promise and can be effective especially for nonresponders to typical therapy so people who don get good results with Minoxidil and or you know a um DHT inhibitor like finasteride or dutasteride what about doing it yourself at home I caution about that there is a risk of infection uh and even even getting in an office there painful it can lead to bruising and also foliculitis which is basically an inflammation either related to infection or just irritation around the hair follicle uh all that to say micro needling certainly can be effective people who use Minoxidil may get better results when it needling again probably because of enhanced penetration but be cautious I don yourself at home because of the risk of infection now what about PRP he hinted around that he has done that as well so PRP platelet rich plasma there is evidence showing that it works uh and that people get good results high patient satisfaction what does it and tail you go in they withdraw blood from a vein they spin it down into a centrifuge to separate out the red blood cells they take the plasma which is in theory enriched for growth factors and then they inject it well in this case into your scalp down into the deeper layers of the skin the dermis in theory they are injecting your own growth factors to the scalp to help get those follicles to to you know get back in the the growing phase of the hair cycle can be very painful there long-term studies on how effective it is and in order to maintain the results that you get with PRP you have to keep coming back for those injections another thing about PRP it appears to really be most effective for those more earlier cases of androgenetic alpia kind of like what he was suggesting catching it earlier on uh the follicle has a better chance of responding whereas if you have more significant balding then um you know to what extent it effective it it seems less like two videos ago I reacted to the fact that he has been doing exomes into the scalp exomes are a new Hot Topic area people are all jazzed about exomes so exomes they are little membrane bound vesicles that get released from cells they contain things like growth factors proteins and they of active research interest but I have not seen any any good studies on exomes for really anything in actual people um for for skin for Rejuvenation or for androgenetic Alopecia most of the stuff you know has been looking at cells in a dish type studies uh and you know I have questions and at the end of the day it like all this expensive molecular biology right of extracting these exosomes and putting them back in the skin with a laser show me the data that compares that to just plain Jane minoxidil and if there if there and no harms then then then I excited but uh until then just go to Costco and get the Kirkland I sponsored by Costco get the Kirkland minoxidil um you know that would be that would be my first line recommendation then also there like uh being careful with your hair you know not combing too hard not uh pulling really hard the follicles it uh so just being mindful about that uh not having hair pulling fights you know that care we and more powerful and so this is what worked today all right so yeah I mean don that sounds like you know a light-hearted ending to this but keep in mind that anything that puts undue traction on the hair tight braids tight hairstyles it can lead to something called traction alopecia it uncommon for people to have more than one type of hair loss process going on like you can have androgenetic alopecia but you can also have some traction going on if you really tight hairstyle all the time so to his point yes do not um put a lot of traction on the hair as a side note I have a video All About ways to minimize uh and reduce the risk of traction alopecia how to change up your hairstyles I below in the description box because it your hair again um but you do want to be changing it up and changing things up in in certain ways which I outlined in that video everything he actually not that bizarre or over the top in my opinion he looks like he is responding to Minoxidil everything else he know had he gotten on here and said this was my hair before I started anything I tried minoxidil first and did only minoxidil for X number of months and this is the response I got with only minoxidil and then I moved on to other things like then you could kind of start to see how some of these things for him and maybe you know had more of a contributory effect but that wasn journey he went on he kind of at least my impression from this is he went all in and did all sorts of things um and it all of these things maybe he outlined that in another video but slowing down and reversing androgenetic alopecia it a slow process it takes time and it requires consistency and you do have to you do have to stay on the treatments in order to maintain the results there really no oneandone thing with androgenetic alopecia so keep that in mind like I said at the start of the video Don your hair loss process is androgenetic alopecia you want to make sure you have it evaluated get an accurate diagnosis that is key uh that way you don time doing things that are unnecessary are not going to be effective for you and you also don potential for more effective therapies that actually could you know truly slow down whatever it is that you are dealing with in terms of hair loss now the one thing I noticed he did not include is good old ketoconazol shampoo um I have a video all about this but keton topical ketoconazol it as an anti-dandruff ingredient there evidence that it inhibits uh five Alpha reductase that enzyme that converts uh testosterone to the more potent form that leads to follicle miniaturization so that would be the only thing that would be pretty reasonable straightforward to add all right y that in today video I reacted to the next half of this video where he talks about his gray hair reversal on the endslate I link that video so check it out next if you one give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow [Music] bye [Music]	Success
Bryan Johnson's GRAY HAIR REVERSAL SUCCESS	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtJyWg6eHEU	Dr Day	hi guys in today be talking about reversing gray hair Brian Johnson put out yet another video this time detailing not only his hair regrowth Journey but also what he doing to reverse his gray hair I to be reacting to this and we to be talking about why our hair turns gray and how to stop it we through the basics let me show you what I go as I mentioned before I started going gray when I was in my late 20s uh right here initially it was kind of a crazy time in my life I was building brain venmo I had three little babies I was in a challenging relationship trying to leave my born into religion a lot going on also I was really depressed and so I started going gray by my mid to late 30s I was basically all gray all gray I don little graying in the temples but maybe he was dying his hair back then all right so graying of the hair it is a normal part of the aging process hair color is secondary to pigment produced by cells called melanocytes that reside down in the hair bulb there are two types of melanin pigments you have brown black um melanin and you have this reddish yellow fom melanin and basically your hair color largely is due to the relative amounts and ratios of these two pigments it seeing gray hairs in your 30s uh the general running estimate is that 50% of the population will have 50% or more of their hair gray by the age of 50 there premature graying of the hair which is defined as going gray before the age of 20 or 30 depending on your race pigmentary unit for coloring your hair is this pigmented dark black pear-shaped structure at the tip of the dermal Pilla of the hair follicle but when you start going gray and a gray hair that pigmentary unit it starts to become fuzzy and you see a decrease in the number of melanocytes number of pigment producing cells as well as an overall red uction in their um transfer of pigment to the surrounding cells now we behind what causes the hair to turn gray again it process and in your 30s it is not uncommon to start seeing a few gray hairs here and there but definitely lifestyle factors likely play a huge role and a lot of people report Nuance that graying of the hair or increase in the number of gray hairs with a stressful event I mean that joke right like oh my gosh I can feel the gray hair coming out with certain underlying illnesses anything that puts stress on the body causes a lot of inflammation can be very taxing to those pigment producing cells here when it comes to making pigment it actually a very um oxidative process and when you have an imbalance of the production of reactive oxygen species versus removal of them and handling of them you get what called oxidative stress that can be very taxing on the surrounding structure can be very damaging and it can weaken those pigment producing melanocytes um that are responsible for coloring your hair and as you can imagine they are vulnerable to to a lot of oxidative stress and that is one of the main factors thought to play a role in why the hair goes gray it reactive oxygen species oxidative stress weakening those melanocytes and compromising their ability to produce pigment and then ultimately you know destroying them can you truly reverse gray hair it depending on if there is an underlying Clause that has tipped you over the edge as it stands now the way the science is going it really does appear as though there is a window of opportunity where those melanocytes are still salvageable and you can potentially reverse meaning if you intervene early and address a potential root cause and again we explain what those might be in a moment um if you do something early enough you potentially can reverse and slow down the graying process now I want to make it clear in my opinion there absolutely nothing wrong with gray hair provided it underlying medical problem but we all know Brian Johnson is on this journey to never die apparently and that includes reversing any type of evidence of Aging including growing of the hair so he just testing out a variety of things to see what works and so blueprint we have been trying to reverse it and we tried a lot of things the first year of this effort we were largely unsuccessful over the past uh year we successful now many people have said I dye my hair I actually don going to the salon using a chemical process I did that before in my 30s I haven so so I formulations I use one of them has an herbal extract which has a color and that what you hear the way that was worded if you just glazed over it you probably like oh he doesn dye his hair in a hair salon so apparently one of the things that he uses has some colorant in it but what compelling to me again is we biopsied my hair we looked at it under the microscope and we see that the hair the color is being produced beneath the scalp so it showing the scalp biopsy here but you can imagine depending on where you sample it where you part where you don the details of of what he was biopsy I wouldn as proof that it is working per se so let me show you the two things we use one is a gr7 this is a company in the UK that makes this this is applied I do this uh three or four times a week in addition to gr7 is uh my Rocky this is the one that has the herbal extract that has some color as part of the formulation I use these in tandem so I apply the gr7 a few times a week this maybe once or twice a week and again if you look at my follicles underneath the microscope I of of color in my hair so we like where it hard uh it takes a lot of effort just like maintaining your hair uh when you what these things are so here is the gr7 no more gray hair gr7 professional is a revolutionary anti-g gray hair treatment it stops the processing of gray in a natural way by stimulating melanin and hair follicles thanks to its unique combination of ingredients gr7 professional is the most effective solution to gray hair regain your natural hair color with gr7 professional what is in this magic lotion water isopropyl alcohol which can be drying but um probably helps with absorption and penetration which can really be an issue with any kind of topical for the hair glycerin hydrating biotin applied to the scalp probably not going to do much it know they biotin is really important for hair growth but to what extent putting it on your scalp is going to do anything for gray hair um yeah there research there aluminum chloride andosol ammonium acetate gallic acid is anti-inflammatory as a sulfur horse tail extract also anti-inflammatory beroch root extract tyrosine is an amino acid important for pigment production so I suppose in theory you know technically I suppose it could feed the melanocytes but come on that is a stretch getting stuff down into the hair follicle is a you know formulation challenge for sure I to do anything myoi anti-gray restoring treatment gray hair treatment to reverse gray hair improve gray hair texture restore color naturally you know that is something with gray hair it does assume a different texture it less it rocki boosts melanin production at the bulb and stimulates natural pigmentation the hair is then repigmented and restored to its natural color it types and contains nourishing ingredients that make the hair look and feel younger shinier and Fuller water hydroxy cellulose glycerin propylene glycol to help enhance penetration fragrance um coffee extract may have be anti-inflammatory Gala Roy gallnut that may be the Dy I anything on here that strikes me as like a Dye hydrolized wheat protein can definitely help with brittle hair strands just by kind of basically filling in little gaps if you will and you know kind of strengthening but it a very temporary effect so again this has a variety of botanic extracts maybe anti-inflammatory it may provide antioxidants to the scalp and you know in theory could do this but I skeptical I has decided to use these two things I don I if he because he was dying his hair before allegedly so we don sense and and he currently although not in a professional setting so there kind of hard to assess to what extent he here so like I said a lot of why our hair goes gray in the first place why we start losing color has to do likely with cumulative oxidative stress over time so anything that creates excessive free radicals in the body you know excessive oxidative stress is very inflammatory can push things over the edge classic example like probably the most wellestablished link just based on Association and again Association does not prove causation if is people who smoke people who smoke are more likely to go gray earlier because they are bising themselves daily with an excess load of oxidative stress and they also deplete their body reservoirs that prominent signs of skin aging prematurely and that their follicles rapidly and the rest of their body you know and set the stage for numerous cancers so the number one thing that you can do to prevent to reverse to slow down graying of the hair if you other thing is your nutritional status we know that people who have B12 deficiency one of the signs of B12 deficiency is is graying of the hair newon set graying of the hair there is an autoimmune condition called pernicious anemia basically your immune system attacks the substances that are needed to absorb B12 so you can it in your diet you become B12 deficient those patient patients often have premature graying of the hair check out my video on signs of B12 deficiency that pigmentation of the Palms that important because B12 deficiency is nothing to joke around with it can be you know it can go if it persists you have severe irreparable neurologic damage so it could be an important clue that your B12 is low or maybe you have an inflammatory bowel disease like Crohn the inflammation in the gut get in the way of B12 absorption if caught ear in treated not only is that key for your overall Health and Longevity for sure but it reverses uh then there is also thyroid disease okay that thing uh thyroid hormone T3 T4 really important actually in the production of pigment from those melanocytes that color the hair patients who have hypothyroidism low thyroid their hair can start going gray um check out my video on skin signs of hypothyroidism so for some patients who come in and they have Nuance said graying of the hair it might be worthwhile depending on their medical and family history to check their B12 to check their thyroid because those are things that can be life-threatening if they go undetected and untreated and if detected and treated early they can also potentially reverse the graying of the hair as I said there seems to be a window of time when caught early on these interventions are most likely to be helpful it it process but if you have overlying factors on top of it that are really pushing it for you and you intervene on those early enough then yes it can make a difference then you have patients with Vitiligo Vitiligo is an autoimmune attack on the pigment producing cells and those patients their melanocytes are a lot more susceptible to oxidative stress and to damage from oxidative stress so for those patients it uncommon for them to go gray early um or just start going gray especially when their viigo is very active so there are no promises that you can reverse your graying of the hair some people have a genetic tendency to go gray early if you have family members who went gray before the age of 20 or 30 there there more research is needed to identify the genetics behind why people go gray early but it appears to be inherited in what called an autosomal dominant fashion meaning you only need one copy of whatever it is to um to develop premature growing of the hair as opposed to getting two copies from you know one copy from each parent you only need one copy of the one copy of the memo and boom there you go it appears to be that way but more research is needed and if you have a genetic tendency to go and gray early that know there than make sure you have a healthy lifestyle and you don goes for anyone anybody out there who is thinking of smoking don it the other thing uh that can definitely impact the pigment production of the hair are medications uh specifically certain medications given to treat certain cancers chemotherapy uh some of these chemotherapeutics work by inhibiting a receptor that is necessary for production of pigment also uh there antimalarials well of course used to treat malaria but also used to treat things like lupus uh and these can impact uh hair color chloroquin for example can uh reduce uh the pigment fom melanin have a a change in in the hair color as a result it appears clear that people who go through any type of profound nutritional deficiency they definitely can go start having graying of the hair because again the melanocytes are taxed and that that stress that burden on the on the body it okay we and that who become what have protein energy malnutrition uh severe severe malnutrition definitely can start having graying of the hair copper deficiency not very common but I will warn you if you take excessive amounts of zinc zinc supplements it is possible that it can interfere with the absorption of copper lower your copper levels and you know that might impact your hair color there deficiency with vitamin D deficiency Calcium deficiency um as well as a low fertin fertin is a marker of iron levels um and having um graying of the hair but that really hasn studies here and there are suggesting an association to what extent though would it ever you know we to say hey anybody who gray we should check these Labs make sure they things but we don research to point in that direction but uh also there amount of of research very small suggesting an association with gray of the hair and low HDL that cholesterol you want on the high the htl you on high so those are some things that for some patients could be investigated if if the history supports it not everyone who has a few gray hairs popping up needs to undergo an extensive blood workup that most people are going to gray as part of normal aging shouldn we go unnecessarily testing for so he seems to believe that these two topicals are what is making a huge difference in his gray hair it I any topicals out there that have been studied for improving gray hair there are studies looking at topical antioxidants uh for example uh green tea polyphenols and melatonin applied to to the scalp show promise you know small studies here and there not enough to to really say oh yeah go buy this and put it on your scalp and it gray hair so you have to be careful with stuff like this um you know he seems to think they hard to judge to what extent he truly has had reversal of any graying of the hair you do have to be careful with things like this because there out there that is like approved or established to reverse gray hair and it people cosmetically don those kinds of things I mean if you want to try something like this it appears to be relatively harmless the greatest risk of doing something like this you know using one of these two things he talking about here is contact dermatitis but you can develop contact dermatitis from anything you put on your scalp so just be aware of that um and and you know you may just be wasting your money the other topical that um theoretically could work depending again on if if caught early um not really used widely are the topical prostag gland and analoges you know you hear about latis bamat Prost used for lash enhancement um and I talking about letis and how it works well one of the side effects of ltis is hyperpigmentation of the skin around the eyes it stopping in one of the many potential side effects I should say um but that side effect actually can be you know exploited to our advantage in certain situations and it it turns out that latanoprost similar compound uh show some one person see to get Improvement in in gray hair with with topical Latana Prost so that it makes sense clearly it gets to the follicle in some meaningful way cuz it can be helpful for uh growing brow hair why he chose these products with these specific ingredients I couldn anything on any of these ingredients before I sat down to film this video that are in these products all that to say can you reverse gray hair you can the devil is in the details it depends on if there is a factor that is driving it excessively Beyond above and beyond what is normal aging uh if caught early enough and also dependent on your background genetics uh and and and background genetic makeup some people are just going to be more vulnerable to graying to going gray early and in my opinion nothing wrong with gray hair perfectly normal part of aging and in fact I think a lot of people look really really good with gray hair all right y about in today you want me to react to the rest of this video where he goes into detail about how he reversed his hair loss uh cuz that is you know I videos on this channel about hair loss and and hair loss treatments that actually work um but I have reacted to a couple of his videos now um about the different treatments that he is doing and pursuing as a matter of fact on the ins slate I will put my last Brian Johnson reaction video so those of you who are interested in that check it out but if you like this video give it a thumbs up

Bryan Johnson's $1000 Skin Therapy Explained	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am8lgRiOviY	Dr Day	well hey guys Brian Johnson has come out with a new video on a $1,000 skin treatment that he is doing uh he doing something to his hair and I going to react to it my name is Brian Johnson and for the past 3 years I been trying to slow my speed of Aging as much as possible using data and science today is my favorite face treatment so when we started blueprint 3 years ago I had really bad skin damage I was in the sun all the time as a kid I never wore sunscreen so when we started blueprint we did my Baseline measurements look at UV damage Browns Reds it was really bad I looked like a zombie and we quality for the past 3 years trying all kinds of things and today I share with you my favorite [Music] treatment look amazing and then delivery ex a face all right okay so what we today is exosomes what are exosomes they thing in aesthetic medicine exosomes are little vesicles that are released from cells and think of them as like little communication Vehicles they contain cargo that includes micr RNA messenger RNA lipids cines growth factors proteins and they receptors on the surface of cells and are taken up by those cells and can influence things like the formation of new blood vessels cell maturation cell division they also May influence things like inflammation and cell death they can be soured from different cell types like macroasia endothelial cells keratinocytes which are the main cell in your Skin from bodily fluids like saliva menstrual blood or your blood or plasma they are very much an area of active ongoing research with regards to wound healing flop reconstruction a variety of inflammatory conditions like lupus atopic dermatitis psoriasis and of course they interest in terms of skin Rejuvenation 3D human skin cultures so not actual people but models of human skin suggest that exosomes offer the potential to uh improve collagen production as well as to suppress the activity of enzymes that destroy our collagen so that certainly could have a anti-aging benefit for on skin but when it comes to exosomes you need to bear in mind that the vast majority of the research out there is preclinical meaning not on actual people in human clinical trials and that really important because what happens preclinical can be totally different from what actually happens in the real world when you try and use this on human skin not to mention you have all of these questions that need to be answered like what source is best how do um exosome source from different cell types how does that make a difference for the skin like um in theory couldn potentially be harmful because in in theory these exosomes can guide cell behavior in a maladaptive way it interesting to me that this is something that is being so hyped up because it not something that truly has a lot of good clinical data to back it up and I think in a lot of cases you could just be encountering snake oil that say that it cool area of research but to say it ready for human use I think is premature because there are just so many unknowns in this field these are for the face so we do this tixel therapy which is thermal mechanical oblation it opens up channels in the skin for the exosomes to be absorbed much more efficient effectively we also have exosomes for the hair we laser same thing is drug assisted laser for the hair we PRP so it more effective protocol is getting my face really really dry so I just wash my face I it try so it that go in they like little pyramid shapes that stab the skin at a depth setting between you know 100 and 1,000 micrometers depth so it goes pretty deep uh you know goes through the epidermis which is around 100 micr Ste so you going to affect like the bait thermal layers which is important and yeah it Heats by 400° C I don fenhe like 10 billion fah or something tixel is a non-invasive thermomechanical device that basically delivers heat very precisely to the upper dermis so it uses a titanium tip that has these little tiny pyramids on it that can precisely deliver a little short burst of heat precisely into the upper dermis with without causing spread of heat and damaging surrounding structures it fractional skin resurfacing that is delivering heat and it can be helpful for not only improving collagen and improving wrinkles it approved actually for improving wrinkles around the eye but it also shows promise for lightening up dark spots on the face so it can improve skin tone and because it channels it is also a way to allow for enhanced Dr drug delivery so they using it here basically for both Rejuvenation I suppose in terms of improving collagen and maybe improving any sort of age spots sunspots but also for enhancing the delivery of the exosomes which may or may not do anything what does it feel like uh feels like feel like you on your skin but it benefit ratio is very high it it can be a little painful and that varies from person person to person um some people use a little bit of topical numbing cream other people are able to tolerate it without any topical numbing and then you can do like topicals as well at the same time exone these and C stensil exom typically they can half the recovery time as well which is nice it works on all skin types more easily there light involved and again you don to get the hair removal so with many lasers it around jaw area you tixel should not affect the hair it just going to the very top part of the dermis delivering very focused heat in contrast laser hair removal you know it uses a very specific wavelength of light to Target the melanin in the hair follicle to destroy the hair so you get you know reduction in hair with the drug delivery option as well you can um kind of personalize that to the patient skin condition CU it creates open channels depending which settings you use all do you think every 6 weeks 4 weeks for this um depends on your recovery we are using exom so it could be 4 weeks you know in the manual they do say if you very higher settings than more in the you know 4 to 8 weeks kind of range you don reason why it whole body you can only do so much top anesthetic normally light Decay and other you get overdose it dangerous so in theory it is quite slow but you can do large body surface areas in a single session tixel can also be helpful for improving smoke lines it actually been shown to be helpful for treating dry eyes which is something I forgot to mention in contrast to like lasers where you have to wear eye protection you don protection with tixel um and you can use the Zill which we the skin down to - 10 - 20° uh cold air blowing on it and that provides the pain reduction so they using cold temperature to reduce pain which definitely can be effective for energy based devices for controlling pain it like just endless fun I love every second of it genetically I should be bald I still have hair which is great we we manoil and uh laser diil for a hair cap and PRP we better stuff and now we eomes this is that mixed up so minoxidil is FDA approved for androgenetic Alopecia um and basically it that you apply to your scalp you can buy over the counter without a prescription and there efficacy for both men and women with androgenetic alopecia which is basically the hair follicle miniaturizes it turns into a baby hair it anything so it has the potential to resurrect and grow a healthy hair and the way minoxidil is thought to work is perhaps by improving blood flow to the follicle through that Improvement in blood flow it helps cut down on hair follicle miniaturization and it also increases the duration of the growing phase of the hair cycle you use it daily and it typically takes around 12 weeks before you start seeing substantial Improvement however you have to continue using minoxidil to maintain those results so once you stop the hair loss will resume usually in about four to 6 months of stopping topical minoxidil is generally well tolerated but it of a pain to use uh and it can cause contact dermatitis irritation in the scalp uh however some people don respond to topical minoxidil because the drug itself is not in the active form requires an enzyme in your in your hair follicle to convert it to its active form it phrase and it the enzyme is just not as active so that with topical minoxidil that being said the combination of topical minoxidil plus topical troin can get people over the hump and get better response with an oxidil it with the Sano transferase activity or alternatively troin may also just help with enhanced penetration of minoxidil that will see results others will not and then he mentioned um low-level laser therapy I light therapy can definitely help improve androgenetic alipa especially when used in conjunction with Minoxidil you get better results than minoxidil alone in a lot of cases or for some people who don they try low level laser therapy they get good results so low-level laser therapy with these laser caps I use one myself um I have been sponsored by the company in the past called the iris store and basically it works through something known as photobiomodulation similarly it helps to improve blood flow to the follicle to inhibit hair follicle miniaturization and to improve the growing phase so you get increased density and increased thickness with continued use then there tried um so PRP basically Al involves taking your blood and spinning it down to uh a fraction that is plasma and like growth factors and then injecting that either into your skin or your scalp and a lot of people see results in terms of improvement in in the case of the scalp and Improvement in their hair growth but other people do not and PRP is one of those things kind of like exomes where in my opinion it got hyped up without really good like clinical trials behind it there regards to PRP whether it be for the scalp or for any sort of skin condition you know for the face for example um but a lot of derms offer it do it people swear up and down by it you know there are some people in the in the field who are who think that PRP is a complete scam uh and that it out and hyped up prematurely in the absence of good clinical trials and that there are way too many uh unknowns with regards to it for for whether it be hair growth or for the skin it things in my opinion it of hype but there behind it it sounds like he didn good results with PRP some people do you know some people do I I don it explanation like I said there there are a lot of gaps in knowledge with regards to PRP I view exosomes as PRP 2.0 because it thing we pre-clinical study going really you know interesting area of research but so many unknowns but at the same time it out as something that you know is the next best thing and it heavily marketed publicized you about it in magazines you know prominent dermatologists swearing by it up and down but honestly it are the clinical trials with this in my opinion exomes are super overhyped and to get excited about them is premature which is interesting because I thought this guy was like all about data but I guess he pre-clinical data and not actual stuff in humans which you know that he to do what he journey I suppose um but at the same time you know you have to understand that preclinical science does not often translate to humans if you try and translate pre-clinical studies prematurely to humans you might discover that there are adverse effects that um you didn mind you know people on social media like to Hype up a lot of things that are largely based off of preclinical stuff and it really can do the public a huge disservice the thing about exomes too is like it it presumably continue to receive in order to maintain the results so you know definitely not something at this point that a is indicated by any large clinical studies in actual people B it just seems you know kind of out of Out Of Reach for most people so we to use a 1927 laser open the channels for the drug delivery and then deliver the exosomes which are made of yeah but a combination 10 billion exosomes per vial is a antiage MDX exomes and it grade a mix of human bone marrow stem cells and human umbilical C stem cells here what they the delivery right the thing about topically applied things for hairs you have to factor in it down in the follicle so there are things that can enhance penetration so the 1927 nanometer laser is something called a non-ablative fractionated laser fractionated or fractional basically means going and treating fractions of the skin what are called microthermal zones it leverages the principle of selective photothermolysis where basically the energy is delivered to selective chromophores in in the skin um and that energy uh is converted to heat to basically have a desired clinical effect whether that be improving dark spots um whether it be um resurfacing the skin or in this case enhanced drug delivery really small study looking at 10 Korean men with androgenetic alopecia did show an improvement in hair density and an improvement in hair shaft diameter with this laser treatment they also tried combining the laser treatment with growth factors they got an even better Improvement above just the laser treatment alone uh now they growth factors here they exosomes which as I said is kind of a an area where there are many unknowns not that growth factors um for hair hair growth are a huge area of established research I digress but one thing to point out is that with this study while they did get an improvement in hair density and hair shaft diameter hair thickness um um again once the treatment was stopped that slowly regressed so it suggests you need to continue to get these laser treatments so it to know like well how does this compare to doing at home low-level laser therapy um is it you know more cost effective to just buy a laser cap and do that at home versus coming into the office and getting this expensive laser treatment all the time who knows is it significantly better in the long run than just topical monox I mean it same issue right with topical minoxidil presumably although again we have very little established research um to say like once you stop this are you just going to go back to where you once were if that Minoxidil you know it buy it in the store really wondering if I Frankenstein uh what was that article that came out was like Doctor Strange blood that was my name yep there we go there we have it and going start here yeah you divide it into sections and then I need to get in here too okay y that sounds good what are these look cool yeah you always want to look cool when you around not look cool and with this laser you do need to wear eye protection one two how much better oi than micro needling or or PRP a really good day for therapies we probably the most effective therapy we to go and we [Music] doing all right so $1,000 Skin Therapy boils down to using exosomes which again are little tiny vesicles released from cells that can help with communication and can influence behavior of neighboring cells in terms of improving blood vessel formation uh cutting down inflam infation helping with cell death processes improving cell proliferation and maturation but you know the devil is in the details and the details have not all been worked out um anyway he trying it um and he he thulium uh nonablative fractional laser to enhan delivery he presumably uh skin Rejuvenation to improve collagen and to improve his hair you go in for a treatment like tixel or The Moxy laser and you upsold for this booster package of exosomes and for the consumer you probably under the belief that those exosomes are going to offer you something additional above and beyond what the energy based device by itself has offered and I don really support that I think it way to make more money but if you harvesting you know umbilical cords stem cell exomes and putting them on your skin is it really going to have that same outcome to the cells in your epidermis I I really just don enough research on that everything I seen so far has been pre-clinical and in animal models so at this point I think it honest but let me know in the comments what you guys think um Brian Johnson routines are always interesting to look at I hope this video was informative I did see a lot of requests please talk about exome so I thought this would be a good opportunity to chat with you all about them now I have done a video already reacting to his full-on over-the-top anti-aging skincare routine which I so check that out if you missed it but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe I [Music] bye [Music]	Success
This Is Extreme! Bryan Johnson's Anti-Aging Skincare Routine	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObchFIOjDqY	Dr Day	so Brian Johnson put out a video two days ago detailing his over-the-top anti-aging skincare routine and you guys want me to react to it so let is the largest organ of our [Music] bodies as a kid I kind of destroyed mine I was in the sun all the time no sunscreen and now I paying the price when we started blueprint we had the goal measure every organ of the body including skin and slow the speed of aging and then reverse the aging damage I had a lot of skin age damage and what we various Technologies to measure my skin damage and my age I three things today I with the cream then I you lasers or devices and then I to tell you what you should do on a daily basis I wake up I wash my face with cave it like just enough to keep my face uh blemish free I also micro do Accutane so I currently take two pills a week each one been great I do a few anti-aging therapies that have a side effect of acne for example rapy which is one of the most promising anti-aging drugs it used for people who are doing organ transplants it suppresses the immune system kind of counterintuitive the do I is really great for some acne control all right so a few things here first of all the salicilic acid cleanser in the morning great option as an over-the-counter acne treatment to control bright outs not going to be enough for everyone with acne they may need additional treatments but it definitely a great starting point but using a salicylic acid cleanser also has other benefits it can help improve um the appearance of dark spots sun damage smooth the skin surface exfoliate the pore help with things like blackheads and white heads second thing micro doing Accutane all right I actually have an older video All About lowd do acutane for anti-aging purposes Accutane is the brand name of isotretinoin a retinoid given by mouth to treat acne it works because it is a chotic meaning it dissolves blackheads and white heads and it also is sibo supressive it reduces the output of oil but we also know that isotretinoin can help to suppress um activation of enzymes that destroy collagen in the deeper layers of the skin and isotron is also associated with an improvement in collagen levels as well as elastin so there is some interest in lowd dose isotretinoin for an anti-aging effect does taking lowd dose or micro doing isotretinoin really do all that much for anti-aging the research is sparse and somewhat conflicting there are some small studies that show an improvement in what called solar elastosis basically the histologic AKA biopsy manifestation of sun damage in the deeper layers of the skin as well as an improvement in wrinkle depth and overall skin color but one study actually showed no difference in people taking isotretinoin plus sunscreen Plus moisturizer compared to people just using sunscreen and moisturizer so again the data are small limited conflicting and as it stands now there taking lowd dose isotretinoin for an anti-aging effect per se although there is some logic behind doing so the main issue are you the potential side effects from isot Tre know and so blood work is needed to monitor for those um it is an overall safe drug but there are potential risks such as elevation of the liver enzymes abnormalities in the blood lipids and of course it can be super drying for your lips for your eyes so there insufficient evidence to recommend taking isotretinoin over just using a topical retinoid like tro or a cosmetic form of vitamin A like retinol or retin aldhy which as a side note I saw a lot of comments in his comment section asking why no retinol why no troin what are your thoughts on retinol what are your thoughts on tretinoin I would assume he because he is on lowd dose isot tretinoin doing the same exact thing as the topicals would so it would be redundant unnecessary and if he experiencing dryness from the isotretinoin that may make it much worse but he the salicylic acid cleanser for acne control because because this is the next Point um he comes with the risk side effect which maybe he is taking um rrap sense so this is a drug that is actually an immunosuppressant meaning it lowers the immune system and because of that it given to patients who have had an organ transplant to prevent them from rejecting the transplanted organ it also has some other beneficial properties for certain indications it is anti-proliferative and it has anti-angiogenesis properties meaning it kind of suppresses new blood vessel formation so it turns out it ends up in a lot of cases being really helpful for treating certain birth marks where you have a problem with abnormal blood vessel development now why is he taking it so there is some enthusiasm for this drug for anti-aging purposes um perhaps it influences some metabolic parameters associated with longevity and slowing down the aging process activating certain Pathways like autophagy that are important for uh recycling of damaged organel so on and so forth but but the majority of that research is what we call preclinical meaning it been done in animals mice insects um some M Alan models so that bulk of the research supporting it for an anti-aging effect lies there are some actual studies and people looking at these drugs for um improving immune function in older adults so there is some promising research in that regard however there out there on just taking it and otherwise healthy people for ant anti-aging so it leap of faith there um and again it drug it does have side effects acne like you mentioned um also rosacea really painful mouth sores um you can also develop skin infections pretty readily on this medication foliculitis I have lots of videos on foliculitis it infection of the hair follicle you more susceptible to um different fungal infections like ringworm uh toenail fungus jock itch foot fungus and if you had chicken box as a child you take this medication it increases the risk the chickenpox virus wakes up and causes a very painful rash that is commonly referred to as shingles shingles is not fun because it suppresses the immune system it also delays wound healing so if you get a cut or you have to have a surgery you may have problems healing efficiently properly and plus on top of that you infection it also can cause some weird side effects with your nails make them very brittle peely I develop hair loss on this hair shedding most cases as well as a change in the texture of their hair when it comes to medications it dose he says he you know you can develop side effects out a low dose sounds like you know he able to control the side effects that he that he he this I just applied this at of poo cream uh we weeks like we do with every cream we motivated to see does this work by the markers we can measure so this is basically feeding fat cells in my face because I volume of my face this so Ado cream volum fill in these are topical moisturizers that allegedly stimulate um fat cells to regenerate and replace lost volume in the face pretty big claim check out my video reviewing volue Fillin I go over their study it like a peer-reviewed study per say but what they did on their end I discussed the limitations of it um I skeptical the mechanism here it just doesn cream applied to the skin would actually stimulate healthy fat cell growth um in areas of volume loss and you also would have to question like how is this going to strategically replace loss volume exactly where you want it and not give abent fat growth in the form of fatty tumors like lipomas um so I I think at the end of the day these products are pretty much just moisturizing the skin but we he curious to know what that is maybe he doing like an ultrasound or something of that sort is supposed to help but again we case that in a week or two weeks or four weeks from now it cream graveyard on my counter well we because it worthy of existence in the protocol otherwise it found is that creams don needle on data like if you really address the crow trying to reduce the UV damage which you can machine using multi-spectral Imaging uh you really need to use devices like lasers and other things IPL which I will show you in a minute you know a cream is not going to actually in the most in most cases it take away a wrinkle sure retinol has the ability to improve collagen and lessen wrinkle depth but things like creams ser ums they away a lot of the visible signs of aging they can improve them things like dark spots um uneven skin tone rough coarse skin texture all that to say though using it using skincare products and then taking these measurements you may be missing a bigger picture benefit of using skincare products in that a lot of them because they are moisturizing they help improve barrier function ultimately when barrier function is improved your skin is better able to protect you from environmental aggressors some skin care products have um antioxidants in them which you know I the limitations of topical antioxidants they gaps in knowledge it matter of oh put an antioxidant on my skin it at the right place the right time the right dose the right antioxidant lots of areas where we don to say I measurements that he taking are necessarily going to reflect that those things could be having small but meaningful benefit on the skin over time by helping to reduce lipid peroxidation in Skin say when you go out and are exposed to environmental aggressor not only ultraviolet radiation but pollution infrared radiation visible light uh basically in summary the routine is very simple I wash with this in the morning I put this cream on I just dab it on again trial we put sunscreen on Ela MD I wear sunscreen because the Sun causes damage it ages the skin and causing agent damage so I try to spend my time in the sun in the early mornings or in the evenings when the UV index is low otherwise I stay out of the Sun but when I am in the sun I do have sun shreen on this is a great morning skincare routine cleanse moisturize sunscreen I mean nothing extraneous I the routine simple and that stick with less risk of irritation so I really like this routine and this advice around sun protection wearing sunscreen and protecting your skin from the Sun is also going to allow for these treatments that he moment to work best because so long as you are continuing to have unprotected sun exposure your Skin in there and utilize the tools that you going to be limited because you have that constant immunosuppressive effect from the UV you have that constant inflammatory milu that upregulation of collagen destroying enzymes so it taking you several steps back you need the sun protection to prevent but also to reverse welcome to the clinic here is kind of how we understand reality with blueprint it constructed a diet for my 2,250 calories where every calorie has to fight for its life so we have these ideal markers of where we want the organs to be and we have the food and if the food does not deliver the marker that we expect it to it out the same is kind of true with the clinic where we have these markers for example with skincare like UV damage pore size Reds Browns Etc if we don markers the technology is out and so let me show you how we do these Baseline measurements to get us orientation of where my starting point is this device here is a clinical grade system that typically in dermatology offices it called multi-spectral Imaging and it gives you this dashboard of I think eight to 10 different biomarkers when I started it was pretty terrifying I look like a zombie face you see all the damage what was interesting is my son talage I had a surprise birthday party for him all the friends came up here was really kind of cool like 16 17 year olds and their skin is just beautiful they put their faces in here and then they see their zombie face and they wait a second but my skin looks so great I they much sun damage especially living in Southern California so multispectral Imaging is a tool that basically allows for collecting spectral Imaging and spatial data kind of all at once and essentially what it reading information from various chromophores in your skin mostly melanin as well as oxy and deoxyhemoglobin collagen water so it really gives the to the technology information that kind of gives you some insight into things like hyperpigmentation dark spots moles now the technology has its limits it doesn give you all the information you might be looking for which is is key so for example talking about lost fat in the face probably not going to gather that kind of information necessarily from this reading but um it is going to give you some picture of the sun damage on your face to a certain extent so this is an exilus device this is for the face this is a radio frequency technology this tip here warms up and you kind of roll it over the skin and it collagen production and for tightening the skin so as you age you lose f nness of the skin and less collagen so we trying to revolumize and that was in particular a problem with me because in the beginning of blueprint I lost a lot of facial volume due to my caloric restriction I caloric intake but we increase volume if you see my pictures from a year ago to now it difference I so the exis device is a monopolar radio frequency device with ultra sound and basically what it does is it can be used on the face on the neck and in the Jou are area for like you said skin tightening improving laxity and wrinkles basically it targets the deeper layers of the skin with radio frequency and ultrasound energy to cause remodeling of the collagen and stimulate new healthy collagen to be produced so you get Improvement in tightness and a reduction in overall laxity radio frequency is also used um on like the body for example to Target stubborn fat and to have the outcome of skin tightening so we did this for a protocol we this because we about it being potentially a cause for fat loss so we have a device uh that measures heat we stay at exactly 40 to 42c anything above is used for fat burning but anything below uh should be restorative but just out of precaution because we volume we pending future analysis in the hands of someone who knows how to operate the device and the correct settings definitely not a concern but yeah ultimately it could cause problems with the fat if the wrong settings the wrong hand piece was used on the face for sure also we pause this because we very recently uh positive on a technology called tixel we don the device we uses thermal mechanical oblation so it uses a titanium tip and it delivers these these intense pulses of heat and we found it is safe so we we use RF and they all have these pros and cons there with the technology tixel refining is safe it things like uh firmness and collagen production so I we like the results so far Again by using the multi-spectral imaging technology to measure the markers so tixel just like he says it delivers short bursts of thermal energy to the top part of the scan it approved here in the US for treating crow eyes which um you know that area can actually be kind of challenging to treat because the skin there is very delicate very thin and it um Heats in a very precise way creating these little channels of injury so that stimulates new healthy collagen production we also have things like this device it measures Advanced glycated M products so basically junk build up in the skin you put your arm on this thing and it measures it so adjacent to the face on skin you and so this particular reader you can see here you can find age on the bottom on the x- axis here and the result is your y- axis so for example if you years old you want to have you right here on the result for normal one line below standard deviation is better than normal the one is above I was my first measurements were in the red like I was really bad and so this again is looking at cardiovascular health for the skin so whether you damage or or Browns or Reds or por size uh we across the entire body body Advanced glycation and products so basically these are modified lipids or proteins that have essentially a sugar attached to them glycation and they um form as a natural consequence of the aging process like they certain things that really hasten their formation lead to you know accumulation of these and they can be really damaging to the blood vessels so that what he cardiovascular health um specifically they form in a large amount in a hyperglycemic environment so diabetics have a higher load of these it probably a lot of what contributes to microvascular disease in diabetics but it also plays a big role in skin aging check out my video on the worst foods for collagen because I talk about dietary sources of advanced glycation and products that contribute to premature skin Aging in that video it not even just the food itself but importantly how it are also food preparation strategies that lessen um Advanced glycation and product formation now the tool he is um talking about is an age reader and basically this um works by measuring fluorescence uh my understanding is it kind of helpful and maybe a research setting but it definitely has its limitations and it best tool for truly quantifying these but does give you some information we started using this device this is BBL also known as IPL intense pulse light and there there doing full body treatments there was a small study at Stanford that showed that it changed the genetic expression of skin to be dramatically younger it wasn huge amount of confidence but enough where we play with this so we started doing whole body and it was basically effective at eliminating a bunch of the skin damage because I never had a shirt on when I was growing up as a kid I burned and tanned on my upper body and so I had a lot of skin damage on my face and my upper body and so I basically got my skin back to the majority of that skin damage being gone intense pulse light or Broadband light however you want to call it it is useful for improving hyperpigmentation redness uh tasas otherwise commonly referred to as broken capillaries on the face I have a video all about that um definitely can improve the appearance of those depending on the settings now you got to be careful if you have a deeper skin tone with this because it does have the risk of burning deeper skin tones causing hyperpigmentation all these tools they do have the potential to damage not something to just play around with so I want to make sure that person doing it has the training the expertise and how to use it now there is some evidence that IPL can improve papillary dermal collagen uh however that of mixed some studies don support that so it air as to whether or not it improves collagen but like he said um it sounds like he got some improvement in the visible signs of sun damage on the body maybe things like dark spots redness uneven skin tone possibly coarse skin texture the Stanford study that he talking about um is interesting I I I looked at it very small like he said um and basically they were they sought out to see if there were any changes on the molecular level you know we can see histologically maybe there improvement and sun damage and visible signs of aging either with our eyes or you know under the microscope but they actually want to see are there any differences in the genes that are being expressed and and like he says it kind of the research kind of suggested that with intense pulse light you get genes being expressed that are more characteristic of like a younger skin so it kind of does suggest some degree of you know molecular Rejuvenation but again more research is needed um intense pulse light can certainly be helpful and he he didn say how frequently he sounds like he results another device which we which is kind of like it our protocol is saluma pro it expensive it kind of a big buy uh but I did this for a while it has both red and blue light and red is for collagen production and healing skin Health uh blue is for uh acne so I did this for a bit for blenders control when I was having side effects from some of the medic I was taking but I no longer uh do it so um it kind of comes in and out of the protocol but it because the effect is so subtle and the devices we use have such a big effect like the tixel system or BBL so you have red light and blue light I on this as a side note red light is like you said going to be helpful for improving collagen production it has anti-inflammatory effects and the blue light is specifically helpful for calming down acne now um this definitely can be certainly beneficial uh in in terms of either acne or wrinkles so it not BS logical thing to try um and you can buy these masks I now the results that you get are very subtle like you said not as significant as what you would get maybe from an in-office treatment um only as good as you are at using it so you have to keep using it to maintain those results and then finally let me walk over here and show you this we have uh St red therapy we weren the time I do this uh three times a week uh for 12 minutes so it 36 minutes a week and it uses both red light and near infrared uh but I stand right here in between them it a a hacky setup and uh it skin health for healing for uh mitochondrial Health it even how red light therapy has been shown to be useful for depression when it the forehead so there things that just has General Health benefits and because I do work out quite a bit I little boost to my recovery so this one we feel like the evidence is there to support doing this even though we can directly measure its effect because it compounded upon other things we do so it sounds like he with this um total body red light system that he has you know to what extent that probably not as much as that mask that he was using but like he said red light you know is anti-inflammatory um so it sounds like that what he basic tour of the the clinic you get an idea of how fast we move the things we try uh I we when I started I was in like a 98 percentile U my skin age was like 64 on one of the markers and I recent measurement I was I think to between 37 and 42 so had significant improvements in the measurement okay okay welcome to the kitchen you exciting part I have a few things that are a little unconventional okay I kind of unconventional but on my windows I have really big ones all over the house and I get a lot of sun in the morning at night and so to control the environment we have a tint on here that knocks out like 99.9% of UV I get a lot of comments about my pel skin I vampire that okay but really Sun causes damage it ages your skin it makes you look older so you don objective of blue blint is not to adhere to cultural norms of a tan the the objective is slowing my speed of aging and reversing aging damage that includes sun damage so I try to control what comes in my window when I go outside I take an umbrella with me and I the umbrella above my head that is weird in the United States of America in other places of the world it to be aware that other people do have skin practices that are useful yeah those are great points you know first of all one thing I comments about um are people probably annoyed complaining that oh this is just you know for vanity sake and truthfully that organ and it that people will be more motivated to take care of it for aesthetic reasons and then that trickles down to health benefits for them but really viewing your skin as an organ system is very important because keeping it healthy as long as possible and doing things to optimize skin Health namely protecting your skin from the sun it off in your older adult years because you don fragile Sun damaged skin that is prone to tears easy bruising poor healing and skin infections we call that dermatoporosis just like you wouldn want to do things to accelerate and increase the severity of osteoporosis bone thinning why would you want to do the same thing or be okay with doing the same things for your skin yes sun does come through window glass UVA rays specifically most window glass will block out UVB the Rays that burn the skin but UVA does come through window glass now your exposure to that is going to vary depending on the time of the day where you live and how close you sitting to the window but he has some pretty big Windows lives in a very sunny climate so yeah overtime that is quite a bit of UVA um enough to you know if you spend a lot of time in that room maybe you indoors for sure but he has taken it to another level in terms of getting some kind of film on the windows to block out the UV I also really like the advice of carrying an umbrella with you I would add a hat Sun protective hat also can go a long way try to avoid damaging your skin this happens when there means so between 10:00 a.m. and 400 p.m. every day roughly in that window of time it higher in the summer than it is the winter the most effective thing to do is avoid the damage if you outside wear sunscreen ltmd is a good option it or if you can avoid it all together even better but really uh for the basics we can all agree upon let damage have a good diet and we to a good starting point I actually really like the ending message there something for everyone that can incorporate into our lives it doable very actionable it what I say on this channel what you know you can find on any professional dermatologic um information Source American Academy of Dermatology Etc protecting your skin from the Sun is like the most proactive thing that you can do to keep your skin healthy long term and I like throwing in the aspect of a healthy diet I would also add you know making sure that you good sleep um exercise which sounds like he does these are all things that we know we Health it pays off dividends for our skin I like the fact that the skincare routine is very basic simple sustainable cleanse moisturized sunscreen I mean that need now the other things that he doing you know certainly are way above and beyond what is necessary for skin health and to what extent they actually going to make a huge difference it like right to see he his own little self- experiment not really pushing you to do them just kind of watch and see what happens I guess approach so use discretion hopefully this video of me responding pointing out some of the potential risks of some of these things and what they can and cannot do you know gives you a little bit more background also this is very cost prohibitive for the majority of people out there I can much money all this cost yeah it interesting to see what happens let me know in the comments though what do you think of this extreme skincare routine but if you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow [Music] bye	Success
Tretinoin Causes Death & Is Banned?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwU8soyyP-k	Dr Day	well hey guys in today to be reacting to topical retinoids to reverse skin aging this is a video from nutritionfacts.org in yesterday I reacted to their what is the most important anti-aging cream ingredient so definitely check that video out if you missed it sunscreens are intended to prevent further facial photo aging but can dramatically reverse damage presently visible whereas topical retin oids are the most important drug class to reverse the signs of aging also known as alltrans retinoic acid tretinoin sold under a variety of Brands including retin A is a prescription only topical form of vitamin A that can visibly improve mild to moderate photo damage including refin and coarse wrinkles freckles other pigmentation and improve overall skin texture after months of daily use this is accompanied by restoration of collagen formation recently I did a video for you guys the other day on what retinol actually does to your skin we go over like the nitty-gritty biologic details of what is happening on the molecular level at different levels in your skin I mean if you really want to understand the science of how retinol works in your skin you need to check that video out but um one of the advantages we have discovered of using a topical retinoid is that it can improve the appearance of wrinkles because it gets down to the deeper layers of the skin to not only improve collagen production to smooth out wrinkles but also to help actively protect the collagen that you have skin biopsy taken before and after 10 to 12 months of trenin versus placebo found that while skin collagen formation dropped 14% in the control group it Rose 80% in the retinoic acid group The downsides are the side effects so common they have their own name retinoid reaction plaguing a high proportion of patients including redness stinging burning itching and peeling um ironically the constant irritation may be a conso mechanism constantly forcing the skin to renew the adverse effects do tend to improve over time after Peak after about two weeks of daily use and you can minimize the irritation people experience with uh topical retinoid a lot of it actually has to do with receptor selectivity so you that um when it comes to the prescription grade retinoids including the over-the-counter um retinoid adapalene um as as they come out as you get newer retinoids being launched often times what you newer retinoids they have better uh specificity better selectivity for certain receptors in the Skin So ultimately that is part of why they are less irritating so they all work to improve skin cell turnover but some of them are more specific in terms of The receptors and for that reason they are less irritating like adapalene is substantially less irritating compared to troin troin was the first first generation retinoid topical we also have Tartine adapalene now we have tritin which is super specific so much so that you hardly need any of the actual active drug in there it that reason it can be used to a large body surface area and is actually FDA approved for treating acne on the trunk in contrast to the other prescription retinoids but yeah the major the major side effect with tretinoin especially but any topical retinoid is drus peeling irritation we now have a newer form of tretinoin called Alano lotion it is in a much more like moisturizing hydrating base it has hyaluronic acid it has collagen people seem to do better with that but I also have had patients say h this is very irritating I don so I don just the drug companies hyping up the the base in alrol it so I on how to introduce retinoids into your skin care routine to minimize this dryness and irritation the tips are basically introduce it slowly you know starting you know every other night or once a week if you and then gradually increasing to Nightly moisturize U make sure you other things alongside the retinoid like um Alpha hydroxy acid Sal iyc acid things that exfoliate not to say that those can never be used with a retinoid but they do increase the irritancy and when you are trying it out for the first time starting it for the first time you don increased irritation there approach for introducing it for the most sensitive person out there called short contact therapy so check that video out if you found that no way no way Jose can it try try checking that video out give some tips there about short contact therapy use and you can minimize the irritation by starting at a lower concentration for example 025 per instead of 0.1% and slowly ramping up from applying at first twice a week for a few weeks then every other night for a few more weeks before finally advancing to Nightly application as tolerated yeah and the point there too about the percentages people always get hung up on the percentage of retinoid that they using and this idea that oh I started at a low percentage so you know I tolerating it surely I must graduate no the lower percentages namely for anti-aging in particular they effective as higher but less irritating and so you know 0.025% tro and if you using that for anti-aging purposes don feel as though there to 0.1 it more significant for collagen production for anti-aging purposes um now if you are you now if we to treat a skin condition like acne some people require the higher dose say in the case of acne some people lesions are thicker um they get better absorption of the drug at a higher at a higher concentration but higher more side effects more irritation more dryness given that a small amount is systemically absorbed out of an abundance of cautious women of childbearing capacity may want to steer clear given the severe birth effects caused by a similar drug I CRA uin sold formally as the acne drug acutane so when it comes to applying retin retinol whether it be the Cosmetic stuff or the prescription uh retinoids we don advise using them during pregnancy now um if you taken by mouth like isotretinoin which as he pointed out is commonly called Accutane there there are a lot of other oral retinoids out there actually um but that familiar with right um that is 100% a noo in pregnancy it if a woman gets pregnant on Accutane their child will have severe birth defects usually incompatible with life I mean it don ones you put on your skin are actually are they equally harmful in pregnancy probably not because trano for example it um not to mention the stuff you get over the counter whether it be ad daping and over the counter r oid medication or retinol creams retin aldhy creams those are even less uh absorption check out my video as a side note on retinol in pregnancy I go into the nitty-gritty um I do recommend avoiding it in pregnancy but I want you to watch that video because a lot of people get pregnant and don planning to get pregnant and they may find out and then they realize they been using a retinol and freak out don freak out don video it will put your mind at ease but um yeah there are gentler less potent overthe counter topical retinoids retinyl retinol and retinal there retinol acetate retinol palmitate propionate retinol retin alide once absorbed into your skin your body can convert them into small amounts of retinoic acid however data is limited on these nonprescription retinol so those are cosmetic ingredients they drugs like your doctor tell you to use a Retinol for acne they alahh for acne they prescribe you one or tell you to buy the over-the-counter adapalene the results of clinical trials on the retinal Esters have been routinely disappointing even 48 weeks of daily use was found to be ineffective for reducing wrinkles compared to Placebo so the retinyl Esters retinyl palmitate for example those are not going to do what retinoids retinol or retin alahh can do those do not have a track record of having any promise in improving collagen production in the deeper layers of the skin are targeting hyperpigmentation those ingredients they so if if you an anti- wrinkle cream and it has a retinyl Esther it doesn or retin alide in it it doing what much of what you want it to do basically what those ingredients do in skincare products um for the most part is they act as antioxidants they may help with formula stability they may even to a certain extent act as antioxidants on your skin so they completely useless but just understand that those ingredients they don the backing that um of course prescription retinoids do they don have the track record that even retinol or retin aldhy does retin aldhy and retinol however hold some promise there was a 48 we head tohe head trial of retin alide versus retinoic Acid versus placebo now retinoids can be so irritating it to Blind participants as to whether or not they objective measures that may be less susceptible to Placebo effects are especially important so what they did is make silicone molds of the crow wrinkles around the eyes of the participants before and after being randomized to one of those three groups and then analyze scans of the molds using highresolution Digital Image processing the retin alide group showed a similar reduction in fine lines and wrinkles as the retinoic acid group with less irritation only 23% of the retin aldhy group experienced skin irritation compared to 71% in the retinoic acid group versus 4% in the placebo cream group of all the non retinoid options retinol may be the preferred choice though it causes even less irritation than retinol insignificantly different than Placebo and a randomized double blind Placebo control trial found that 52 weeks of use improved crow Fine Lines by 44% and model pigmentation by 84% um when it comes to retinol o or retin alahh the stuff that you to get over the counter these are Cosmetics when it comes to their efficacy it all boils down to how good the formula is uh for example you can have the um you can have a r alahh cream but maybe it and it degrades uh so it whereas you can have a really good well formulated retinol that performs better in that case so just be aware of that like there good evidence that using one is better than the other but tretinoin roric acid has by far the most robust track record of efficacy so why not just ask your doctor for a prescription yeah I mean troan has been around the longest right it there retinoids adapalene to zerene topical isotretinoin uh gel which we don here in the US but other countries do all of these have research behind them to support their efficacy for improving the signs of skin aging just not as much research as Treno one like Tran is the one where we have the most and the most clinical experience with using it and the reason we have the most clinical experience using it is it got FDA approval as an you know for improving wrinkles record of efficacy so why not just ask your doctor for a prescription because long-term topical trenin use may increase your risk of an even more stinging side effect death topical tretinoin therapy and all cause mortality the Veterans Affairs topical tretinoin chemo prevention trial was to be a six-year randomized control trial to see if it could help prevent skin cancer but the trial had to be stomped early because significantly more people were dying in the retinoic acid group than the placebo cream group at the time the study was halted 19% of the subjects in the tretinoin group had died compared to 14% in the placebo group between 1 to 8% of topically Applied retinoic acid is absorbed into the bloodstream could it be killing people we don deaths was a statistical fluke that happened by chance or a real biological effect the probability that we such a discrepancy just by chance is about one in 100 tretinoin continues to be banned in Europe for cosmetic purposes well he really left us on the edge of our seats there all right first of all band in Europe uh that is a scary sounding term banned in Europe people are prescribed troin in Europe um but it throw that that term that language around banned in Europe all the time they don means they Europe but a lot of times if you actually take the time to go in and look at what the legis is there and what the details around it are you the laws they have there and the legalities around an ingredient are the exact same as they are here in the US the way this was worded and presented is a little misleading because um it sounds very scary you know retinoic acid is banned troin is banned in EU in cosmetic products it than in the US you can store into Target and buy troan over the counter it is a prescription only medication um so it cosmetic products here in the US either but um if you look at the document there clearly they allow retinol and retinal Esters just as here in the US which you wrinkle cream so it different and uh it troan is banned so keep that in mind all right but let pulls up because we about this study together in the past the the VA study but it revisiting for those of you who are new especially if you are coming here from this video so we that because of Tran reversing sun damage it beneficial for people who make a lot of skin cancers related to cumulative sun exposure in 2009 there was a study that sought to examine the efficacy of troin 0.1% cream as a preventative for squa cell carcinoma and basil cell carcinoma those are types of skin cancers it was done in a population of older adult primarily males around the age of 70 at the VA they were veterans the veterans you know here in the US received their care at the VA they wanted to see if it would have any impact on basil cell carcinoma and Squam cell carcinoma this they started enrolling participants in 1998 but they had to stop the study prematurely because they observed an increased in deaths in those who were using troin compared to those who were not so they wanted to see if they could tease out why these people were dying and it was actually really hard to do they went in and looked at the VA Master death list but as you can imagine an issue here is that this study never sought out to look at death so they aren the get-go so there is a lot of missing information here in terms of what these people were dying from and what their background medical history really was a lot of it was not taken into account initially because that was not the point of the study when they looked at the causes of death as best they were able they really couldn cause of death but by and large it seemed as though the majority of the deaths were related to problems with the vascular systems heart attacks or lung disease here intriguing because these are problems that are a lot more common in people who smoke the reason this is of interest is because there are actually two very large studies that were conducted to look at Oral vitamin A you know by mouth not a topical cream as a prevention for lung cancer and these two trials both actually showed an increase in lung cancer in smokers with the oral vitamin A intervention so like the question has always been are there some sort of metabolites in like maybe tobacco smoke or the vitamin A that interact with one another concentrate in the lung to push lung cancer formation in smokers there also some research that suggests that certain lung cancers metabolize troan faster in compared into healthy lung tissue again perhaps the tobacco plus the Tron and metabolites could that be increasing lung cancers and people who smoke it though that these are just speculations they does not prove causation you can find an association with many things eating ice cream and risk of drowning well a lot of people eat ice cream at the beach you probably more likely to drown at the beach doesn you drown again Association does not improve causation and we have a lot more things going against the idea that tro and applied to the skin is somehow going to be harmful cause a long cancer or increase your risk of death we actually have studies looking at the shortterm and long-term long-term up to a year in terms of systemic absorption of troin from applying it to the skin it actually very very very small one important point about the VA study is there with dosing of trano and risk of death if Tran causes death you would expect to see a stronger increased risk of death and people using Tran more frequently however when the researchers went back and looked at the number of uh tro and prescription refills there was no association with an increased number of refills and an increased risk of death there also was no association with an increased risk of death and the increased frequency of use in the study participants either use trano once a day or they Ed it twice a day there difference and no increased risk in those using it twice a day compared to once a day and there specificity of type of death one would assume that if tranan was going to increase risk of death it would probably be an increase from one specific cause but the people dying in the study they died of different causes and again the study did not set out to look at death so there is a lot of information missing from this in summary the study did not prove that troan causes an increased risk of death and I don concern that troan is harmful that it puts you at increased risk of dying we have been using troan for over 50 years and we have not observed any increased risk of death in people using it we haven from using tranan and this has never been repeated ever again there have been other trials out there looking at troan and we don they wouldn and it is frequently brought up you have to understand the nuances of the study and it harmful whatsoever all that to say you know troan is not a must have for people to be using to reverse sun damage uh you know it can be definitely beneficial in the treatment of a wide variety of skin conditions but the most important thing that you can do proactively for your skin to keep it healthy longterm including red reducing your risk of cancer is sun protection in the form of not only sunscreen but Sun protective clothing uh broad brimmed hats seeking shade when you know if you have young children out there starting these habits early is really going to pay off dividends really going to pay off dividends for them in the long run all right y response to this video I hope you guys enjoyed it I hope it was informative if you liked it give it a thumbs up share

What's The Most Important Anti-aging Cream Ingredient?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy1_lRWHxU	Dr Day	well hey guys so I came across these videos from nutritionfacts.org the first one is what is the most important anti-aging cream ingredient I react to it in today it [Music] up what is the truth about over-the-counter Anti-aging products which constitute a billion dooll industry there is a psychological effect from spending more wrote a team of dermatologists but don fancy packaging and high prices for a long time I have emphasized this on this channel that you don lot of money to get good quality skincare products you know when I first started on YouTube I feel like a lot of people were sold this idea that they needed to buy medical grade skincare when really medical grade is just a marketing term to amp up the price and sell the consumer on this idea that it somehow you know more effective um I don but rather the marketing the deception but I think now in 2023 consumers have wised up they know that there are better options in the drugstore and our wallets are getting tighter with inflation so people are less willing to drop big bucks on a moisturizer they have wised up let I many products advertise dramatic results that are frequently exaggerated and misleading and are rarely scientifically supported an independent product testing Institute questioned the efficacy anti-aging creams generally find that beneficial effects could only be picked up using sensitive instruments without becoming clinically or noticeably detectable they suggest these products may not work any better than typical moisturizers that pointed out a lot uh when it comes to skincare products there actual highquality research to really support like do the formulations actually work to do what they say that they do when it comes to certain ingredients in anti-aging creams much of what what you rely on are industry studies done by done by the supplier and a lot of that is kept behind closed doors things that we are not privy to there are no big clinical trials and so to separate out whatever demonstrated effect they have shown or claiming from Simply the benefits the effects that one might achieve with simply putting on a moisturizer I mean a moisturizer for a dollar without any of these Jazzy ingredients you always have to remember that that being said there are some evidence-based cosmetic ingredients in skincare products many of which I covered on here before are they like the most rigorously evidence-based like super Placebo controlled trial type no but there are some ingredients not you know show promise cross-sectional studies of Chinese and British women found that those who regularly used facial moisturizers were guessed to be about 2 years younger than those of the same age who didn larger Dutch study did not and regardless snapshot and time studies can never establish cause and effect studies on moisturizers are limited but they can improve the appearance of dry skin which can otherwise look discolored flaky and rough moisturizers can hydrate the skin and may reduce the appearance of Fine Lines by 15 to 20% called the oldest trick in the Cosmetic industry but may not do anything to treat the underlying cause when it comes to skin care you can try all the Exotic ingredients out there peptides growth factors but the benefits of moisturizing of replenishing moisture content in Skin off dividends at least in the short term for improving not only the appearance of the skin but it definitely can support the needs of the Skin Barrier as we get older um the components that maintain our Skin Barrier they start to decline and we do know that moisturizers can help aid in moisture retention they contain ingredients that help Hy hydrate the skin so I wouldn not any proof that they work they definitely do and in fact they are a Mainstay of the skin condition at topic dermatitis where there is a problem with the Skin Barrier and and we know they can improve the appearance of the skin and when he trick in the Cosmetic book it again is it just that basically what you have here is just another moisturizer whether facial Foundation or night cream or anti-aging serum the formulations of most skin products are basically a moisturizer combined with purported active ingredients for marketing appeal which ingredients are actually active anti-aging agents I up to 90% of visible aging of someone face is due to sun exposure from an anti-aging standpoint the most biologically active ingredient in skin products is sunscreen consider the most important thing to maintain youthful skin is the daily application of sunscreen and other protective measures like wearing a hat all other things you can do for your skin pale in comparison especially for those with pale skin um as far as the stuff that you are like actively putting on from the outside onto your skin you know it sun protective behaviors too like you can put on all the sunscreen in the world but it you put on a bunch of sunscreen and you spend all day Outdoors you don shade um you UV index is very high it going to do you many favors in fact some argue that it might actually lead you to get too much sun exposure you confident again it armor but that being said sunscreen is one of the most it is the most evidence-based anti-aging thing out there um for protecting your skin from premature skin aging from the Sun um but then of course you know you have your lifestyle habits and things like eating a balanced diet getting exercise not smoking um but those aren things that you buy in a jar per se prevent skin cancer the American Academy of Dermatology recommend sunscreen with ANF of 30 or higher but an SPF of 15 can prevent skin aging how do we know because it adults were randomized to years of daily sunscreen use or to continue their own discretionary use it was considered unethical to withhold protection by giving people Placebo sunscreen in the end 77% in the recommended daily sunscreen group were applying sunscreen at least 3 to four days per week compared with 33% in the discretionary use group would that be enough of a difference to make a difference yes there was significantly less skin Aging in the instructed daily use group in fact they suffered no detectable increase in skin aging over that 4.5e study the researchers concluded daily sunscreen use protects against skin aging yeah I I mean the majority of what prematurely ages our skin is ultraviolet radiation both UVB the Rays that are you know get to a more superficial part of the skin they damage DNA and then UVA penetrates deeply and destroys our collagen and they both have a role in suppressing the immune system so they make the skin less able to repair from damage less able to clear out cells whose DNA has been damaged and part of what leads to skin cancer risk and when we talk about in this context some prot some protection for anti-aging purposes people get all hung up on this you know rebuttal that oh well I don for the sake of not having wrinkles it just cosmetic vanity nonsense but premature skin aging it is basically like it and people need to think of it in that way because once you get into your older adult years if you have extensive sun damage not only do you put yourself in the category of risk for uh skin cancers of course depending on your skin type but also the skin it is damaged it is weakened it may it tearing secondary infections poor wound healing it morbidity and I compare it to your bones you thinning of the bones it happens in everyone to a certain extent as part of the normal aging process like if you are lucky enough to live to 95 guess SWAT on a dexas scan there be some detectable osteoporosis there some detectable thinning of the bones it likewise your skin is is going to thin as part of the natural aging process it natural aging process that we to escape is premature accelerated because that putting yourself at risk for adverse health effects in the case of your bones you know there are certain things that can happen to an individual throughout their life or genetic factors that put them at risk for premature or you know excessive if you will bone thinning osteoporosis and we all know that something that is good it with a lot of health problems in older adults coming from the skin pers perspective you have what as dermatoporosis thinning of the skin and the things that you do throughout your lifetime can influence that just like osteoporosis is not something that we want to aim for especially prematurely we don extreme dermatoporosis either so that really how you need to approach why it important to protect yourself from the sun it benefit although that can be a motiv motivating factor for sure um in contrast you don on a day-to-day BAS basis so it to ignore your skeletal system whereas your skin is like staring you right there in the face although sunscreens are primarily intended to prevent further facial aging rather than reverse photo damage already done some in the daily sunscreen use group did show an improvement in skin texture the results are all the more striking given the control group was told to continue to use sunscreen and hats whenever they thought necessary suggesting people are poor judges or planners for excess UV exposure when left to their own devices this is why I heavily encourage people to make it a habit to protect their skin on a daily basis I will often get questions like well what about if I going to be inside most of the day what about this what about that should I you know do I really need to be wearing sunscreen every single day and you know of course you have to make a choice for yourself what makes sense to you but we know that people who make it a habit on a daily basis and are consistent with it that if you are an intermittent user you less likely to have it on board on your skin when you need it so a daily facial moisturizer with an SPF 15 and it is recommended even if it raining outside considered the gold standard for anti-aging skincare daily use of sunscreens in the day time and retinoids at night I want to bring your attention too to the fact that SPF 15 you know the recommendation is SPF 30 but if you actually look at these research studies examining the efficacy of sunscreen they show these benefits FS at SPF 15 so you might be saying well why not just use SPF 15 like do I really need SPF 30 the reality is that in real world use conditions people underly sunscreen and we know that at least if they have a higher SPF they are more likely to get the amount of protection on their skin that they need to protect from premature skin aging as well as skin cancer but you know all that to say if you are using a sunscreen or facial moisturizer that consider it useless um it know provided you are applying it at a sufficient density to your skin it can work and it 15 can work um the the right amount however it amount so you need 2 milligram per cm squared of sunscreen and a lot of people you know that it the other thing that applying sunscreen is to make sure that you get it on all Sun exposed areas a lot of people skip like their ears uh their forehead upper lip neck um common areas to forget or the backs of their hands if you don protection if you protection any over-the-counter especially anti-aging cream it not really you know doing much because you are taking your skin several steps back now when it comes to to skin types paler skin types are more susceptible to sun damage to premature skin aging but deeper skin tones also can be their skin is also negatively impacted by unprotected sun exposure I that out because there is a misconception that if you have a deeper skin tone there your skin from the Sun you vulnerable the other thing he points out is that sunscreen is intended to uh prevent not reverse existing sun damage definitely is intended to prevent against sun damage uh by protecting from UV however there is research to suggest that it can help with reversing some of the visible signs of skin aging especially uh it who have a deeper skin tone and they have a lot of dis pigmentation dark spots uh that happen as part of the natural aging process but are aggravated accelerated enhanced by unprotect protected sun exposure women who were instructed to use sunscreen on a daily basis who had a lot of these sunspots and had a deeper skin tone the end of the of the study period after several weeks I think probably 12 weeks I to go back and look but they had a significant reduction in the appearance of these dark spots and so if you again if you are pursuing any kind of skin care for an intended purpose sun protection really brings it together and really allows those things to work UV unprotected UV exposure it really just takes your skin several steps back and prevents these ingredients from really doing what they you want to use an antioxidant serum um antioxidants may help lessen the burden of oxidative stress but there there are many unknowns when it comes to antioxidants and skincare do they actually get into your skin it simply a matter of just put antioxidants on the skin and they scavenge excess free radicals they have to be at the right place at the right time the right formulation so it area where there is a lot there many unknowns but say you have the perfect antioxidant serum you the skin but your skin is not being protected from UV rays well you bising more reactive oxygen species generation and it that little ascorbic acid in there is it really doing that much at this point no back the bus up and focus on sun protection consider the gold standard for anti-aging skincare daily use of sunscreens in the daytime and retinoids at night retinoids I [Music] next all right that what is the most important anti-aging cream ingredient from nutritionfacts.org this is a very good video highlighting key points about the need for sun protection ction in an anti-aging regimen um tomorrow I will do a video reacting to this next video topical retinoids to reverse skin aging so come back check that out cuz there a bit of a controversial point at the end and I want to talk about it but if you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don

Why Is Gen Alpha Skincare Obsessed? Dermatologist Weighs In	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kfjHxUqfo	Dr Day	well hey guys today I want to talk about something that is really popular right now and that is this Fascination that the young kids these days have with these complicated skincare routines we different types of products toners exfoliants Anti-aging products at the age of 10 yes I am seeing this it is happening right now in fact gen Alpha which is kids born after 2010 they are anticipated to be a group who is going to contribute substantially to Holiday spending on skin care and it definitely something that you know a lot of parents are saying my tween is obsessed with skin care is this bad like is this um getting into potentially harmful territory like these products are meant for adults are they going to you know damage a tween a step back for the most part no right um skincare products even you know anti-aging serums they seriously harm a child starting from 6 months of age and above kids should be wearing sunscreen to sun-exposed skin you know when they it a daily habit giving them sunscreens to try out letting them pick their favorite sunscreen you know it doesn matter if it marketed for mature skin if that one they want to use by all means you know provided it give it to them okay give it to them encourage them to reapply it this is a really good thing because the majority of sun damage that leads to the changes that put us at risk for skin cancer these things are actually acquired in our childhood so protecting a child skin from the Sun can have a huge impact on the health of their skin long term like once they get into their older adult years I mean I can go on and on about how beneficial that is I mean in Australia they they take it really ser seriously because of course the sun there is so intense they have all these campaigns in place for shade structures the kids wear um hats uh at school you know we don here but I wish we did I mean it really is a big Public Health thing for kids uh to be protecting their skin from the Sun 100% but then we get into some other territories all right well I mean washing your face like that right and you know around the tween years that oil glands start becoming active with changes in hormones skin becomes oilier some kids might start experiencing acne for the first time uh little breakouts here in there are just oilier skin and it starts to become you know more important to incorporate a cleanser at this age someone might need to start using over-the-counter skincare products that have active acne treatments in them like salicylic acid or benzo peroxide as as directed by your treating health care provider of course your pediatrician um or you know if your child sees a dermatologist but you know those products have been used in young kids for years and years and years so they definitely safe um if your kid doesn have acne though do they need to be using a salicylic acid face wash no um but it you know we benefits of salicylic acid face washes and and you know acne products on this channel at nasium and if if your child is starting to develop comedones then yeah there um always clarify with your healthc care provider because remember while salicylic acid is super gentle while benzo peroxide super gentle and meant to be sold over the counter these things can be harsh they can be drying they can be irritating they might not be necessary for your child to use and if it this is just not it helpful um so there have moisturizing um moisturizing does a child necessarily need to moisturize you know kids have really good at that age they have pretty good Skin Barrier function unless they have an underlying skin disorder like atopic dermatitis but you know we can benefit from moisturizing to help cut down on transepidermal water loss to what extent a child of that age actually needs to use one again unless they have atopic dermatitis it likely to be harmful though so you know I I I see that as being beneficial you know if you live somewhere that the air is dry your child might develop dry skin just like the rest of us uh you go somewhere like the mountains there cold wind they their little cheeks are chapped yeah moisturizers can be definitely helpful in that group for sure body moisturizers fine to use then we get into the territory of like everything else right now when it comes to skincare I don care what age you are keeping it simple to just a few products is best the more things you put on your skin the greater the risk for irritation and for young kids you know that that holds true as well so they may want to use a lot of different skincare products um but it comes with the same risks right of increased risk of irritation that they products if they they using them and they consistently so it their money if you with like their allowance or you know after school job money or you it it it know by all means it at that point in my opinion every parent has to choose what child and you know your child better than anyone else so I here and tell people oh kids are too young to be using these types of skincare products if your child is tolerating these things you to buy them for them or you don problem buying them for them um they using them up I you know I I can understand not being bothered by the your child using them because in the grand scheme of things that kids could be getting into this is pretty benign um in theory you know that being said we don ramifications of kids in terms of their psychological Health getting so focused on these complicated skincare routines from a young age like um you know is it is it just a self-care thing that they enjoy doing it an awkward age too you know the transition from childhood to teenage years you kind of feel like you know you things but you to get a little too old for certain things and Skin Care kind of feels that void anything you put on your skin has the potential to be irritating so the more products a child uses the greater the risk of irritation and you know if they exfoliant exfoliants we know can be pretty harsh pretty irritating and if they overdo it or they use it around their eyes it can definitely develop flakiness skin rashes swelling it can be quite exuberant and while that is generally something that is pretty easy to correct it to avoid it and if the child has a deeper skin tone that can leave them with post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation you know at this age let the kind of risk um assessment of situations is not all there in terms of the maturity level and a lot of times kids will just Dive Right into something and not you know do be conservative and do a test spot or gradually introduce things and slowly like an adult would do kids also have a lot of peer pressure um you know from people that they may follow on social media are they immediate you know in-person friend groups maybe putting a lot of pressure on them oh let at a birthday party this like three-step exfoliating mask and it may actually be too irritating for your child they may have you know an underlying skin condition or just overall more sensitive skin but they may you know in that situation feel pressured they going to say no they want to do what their friends are doing children should not really be focused on anti-aging in my opinion that opinion they shouldn to prevent aging but I say that but in the same breath I yeah you know have them use sunscreen and one of the benefits of using sunscreen early is that not only does it cut down on the risk of skin cancer but it also can protect against photoaging so then you get into the territory well if that using an antioxidant serum then like to mitigate some of the damage I will say you know again if they tolerate these things and are motivated to use them and enjoy them and you don them doing it as a parent by all means but we don on kids in this age group using cosmical um what the long-term ramifications are I mentioned the more products you use the more likely for irritation but you also have to factor in research that suggests that using a lot of skincare products it can disrupt our natural skin microbiome the the bacteria things that naturally live on our skin and help protect us and you know interact with our immune system in a supportive way if you start using too many skin care products that can be disrupted that to irritation and you know what are the consequences of doing that in a really young child we honestly don mentioned already you know if a child with a deeper skin tone gets a lot of irritation from trying out too many skincare products it can lead to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation now in the store in the drugstore and you know on this channel we have talked about a lot of over-the-counter cosmical products that have ingredients in them aimed at tackling dark spots things like niacinamide licorice fruit coic acid arbutin um are these safe for a child to be using again we don safety data on these things in children it lot more access to skincare information it very young age in comparison to ever before and so it they have a lot more influence is um probably the adults in their life are more into skincare than the adults in our lives were right I mean back in the day our parents were not doing a bunch of skin care you know they maybe Mom was using moisturizer cleanser uh you know Clinique or whatever but it all these multiple serums it just was not part of someone part let alone sunscreen you know um so there are a lot of other outside influencing factors um there immediate peer group is obviously getting into it and then the people that they follow on social media and one of the things you know about Tik Tok in particular is it targets the audience with certain pieces of content so a child may be getting targeted with this type of content like they watch one video and then the next thing you know they multiple videos it really can have a very strong influence on their um you know interest motivation for sure um so is it necessarily A Bad Thing to be interested in skincare no I mean taking care of your skin it and on the surface it sounds pretty healthy I do have concerns though because you know there seems to be a growing and growing by the moment by the second extreme extreme fear of Aging I mean it gen Z genen ZZ as a generation is terrified I mean terrified of aging wrinkles um and they demographic interested in cosmetic procedures and I don below them being much different you know it could potentially be worse and I don healthy to be that phobic of Aging I think it really can create a lot of self-esteem issues that are not good for developing brains developing Minds I really do think it has a potential to negatively impact someone and emotional well-being long term and a lot of that is going to depend on what the influence is if the influence is rhetoric around being bothered by aging that you know a phobia of wrinkles that aging is bad oh my God you look old that kind of T negative talk I do think can trickle down for sure and negatively impact the younger generation and so when it increased enthusiasm for multi-step skincare routine it does give me pause because we know firsthand that you know children this young and younger they like sponges and they will absorb uh things right and you know we this kids absorb you know if if Mom is having a lot of negative selft talk that she verbalizes out loud about her appearance her body that that can negatively impact the child especially daughters um and so I don the this skin care Interest being much different than you know if if a child from the of a sudden in drinking Slim Fast back then people probably would have just kind of chuckled but we know now like that that sets the stage for a lot of you know problematic self-esteem issues with dieting and body image and the like this but this fixation with skincare while it can be a good thing is a self-care Behavior you know taking care of an organ system especially if it involves sun protection um you know while it can be viewed in a positive I do think it also can be a gateway to more problematic Pursuits like an over fixation with cosmetic procedures from a young age um you know getting filler and Botox all sorts of cosmetic procedures there is a large interest in that from like again gen Z which has a direct influence on this younger generation we have have too much superficial socializing I should say that in air quotes where we people to do things that probably are not necessarily relevant to us um in our age right like um a lot of younger people being influenced to use tritoan for wrinkles I mean is that really relevant you collagen you don what what are you trying to achieve um but they see other influencers do it many of these influencers will also use filters so it creates this illusion that these skincare products give you this great skin when you know either they a filter or they have done cosmetic procedures I really do think it you know a place where young people are very vulnerable in general overall though in my opinion it boils down to the parents it control to supervise what their child consumes on social media um and you know what kinds of influences you are allowing in your child can impact them that responsibility to control that every child is different to make blanket statements I don know some children are really going to benefit from getting into skin care it might spark you know an interest in dermatology for example or it might um you know be something that they like to do little fun videos it outlet for them a form of self-care an interest in something like skin care again on the surface level seems relatively wholesome I mean most parents would probably rather have their child dabbling in drunk elephant than becoming a drunk elephant so there are certainly more harmful things that your child could get into but don the potential for this to be a slippery slope as well so it at the end of the day what their child can consumes and you know how they how they control the influences in their child the comments what you all think about this trend of tween gen Alpha getting super into over-the-top skincare routines do you think it you think it Outlet or are you somewhere in between let me know but I hope you guys enjoyed this video if so give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don I [Music] by	Success
You Don't Need A Disposable Face Towel ?????	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04CY4nwmh_0	Dr Day	so Tik Tock is convinced that acne breakouts are caused from your washcloth and that the solution is to instead buy um single use disposable face towels okay so it 2023 if you disposable wipes to dry your face what are you doing I used to use just like a towel like this to dry my face after I wash my face but these towels hold so much bacteria and you wiping it on your face every time you dry your face so I got the wipes the Box on AliExpress I think the box was like $78 I got two packs of 100 count of these wipes for $10 total and they disposable they dry your face you throw them away I usually will like wipe my counter down with it after but don paying Crazy Prices like there brand that sells them I almost bought them no no no you can find your own on AliExpress for way way cheaper do it if you have acne brone skin like I do as you can see you need to start getting on these actually even if you don get on them and no they are not tissue paper they that you can use right after you wash your face to make sure you accumulating the same dirt over and over again and that you have a clean towel every time these ones you can easily find on Amazon and they come with I believe about 100 sheets and you to go um should you be blowing your hard-earned money on that um in short no uh unless you want to uh but I would say save your money and let single use disposable items whether it be face towels makeup wipes not the most environmentally conscious thing to do it claim that using a regular towel that you can wash on your face causes acne or leads to acne breakouts I you as a dermatologist I have really never seen anybody whose acne is caused by their towel acne pathogenesis is complex and it involves your genetics your oil glands making a lot of oil the cells lining your pore don maturation and they get stuck together combined with the oil and they make a little plug it within your pore there called cutie bacterium acnes that breaks down the oil generates a lot of inflammation acne is you know related to your genetics and to your hormones because hormones signal to the oil gland to make more oil towels are not the cause of acne that being said if you using a towel that abrasive it definitely can be irritating to the skin it can disrupt the Skin Barrier cause irritation that might aggravate your acne by virtue of inflammation because acne is an inflammatory skin condition um but you that being said I have seen people on the internet you know doing their routines and the like or taking off their makeup and like rubbing stuff rubbing a rough towel back and forth that can definitely aggravate acne but using a towel is not going to transfer bacteria to your face that cause acne the acne causing bacteria they already on you they don towel they all have that acne causing bacteria but it they actually have a specific strain of that bacteria and that might underscore part of why they have acne in addition to their genetics and hormones um I digress the the the acne P causing bacteria is not living on your towels so you face cause acne so let the way the way that that towels could aggravate acne though is if they abrasive and you that can be very irritating just like you know I don harsh scrubs or anything of that sort it can be very irritating not just for acne but for anyone skin you want to be careful that you and buffing with with a towel Can it can really be irritating the other thing in a towel that might be irritating to the skin not necessarily for acne specifically but really for anyone is the dyes dyes in Fabrics whether it be your towels or your clothing they can be irritating the skin I would say in your clothing though it than in a towel because with clothing you against your skin for a much longer period of time and as you go throughout your day you sweat um so the dyes you know they mix with your sweat they rub off onto your skin that it contact of patting you know a pink bath towel to your face not likely irritating unless you the dyes so like I said you do not need to be buying these disposable towels for preventing acne breakouts they should not make a huge difference for your acne again the acne causing bacteria it doesn going to be transferred to your face but but but um Linens bedding uh towels they definitely can aggravate skin problems and they can transfer microbes to the skin not specifically the acne causing bacteria but other Little Critters can live in them but guess what washing your Linens regularly can get rid of these things and make it not an issue so let about some specific microbes that can be problematic with your Linens first one is Staff bacteria um a lot of people develop um what stafilic cacus foliculitis these are skin conditions related to a bacteria called stafl cacus orius and some of those strains of that bacteria can actually be very stubborn and resistant to getting rid of with traditional antibiotics so they can really be a problem for people and they deal with recurrent balance of these skin infections caused by staff bacteria some people have this staff bacteria that just naturally lives in their nose they colonized by it so they end up transferring it and it can get into little tears in the skin cracks in the skin and cause a skin infection especially if you um have a condition called atopic dermatitis where you have an impaired skin barrier it allows for bacteria to set up shop more readily another group of people who get staff infections whether it be impo or foliculitis are athletes to spend a lot of time in communal gym areas because this bacteria can hang out on surfaces like you know gym equipment so when you deal with these conditions you have to be mindful of your towels make sure that you are washing them um after each use in hot water with bleach to kill that bacteria because you can transfer it to other parts of your body and to other people who cohabitate with you so don share your towel in that case um but that your towel definitely can be playing a role I will say that staff foliculitis can look like acne but it thing um and it on the body like the the buttock is a common area the thighs uh where you have a lot of follicles and you can actually develop boils related to staff infections not pleasant and yeah you do need to be careful with your towels but like using single used towels is not really necessary you just need to wash your towels regularly then the other scenario where you can be transferring um little microbes to other areas of your skin is if you are dealing with athletes foot or ringworm uh you can actually transfer the the fungus to other parts of your body or to someone else if you share those towels so for example what can happen is people develop athletes foot that name for um fungus on the feet they can have develop athletes foot and then they may use a towel to dry off their feet and then take that towel to other parts of their body and they can transfer that little fungus to other parts of their body like it people to pick up um athletes foot in a gym locker again the these little guys they love to hang out in these moist communal environments like you know a sauna a steam room a locker room shower room and if you walk around Barefoot they can jump on your jump on your feet I mean not literally they don legs but they can get on your feet cause athletes foot that comes from and then what can end up happening is like I said you know you you dry your feet off with a towel and then maybe you dry the rest of your body you can bring it up up to other parts of your body your legs you can get ringworm or the groin area can cause jockage um so that yeah your towel can be the problem for people who are not dealing with ringworm or staff infections how often should you be washing your towels at least after after every three uses another thing that can influence the cleanliness if you will of your towel is where you are storing it if you if your bathroom doesn humid in there damp you hang up your towel in there it to dry it becomes a more hospitable environment for little microbes for that reason I say wash your towels a lot more frequently likewise your washcloths can be doing the same thing so with a washcloth make sure you wash those after every use and uh you know again if you you want to be washing those in hot soapy water with bleach to get rid of that because you will transfer those little critters to other body parts one of the reasons I don loofah is that you really can out those lofas uh particularly well and they may also Harbor some of these microbes which again if you deal with Rec staff infections or ringworm can definitely be a problem for you moving into the bedroom though let your bed linens because bed linens can be problematic for your skin possibly aggravating acne but not you know directly contributory for a few reasons uh you know a lot of people they sweat in their sleep um to some extent plus when we sleep we shed skin cells into the bed um so this moisture and the skin cells it can you know be a favorable envir environment for microbes but but the Critter that really loves your bed and you know the moist environment of damp sheets from your sweat and all of your skin cells is dust mites dust mites love that if you have at topic dermatitis dustmites are your Nemesis so really encourage frequent laundering of your bed linens at least once a week to cut down on dust mites and also be mindful of like headboard I have a fabric covered headboard that I try and vacuum out cuz the skin cells will get in there and dust mites love dust mites love those headboards um so make sure you debris that those dust mites can feed off of make sure that you are vacuuming out and washing laundering uh any sort of fabric curtains that you have in your room that also can favor dust mites with the pillowcase a lot of people you know that sleep on their side or on their stomach they drool in their sleep a little bit and so you have saliva there which contributes to the moisture which again favors dustmites and also other microbes that uh could be irritating the skin but it causing bacteria hanging out there and then getting on your skin and causing breakouts it might be though that you getting a little bit of a foliculitis which is just an infection um in a in a hair follicle kind of looks like acne but is is very diff different the Fabrics that you sleep on whether it be your sheets or your um pillowcases the material can you know be soothing on the skin if if you choose the right material like Silk is very cool very smooth very nice if you have sensitive skin atopic dermatitis it can be very nice on the skin is it an absolute must have to have silk everything no obviously washing your Linens regularly is super important regardless of if you have staff ringworm atopic dermatitis or acne but uh all that to say like you do not need these single use face cloths but one thing I will say and a lot of people seriously side eye me when I say this and I get it like it me quite well I don much anymore um but I do do it here and there and that is I just don towels at all sometimes and it works for me for a few reasons first of all I don living in you know the Northeast with some brutal winter second of all it works for me because um it just does what can I say like you you let the majority of the water fall off of your skin while you the shower then you get out and the air kind of just circulates over your skin I apply moisturizer while my skin is still a little bit damp um while I completely naked I know it my skin care products on my face while my skin is still a little bit damp immediately off of out of getting out of the shower um you know I have my hair up in a towel and then you know within a matter of moments my skin is completely dry I don over the floor put my hair up in that microfiber hair towel the aqua towel while I so I turn the shower water off I reach for that microfiber hair towel which I wash regularly I forgot to mention those hair towels need to be washed regularly um I grab that put it around my hair most of the water comes off while I standing in the tub and then I get out step on a bamboo bath mat yeah my skin is wet but it starts air drying it still damp I put moisturizer on all over I moisturize my face uh then I start to get dressed moisturize my feet put socks on and honestly you will be surprised at how you are able to air air dry yourself like you videos because it on camera as you can imagine but in my day-to-day life when I really don body I I really don don over I just don of the reasons I started doing that honestly is back when I lived in New York it was so expensive to do laundry you know I had to the building I lived in had a coin operated laundry was like a dollar a load or something $2 a load so it was pretty expensive and you had to have coins to operate I mean it was like very it was a big deal to do laundry and so I found like well I going to cut down on using towels because it all the time and I just stopped using a towel uh when I live there and I know I said I don works for me but that obviously was a place where it got very cold and I was able to do it there so it worked it worked out for me but I get it it right for everybody but all that to say do not be dropping a bunch of money on these single use towels anyways guys I hope you enjoyed this video if so give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow [Music] bye	Success
Why Is Everyone Putting Beef Tallow On Their Skin?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZD3Wt4oR8w	Dr Day	well guys it seems as though Tallow is having a moment beef Tallow is the only thing that I put on my face as Skin Care moisturizer everything it ingredient it it won not smell like beef I will literally never stop talking about this because beef Tallow has changed my life entirely not only is it safe to eat which you shouldn it skincare Brands it ingredients I single day for months now and my skin absolutely loves it is there any benefit to using Tallow for the skin like uh people claim all sorts of benefits anti-aging wrinkle I mean and of course on Tik Tok the claims get Bolder and Bolder because that nature of how that app works you can just say oh this is nice now what exactly is Tal T Tallow is a rendered animal fat from the cooking of ruminants most commonly beef but you could also have I guess goat Tallow it cooking back in the day McDonald to use beef Tallow to fry the french fries gives food you know another level of flavor and it sort of solidifies into this creamy compound looks sort of like coconut oil then when you pick it up with your hands work it between your fingers it kind of melts now Tallow is widely used in cooking in restaurants but it skincare and cosmetics it staple ingredient actually in soap making for a long long time so this is not something new and novel that Tik Tok invented the thing about that app is it will take things that have been around for a long time and act as though it some like new Innovative concept what are the benefits for utilizing Tallow on your skin like should you just start collecting it and making your own and putting it on your skin it is frankly moisturizing it is very fatty it in omega-3 fatty acids and so that can be helpful for Your Skin Barrier You Know Your Skin Barrier we always talk about it as like this brick wall where the bricks are fully differentiated matured uh shells of former cells called corneocytes and they are stuck together with this lipid cement and you have these situations where that external barrier becomes impaired either from external aggress aggressors underlying skin conditions or just with age you know we lose the ability to make good lipids in that part of the skin or you know maybe an underlying nutrient deficiency we know that applying lipids to the skin can help in restoring that and help with barrier function overall um and Tallow is an emolient so it can soften and smooth the skin surface which always has a nice cosmetic appeal to it anytime time you put something oily on your skin it often will give the skin this sort of radiant glow because it smoothing everything down and emolion can also help soften and exfoliate corneocytes that are trying to shed you know your skin naturally exfoliates on its own but with age that cellular process can kind of slow down a bit you can get accumulation of dry heaped up cornea sides they can the elevator so to speak and shed you need a little bit of help and in a molent an oil a fat a moisturizer rubbed gently on the skin it slips between those cornea sides and helps them to lift off so you know I advocating use moisturizer in your skincare routine it really can support the vital functions of your skin moisturizing ingredients also help in ultimately improving water retention in the skin and that allows the enzymes that orchestrate everything to function better Tallow is also rich in fat soluble vitamins fat soluble vitamins include vitamin A vitamin D vitamin E and vitamin K and these may have some potential benefits for the skin Tallow also contains antioxidants and I talked about antioxidants in a lot of my videos uh you know the the benefit potentially of applying antioxidants to the skin is that they may help in mitigating some of the damage that occurs upon exposure to environmental aggressors but unfortunately you know it antioxidants on your skin they sort of have to be at the right place the right time and they have to be stable they have to actually get into the skin so it using Tallow is that it is not something that has preservatives in it so you can these given constituents whether it be vitamin A d e or k or the antioxidants and because there are no preservatives you also run the the risk that with time it can go rancid and that can be very problematic for your skin cause irritation skin problems rashes breakouts not a good thing applying Tallow to the skin generally speaking it know it Smooths the skin it may help with barrier function to what extent any of the constituents of Tallow are going to truly yield skin benefit Remains unaddressed by research study so when you go on Tik Tok people will claim all sorts of things you know that it anti-aging properties and they will try and extrapolate the fact that it has vitamin A and suggest you know that it is acting like retinol which is not exactly true you can A there and expect it to get into your skin and act like retinol it the same thing um they and so you have to keep that in mind not to mention the fact that you have the stability issue with this not being something where it preserved and there formulation science behind it to you know have a delivery system for those ingredients into the skin skin is a barrier so when it comes to actually delivering ingredients they can not merely oh they must be you know effective it in the formulation and with Tallow there so you have no idea to what extent any of these things are going to help you the other drawback with using Tallow um and what I you know to me it you want to do it do you but I can can this is it kind of has a foul odor uh you know I do not like meat the smell of meat nauseates me so it kind of has a beefy Aroma to it which I find very repulsive frankly now you can go on Etsy and there are a variety of sellers selling their Tallow and many of them add essential oils to mask the aroma of Tallow and I pointed this out in many videos before but you have to be careful with essential oils they can be very irritating to the skin the thing about essential oils is that they can degrade and become very irritating as they degrade they become very inflammatory and sensitizing and they can make you um sensitive when you go in the sun they can cause a rash when you go in the sun and in in personal care products cosmetic products that you buy in the store they may have essential oils added they may have components of essential oils added and in those formulations it talking about here and the reason is again there are preservative systems there you know help with the stability of those essential oil components whereas if you just have somebody collecting T um you know in their home or whatever and adding essential o oils you have a system where there are no preservatives to ensure the stability of that essential oil it can degrade and you know again the tall can go rancid and that is really a recipe for something that can be quite irritating and inflammatory to your skin so I would caution against that if you would say it suck it up and do it with the plain Tallow but you know all that to say like people are making a lot of bold clim about Tallow but is it really any different than any other sort of natural emolient no we don on people applying straight Tallow to their skin in comparison to other things I ago maybe like six or seven years ago there was a coconut oil Renaissance I mean people on social media were all about coconut oil I mean they were singing the Praises of coconut oil for everything coconut oil for brushing your teeth for shampooing your hair for you know taking off makeup as a moisturizer eating it putting it in your nose um you know putting it on your car seats you name it people are putting and ingesting coconut oil in every way shape or form possible and just like Tallow it of one of those things that starts out small and innocuous and the next thing you know people are making more and more outlandish claims about the benefits of something which simply are not substantiated by the research now just like coconut oil has potential to moisturize the skin soften and smooth so just Tallow that anything above and beyond that that being being stated on social media is just anecdotal hype I would say another potential drawback in my opinion is that if you have very oily skin you may find that this is kind of heavy you know it it again you do run the risk of it going rancid which can cause irritation to your skin on Tik Tok you know there are some people who claim that and I find this hard to believe they claim that they have just gotten rid of all of their skincare and the only thing they are putting on their skin is Tallow and it you know I think you got to take these stories with a huge grain of salt let me know in the comments though are you using Tallow on your skin what you know what has been your experience with it and no does not smell like beef the one she essential oil added she St talking about this because beef Tallow has changed my life entirely not only is it safe to eat I mean this fascination with eating our skin care this is something that the Wellness Community likes to state but it just doesn if you wouldn it on your skin well a lot of things that we eat are not good to put on the skin they because it would want to ingest doesn it mean the skin is a barrier so it is not going to get into your body like it would if you were ingesting it it yeah all right let section beef Tallow broke me out so bad as an acne prone person I mean it happens with it can happen that can happen with anything but you know like I said maybe it you know it can go rancid and that makes it more likely consider me influenced does this hurt the cow someone asked well I mean yeah love beef Tallow but I eyelids because it gives me milia when I put it there everyone milia you know it misconception that moisturizers cause milia milia are actually little cysts that form usually uh due to damage of the underlying supportive structures of the skin like after you know maybe an aggressive microderm abrasion or extensive sun damage putting moisturizer on the skin really should not elicit milia I think some people confuse milia with you know maybe closed comy dones what do people think we used as a moisturizer before the invention of concoctions we used naturally found oil that appeals to the you know ancestral fallacy like just because it was used by our ancestors it must be the best thing ever but remember they had all sorts of health problems that they had to deal with that we have since eradicated they died much younger than we do they had a lot more physical and emotional struggles and we do today a lot more things to deal with they probably just used it because that was what was available it doesn it that we have advanced so I don why we would want to regress to things that are just not as good I love to season my cast iron skillet with it where can you buy this do you wear SPF yeah do not rely on alow as an SPF there only thing I can put on my face I have the most sensitive skin a lot of people here just singing the Praises of eating it beef Tallow is very high in saturated fat so not the most hard healthy thing to be consuming in fact I think it higher in saturated fat than lard what do you wash your face with good question is it good for oily skin again I it not going to cause your skin to make more oil but it probably will feel greasy especially if you have oily skin lots of people ask about sunscreen not getting a response there can you put makeup over it makeup might not set up well on it like any kind of emolient that can disrupt the setup of your makeup is it fungal acne safe pittosporum foliculitis it in the public referred to as fungal acne but it due to that little yeast malesia that lives on everyone response against that and happens in the follicle I have lots of vide on this really really oily Cosmetics May aggravate that for some people and you know perhaps that is the case here but fungal acne safe versus unsafe I mean there formulation that really predicts that per se the police are outside for you do you know if it will help with rosacea um so for rosacea you know there is a part of rosacea that skin barrier that know aggravates the sensitivity symptoms the burning the stinging and so moisturizers are a really important part of rosacea care but heavy moisturizers actually can because they you know slow down the evaporation of sweat they can make someone feel overheated and that can actually precipitate a rosacea flare so this may be that kind of issue so Tallow because it is kind of heavy might actually aggravate rosacea but everyone there I wanted to say about Tallow again let me know in the comments if this is something that you have try it out if you have any interest in I hope this video was informative to you now on the ins slate I video reacting to the Tik Tock carrot tanning Trend you want to watch that one next if you like these types of videos where I go in and you know react to Tik Tok skincare Trends but if you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow bye [Music]	Success
Eating Carrots Every Day To Get Tan? TIKTOK HAS LOST IT	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5IanqBmlyg	Dr Day	so all of the cool kids over on Tick Tock are eating a couple of large carrots every day in the hopes of getting a tan I can say it again three large carrots a day and you can change your natural undertone this is literally the skin that I was born with and this is me with no fake Tanner I have been eating three large carrots a day for the past few years it changes everything trust me like literally you the inside out love ya [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you never know what you encounter on that app is there any truth to this well eating several large carrots a day give you a tan the short answer is no however eating carrots can lead to a skin color change referred to as keratinoderma which is a yellowish orange Hue to the skin in the setting of keratinemia keratinemia is a fancy medical term for when beta-carotene levels in the blood are much higher than the normal range beta-carotene is a carotenoid carotenoids include not only beta character teen but Alpha carotene lutein lycopene and canthazanthin they they can influence our skin color and our skin tone importantly carotenoids from our diet are a precursor to vitamin A AKA retinol carotenoids are absorbed in our small intestine and the majority of conversion to vitamin A occurs in the mucosa everything else makes its way to the liver in order to convert carotenoids to vitamin A you need a few players you need pancreatic lipase which is an enzyme made by your pancreas you need fat you need bile salts and you need thyroid hormone carotenoids are removed from the body in your urine in your stool in your sweat and in your sebum aka the oil that your skin produces when you take in high amounts of beta-carotene it can cause a yellowish orange discoloration of the skin that this first presents on the palms the souls around the nose and then gradually can spread to involve larger areas of the skin of the body the reason it most obvious on the palms and Souls is because it is excreted in your sweat you have a high density of sweat glands on the palms and Soles and the beta-carotene sticks there because you have a very thick stratum corneum that the top layer of the skin so that is where it first shows up you also see it in the area around the nose and the nose itself because that is an area where you have a very high density of oil glands here keratinoderma you don corneum in the whites of your eyes or in your mucosa stratum corneum is just that top most differentiating layer of the epidermis it is absent in the whites of your eyes and in the mucosal surfaces so you will not see yellowing of the eyes and you will not see yellowing of the mucosal membranes with keratinoderma and that turn yellow if you have jaundice if you get jaundice that liver not only does your skin turn yellow but so the whites of your eyes and the mucosa it the tongue the yellowish orange discoloration is a lot more obvious and people who have a paler skin tone people who have a deeper skin tone keratino Derma is a lot more subtle it obvious on the palms and Soles again stratum corneum there is quite thick however the skin like on your face might actually appear lighter so deeper skin tones it does not really look yellowish orange when you have high levels of beta-carotene in the body it lightening of your background skin this particular Tick Tock trend is focused on eating carrots but you can develop keratinoderma from eating other carotene rich foods carotene rich foods are those that have a bright yellowish orange appearance or those that are brightly Green Mango papaya pumpkin other squashes sweet potato broccoli and spinach broccoli and spinach have a high amount of carotene but that color that orange yellow color is masked by the chlorophyll which gives them a green color but you can get keratinoderma from eating a lot of spinach or a lot of broccoli you you carrots is not going to give you a natural looking tan it will make you yellowish orange so if anything you going to have the appearance of a fake tan gone wrong and that includes yellowish orange palms and souls and a yellowish orange nose I don think that that for all that being said I won completely dismiss what they here because yes carotenoids do play a role in your background skin color but to what extent that it tan but it may bring out your natural Radiance a Natural Glow and I do encourage people to eat fruits that are carotenoid rich because studies show that diets rich in fruits and vegetables actually help people negative consequences of ultraviolet radiation from the Sun much better and that includes lycopene-rich Foods as well so eating a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables is very skin health and total body Health forward so I expect to get any sort of Tan in your skin so eating a couple of carrots a day is unlikely to get you to the point of keratinoderma unlikely to tan your skin but may you know help enhance your own radiant glow through the effects of carotenoids and may also be beneficial for helping your skin handle environmental stressors better of course always protect your skin with a broad spectrum sunscreen and Sun protective clothing but that being said who gets keratinoderma like is it just people who really really love carrots and eat too many keratinoderma can be broken down into primary keratinoderma secondary keratinoderma and metabolic keratinoderma primary keratinoderma occurs because you took in too many beta-carotene rich food you want to know who we see keratinoderma in a lot babies who are being introduced to food for the first time starting with baby foods like pureed pumpkins squash carrots these baby foods are actually very rich in beta-carotene because they and pureed that enhances the bioavailability of the beta-carotene and the baby yellowish orange and oftentimes they have a little yellow nose as well you will also see a lot of primary keratinoderma if you visit West Africa because in West Africa they utilize red palm oil quite a bit in their diet and red palm oil is very beta-carotene rich and of course from time to time you can see it in people who eat a plant-based diet they beta-carotene rich foods preparing beta-carotene Rich fruits and vegetables in certain ways again can enhance the bioavailability so you will see this a lot from time to time and people who do consume a plant-based or plant-heavy Diet that also have secondary keratinoderma secondary means it occurs secondary to an underlying medical condition you can develop keratinoderma as a result of diabetes low thyroid hormone hypothyroidism liver disease kidney disease and you also can develop it with certain psychiatric conditions then you have keratinoderma the rarer form and basically that is referring to people who are born with a problem metabolizing beta-carotene how is this diagnosed you walk into your doctor should be able to diagnose that from history just by looking at you you know they look at your eyes they look at the mucosal membranes and those are not this yellow color they look at your palms your souls you know they put things together they ask you about your diet and you know generally speaking that how the diagnosis is made if you look at blood work of somebody who has keratinoderma their liver function is perfectly normal they may have slightly elevated vitamin A Levels but by and large the vitamin A levels are perfectly normal and they also have an increased level of beta-carotene in the blood you can also get a yellowish orange discoloration from excessive intake of foods rich in lycopene another carotenoid so that would be another reason like if you of tomatoes is this safe though is it safe to be consuming carrots yes I mean unless you have some under underlying health reason not to eat carrots and you allergy eating carrots is generally accepted as a healthy part of a balanced diet I know there diet ideas out there on social media but by and large carrots are considered a healthy food and I encourage people to eat them as part of a balanced diet so long as you like them if you don them don other carotenoid rich foods out there that you can incorporate into your diet but if you develop keratinoderma is that deadly no not at all it so bad it have any negative consequences to your health it on consuming those beta-carotene rich foods uh to you know just dial it back and it will slowly reverse it takes a couple of months for it to go away but it will go away what about vitamin A toxicity you know this is a precursor to vitamin A and I adverse effects of of getting too much vitamin A fat soluble vitamin in your diet I caution against taking vitamin A supplements unless you by your health care provider because it can really cause a lot of adverse effects including super dry skin but what about eating beta-carotene rich foods can that cause high vitamin A Levels that dry out your skin and cause liver failure no the conversion of beta-carotene to vitamin A is so slow and again your body has ways to remove the excess carotene so it keeps it in balance it keeps it in shock hypervitaminosis a toxic levels of vitamin A from eating foods rich in carotenoids it doesn are tanning pills out there and I say that in air quotes because these are not prescription medications these are you know gimmicky stuff that they sell you online supplements uh to you know quote unquote give you a tan some of these tanning pills have very high amounts of the carotenoid cancer xanthin and that can actually cause harmful effects to the retinas in your eyes retinopathy it from eating carotenoid rich foods take home points consuming beta-carotene rich foods can turn your skin yellowish Orange it dangerous you hypervitaminosis a or vitamin A toxicity from eating carotenoid rich foods but it is unlikely to give you a tan if you want a tan the safest way to do it is to use a sunless tanner they are safe to apply to the skin and of course protect your skin from the Sun there is no such thing as a safe UV mediated tan whether that be UV rays from the Sun or UV rays from a tanning bed is eating a couple of carrots a day harmful no but I do think you know people pursue these different Trends and they should be clear on what is is true and what is not all right y Trend that turned into an educational teaching lecture I know some of you guys just want to cut to the chase in these videos and you like I don science talk uh anyway y of foods and skin on the end slate I going to put my video talking all about the skin benefits of incorporating almonds into your diet providers you not allergic to them so check that one out next but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow bye foreign [Music]	Success
Is Runner's Face A Real Thing? Dermatologist Weighs In	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpqRsahGFpM	Dr Day	so I came across a tick tock of this plastic surgeon claiming that long distance running is going to Aid you prematurely and I have to say I sensitive or reactive person but as a runner I felt a little how shall we say triggered by this post frankly it pissed me off I what I hi it things that prevent aging versus things that accelerate aging and I have a pet peeve and um half my patients love me for it and half my patients hate me for it but it about running and it run a little bit every day or run a couple of miles a few times a week but I want to start this little talk by saying have you ever seen a long distance long time runner that didn face that the gaunt old face your knees go your ankles go your back goes and it of dumb so if you want to run a little bit terrific but no impact or low impact aerobics is really the way to get your exercise is there any truth to the idea that long distance running ages you faster yes and no long distance runners run long distances often outside out outdoor exposures are going to weather your skin and contribute to premature skin Aging in the form of laxity wrinkles Fine Lines disc pigmentation skin yellowing prominent pores but it doesn two hours outside or if you just take a lawn chair and plop yourself out there for two hours the same things can contribute to weathering of the skin and premature skin aging whether you running or not ultraviolet radiation from the Sun I talk about this all the time right I mean duh UV rays from the Sun they are a confirmed source of premature skin aging as well as skin cancer ultraviolet radiation from the Sun is a carcinogen it damages the DNA and the keratinocytes of your epidermis and your immune system has to come in and try and clean up the mess as you get older your immune system is not as robust at doing that eventually those damaged cells lead to a skin cancer then let radiation annihilates the stuff and the deeper layers of the skin that gives your skin snap recoil namely a collagen and elastin it also contributes to skin glycation which leads to skin yellowing but ultraviolet radiation from the Sun you don damage your skin if you do run Outdoors you can protect yourself from that by wearing a broad spectrum sunscreen ideally water resistant because sweat is going to remove sunscreen and Sun protective clothing make sure you don time your distance runs in the middle of the day that is when ultraviolet radiation is at its peak intensity aside from ultraviolet radiation Runners are also exposed to other things like pollution especially if you run in a city pollutants particulate matter get on your skin and they cause lipid peroxidation so the lipids in the top layer of your skin they damage those and that generates an inflammatory Cascade that leads to premature wrinkles it doesn through a polluted city or if you are sitting outside in a polluted city same things are going to contribute to premature skin aging and weathering and damage of the skin there aren great approaches to offsetting the negative impacts of pollution on the skin in theory topical antioxidants may help to slow down or reduce the burden of damage but more research is needed on what the ideal antioxidants are in terms of formulation and for truly addressing that and of course mechanical barriers like those long sleeves and Sun protective clothing that you should be wearing to protect your skin they going to help reduce particulate matter getting on the skin surface in theory the other thing about distance Runners they burn a lot of calories they tend to be very lean and lose fat in the face we other videos on why your face changes with age but shrinking of the facial fat pockets leads to Hollows and that kind of sunken appearance when you lose fat and are very lean whether it be from sport or a diet you weight it can show up in your face in the form of more prominent Hollows and yes definitely can give you a more sunken appearance similar I did a recent video All About ozembic phase I say that in air quotes because is basically when you lose a lot of weight you lose fat from the face it same effect people call it ozembic face but it has nothing to do with ozembic the drug it on taking that medication for weight management they lose a lot of weight and all of a sudden their face changes and you know people are like oh my gosh you look old now some people like to go a step further and start hypothesizing as to other ways in which long distance running May contribute to the appearance of a prematurely aged phase some things that I have heard are that running generates a lot of inflammation in the body and inflammation is not good and this isn think about inflammation in the body you don in fact you need a little bit of inflammation in your body you need a little bit of stress otherwise you become very weak uh if you take a medication called Prednisone which completely wipes out inflammation in your body that diseases prednisone leaves you very weak and it thins your skin and leaves you prone to all sorts of problems that why people who have to take that medication you know they need to be monitored for side effects so like basically you need some amount of inflammation your body needs some amount of stress otherwise you become very weak too much inflammation too much chronic inflammation excessive inflammation above and beyond physiologic threshold it does contribute to all sorts of diseases for example people who have a certain autoimmune diseases where they have high levels of inflammation throughout the body it really does take a wear and tear on a variety of organ systems and contributes negatively to their overall health running in general it improves your cardiovascular health which improves blood flow which improves delivery of growth factors and nutrients to the skin for healing and Recovery it have heard is people claim that the repetitive shearing forces of running damage the structural elements in your skin like collagen and can lead to premature skin aging I mean there available research to suggest that the collagen in your skin is is pretty strong unless you have an underlying disorder or like Alors down low syndrome where you have a problem with your collagen or you have defective collagen as a result of vitamin C deficiency that video on that by the way your skin is actually pretty strong those shearing forces contributing to wrinkles I really think that it is a stretch to claim that without more research to back it up long distance Runners definitely do take on a characteristic appearance in their face it environmental exposures like ultraviolet radiation that damages the skin as well as just loss of fat in the face loss of facial fat but that can happen really with any endurance sport where you are outside and burning a lot of calories you can lose fat in the face and it can lead to this more hollowed sunken appearance there there is is the competitive distance Runner who is doing a lot of long runs training for marathons consistently running marathons each year this can take a toll on your body like any endurance sport especially if you don go about it in a healthy manner so in addition to protecting your skin from the Sun Sun protected behaviors the other thing that your nutrition one thing about Endurance Sports for a lot of people is they end up losing appetite and it you know it can actually be a lot harder to maintain your nutrition Than People realize who don enough calories can actually be challenging for many endurance athletes because of this so I would encourage anyone who is considering doing distance running or already is to of course talk to your health care provider and consider seeing a registered dietitian who has expertise in Sports Nutrition to really help you out because it actually actually a situation where if you are going on these long runs you know your caloric needs are much different than the everyday person who largely sedentary and you know and women for example you can run into situations where with with running you know it has a high demand for iron and if you woman for example who has heavy periods you that fueling your body properly you could run into something like iron deficiency anemia and other health problems so I can good nutrition is when it comes to any type of sport but in the case of the topic of this this video and long distance running for sure you know if you goal of running a marathon make sure you are educating yourself about your nutritional needs before you go in because it is it actually can be a lot more challenging in the day-to-day life you to do these long runs and things people will make fun of you and say like oh what do you mean you have a hard time eating enough but it actually can be challenging to to do and you know your appetite will go down so you may not even realize it that you are not getting like meeting your nutritional needs so I highly encourage you to follow with a registered dietitian and your health care provider to make sure that you not missing out um and you that going to help cut down on you know excessive fat loss in your face but it definitely going to help with your running career in terms of helping with recovery and preventing injuries nutrition is key protein carbohydrates all of those things the other thing Runners need to stay on top of like anyone but it can really get tricky with long distance running is your sleep because your sleep can kind of get a little bit messed up with doing a lot of running uh you know sometimes people wake up super early especially here like when it wake up like you know at 4am to go for a run before it gets too hot and then you go to work I mean you can definitely stress your body out balancing training with your day-to-day life so you need to find the right balance so that you not overdoing it and over taxing your body don those two things are going to take a serious toll on your body as you are trying to meet your running goals and it and put you at risk for injury and all sorts of health problems so should you stay away from running because it going to age you no when it comes to longevity cardiovascular health is a major predictor for longevity I mean we term which should be the goal I mean I don much rather have a few more wrinkles on my face in exchange for five or ten healthier years of my life than to have this like smooth skin and be you know internally a mess you know I wouldn necessarily disagree with this plastic surgeon long distance running like training for marathons or gosh Ultra marathons I credit to those of you who do that no doubt it hard on your body uh for sure include you know the environmental exposures to your skin is one thing but you know just training for it fueling for it it lot for your body so without a doubt yeah if you into this Sport and doing distance runs you need to go in educated you need to educate yourself about proper nutrition about getting good sleep and you need to really take a look at your work life balance because it just going to train for a marathon on top of everything else I realize that if you don bandwidth in your schedule to really make sure that you are taking care of yourself you know then it definitely can be take a lot out of you for sure the whole tone of this video really just put me off because on social media there this and it this idea that we all have to like look super young otherwise why even bother it benefits that come from exercise cardiovascular exercise you know he like yeah maybe run once a week one or two miles or you know do some low impact why do the exercise that you like and enjoy because that to stick with and that have the biggest difference in terms of your overall quality of life and your longevity don because somebody on social media tells you it all of these others are bad if you are moving your body and you are exercising whatever type of exercise it is that you that works with you your lifestyle that you enjoy enough to stay consistent with that is going to make the most difference for you for your health for your longevity and for you know your skin is going to thank you for it maybe you have a few more wrinkles if you are outside a lot doing these things but come on like I just think if we point on social media where we are we are discouraging people from exercising in the pursuit of wrinkle free smooth skin and a youthful glow what are like we are regressing here we are regressing and here to social media you know I can come on here and tell you guys till the cows come home about healthy diet uh managing your stress getting good sleep and people will always be like that I don repetitive yada yada people want some kind of sensationalized tidbit of information and that is what gets clicks and Views it does not get clicks and Views because the truth requires too much personal responsibility people want a quick fix they don just put the work in not to mention running can have a tremendously positive impact on your mental health it can help with coping with stress it can help with uh your mood certain you know people who have underlying mood disorders research shows that exercise whatever the form I one form can improve your symptoms it not a cure for these issues but people who have these issues and exercise they tend to feel lot better we should be encouraging people to move as much as possible this is a problem in our modern society we do not move we do not move enough we are too sedentary and it is going to catch up with us it catching up with us if you want to start running do so smartly while I love running I am not an exercise physiologist I expert so I on how to start running but you need to educate yourself if you are going to get into this sport because it definitely can take a toll on your body if you go about it the wrong way all right you guys let me know in the comments what do you think about this that we are at a point in society where people are starting to get scared of running a marathon that used to be considered like a goal that once you attained it it was like wow you know something you could tell all of your friends yeah I ran a marathon and it feels really good to do why are we at a point now where we are scaring people away from that makes sense sense to me but anyway I hope you all enjoyed this video if so give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe I bye

ALIX EARLE NOSE JOB FROM ACCUTANE? | Derm Reacts	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNgJ9O5e_L4	Dr Day	well hey guys I made the mistake the other day of going on Tick Tock so that means I lost like three hours of my life everyone Alex Earl came up on my for you page talking about her nose many people have speculated that she has had a nose job but she goes on to say I genuinely think that I got a nose job in my sleep look in my nose like granted I didn how to use nose Contour at the time but it your face I before and I of me like going through puberty and they you they asked my parents like did she have a nose job but she goes on to say I genuinely think I had a nose job in my sleep your nose is not going to change overnight but it does change so I thought in today appropriate to talk about how your nose changes not only with age but with underlying circumstances life events if you will during childhood adolescence and early adulthood your nose is growing the bones of cartilage they uh in the teen years your nose can change quite a bit so she photos to when she was like a teenager so it doesn looks different doesn though that she had a rhinoplasty generally speaking your nose finishes developing by the age of 18. while your nose is kind of fully formed and grown by the time you are well grown early adulthood it will continue to change as you age part of how your nose changes in appearance has to do with your skin the skin overlying your nose with age it thins you lose collagen you lose elasticity elasticity is what gives the skin snap and recoil and all of those changes affect the appearance of your nose the cartilage in your nose also will thin and weaken with age so that combined with the changes in your skin lead to a nasal droop so the nose actually droops a bit and that creates the illusion that your nose is getting longer the nasal cartilage can sometimes become brittle become thin just like your bones with age as you get into your older adult years it uncommon for your nostrils to enlarge the little pieces of cartilage that attach the tops and bottoms of the sides of the nose they actually can separate a bit so that can impact the way that your your nose appears all of these things lead to lengthening of the nose but that actually that your nose is growing in length it changing so it appears longer and sometimes more bulbous or larger the other thing that can happen to your nose with age is that all of a sudden you wake up one morning you minute I have a bump on my nose what the heck that bump was in fact there all along but it wasn as the skin thins overlying the dorsum the back of the nose as that skin thins the stuff underlying it is going to be more obvious including that bump that not an uncommon change actually and then of course with age the deep fat pockets underlying our skin they change a lot and that ultimately can really change the appearance of your face quite a bit including your nose then you have the sebaceous oil glands we talk a lot about these in my videos on acne on oily skin but your nose has a ton of sebaceous oil glands they can enlarge as you get older and that can make the nose appear larger that combined with it appearing longer overall really can change the shape of not only your nose but just change the way that your face looks in general and for a lot of people it don aesthetic procedures to correct those things when you think of cosmetic procedures for the nose probably what comes to mind is rhinoplasty surgery but there are a lot of minimally invasive procedures that can rejuvenate the appearance of the nose improve the nasal tip a lot of people develop prominent blood vessels with age overlying the nose as well and that too is something that bothers people cosmetically skin care products are not going to get rid of these prominent blood vessels they called teal injectasias see a board-certified dermatologists vascular lasers like pole style laser KTP can Target those bad boys cause them to shrink involute and go away if you take out your old high school yearbooks and compare what you look like now as an adult in your 30s 40s and 50s you compare your face you that the nose looks at least subtly different so those are more slow gradual things that you start to notice with advancing age but if you early 20s and you look at a photograph of yourself say I don year of Middle School junior high maybe your freshman year of high school it not surprising that your nose might look different because again your nose continues to grow throughout your teens and into early 20s for some people but she also points out that she Contours her nose with makeup so don underestimate what Mako can do it can really change the way your face looks quite a bit just by contouring shadowing the other thing that can change the appearance of one had injectables to your face like your cheeks for example not actively changing the size the dimensions of the nose again it is still the same size the same shape filler is not altered your nose anatomy in any way but it distorted things and changed everyone perception of how your nose looks now now I want to talk about some circumstances that might impact how your nose looks outside of just age-related change or the changes that happen with late adolescents rosacea rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition if you have it comment in the comments section you know rosacea is characterized by bouts of flushing facial redness as well as the symptoms of sensitivity burning stinging discomfort people who have rosacea they often will go on to develop persistent dilated blood vessels telangentasias including over the nose if rosacea goes untreated one complication that can happen especially for men more so than women but it can happen to women for sure is something called feminist change it can really happen on the nose in which case it it can happen on other areas of the face as well and this is characterized by thickening of the overlying skin enlargement of the sebaceous glands and that really can distort the appearance of the nose quite a bit it change the nose starting to become more swollen over time and then the texture over the nose becomes more irregular it really can bother people cosmetically and the way that is treated is actually with resurfacing lasers there are a lot of underlying medical conditions that can impact the nose lead to something called a saddle nose deformity Hansen Disease is an infectious disease that can impact the nose and cause saddle nose deformity relatively uncommon but it in the U.S there are pockets of the U.S where there are a lot of cases of this like in Florida here in Texas we see a lot of Hansen condition called trigeminal trophic disease or syndrome basically it type of nerve damage that causes persistent discomfort and pain and itch on the nose this discomfort can cause people to touch their nose pick at their nose and the nose itself to break down and change an appearance pregnancy will change the appearance of your nose temporarily because there are a lot of changes that happen in your body when you are pregnant that make their way way to impact how your nose looks first of all when you are pregnant guess what increases the volume of contents in your blood you have to have a lot more blood to house a baby so when you are pregnant your body needs to make a lot more blood with a lot more blood comes a lot more blood flow through the tissues including the nose and that can lead to the appearance of a swollen nose the other thing that happens in pregnancy is your your mucous membranes in your nose become a lot more congested and swollen because you have a lot more fluid throughout your body and all of that extra excess fluid through the mucous membranes can make the nose appear swollen but the nose goes back to how it looked before you were pregnant once you deliver you that is not a permanent change the last thing I want to address about this video I saw in the comments a lot of people saying well you took Accutane and we all know that basically shrinks your nose and gives you a glorified nose job is that true not exactly um there are a lot of tick tocks actually of people showing their it was before and after Accutane and claiming that it basically gave them a nose job it shrunk their nose is that possible not really what can happen with Accutane isotretinoin is is the name of the drug I should try no one you know it treatment for acne this girl has been very open and honest about her acne struggles does isotretinoin Accutane change your nose well what it can do and how it works for acne is it shrinks the sebaceous oil gland remember nose is some of the most sebaceous dense territory on your on your head that in your scalp uh you know that no one can shrink the sebaceous glands so it can make the overlying skin appear less bulbous and overall that may have a subtle impact on how the nose appears but it cartilage or the bone in your nose yes there are some bony skeletal side effects that can happen when taking isotretinoin joint pain muscle leg back ache those things happen in people on isotretinoin but uh it doesn your nose it doesn cartilage in your nose or the bones of your nose all that to say if your doctor has talked to you about isotretinoin for your acne I would not worry that it drastically going to change the appearance of your nose the other thing to keep in mind in a lot of these tick tocks where people show their nose before and after isotretino and isotreinoin is often prescribed for people in their teens late teens early 20s with acne of course it to adults with acne but that huge chunk of the demographic that is prescribed this but a lot of the people who are posting their our isotretinoin before and after nose keep in mind their before nose was also a nose that was still growing and still changing so it not unusual for it to look a little different whether or not they took isotreino or not they likely would still see that difference in their nose as a side note a while ago I did a video all about this myth around the Accutane nose job so check that out um but yeah it doesn other thing though that can happen on isotretinal and that it dries out the mucous membranes so the inside of your nose can get dry making you at risk for nose bleeds but once you isotrano and the mucous membranes their hydration level comes back to normal and you don really should not lead to any sort of sustained change in the appearance of your nose alright guys I hope this video was fun and informative talking about how different conditions and life stages life events can change the appearance of your nose I hope this is fun and informative to you if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow bye [Music] thank you	Success
MARGOT ROBBIE'S SECRET TO BARBIE SKIN IS DRINKING TEA?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1O-vX2PZRQ	Dr Day	well guys according to Media Outlets the secret to Margot Robbie doll skin is drinking milk thistle tea that guys you know I advocate of tea drinking I love to drink tea because it tastes delicious you all know I love my drinks there epidemiologic evidence to suggest that there are a variety of health benefits associated with tea drinking now of course Association does not prove causation but depending on the tea teas can be rich with a variety of anti-inflammatory compounds that may yield health benefits things like antioxidants for example green tea is packed with anti-inflammatory compounds like egcg that may help board off inflammation oxidative stress and may be associated with longevity although more research certainly is needed all that to say drinking tea in moderation it good choice for a beverage the facialist hired on set to take care of the actor skin is Jasmina Vega go she had them drinking milk to Salty she claims that drinking milk this little tea cleanses the liver and makes the skin more radiant this facialist is from Croatia originally and milk thistle tea is a popular beverage there is liver cleansing a real thing sounds like one of those woo-woo things that gets hyped up on social media only to sell you a package of some sort of supplement well actually when it comes to milk thistle it has compounds in it that are associated with liver protective properties and this is actually an area of active research the compounds in milk though soil are of interest for people who have diseases of the liver now it not an approved treatment for liver disease milk thistle serves as an antioxidant we always talk about antioxidants and their benefits for the skin but your liver has to deal with detoxifying things and when it does that free radicals can be generated especially after heavy drinking of alcohol or if you happen to take in too much acetaminophen it can be quite toxic to the liver this can generate a lot of free radicals that can lead to liver damage milk thistle may also help to increase free radical scavengers within liver cells ultimately that may help them be better equipped to handle toxins as much as I hate the word detox when it comes to detoxification your liver is actually the main organ system task with that Duty the other potentially beneficial aspect of milk thistle is that it is anti-inflammatory and in addition to creating a lot of free radicals toxins that the liver may have to deal with generate an inflammatory Cascade and compounds in milk thistle may help to put the brakes on that lessening the overall inflammation that could harm the liver it least in like cells in a dish to have anti-fibrotic properties basically when you have liver disease the liver can heal with almost like a scar fibrosis that and part of what kicks us off is certain liver cells get changed to what a myofibroblast it starts putting out collagen you know when we talk about skin we improving collagen but you can have abnormal collagen production that results in scarring whether that be in your liver or in your skin it good thing milk thistle compounds may actually put the brakes on that process of conversion of liver cells to myofibroblasts ultimately helping to reduce fibrosis of the liver and so this is an area mostly of active research in terms of helping with patients who have certain types of chronic liver disease one really common type of chronic liver disease is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease the prevalence of this is about 20 to 40 percent in Western countries most of the research examining the effects of milk thistle focus on two things silamarin which is actually a mixture of seven flavor lignins and syllabin syllabin is the most abundant most relevant compound in milk thistle a lot of the studies are pre-clinical cells in a dish animal models not an actual human people but there are studies on people who have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease looking at compounds from milk thistle and helping with things like their insulin resistance which is a major factor in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease milk thistle shows promise for liver disease but it an approved treatment more research is needed now Margot Robbie swearing by drinking milk to Salty by and large seems to be a safe thing to do and we then you also have milk thistle supplements supplements don extensive pre-market testing to demonstrate safety or efficacy and so for that reason they have a very low barrier to entry into the market the other thing to keep in mind with supplements is in many cases the supplement will have other things besides the milk thistle compounds that you are interested in so you have to read labels very carefully the amount of milk thistle components that you might get from a supplement could be quite high and whether or not that biologically relevant we truly don know we don is drinking milk thistle tea safe though by and large it is it adverse effects from drinking the tea you could potentially have some negative side effects maybe from supplements these include diarrhea just gastrointestinal upset headache some people actually develop skin problems related to milk thistle like rashes hives itch there for the supplement or the tea to interact with medications that you are taking so definitely disclose to your health care provider if you are taking milk thistle tea or a milk thistle supplement because there is a potential for it to interact with medications that you might be taking and that could impact their efficacy or it could potentially make them harmful to you if you have an allergy to plants in the Asher family this is includes kiwi artichoke Daisy and other thistles you want to avoid milk to salty because there can be cross reaction you can have a bad allergic reaction just because it mean it that we do have suggest that you can actually get liver toxicity if you take in too much syllabin you have to take in a lot unlikely the amount that you would get from just drinking the tea but you got to be careful if you dietary supplements make sure you read how much is in there although with dietary supplements sometimes the amount that what you if you supplement make sure that it third-party testing like NSF certified this helps to confirm to you that what is listed on the ingredient list is actually what is in the product and we do know that at very high doses syllabin is actually known to trigger asymptomatic liver toxicity meaning you don is evidence on your Labs that your liver is being harmed I there because it liver is starting to be negatively impacted so you may not realize it because these supplements are things that you buy over the counter without a prescription if you end up taking too much you know that you until potentially it is too late but again pretty unlikely at least from the T that you and you have to be taking a lot of syllable to get to the levels that have at least been associated with liver toxicity in clinical studies more evidence is needed though to establish both the short-term and the long-term effects of drinking milk thistle it not FDA approved as a treatment for anything the compounds in milk thistle they actually have very low bioavailability and what I mean by that is when you ingest them their ability to absorb into the body is pretty low first of all syllable and the most abundant and most relevant compound in melchisol it is not soluble in water one might assume that it would be better to take it at least with some sort of a fatty meal or with food rather than on an empty stomach because that may help in improving the absorption but that being said syllabin overall has pretty low intestinal absorption so dietary supplements will tweak things around in order to make the compound more readily absorbed into the body so that may be a good thing it may be a bad thing maybe giving you too much or too little again we don on the optimal dosage to yield any particular benefit and and what groups are going to see that benefit but Margot Robbie that this is going to be good for your skin drinking the tea you know you may be getting some anti-inflammatory compounds but remember they have pretty low bioavailability so the chances that it making its way to the skin so that those antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds may help your skin in warding off oxidative stress that would leave your skin looking dull the likelihood of that seems very low given its low bio availability upon ingestion there actually some interest in applying compounds from milk that silimarron to the skin because it antioxidant it may help in reducing oxidative stress upon exposure to UV and there studies that support that there are also pre-clinical studies that suggest that it may be something that warding off oxidative stress caused by say pollution pollution can oxidize lipids on your skin and generate an inflammatory Cascade and there is some pre-clinical research suggesting that topically applied silimarron an antioxidant anti-inflammatory compound may put the brakes on that which can possibly be beneficial for your skin especially if you acne because we know that with people who have acne they have extra sebum extra oil that they make that oil can be oxidized upon exposure to environmental stressors and that oxidized sea bomb can generate a lot of inflammation and aggravate their acne some of the pre-clinical studies that I here are non-industry sponsored and the authors have no affiliation or no conflicts of interest so it definitely is an ingredient that is of interest for helping to protect the skin against environmental stressors things that could lead to not only premature aging but maybe set the stage for skin cancers or aggravate underlying skin conditions as stands now though silamarin from milk thistle it company that has a skin care product with silimarron in it who has done at least some clinical studies on it albeit they sponsor these studies so take them with a grain of salt it SkinCeuticals I reviewed last year actually silimarron CF serum marketed to people who have acne it has 0.5 percent silamarin in it it also has ferulic acid another antioxidant and it has ascorbic acid now I on here before AKA vitamin C and we all know that it has issues with stability and penetration SkinCeuticals has a track record of good formulations and so it antioxidant formulation the silomere and CF also has salicylic acid which you all know from my videos on salicylic acid it acne it hyperpigmentation so the serum is sort of marketed towards acne prone individuals especially those whose acne heals with a dark mark maybe the antioxidant blend of silamarin ferulic acid and ascorbic acid can help put the brakes on oxidative stress that would lead to hyperpigmentation as well as slow acne healing and then the salicylic acid which is both anti-inflammatory and comedolytic may have benefits there as well but it acne serum yeah it has salicylic acid but you need to be spending that kind of coin on a salicylic acid serum for your acne I don really supports that at this point seems like a pretty steep price point to pay for the potential benefit of the antioxidants in the serum now while the SkinCeuticals silomeran CF serum does have some clinical studies to back it up they are not perfect and I think I pointed out their limitations in my video reviewing that so check that video out if you want to learn more about the product all that to say when it comes to putting antioxidants on the skin they cosmetic ingredients and their efficacy really boils down to the formulation overall of the product in terms of if the antioxidants actually get in they tricky ingredients to work with personally I do use antioxidants in my skincare routine are they necessary are they essential no and you do have to take the industry studies that back them up with a huge grain of salt not to say that they are useless but you know the devil is in the details as far as their efficacy in terms of if they are going to work the formula has to the formula has to be good so should we all start chugging down milk this whole tea I think it lot misleading to suggest that these actors actresses got glowing Barbie doll like skin from drinking tea we all know they have had lots of plastic surgery you know they have makeup they have lighting all of these things that make their skin look the way that it does so please do not think that if you started drinking milk thistle tea you are going to look like a Barbie doll it going to make your face look like shiny plastic provided you don allergies to the Asher family you on any medications you healthy drinking milk thistle tea is safe it not likely to hurt you just don it to completely transform your skin and your skin is great as is why would you want to look like a plastic doll I mentioned this in a video the other day that this is the latest thing to get us to buy skin care products is to choose an inanimate object whether it be a donut piece of glass or in this case a doll and suggests that our skin must look like that and and create a storyline of products all around that inanimate object it I played with Barbie dolls a lot as a child like it was my go-to form of entertainment for majority of my childhood and I still really love Barbie dolls but I know if you like it I I people some people love it some people hate it so let me know in the comments what you thought of it if you saw it or if you excited I thought for today would be appropriate to wear my bright pink top of course I have my pink pillows in the background and it of funny you know as a child like I said I played with Barbie dolls a lot and I do think heavily influenced me because a lot of what I used to play and you know dream up in my Barbie world that I had built in my closet uh you know a lot of my life actually looks like that as as it hope this video was fun and informative to you if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends

*NEW STUDY* MELATONIN GUMMIES ARE MISLABELED | UNSAFE? ??	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NILqJAWi9o	Dr Day	well hey guys let me know in the comments have you ever taken a melatonin gummy or considered taking one to get a good night definitely going to want to watch this video because you know earlier this week I went to my mailbox trusty Journal of the American Medical Association was waiting for me and what caught my eye is a new study that came out showing that if you are taking melatonin gummies you could be exposing yourself to 40 to 130 times the recommended amount of melatonin in this video I explain why that might be putting yourself at risk for serious adverse effects what the heck does this have to do with the skin you might ask you little dermatologist you how dare you speak on things outside of skin listen on this channel I continuously emphasize that you know aside from of course sun protection getting a good night one of the best things that you can do for your skin if not your total body health of course it blood pressure how your immune system functions all sorts of things but you know it those required seven to nine hours a night and so a lot of people a lot of people turn to turn to sleep aids including supplements aimed at sleep many of which have melatonin what the heck is melatonin melatonin is a hormone that your body produces when the lights go down it controls your 24 hour clock your circadian rhythm and your sleep and our modern lifestyle we being exposed to lights blue lights from our devices and that can actually block the normal release of melatonin plays a role in why we are all sleep deprived because we all the time so does taking melatonin actually help with insomnia poor sleep there is some research to suggest that low doses of melatonin anywhere from one to three milligrams can help in certain situations that is the key certain situations melatonin and low doses for a short time can be very valuable for reducing the issues around jet lag it also may be helpful for people who work swing shifts although the research on that is actually kind of conflicting people who suffer from a sleep disorder called delayed sleep wake phase some sleep disorders in children and maybe for the short term it may be useful if you before surgery so those are the select conditions for which there is evidence to support using low-dose melatonin however melatonin it supplement it therefore it so it consumers as a dietary supplement because so many people struggle with sleep they melatonin and we have seen lady ladies and gentlemen and increase five-fold of melatonin supplement usage over the past 20 years why the heck did this research group even seek to test out melatonin amounts and gummies along with the increase in melatonin supplement use especially around the pandemic pandemonium a lot of people you know stressed out understandably poor sleep impacts quality of life we know that poor sleep weakens the immune system people want to get good sleep they want to stay healthy you know ward off viral illness and so people turn to melatonin in an effort to get good sleep we saw a huge increase in people taking melatonin and people are very willing to give it to their children they perceive it as a dietary supplement they think oh it probably natural it unfortunately alarmingly what we also saw during this time was a rise in calls to the U.S poison control center of children overdosing on melatonin an increase of 530 percent in calls poison control center for melatonin overdose in children between 2012 and 2021 27 000 visits to the ER 4 000 children were hospitalized 287 children have ended up in the ICU and two died so this is not not something to take lightly and so the researchers saw these numbers and they melatonin so they they gummies and come to find out a lot of them have a ton of melatonin way more than what is disclosed they ended up analyzing 25 melatonin gummies the amount of melatonin on the label varied with amongst these anywhere from 1.3 milligrams a serving to 13.1 milligrams of serving however the actual quantity they tested the actual quantity ranged anywhere from 74 to 347 percent of what was labeled of the 25 22 were completely inaccurate in terms of the label and what was actually tested to be the case only three actually contained uh within plus or minus 10 percent of the quantity disclosed on the label of the dose another thing they found out is some of these gummies you know they don have melatonin they other stuff including CBD so five of the products declared having CBD when the researchers went in and tested the CBD it was off the charts too 104 to 118 percent higher CBD than what was listed on the label um and of note while the majority of these had melatonin above and beyond what was listed on the label One supplement they tested one gummy they tested had no detectable melatonin in it is this an exclusively American issue no back in 2017 Canada did a similar study testing Canadian melatonin gummies and they have the same issue that study showed anywhere from 17 to 478 percent above what was declared as the quantity of melatonin in in the supplements now obviously the study you know it perfect what supplements did they actually test they don don they go out and do random testing if like you know for legal reasons they don they would right um there are some issues I guess you could point out you know they only tested a small amount of different brands and they only tested one gummy per brand so you could imagine there some batch to batch variability you know maybe it is a one was a one-off thing in some of these but that shouldn but it can we or we um supplements you know these are not medications so this is the kind of heterogeneity that you can get in things you then in reality you could be getting getting much more now what right it naturally produced by by your body surely it because it body doesn doses of it the research that we have to support melatonin for those limited indications that I pointed out um that don don doing it on the regular long term are for your health I mean it it hormone so taking high amounts of it you influencing brain chemistry I would imagine side effects reported with melatonin include fatigue dizziness headache this is what was reported in the clinical trials looking at melatonin those side effects are more common at higher doses but it doesn also develop stomach cramps confusion depression irritability Tremors low blood pressure and anxiety which you know is is terrible right A lot of people they have a sleep problem it makes their anxiety worse they turn to melatonin in an effort to get better sleep maybe it helps in the beginning but then you know they anxiety um and it problem with melatonin especially at these high doses is there evidence to suggest that it can decrease glucose tolerance which can be a serious issue for diabetics and then you know we handle things for elderly adults they going to be slower in metabolizing melatonin that can have implications lead to drowsiness the American Academy of sleep medicine cautions against use of melatonin in those with dementia because again it can have some potential impacts on cognition melatonin can also interfere with certain medications that you might be taking like medications that you may take for seizure disorder or if you always emphasize this you know if you taking supplements don know oh it health care provider that you them because they definitely can impact the metabolism of medications that you might be taking and the reason this this paper is so important is that finding that these gummies have such a high amount you this to a young child you giving them anywhere from 40 to 130 times the recommended dose and that that what the heck that children remember melatonin is a hormone you know it could have serious adverse effects and that fact that we calls to poison control center now we don Control Center were the result of the kids just getting the serving size of melatonin gummies or if what I suspect happen is gummies look like candy this is another thing I problems with gummies because they taste good and because they taste good they very tempting to chill around and they think they to mistake for candy and so you can imagine that they can overdose on on them especially if they have such a high amount to begin with for children the FDA has approved CBD for refractory seizures in children with this very rare genetic disorder but aside from that otherwise healthy children there reason to be giving them CBD that is evidence-based and we don long-term safety let alone at these very high doses you know across all of my videos whether I whether I I ailment of the body body system you gotta know what the root cause is you here is where I see a real problem with melatonin supplements is that people turn to them and put off getting a proper medical evaluation for what is actually going on and causing their sleep problems and this can be deadly again first of all taking a step back sleep you know poor sleep it impacts your cognition can put you at risk for car crashes I mean it serious and life-threatening to be sleep deprived but there are certain underlying Sleep disorders and problems with sleep for which melatonin is not appropriate and there are things that need to be addressed fixed corrected very common to deal with obstructive sleep apnea you need a CPAP if you it can be deadly to continue on with untreated sleep apnea it can be deadly uh causes your blood pressure to go very high puts you at risk for all sorts of heart problems you know stroke Etc you know I always point this out too because something I struggled with when I was a child is people who have a diagnosis of eczema coming back to skin they have disrupted sleep because they have these arousals throughout the night of their skin causing itch and so they constantly you know one having these low-level Awakenings that they really aware of that are disrupting their sleep and children who go through this they often can get misdiagnosed as having like a learning disability or attention problem when in reality it their skin disease impacting their sleep so if the skin disease is controlled and calmed down they can get good quality sleep then they can start focusing better in school and whatnot so so for consumers they proper evaluation because they take these melatonin supplements it could be exposing themselves to very high amounts of it and we don safety implications of even taking it at the low doses that are recommended let alone at these ultra high doses now I want to make it clear this study did not look at a full spectrum of all of the available melatonin supplements out there I mean that I mean the the supplement industry is huge they only looked at a handful of these gummies so if you are going to take a melatonin supplement I highly suggest talking to your health care provider first if you for your child a hundred percent myself and the American Academy of sleep medicine strongly encourage parents to discuss with their child health care provider before giving a melatonin supplement and if you have decided with your health care provider that this is appropriate it for you how do you know you reputable I always recommend looking for third-party verification the USP seal third-party testing to verify that what is on the label is actually what is in the product as it stands now I would stay away from gummies especially if you are a parent because again I think they look like candy they look tasty it easy to overdose and we do see cases of children overdosing on on melatonin and it can land them in the hospital ICU and even you know in those two situations death unfortunately melatonin in these supplements is not natural yes it naturally produced in your body as part of your circadian rhythm but not at this high level and news flash the melatonin in these supplements it they complaint I hear a fair amount is doctors do not treat the root cause they just prescribe prescribe prescribe I sure that you know I there but by and large you know that not that is not the way of medicine and I sleep disorders go in the Melatonin round you skipping out on seeing your health care provider they could identify what the root cause of your sleep problem is and news flash in the vast majority of cases of sleep problems insomnia the first line treatment is not medication it behavioral modifications seeing a health care provider getting the right diagnosis and then being given tools of how you can modify your lifestyle to get your sleep back on track that thing when it comes to sleep is implementing those behavioral pieces of turning off your devices before bed uh you know not eating a large meal all of those sleep hygiene things they pain honestly they especially when our modern lifestyle has you know there heart you honestly you have to put the work in in a lot of cases to to reap the benefits of actually ensuring that you get the right amount honestly it unfortunate that we have to try so hard to do something that should be so natural but it is it is a reality and I can you are struggling with sleep please see your health care provider uh that way you can get the right diagnosis don just turn to melatonin supplements in some cases you could be putting yourself or you know your children in harm let me know what you think guys uh I hope this video was informative to you and if you liked it give a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow bye [Music] thank you [Music]	Success
OLAPLEX IS GETTING SUED FOR ALLEGEDLY CAUSING HAIR LOSS ??	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgG5f91SqS8	Dr Day	so Olex is facing a lawsuit we to talk about it in this video Olex at this point has become somewhat of a household name it social media lots of celebrities endorsing it it products that contains an ingredient Biz aminopropyl D glycol D malate this ingredient Works to repair broken disulfide Bonds in the hair that can come about as a result of bleaching the hair dying the hair using a lot of heat styling tools or just being really aggressive with your hair brush and it those broken dulfi Bonds in the hair proteins that can contribute to frizz breakage and just overall a brittle appearance to the hair this technology reapproximate those bonds helping the hair to be smoother more manageable but as of last week 28 women have filed a lawsuit against Olex in the California District Court claims include that the products have caused more than half of their hair to fall out with Frank bald spots in some cases as well as scalp sword extreme itch yeast infections bacterial infections Frank sores as well as brittle frizzy and overall dull appearing hair the plaintiffs are narrowing in on two ingredients in particular which we as well as panthenol now lilial um a few months ago there were a lot of Tik toks being made about this ingredient because in the EU its usage has been banned lilial is the trade name name for M fenel methyl propanol and it fragrance ingredient now as of March 1st 2022 this ingredient has been categorized as a mutagenic carcinogenic and reprotoxic category 1B substance under the EU and Great Britain classification labeling and packaging regulations the problem with this regulation is that it potentially hazardous outcomes of a particular substance at really extreme concentrations nothing that would ever be used in a personal care product the personal care product industry is regulated and they have to demonstrate safety of their ingredients just because something ends up being carcinogenic and an animal model at extremely high doses doesn translates into a Toxic effect when used an appropriate concentrations in personal care products that have a track record of demonstrated safety in in use in actual humans I mean this is the equivalent of banning water as an ingredient because it drowning it doesn whether or not the risk is actually relevant in the concentrations that are being used in personal care products so if you have bought a product that has lilial and you don to your health and you don throw it in the trash the product will have undergone gone rigorous safety assessment that personal care cosmetic industry however lilial it is fragrance and you can develop an allergy to fragrance as I frequently point out it is a relatively common allergen the most frequent allergen in personal care product so yes it absolutely is possible that these individuals are allergic to Lilo they had an adverse reaction leading to a scalp dermatitis the scalp dermatitis potentially could be so intense that it loss that is a possibility but does that make Olex at fault no because you can develop this type of reaction to really any personal care product that has fragrance in it fragrances are so widespread in personal care products especially in hair care products for those who truly have an allergy it can actually be very challenging to find fragrance-free hair care products as many of you out there who are allergic to fragrance know if these individuals truly are allergic which would need to be demonstrated by say patch testing if they truly are allergic to this ingredient well then it necessarily Olex pretty much any brand that has fragrance in it likely can cause this problem for the individual what fragrance component they reacting to if it is the lilial probably will show up in other personal care products as well as household products things like cleaning sprays laundry detergents as a precaution Olex went ahead and removed this ingredient just to be on the safe side but to be clear it developed an allergy to lilial there no reason to fear it or to avoid it uh only those who have an allergy a sensitivity to the ingredient need to avoid it the levels that you are being exposed to in personal care products are negligible and what is the impetus for the band is often rooted in animal studies where they amounts and they to that particular ingredient in a way that would never be such in a personal care product like we high doses that they the animal and not to mention animal studies are not necessarily indicative of what alone when we just coming in contact with the skin which as a reminder is a barrier If This Were A oneoff new ingredient I would say yeah I I guess I can see an abundance of caution but it products for a long time with no evidence of true harm to human health other than the possibility of someone developing an allergy to it which you can develop an allergy to pretty much any ingredient the other ingredient that the plaintiffs have concerned about is panthenol now panthenol is a B vitamin but it care products but in skincare products because it is moisturizing it hygroscopic it helps improve the water content in the skin and it is a very lowrisk ingredient for you becoming alergic iic to I mean of course you can develop an allergy like I said to anything but panthenol it risk uh contct dermatitis to panthenol is very rare very rare very unusual for the most part it moisturizing ingredient in personal care products I did see some uh mention too from the plaintiffs that they had some concerns around potentially degrading into Benzene which of course is a carcinogen If This Were true I imagine that the amount that you are exposed to is very very negligible we about Benzene detection and personal care products on this channel before it is not something that is associated with harm to human health in these very low Trace Amounts so keep that in mind um I with this but that was one concern that they raised let bacterial infections that they claim now I don they have Whenever there is a lawsuit like this plaintiffs have some problems that have developed but we don get the nitty-gritty details of their medical history and what the actual diagnosis is so I bacterial infection they had are they saying that the products were contaminated that seems highly unlikely given how rigorous um cosmetic standards are in the personal care industry for demonstrating the safety of the product in terms of a bacterial contamination standpoint point that being said if a product is very irritating to the scalp and leads to dermatitis maybe causing the person to scratch a lot and a lot of these people did note that it caused itch pretty notable itch for them well the action of scratching and inflammation makes the scalp more amenable to the introduction of bacterial organisms that could lead to a scalp foliculitis for sure but we don really know that that was the course with this to be clear I guessing here as to what is going on with these women we will never know um these are possibilities but I their doctor and so we don their diagnosis truly is and and and how they acquired these problems they also mentioned yeast infections now I sure what yeast they um it would be very unusual for candada yeast to H to to develop on the scalp from a a personal care product I mean that would be unless these people are immunosuppressed it it for something of that sort to happen so I doubt that about maybe they they they they did mention cic dermatitis or concerns about cic dermatitis so maybe they reminder seic dermatitis AKA dandr flaky flaky scalp um that is often that related to an inflammatory response to malesia yeast but malesia yeast are naturally present on everyone S dermatitis is not really considered an an infection per se because again we all have that yeast on on the scalp so I guess you know are are they are they saying yeast infection when they mean aggravation of underlying CC dermatitis or CC dermatitis I guessing here they said they developed rashes and they also said they developed open sores now open sores certainly can develop if you are scratching a lot um for sure and as I mentioned earlier with ongoing itch and scratching you can introduce bacteria into the scalp and that can lead to a scalp infection so one would expect that if these problems were arising they would be more prominent on maybe like the sides of the face the sides of the neck where your hair comes in contact not so much the scalp as much one would think you know if it ingredients you would expect to see these problems elsewhere plaintiffs also point out a concern that Olex contains nonwater soluble ingredients that they feel are clogging the pores and leading to seic dermatitis and I am assuming they in Olex products now silicones they safe for the hair what they do is they provide slip and lubrication to the hair strands but in some people they can lead to a buildup that could contribute to to breakage especially in certain hair types and it unusual though for silicons in hair care products to end up causing sebri dermatitis on the scalp because silicons they very irritating to the skin they frequently found in skincare products silicon as an underlying Trigger or cause for sebic dermatitis it not something that we see the plaintiffs also alleged that they felt Olex was very dismissive of their hair loss concerns saying that you know it normal to lose lose hairs every day it is normal lose about 100 to 200 hairs a day but if you are getting more than that or a lot of breakage I do think that it is worthwhile taking a look at your hair care products to see if they aren maybe drying your hair out or causing brittleness but everyone is so different that for a hair care product to um worn consumers of that it know definitely worth taking them serious in terms of their hair loss concerns hair loss always needs to be taken seriously but I truly wonder what exactly their hair loss or hair concern diagnosis is again I we don that of them alleged that they develop Frank bald patches well did they develop alopecia Arata an autoimmune hair loss we do see that a fair amount in in people and it can all of a sudden you you develop a bald patch it has to do with your immune system attacking the hair follicles it has nothing to do with the hair care products that you there can have little pus bumps associated with it called um Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia very challenging hair loss disorder for patients and that is one where certain hair care products that are irritating definitely can aggravate that condition so I can see perhaps it would make sense that that this product these products could could be aggravating that type of hair loss condition as far as an increase in hair shedding that would be unusual to see from a hair care product usually an increase in hair shedding reflects something going on internally for example maybe you had a viral illness you developed a fever or you were pregnant you delivered a baby you were breastfeeding you were on a new medication I mean there internal things that trigger increased hair shedding it in fact Co is known to cause aogen alium that is pretty profound and I will note that there seemed to be an uptick in interest and promotion of Olex products during the stay-at-home time and throughout the pandemic so maybe Olex could be guilty by association in some cases of increased hair shedding maybe somebody had covid and they are now developing the postco hair loss which as a side note I have a whole video on that definitely check it out uh you know and maybe Olex is just kind of Guilty By Association there because that hair shedding The increased in hair shedding it appears about 3 months after after the fact so you may not make the connection that it was something else and you may have recently started using Olex around the time that the shedding starts and you together but it really has nothing to do with ol Plex or any hair hair product for that matter I do think that that these individuals their hair loss concern needs to be taken seriously and they need to to have you know be evaluated by a board-certified dermatologist to truly know what on otherwise how do you know that it it otherwise it Association which is very easy to to happen for a hair care product or any personal care product now the last thing that they brought up which I really do think bear is mentioning is they pointed out concerns that these products were being so hyped on social media by not only influencers but by celebrities like I think Kim Kardashian and they noted that they felt like perhaps there was some degree of failure to properly disclose paid promotion yeah that is definitely a valid criticism something that should be explored I Olex is guilty of doing influencer paid promotion and you know signing off on influencers not disclosing their advertisements properly I that but if the if the plaintiffs feel that that was going on they definitely you know it to bring up 100% because failure to disclose paid advertisement is a violation of FTC guidelines and um you know I can definitely see how as a consumer you would be livid if you saw this product being promoted by an an influencer that you look up to and they made it seem as though they went out and purchased the product with their own money and that they were using it um and you know genuinely loved it but in reality behind the scenes they were either gifted the product and they didn actually being paid to promote it unfortunately you know I do paid promotion as you guys know here on YouTube over on Instagram over on my Tik Tok I do paid ads I 100% always disclose when I am being paid to talk about something and it because I want you guys to know that it is paid promotion first and foremost and second of all it third of all the brands that I work with uh in the contract that that that always there in the contract that that ads must be disclosed like so it would be I Would Not only would I be violating the FTC guidelines but I would be it would be in violation of my contract with these Brands but I can just tell you you know in my experience working with Brands it would be I don find it hard to believe that Brands actually would co-sign on an advertisement uh paid advertisement in which the influencer was not properly disclosing their their relationship but you know I have heard uh that it allegedly happens I don that it does but I have heard allegedly that it has happened you know maybe more recently but I don happens because not only like I said is it a violation of FTC guidelines but it would be at least the contracts that I have it mean I don dis I don disclose I mean whenever you put yourself out there you feedback criticism and you know maybe they don I don just comes with putting yourself out there there who don an effort to evade the criticism just seems like I don but I find it really hard to believe that a brand would sign off on so like when when you do a sponsored post you create the content and you actually send it to the brand they have to approve it before you post it that they have to approve it they you can just create it and post it they have to approve it and it has to have you you also have to send them the caption and all the hashtags that you use and all of that stuff so it in the contract that you disclose and it the contract exactly all the ways they want you to disclose it to use the tools that the individual app has like YouTube has that little box that I checked that says this video over on Instagram and Tik Tok they have the paid paid promotion headers that you can that you need to activate and then it it it mentioned verbally I mean there are a lot of there are a lot of check marks that go into into it and and the brands outline those check marks in the contract so I don make it through through the approval process from the brand without those check marks I know very recently there was a beauty Guru on on Tik Tok who did what uh was an ad and it was not disclosed in the beginning properly and then it later on was disclosed and I so I I do know that it appears though that does happen but in my experience working with Brands and I now for over six years um Instagram and now Tik Tok for a couple of years I do not see how that happen in fact many of the brands that I work with not only is there somebody in like their social media Department that I that is responsible for approving my content but after they approve it they actually send it to a legal team and a legal team approves it and then I know allowed to to make sure I saying anything that is you know misleading um or like making a drug claim when talking about a skincare product so I just find it very unusual that that this is happening but I guess it does um you know I I guess it all depends on who you work with so those are the claims that um the plaintiffs are making now here never know if Olex is truly causing problems for these people or if they have some other type of hair loss and Olex is merely Guilty By Association we will never know I will remind you that this kind of lawsuit happens a lot right um since I hair care product lawsuits have we gone through Diva Curl a few years ago very similar claims uh Tresemme very similar claims OGX similar claims uh so you know and we never get any answers were these actually problematic products who knows cuz again we their doctors we don their medical history but their concerns do need to be taken seriously but whether or not it products I I honestly doubtful let me know in the comments though have you ever used OLX uh was it as good as it did it help you out yeah let me know in the comments how your experience with it went but hope you guys enjoyed this video if so give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen And subscribe I to you guys tomorrow bye [Music]	Success
SPICULES ARE A TIKTOK SKINCARE TREND *i have concerns*	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmmgaHhm5LY	Dr Day	well hey guys guess what is all the rage over on everyone Tock spicules in skin care when I first saw this I thought wait a minute are they talking about spicules as in sponges like what you get from the ocean or fresh water oh yes that is what they into it in today this crazy Tick Tock Trend now I first saw this I think on my for you page uh look like people were getting all excited over some kind of skincare product that came in what looked like uh I don use to play darts with here I this has a kind of sponge in it it Korean based that creates basically the effect of micro needling because they are similar to Tiny needles now I going to massage it in for five to seven minutes and I of the pressure that I um so I just want to know how it feels because I hurt or not I will say you can definitely feel the little needles you know what it reminds me of is like those tiny like tiny tiny cactus that you can get I literally got one at CVS one time and if you like touch it and you get it and your finger has like those really soft Cactus needles but I going to keep doing this for five more minutes what the heck are spicules spicules are microscopic particles that make up sponges and sponges if you didn living animals on the planet spicules come in a wide array of shapes and sizes forms and if you look at them under the electron microscope they look like something out of a medieval torture Arsenal they spiky Barbed all sorts of shapes and sizes doesn something we want to be padding in as part of a relaxing skincare routine right you don figure out by looking at these that they made out of silica and calcium now while this is popular over on Tick Tock in all seriousness spicules are of Interest as a delivery device for topical medications or active ingredients in skin care products because of their pointy shape it might help enhance penetration of things just looking at them under the microscope you might think well perhaps these through their abrasive properties may help in exfoliating the skin similar to a mechanical exfoliant like Walnut shells which we all know can be pretty irritating to the skin regardless they are of attractive potential for therapeutic and cosmetic delivery of a variety of ingredients it issue in skin care formulation I mean manufacturers that make skin care products they really have their hands tied because you barrier right the topmost layer of your epidermis it people always like to describe it as bricks and mortar the bricks are corneocytes and the mortar is lipids it kind of glue everything together and that lipid barrier really makes it difficult for things to penetrate and by and large I mean that that outside world prevents like infectious organisms from getting at and it helps keep hydration in place and we all know that when that gets disrupted we can get dry skin we irritation and skin problems but getting ingredients across that is no easy task especially ingredients that are water loving and large in size now conventional approaches to circumventing the barrier issue so as to allow ingredients and skin care products to get in include things like Nano emulsions polymeric hydrogels liposomes these are not perfect Solutions however whereas others have used like physical approaches to actually disrupt the barrier open it up and allow for entry of active ingredients who here has ever used one of those micro needling patches they become really popular over the years they look like a pimple patch but they have little micro needle darts on them that have set active ingredient and the idea is that you the skin it penetration of set ingredient however a lot of people find them very uncomfortable my understanding is actually difficult to reliably get a good dose of the active on those darts so delivery is variable the other issue with the micro Dart patches is that anytime you have something under occlusion like with this patch it likely to be irritating so yes you are perhaps enhancing penetration through those little micro darts but then the surrounding skin is occluded with that patch in the background of enhanced delivery of said active it just might make it a lot more irritating for the user so there imagine with alternative delivery methods and if you look at a lot of these spicules up close you can see they kind of look like micro needles so obviously they are of interest but the technology is in its infancy to say for sure whether or not this is going to be something that be safe or effective there there that takes spicules from sponge and purify its isolates them out of the sponge you know it process to get them out I schematic here of the the methodology and then this this group they try to see if they could load the spicules with liposomes of of something and and see if they could actually get it to work actually get it to penetrate a pig Scan they use porcine skin models you can see here that they got it at work in the sense that you can you can actually see that spicule piercing the pig scan and they show that the liposomes do in fact penetrate more readily with the with the microspicule technology if you will it basically like a little mini hypodermic needle in a sense that you are smearing over the skin surface I mean the real benefit here really depends on what it is that or being applied after you have used it in effect it is a form of physical exfoliation but it also has a potential through these spicules to pierce the skin and deliver active ingredients and that could be a good thing it could be a bad thing you know your body may not react well to that as I always like to point out you going to be much different than than pigskin but there actually is a study looking at a microspicule with uh epidermal growth factor growth factor their their penetration in the skin is is variable whether or not they do anything is also of a significant question regardless there is a study where they looked at microspicules with epidermal growth factor for improvement of crow wrinkles around the eyes they had the participants in one half of the group just use a growth factor to to the area for four weeks and the other group they had used this microspicule growth factor combo now at the end of the eight weeks both groups had Improvement in the appearance of wrinkles but the group who used epidermal growth factor with microspicules they had a more significant Improvement in comparison to just just the growth factor alone suggesting that they had better penetration and in fact they did show that the penetration was enhanced now it group getting the microspicule treatment it it they had them apply this every single day for four weeks and first they put it on and they massage it in for 20 seconds then they had them apply distilled water to dissolve any remaining spicules I guess in the skin surface and then massage for an additional 20 seconds and I guess the thought process here with having them use the distilled water to dissolve any remaining spicules is to minimize irritation the group that got the micro spicules with EGF they did experience so some temporary short-lived redness and a sensation of prickling that went away very quickly without any intervention so over all rated there were no real Adverse Events aside from that with a microspicule EGF group so it suggests that they are safe but again they only looked out to eight weeks long story short this paper did suggest that the microspicule EGF combo did result in better penetration of the EGF and an overall more significant Improvement in wrinkles around the eyes so that promising but again it study not perfect and it has a lot of limitations and more research needs to be done so what do I think of this I think it is going to end up being an effective delivery method for active ingredients or if it is going to be an effective or safe method for exfoliating for smoothing the skin surface out like is this actually any better than just using a chemical exfoliant like salicylic acid or glycolic acid to smooth the skin surface is this any more effective though at smoothing the skin surface and exfoliating and helping facilitate desk formation of the coordinate sides of cells that make up that that protective layer they shed and that you you are hoping to even out and smooth out are those shedding cells there with exfoliants is this necessarily any better than using a chemical exfoliant when you use a chemical exfoliant or any type of exfoliant for that matter it will allow better penetration of subsequent things that are applied afterwards whether that be your vitamin C serum or your retinoid and this can be a good thing and that you know you get better uptake but it also can increase the irritancy of that ingredient so it and what works for one person may not work for another in terms of enhancing penetration of things it may be too much it may be too aggressive for certain people but using spicules to actually deliver active ingredients rather than simply enhancing penetration by smoothing skin surface the skin surface out to actually load them up with the ingredient and have the those spicules pierce the skin and introduce it into the skin that is something that I do think is of Interest as a topical delivery approach but more research is needed just because it appears to be safe at eight weeks I do have concerns and reservations about the use of these spicules in skin care as I said the spicules they are comprised of silica and calcium and there is one issue with putting silica on the skin especially when you into the skin is there known as a silica granuloma now silica silica is very abundant naturally and our environment we lot and despite that the occurrence of silica granulomas on the skin is actually pretty rare you can develop these though through traumatic introduction of silica into the skin from Sand glass rock slate this is a something that you know an at-risk group might be somebody who is doing some type of construction work where they come in contact with things like this or if you were in a car accident and bits of glass got into the skin in theory you could later on in life develop a silica granuloma what basically a foreign body response to the silica that has been introduced into your skin via traumatic means and essentially your immune system gets kind of like annoyed by it being there and tries to wall it off and the end result of that is the appearance of a bump on the skin and they can you know be pink bumps smooth bumps or just very large bumps and when you biopsy these bumps you can see these bizarre geometric shapes that are obviously of not of human origin and they they come from uh you know the introduction of silica from from a traumatic injury and the funny thing about these is they don happen overnight they can they can appear you know gradually it latency period from the time it introduced to the time these bumps actually appear anywhere from six months all the way out to 60 years uh these might not appear for decades and decades and at that at that point you know too little too late because the way to get rid of these is surgical removal uh you know it can be quite a challenge depending on how large they are and that thing that would be my main reservation with these uh but otherwise you know it goes but otherwise it pretty uh premature to say anything about the the benefits of using these over using any other exfoliant out there at the very least and so stay tuned I don rubbing spicules on your skin I I do think it not only has the potential for for this but uh as you can imagine the likelihood of irritation is definitely there from something like this as with any exfoliant but here I mean I showed you what these things look like up close you can imagine them it really looks like some kind of medieval torture to the stratum corneum who knows maybe in a few years I making a video raving all about spicules and skin care products but as it stands now more research is needed and I do have a long-term safety concerns with uh introducing silica into your skin in that way people love DIYs right so here and you know go diving for sponges and and try try and do this yourself okay sponges I mentioned this earlier they like the oldest living organism on the planet they tons of different types of sponges out there and um for many many years people have been using natural sponges to bathe with the silk sponge the silk sponge is harmless he spongia aficionalis not dangerous to you know to bathe with a silk silk sponge bathing sponge but other sponges can actually be pretty dangerous to the skin because you know either you can introduce shards of the of the spicules into the skin like I mentioned uh or a lot of sponges are colonized with jellyfish so you not only get a traumatic injury from those shards getting into the skin but then the jellyfish that colonize them get released and sting and that can be pretty deadly actually a lot of sponges produce toxins called crinotoxins and many make this uh slimy mucus that is very irritating to the skin sponge dermatitis is actually something that we we see a fair amount in like well sponge divers and and people who dive my marine biology students anybody you know hanging out with sponges in the ocean is an at-risk group for this but it actually pretty serious and it can be broken down into two types of skin reactions first you have an initial itchy dermatitis that happens usually within 20 minutes of contact with these you get itching burning the skin can swell up you can get these little water blisters that can later become filled with pus it actually can result in muscle pain joint pain fevers and in some cases you can go on to develop full-blown anaphylactic shock sponge dermatitis is serious it has a potential to be life-threatening then later on you have the potential for a delayed irritant dermatitis as a result of things that have been introduced into the skin the spicules and anything that are at risk for infections uh you know a sponge while it the most hygienic thing to be just injecting into your skin so it actually can be pretty serious there called sponge divers disease basically those little jellyfish that can colonize a sponge the stinging jellyfish that can result in a necrotic dermatitis basically death and destruction of the skin as it relates to having come in contact with these sponges this is interesting dog Bank itch a dermatitis that happens because the individual has become sensitized to two hydroxyethyl dimethyl sulfoxonium chloride that comes from the sea sure ball can you imagine if somebody in the clean Beauty movement encountered that word two hydroxyethyl-dimethyl sulfoxonium chloride they would be quaking in their boots but hand them a sponge and spicule up and yeah next thing you know they selling you an 80 cream and an egg to put in your vagina I digress all right so that that can happen you can become sensitized to that compound that is found on the sea sureball all natural sea sherbil and of course you can develop a secondary infection sponge dermatitis it is not it is not anything to take lightly when a patient presents with sponge dermatitis the management is initial decontamination of the skin actually you have to take either tape or believe it or not rubber cement yeah getting real high tech but I joking put it on the skin and tape strip or peel off the rubber cement just like you used to do as a kid on your hand to remove those spicules uh you know right away and then they have to do cereal dilute vinegar soaks of the area they have to be monitored you know they have to come back and follow up very carefully because they developing secondary skin infections and again they can go on to develop blisters and serious complications so it nothing to take lightly all that to say I you know I doubt you these issues if you buy the spicule creams assuming the manufacturer has you know Done Right by their manufacturing best practices which they should be and they have purified the spicule to remove all that potentially harmful yuck which you don with but regardless you still obviously can develop an irritant dermatitis uh but yeah this is not something I I would do or recommend more research is needed but it be interesting to see if and how the research evolves over the years anyway y spicules in skin care uh proceed with caution as with everything you encounter on the old tick tock you don this video now on the end slide I going to put my recent video on another Tick Tock Trend although they probably forgotten about it over there because things they come and go uh all about skin flooding so check that one out next if you missed it but if you guys like this

THE TRUTH ABOUT OZEMPIC FACE ?? Dermatologist @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bFJaX0EzKo	Dr Day	well hey guys the internet is all abuzz with ozembic face basically a phenomenon in which people who are taking ozembic lose a lot of weight relatively quickly and their face appears suddenly much thinner with more prominent wrinkles and sagging making them look well older in this video I going on here and how this works as per usual the internet is making a mountain out of a molehill and they things all wrong there the drug ozembic that is changing the way people look or making them appear older this is something that can be seen anytime somebody loses a significant amount of weight it has nothing to do with the drug itself per se I this out because there are a lot of harmful and false narratives being perpetuated online about this drug causing these types of changes when in reality this is a change that can be seen with any type of significant weight loss the same type of change can also be seen in people who have had bariatric surgery for weight loss so it specific to the medication what the heck is ozembic anyway there you it Internet ozembic is a weekly injection that helps improve insulin sensitivity and people who have type 2 diabetes but it also suppresses appetite and the downstream consequences of that are going to be weight loss ozembic is the brand name but the medication itself is called somaglotide somaglatide acts like a hormone which is naturally present in everyone hormone makes its way to your brain and it tells you that you are full so you stop eating so people taking some magnetod will feel full eating less food ultimately they lose weight the FDA approved of zembec in 2017 for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ozembic is not the only medication in this class four years later they gave the green light for approval of a higher dose version meant specifically for people with obesity for example wagovi is FDA approved for people who have a BMI of 27 or above plus one or more weight related ailments or for people who have a BMI of 30 or above however these medicines education started getting a lot of hype and a lot of attention around last year in the spring when Kim Kardashian lost a ton of weight in order to fit in Marilyn Monroe whole debacle for the Met Gala it was rumored that she was on ozembic that rumor that then later on Elon Musk tweeted out that he has taken ozembic as well as a related compound bulgogovi variety magazine dubbed ozombic as the worst kept weight loss secret in Hollywood because a lot of people taking this medication who don or diabetes they just want wanting to drop a few pounds and the Drug cheap anywhere from thirteen hundred to fifteen hundred dollars a month so many people these days really really struggle with obesity unfortunately Society views it as a problem with willpower and a moral failing but there that goes into obesity and many people who have obesity they do struggle to lose weight despite diet and lifestyle modified locations these drugs are not the Quick Fix they still need to put in the work to change their diet and to exercise unfortunately Society still views obesity as like a moral failing when in reality there are genetic factors that play a role they actually physiologic differences between people that make it to that it harder for some people to lose weight than others who have obesity unfortunately with it being so popularized across social media and getting all of this media attention and hype there ozembic that I think it has led people by and large to view this as a quick weight loss fix that these medications are a serious commitment zembic can help people lose about 15 percent of their body weight but again they still have to put in the work of eating healthy and moving their body and making lifestyle adjustments I already pointed out it is very expensive you can expect to lose weight in three months get off the medication and keep it off once you stop the medication and the drug leaves your system your appetite is going to return studies suggest that people will regain two-thirds of the weight that they lost within one year of stopping the medication so that this isn you have people for which this medication is medically necessary and it really really helps a lot of patients who have obesity and or type 2 diabetes on the other hand you have people because of popularization on social media celebrities and what have you who are led to believe that this is just going to be a quick weight loss fix or to get their body summer ready to shed a few extra pounds and I got news for you that is not what this medication is what about ozembic face then again as I said at the beginning of the video this is a myth the drug does not change your face the weight loss changes your face when it comes to weight loss you can reduce fat this is a myth that people need to stop perpetuating there is no such thing as spot reduction of fat but as that fat comes off you to lose fat in other areas where you may not necessarily want to like your face I have a video all about how your face changes with age and as you from that video one major shift that happens as we get into our wiser years is that we get shrinkage of the fat pads interface and redistribution of those and therefore when somebody loses a lot of weight especially when they lose a lot of weight very quickly those fat pads in the face they are going to be affected and you can appreciate them some sagging more prominent jowls in some cases deeper wrinkles and just an overall sunken appearance but that can happen with weight loss surgery any type of weight loss can cause that though it how do you prevent this from happening like I said you can you can to go down in your face so after a significant weight loss if there is a lot of notable volume loss in the face that can be replaced with cosmetic filler or autologous fat transplant it involves taking fat and putting it back into your face either borrowing it from your hips or your abdomen another spin on ozembic face is ozembic body basically similar to ozomic face which again to be clear it should just be called weight loss phase weight loss body when you lose a lot of weight you are left with skin laxity loose skin especially in the abdominal region maybe around the arms and for a lot of people this really bothers them in some cases the loose skin can actually cause problems because you have a lot of loose skin that develops friction and within the folds of loose skin you get sweat trapping moisture the skin can break down as a result of trapping of moisture and friction and irritants in the skin folds of the loose skin and that can cause a hospitable environment for colonization with like yeast you can get recurrent skin infections it can actually be really painful whether it be that you of loose skin cosmetically or you developing complications the remedy for that is going to be surgery to remove the loose skin loose skin surgery that something that a plastic surgeon would do it on a whim lots of counseling goes into that it is a very involved procedure I mentioned that with age we get shrinkage of fat pads in the face and redistribution of those and that contributes to the appearance of facial aging but you also have some changes that happen in the breast in women when you more glandular tissue but as you age that is replaced more so with fat so for women who have profound weight loss their breasts can shrink and droop and they may be bothered by that cosmetically in which case they may seek out a breast augmentation or lift but you can not expect it to impact your breath another thing to think about is that any prior fat transfer procedure you may have had is going to likewise shrink specifically if you had a breast augmentation with that or if you had a Brazilian butt lift butt augmentation in those cases the surgeon had borrowed fat from like your your abdomen or your hips and put it in your breasts or in your rear end well guess what when you lose a lot of weight that affected the fat that was borrowed from your stomach or your hips it retains the memory of those locations so that it called donor site memory it remembers how it behaved in its prior location and therefore in the breasts and in the buttock you will get shrinkage of that transplanted fat and so you may need to go back and have revisions of these procedures that you had in the past so to be clear the changes that happen to your face and to your body they side effects of the medication they are consequences of losing a lot of weight this will happen regardless of what weight loss approach you take especially if it is rapid weight loss in terms of actual side effects to these medications the most common are gastrointestinal offset nausea vomiting diarrhea to counteract these side effects of nausea vomiting patients are started at a low dose and the doses only increased once those side effects have subsided and they nausea if you have been placed on one of these medications by your treating doctor to help with either type 2 diabetes or to help with with weight loss well your doctor should be monitoring your response the side effects and adjusting the dose accordingly and importantly they should be monitoring to make sure that the weight loss is not happening too quickly however there is kind of a boom in more online Telehealth type mechanisms to acquire this medication in which case you do have to question are people being monitored appropriately are they getting too high of a dose and losing too much weight too quickly so you want to make sure that this isn are just being influenced to take for weight loss because you saw it online this is something that you really should be monitored by your doctor for and to make sure that it is even indicated for you it you still need to put in the lifestyle modifications if you shelling out thirteen to fifteen hundred dollars a month for this medication just to get Summer body ready uh no not a good idea but if you are somebody who has Type 2 diabetes or you have obesity and or weight related ailments you may be a candidate for it and under doctor supervision it can be safely administered and actually really change people wanted to make this video because obviously cosmetic issues are in the realm of Dermatology things like filler that somebody might think they need with this kind of weight loss but I was motivated to make this video because I do not like seeing the spread of misinformation and misleading messages around Medical Treatments and therapies people who struggle with obesity they have been stigmatized and stigmatized and so to have people make comments like don going to make you look old it ignorant because you telling the person don going to look old and that on this medication whatsoever but I wanted to make this video to make it clear that the drug itself is not what is causing these changes in people face or body it you can see with any type of weight loss especially rapid weight loss there are cosmetic procedures that you may be motivated or inclined to pursue after the weight loss if that if you want to hear more information about this drug from somebody who actually prescribes it and is really an expert in obesity management I suggest the Instagram account I below Spencer nadalski he who specializes in obesity management he makes really great content about this very informative so I would suggest his content if you actually want to learn more about the drug I hope this video was helpful to you on the end slide I going to link my recent video All About The Tick Tock frenzy around Buckle fat pad removal so check that one out next if that interests you but if you guys like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don I [Music]	Success
CALLING OUT PHYLA FOR THEIR BOGUS CLAIMS ?? @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW1DFdpvY9Q	Dr Day	well hey guys here we are again to defend once again tretinoin along with some other standard of care treatments and dermatology that have been around for a long time y comment on phyla skin care and the claims they make on their website about various acne treatments including retinoids so we what they have to say debug some of the misinformation on their website they claim to be the biggest acne breakthrough in 40 years that bold claim we their technology works or they claim it works later on in the video but if you go on the website it position their product up against the standard of care acne treatments benzoyl peroxide antibiotics and retinoids and here benzoyl peroxide a form of bleach that produces dangerous free radicals which damage the skin and activate aging Pathways in skin cells that scary sounding statement yes there is truth embedded in that but the way they word it it really is set up to make you terrified of benzoyl peroxide what is benzoyl peroxide it is an acne treatment which destroys bacterial cell walls killing them and so it in acne partially because it destroys the acne causing bacterium cutie bacterium acnes now another benefit of benzoyl peroxide is that it helps with breaking up in the shedding of skin cells that are stuck together and breaking up of clogged pores so it comedolytic which is really helpful for acne of course it perfect and there are some limitations number one is probably the most common and that is tolerability namely it can be pretty irritating to the skin leading to redness peeling dryness symptoms of stinging and sensitivity that tends to be more common at higher concentrations of benzoyl peroxide and it tends to get better with ongoing use of benzoyl peroxide the other concern around benzoyl peroxide has always been this question of does it make the skin more sensitive to the sun is it photosensitizing truthfully the research looking exactly at that is mixed suffice to say the FDA cautions consumers that they should avoid unnecessary sun exposure while using benzoyl peroxide and they should always wear a sunscreen and exercise Sun protected behaviors when going Outdoors the other issue around benzoyl peroxide is yes it does create free radicals that it works now because it does create free radicals that not only could damage bacterial cell walls but have the potential to damage proteins and lipids in your skin there overarching question of does use of benzoyl peroxide prematurely age the skin truthfully we don evidence that that actually happens it definitely a theoretical possibility but the research that we have does not support that this occurs and remember this has been an acne treatment for over 60 years and we don that that happens of course benzo peroxide as I mentioned can be pretty drying especially in the beginning that can make the signs of skin aging more obvious when the skin is dry and irritated wrinkles and Fine Lines they issue around benzoyl peroxide is that it can cause a contact dermatitis there are two types of contact dermatitis irritant contact dermatitis in which an ingredient is simply just super irritating and allergic contact dermatitis a dermatitis in which your body is actually allergic to the ingredient and you develop a rash whenever you come in contact with it of those two irritant contact dermatitis is far more common with benzoyl peroxide allergic contact dermatitis true allergy to benzoyl peroxide is actually not that common anywhere from 0.2 percent to one percent rates of allergic contact dermatitis two benzoyl peroxide itself the other overriding concern or question is well if benzoyl peroxide is targeting bacteria couldn bacteria on our skin surface that are important for skin microbiome that certainly is a possibility that with long-term uninterrupted use in theory you might make the argument that it could be disruptive to your skin microbiome but we don evidence that that actually happens is there any evidence that benzoyl peroxide ages your skin in short no theoretically it clinical body of experience does not suggest that that actually happens importantly benzoyl peroxide is part of the evidence-based treatment guidelines put out by the American Academy of Dermatology and the Global Alliance for improved outcomes and acne as part of the first line treatment for acne regardless of severity so my problem is that they position a well-researched evidence-based effective first-line acne treatment that is also affordable they position it in such a way so as to make it sound scary and harmful to the skin they position it that way so as to make their product sound more attractive here antibiotics antibiotics cause antimicrobial resistance and an endless cycle of relapses antibiotic resistance is a major issue when it comes to acne treatment I mean worldwide antibiotic resistance is certainly of concern when antibiotics are used too frequently you run the risk that the bacteria become resistant to them creating Super Bug strains and that definitely is a problem for this reason antibiotics that are used in the treatment of acne which include both topical antibiotics like clindamycin and erythromycin as well as oral antibiotics like doxycycline and Minocycline we use these primarily actually for their anti-inflammatory effects and the goal is to only use them for a very limited duration because they are pretty effective actually at clearing up the acne quickly and that can be beneficial for reducing the risk that the person goes on to develop scars it aim to keep the person on and definitely because of course of the risk of antibiotics resistance it an issue and it can contribute to treatment failure but prolonged courses of antibiotics are not the goal of acne management and when used under the direction and supervision of your treating dermatologists this should not be an issue it should be limited furthermore the American Academy of Dermatology and the Global Alliance for improved outcomes and acne their treatment guidelines actually suggest benzoyl peroxide as a first line treatment because benzoyl peroxide while it kills off the acne causing bacteria see acne like like an antibiotic would there resistance to benzoyl peroxide furthermore in the case where antibiotics are needed using them alongside benzoyl peroxide reduces the risk that resistant organisms will emerge and moving on to what they have to say about retinoids retinoids that claim accelerate the production of new skin cells and result in your skin aging faster oh boy this could not be further from the truth we have a lot of research clearly demonstrating that tretinoin actually helps to minimize and improve signs of skin aging and it also helps to mitigate the damage to the skin from UV by suppressing enzymes that destroy the supportive framework of the skin so if anything we have a body of research to suggest the opposite of what they saying here that it actually improves skin aging not worsens it what they getting at is the concept of the hayflick limit which is this idea that cells have a limited number of cell divisions before they are in a more and so by increasing cell division you are increasing skin aging however the hayflect limit which has to do with something called telomeres on on the ends of your DNA the hayflick limit does not apply to stem cells stem cells are much different than differentiated cells stem cells reside in the bottom layer of the epidermis known as the stratum basal as well as within the hair follicle and they function to ensure the maintenance of skin homeostasis and regeneration so you don doesn cell turnover because of that population of stem cells down there furthermore if the hayflick limit applied to your skin basically anything that scraped the skin rubbed up against the skin could then cause the skin to age more quickly something as simple as bathing washing your face shaving your face or your legs you would expect if the hayflake limit apply that you would be rapidly aging the skin and that there that renews and replenishes and the hay Fleck limit does not apply to those anyone telling you that retinoids damage the skin by increasing skin cell turnover and thinning it they don understand the biology of the epidermis so retinoid usage will not make your skin age faster and to reiterate Concepts from last week zero evidence with over 50 years of at least tretinoin use that retinoids cause any kind of damage to the fat or fat loss I think people fail to realize how many patients a day the average dermatologist sees and so if there was evidence that this happened we would be seeing it in real time in real patients the average dermatologist is seeing at minimum like 30 to 40 patients a day tretinoin is commonly prescribed not just for acne but for a wide array of different skin conditions and this has never been reported standard of care acne treatments that are evidence-based have been used for a long time we know how they work yes antibiotics pose a threat for superbug formation antibiotic resistance that and we use them alongside benzoyl peroxide but the way they position standard of care acne treatments in such a malignant fashion and then pose it next to theirs and just kind of directs the Shoppers attention to theirs almost as if it some safer alternative because it is as they put it it breakthrough in 40 years here other problem with this website they say the real problem is bacterial overgrowth that is a part of acne but it only part to also have hyperproliferation of the poor lining with comedone formation you have increased sebum production as it relates largely to hormonal signaling and genetics and then you also have inflammation in the skin B is a multifactorial disease so it related to cutie bacterium acnes but their phrasing here makes it seem as though it is why well because their product targets the bacteria in the skin it doesn play a key role in acne pathogenesis then they go on to say that traditional acne products kill both good and bad bacteria leaving your skin dry and damaged but that retinoids do not kill bacteria and they are a traditional acne treatment what exactly is phylus skin care all about well they use bacteriophages that Target the acne causing bacterium cutie bacterium acne what the heck is a bacteriophage well the bacteriophage is a virus that specifically hits bacteria and can possibly kill them how does this work well bacteriophages bind to receptors on the surface of bacteria and then they insert their genetic material into the bacteria and depending on the type of bacteriophage and its life cycle they can lead to something called a lytic infection in which basically a lot of new little bacteriophages are made within the bacteria itself and that causes the bacteria to lice to break open and die release more bacteriophages that could subsequently go on to Target other bacteria bacteriophages are actually specific to certain bacteria so it infect all bacteria on your Skin surface cutie back teeth bacteriophages were first identified in the 60s and they really interesting Concept in an area of active research in acne treatment they antibiotics that in theory should not put the person at risk for not only antibiotic resistance but potentially at risk for disruption in the skin microbiome so if the bacteriophage targets acute bacterium acnes is it possible that cutie bacterium acnes could develop resistance to the bacteriophages theoretically it is possible but much much lower than using antibiotics so a really cool concept and a really cool idea the other concern you might have though in terms of the skin microbiome is Believe It or Not acute bacterium acnes it microbiome so going overboard with killing it may not necessarily be the best approach to acne either in theory here the way that this system works is not the bacteriophage is going to basically in fact the acne causing bacteria destroy it and then in destroying it release more bacteriophages that are going to go on to in fact neighboring cutie bacterium acne is destroying those so you may get kind of in theory you could get total elimination of cutie bacterium acne if this really does work and is that necessarily a good thing yes it is part of acne pathogenesis but it of your skin microbiome so how is that subsequently going to negatively impact the health of your skin microbiome so what about phyla and their bacteriophage system so they did a clinical study they took 90 subjects aged 12 to 35 years of age both men and women and they have them use their system for eight weeks they either used their their product their serum or they used a placebo and by Placebo I mean a product that didn have the bacteriophage in it now after the eight weeks they showed that the group getting the bacteriophage containing product they showed an overall Improv Improvement in the investigator Global assessment as opposed to the placebo group they also claim that there was a reduction in cutie bacterium acnes in the group getting the phage containing serum up to 90 percent reduction in ketobacterium acne so they associate the reduction in cutie bacterium acne with the investigator Global assessment improvements that they saw compared to Placebo then they did a follow-up questionnaire and 87 percent said that they would recommend the product to someone else 80 percent said they were satisfied and 70 percent said they noticed an improvement in their skin importantly there were no adverse side effects noted in the eight weeks of this study another thing they claimed their study showed is that there was an increase in overall skin microbial diversity in the group getting the bacteriophage serum compared to Placebo this is their study but we to all the details as to how the study was conducted I have questions for which there are not answers because this is not something that is publicly available it it find this this is their study how did they determine the reduction in cutie bacterium acne do they just take a swab did they take skin biopsies we don have information on them like how did they determine the reduction in cutie bacterium Agnes because there are flaws with certain methodologic approaches we should know about what they did they determine microbial diversity there on the subjects themselves how long have they had acne what other treatments had they tried I noticed that they include women and a variety of Ages where any of these women previously on hormonal birth control pills which could affect sebum were on any of these women previously pregnant or contemplating pregnancy What proportion of the subjects who were enrolled in this study have been using either oral or topical antibiotics previously that they had was there a washout period because as you can imagine if they had the subjects come in and stop all things that they were using but they had previously been using an antibiotic well after stopping the antibiotic one might expect their microbial diversity to increase and they only look at eight weeks so what you have to continue using this serum and with ongoing use is there any risk of phase resistance meaning the acute bacterium acne is on your skin can it become resistant to this bacteriophage in their product that is definitely an important thing to to keep researching we need more long-term studies on this they claim a 90 reduction in ketobacterium acnes on the skin what has the impact of that for the overall microbiome long term the only look up to eight weeks the other thing that interesting and noteworthy is that they position their product up against some competitors in the industry like clean and clear and they say that there are no acne relapses with their with their serum but did they actually test for that like they look at eight weeks relapses can occur after stopping something so maybe the benefit of this product is sustained for six weeks but maybe you here have a huge problem with the marketing on their website and the claims they make about well-established evidence-based effective acne treatments including benzyl peroxide including antibiotics and including retinoids all of which are not without risks not without problems they all can have their own separate issues but framing them in a way that makes them sound harmful to the skin while simultaneously making your product sound safe and effective it bacteriophages are an area of ongoing exciting active research in terms of Therapeutics for acne there lot that needs to be done to figure out how effective this is what tweaks need to be made so I claims around their product I see more long-term research on bacteriophages for acne management in general let alone their product I to see their product in a clinical trial that peer-reviewed journal before I would go buying any of the claims that they make the other thing about the the bacteriophage too in theory like you have to imagine that when you lice open bacteria like that you can be releasing bacterial components that generate a pretty significant inflammatory response that in theory could really worsen acne in the beginning so I you know I would really like to see more clinical trials more clinical studies on this type of approach for acne before really I mean you just can to go I suspect some people possibly you know as the study showed did in fact show Improvement but could people possibly get much worse in the beginning at least uh yeah it definitely seems like a reasonable possibility more research is needed anyway y wrap up on phyla skin care and their claims about evidence-based acne treatments did not like that part of it let me know in the comments though if you have tried this product if you ever heard of it I hope this video was helpful and informative if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow bye [Music]

TIKTOK'S LATEST SKIN FLOODING TREND: why is this novel?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQu9nk6FOk	Dr Day	man the internet loves a skincare Trend slugging glazed donut skin glass skin milky skin skin cycling here we are headed into February of 2023 and the latest skincare Trend Crossing Tick Tock is skin flooding touted as an intervention for dry winter skin to help get you back on track we describe what this entails should you be doing it should you run out and buy a bunch of skin care products or answers but we today ever had dry skin it problem if you got news for you you at some point in your life you know the phrase two things are guaranteed in life death and taxes they need to add a third and that is dry skin at some point in your life I guarantee you about a dry skin somewhere on your body maybe a little patch if not a full-blown bout of like a dry face dry elbows dry knees dry feet dry hands it happens skin is a large organ it has a lot of work to do it known to lose water trans epidermal water loss there are so many different situations in life where this can pop up and what a great opportunity to come up with trends products sell you stuff that might be helpful or just might be unnecessary I my for you page over on Tick Tock skin flooding and I had to do a bit more of a deep dive into this what are people coming up with skin flooding is a winter skin care Trend that is aimed at improving dry skin relieving the symptoms of dry skin which can include sensitivity burning stinging flakiness an overall tight sensation not tolerating products or active ingredients it Winter though it can happen again at any point in your life what does skin flooding entail the principle behind skin flooding is to flood your skin with moisture it essentially entails first of course starting on a clean base washing your face then after you rinse the cleanser off to a damp face apply hydrating ingredients try the skin flooding technique with me for the first time first thing you have to start with a fresh clean face once you keep it wet don weird but that it absorb more product even for the product to penetrate into the skin better and I moisturizing cream definitely feels like slimy and silky in a good way I live in Chicago so it very very dry in the winter time so this is really supposed to help next I going in with the Kiehl Advanced repair Barrier cream this is brand new and it formula it sensitive skin and it relieves dryness up to 10 layers deep in your skin so far I that these Kiehl well with it I highly recommend checking out this new Barrier cream it feels amazing does this sound familiar to anyone are you going isn basic skincare routine entails anyone yes long story short but they take it a little bit further if your skin is dry and tight like mine try Tick Tock hack I spotted which I flooding your skin with moisture cleanse with something gentle and when your skin is still wet apply a hydrating serum when your skin is still a bit damp from that apply niacinamide serum and if you want you can follow with a moisturizer my skin is much better for it and I really think it breakouts too and that they different hydrating products on anywhere from one to two serums and a moisturizer and I folks are taking a hydrating Mist like the thermal Spring Water sprays and spritzing their face in between these layers the goal being to literally flood the top layers of the skin with moisture is this a good thing should you be doing this should you be aggressively attacking hydration to this extreme most of these skincare routines Focus again on hydrating ingredients hyaluronic acid niacinamine which can be helpful for the Skin Barrier and is moisturizing I seen some focusing around glycerin then the final step of course is to apply a thicker moisturizing cream to lock in all of this hydration why would you want to increase the water content of your skin that moisturizing believe it or not is to increase the water content of the stratum corneum the top layer of your skin the stratum corneum the very top layer of your skin it becomes dry and dehydrated in dry skin conditions the top layer of your skin is called the epidermis and it different layers and the topmost layer of the epidermis is the stratum cornea moisture content there is key to healthy barrier function keeping irritating stuff out and keeping moisture in so everything appropriately now a healthy stratum corneum should have anywhere from 15 to 25 percent water content just below the stratum corneum you have the stratum granulosum in healthy skin The Junction between the stratum corneum in the stratum granulosum should contain roughly 40 percent water water so important because the enzymes that control how things turn over and barrier function they rely on water when your Skin Barrier becomes disrupted from different environmental stressors medical conditions or just with age or underlying skin problems well the skin loses water the stratum corneum starts to lose water and that dry skin and symptoms of sensitivity and barrier impairment the end result of that is more irritating stuff gets in the skin becomes dry flaky you lose more water it have dry skin as I said at the beginning of the video there some point in your life you have some degree of dry skin even just chapped lips that my video on why you have dry skin we go into it in a deep dive there all the reasons why you might have dry skin age-related environmental stressors using too many products dry skin secondary to an underlying medical condition and for those of you in the back with oily skin I have news for you dry skin can does and will impact you too just having oily skin does not excuse you from having dryness and the symptoms of dryness and issues around your eye skin the causes symptoms and severity of dry skin are incredibly variable so as with everything you see on the internet it is not a one-size-fits-all approach just because it be right for you or the Practical approach to doing things the goal behind skin flooding is to improve water content in the skin by layering more lightweight products onto damp skin it enhances the penetration of ingredients that are aimed at improving water holding ability hygroscopics things like hyaluronic acid or Marine extracts polyhydroxy acids polyglutamic acid PCA urea and then the final step in skin flooding is layering on a heavier thicker moisturizing cream or gel it going to seal everything in now the occlusive properties of this final stab is important because it essentially suppresses water loss from the skin so all of that flooding that you just did you final moisturizing step moisturizers not only help to improve the water content but by doing so they act they actually improve Skin to restore skin Luminosity you can appreciate a more glowing radiant appearance to the skin simply by moisturizing this is something that I want to emphasize to you guys with all the hype about different skin care products and Skin Care ingredients the most basic gratifying thing that you can do in your skincare routine aside from of course protecting your skin from the Sun with sunscreen is to use a moisturizer one of the most underrated aspects of consistent use of a moisturizer is that it helps with exfoliating the skin there always online that you need to be exfoliating that you need to use an exfoliant sure many people benefit from using one but not everyone needs to newsflash the skin naturally exfoliates on its own but that gets slowed down delayed impaired when your skin is dry when the water content in the stratum corneum drops because of impairment and barrier function well the natural exfoliation processes that rely on that water they don why you get rough skin texture you get a buildup of flakiness dry skin that can be rough it makes your skin look dull lifeless and a lot of people might think oh I need to be exfoliating all of that off but you can get very nice benefit in that situation by just using moisturizer consistently improving water content improving barrier function everything gets back on track another underrated aspect to moisturizing is that it helps with barrier functions so ultimately that slows the penetration of things into the skin which is important for alleviating issues around sensitivity many people who have sensitive skin when their skin becomes dry and the barrier function is impaired stuff gets in it burns it stings it lot more uncomfortable you have flares of redness this can be particularly an issue for people who have rosacea and it can also be an issue for those of you who have acne it can lead to irritation and subsequent worsening of redness that irritation can drive more inflammation into the skin that leads to more breakouts and it leads to more post acne hyperpigmentation especially for those of you with deeper skin tones consistent use of a moisturizer will also not only smooth the Skin plumps up the skin cells they hydrated that helps slow penetration of things into the skin and it also helps to smooth out fine lines and wrinkles last week I did a video reacting to some misinformation online about tretinoin and if you go back to that video we talked about some clinical studies using tretinoin what those papers if you go back and look very carefully is using a moisturizer will improve the look of Fine Lines because in those papers they use a vehicle control what I mean by that is they are comparing the effects of tretinoin which is in a moisturizer to that same moisturizer with no treadmill and if you actually look at the at the research that they get the people who use the control the moisturizer alone with no tretinoin that control group still gets Improvement in the appearance of fine lines of course it when you add tretinoin but it illustrates how valuable using moisturizer alone is this is important for you as a consumer of skin care to always remember because oftentimes Brands will present data that they have collected on volunteers who have used their product and demonstrate an improvement in fine lines and they attribute it to certain ingredients in the product that they have but they almost never I mean I don ever have a a control they don moisture a boring moisturizer control and so keep that in mind you always have to kind of ask yourself could I get there could I get that same amount of improvement just by consistently using my boring moisturizer now with dry skin conditions and with age and with certain underlying skin problems there is an issue there with properly storing water in the skin some skin conditions like eczema they have not only a defect in barrier function meaning they prone to water loss but they also have issues around the hygroscopic aspects of the Skin Barrier that really are key for for holding in water with age we also lose some barrier function and our natural moisturizing factors is hygroscopic ingredients that naturally make up our Skin Barrier the levels of those also start to decline so we more vulnerable to water loss so as I telling you how beneficial water is to the scan I can see how the natural tendency would be oh well by layering hydrating ingredients on and by flooding the skin with moisture that is the best approach but can you go too far with this can you get too much water by flooding the skin you certainly can have too much of a good thing hyper hydration of the stratum corneum actually impairs barrier function it this it little water content in the stratum corneum leads to barrier impairment the enzymes and things don get slowing of the exfoliation processes buildup of dry skin irritants get in more readily however On The Other Extreme of that if you have too much saturation in the stratum corneum of water if you if you get to a certain point where it implies flooded that too can impair barrier function and I clinical example of when this happens trench foot you yes trench foot is a classic example of how over hydrating the stratum corneum can go awry this was seen in soldiers who had prolonged immersion of the feet in damp conditions they were wearing shoes that weren preventing water from entering they sat there in water in in their boots and the stratum corneum becomes hyper hydrated and when that happens especially the thick stratum corneum of the soles of the feet can lead to barrier impairment and in a really significant problem with the feet now does that happen to the everyday person who goes a little bit overboard with moisturizing no you not going to develop trench foot of the face so that extreme example that I seriously doubt most people could ever get to with just overdoing it with moisturizer but you certainly can over moisturize which brings me to my concern around this principle of skin flooding is that one potential risk you might encounter here is that by adding all these hydrating ingredients especially if you this method of misting the face in between each layer which I have seen some people do you can get too much of a good thing and that can actually end up enhancing penetration of things that might be irritating to you for example I see a lot of these routines using niacinamide you all know I of niacinamide but some people find it burns it stings it more likely to be the case when you are doing a routine such as this where you have so much hydration it enhance penetration if your dry skin condition is secondary to the irritating effects of a medication or a topical ingredient like tretinoin or benzoyl peroxide you might end up aggravating that symptom even further by all of this hydration further driving penetration of that ingredient into the skin you might end up getting even more irritation in the long run in the case of rosacea I would I would be a little bit more conservative here with not going overboard with layering too many products one thing is clear with rosacea is yes there is a Skin Barrier defect there but the symptoms of sensitivity can be made worse by applying things to the skin while it in dermatology it recommendation to tell patients who have say for example eczema to apply moisturizers after bathing while the skin is still a bit damp by doing this it really optimizes the performance events of the active ingredients who again their purpose is to suppress water loss from the skin and improve the moisture content but in some situations individuals find that when they do that it lot of burning and stinging this can be true for people who have eczema and they flare where the skin is raw red applying moisturizers can really sting especially when the skin is damp in those cases it may be more practical to tell the patient to pat dry the area first and then apply the moisturizer so as to minimize that discomfort same thing can happen to people who have rosacea I do think this routine certainly is going to be beneficial for many people who experience dry skin as it relates to Winter or any other condition that can cause dry skin however as with everything again it out for everyone having a couple of different hydrating serums that you layer on underneath your moisturizer it I show in a lot of my skincare routine videos I to do this with but it for everyone to do this approach the other thing I want to bring up is that I just kind of think it is a trend of skin flooding where the principle of layering hydrating ingredients onto damp skin it around for a long time this is a theme I alluded to this at the beginning of the video but like it seems like every couple of months there in skincare that reiteration of more or less the same thing and it that for a long time but you just come up with a buzzy name and a hashtag and now all of a sudden like people think it novel a lot of this actually comes from principles found in Korean and Japanese skin care this concept of layering different hydrating products like serums toners Essences and in order to improve moisture content that really comes more so from Korean and Japanese skin care practices you know you can give something a trendy name but in reality it long time so all that to say do you need to be trying this you can try it if you want to uh you know I risks and benefits in this video so it up to you if you want recommendations for hydrating serums and toners I have videos on that but do you need to drop your skincare routine and run out and buy these things uh no to what extent it that plain moisturizer on your face who who that before getting influenced to perhaps buy more products that you may not necessarily be motivated to continue using the problem with skin care trends like this too is it influences people to buy products that they may not necessarily need and it try out products I enjoy skin care I try a lot of products out but you have to remind yourself whenever you consider buying a new skin care product what is this going to look like in my day-to-day life three months from now do I realistically if this if this product doesn realistically see myself continuing to use it three months from now and if the answer is no then you have to ask yourself is this new product going to get me somewhere in the next couple of months with it where I need to be faster and then I with letting go of it then it might be worthwhile to to introduce but just you know be mindful times have gotten really expensive skincare products have gotten really expensive so just be aware whenever there proceed with caution I hope this video was helpful to you guys in explaining this new trend of skin flooding let me know in the comments if you have heard about this new trend speaking of Trends on tick tock on the end slate I to link my recent video talking about the well the trend probably is out of date already by now but a buckle fat pad removal so definitely check that video out next if you are so inclined if you like this one give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen And subscribe I to you guys tomorrow bye foreign [Music]	Success
Tretinoin SKIN THINNING & FAT LOSS | *Response Video* ??	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doeAK_Gn7EA	Dr Day	well hey guys a handful of you sent me a link to this YouTube video posted on the honest channel on January 1st 2023 titled does tretinoin weaken your skin affect facial fat we explore the science and best way to use it now this is an interview and in today to be reacting primarily to statements made by Ivan gallanin he of Adipose skin care Yvonne you produced a paper in which you cite a number of clinical studies which you argue suggests that tretinoin not only doesn improve the structure of our skin but may even damage it so why and what evidence yeah so the evidence is actually really quite clear but before I go to that I want to read what label the FDA label on Retin-A Tretinoin cream does not eliminate wrinkles repair Sun damaged skin reverse photo aging or restore more youthful or younger skin so this is the fda clinical results that were submitted to the FDA so that just puts things in perspective I thought it was interesting that he chose to start making his points by just reading the package insert from Renova brand name tretinoin and if you just hear that and take it at face value it sounds like basically update the FDA is saying hey this doesn you actually read the package insert prior to that statement it reads as follows Renova tretino and cream 0.02 percent is indicated as an adjunctive agent see second bullet point below for use in the mitigation parentheses palliation of fine facial wrinkles and patients who use comprehensive skin care and sunlight avoidance programs to be clear tread Noah it completely undo sun damage but it meant to Aid in improving the appearance of wrinkles Fine Lines palliation means it to alleviate the signs of sun damage the second bullet point just uh to follow up says Renova tretino and cream 0.02 percent should be used under medical supervision as an adjunct to a comprehensive skin care and sunlight avoidance program that includes the use of effective sunscreen minimum SPF 15 and protective clothing so basically they damage and you still need to protect your skin from the sun while using this and it supervision now retina does definitely work um well work how if you that it doesn things well it has a small but significant effect on fine lines so that was proven Way Beyond any reasonable doubt how does Retin-A tretinoin work it works by binding to retinoic acid receptors in the skin by binding to these receptors it is able to impact the types of genes that are expressed and subsequently the proteins that are made and the behavior of those cells well it has a small but significant effect on fine lines so that was proven Way Beyond any reasonable doubt so on a 10 point scale on top of sun protection moisturizing Retin-A improved the appearance of fine wrinkles by half a point I don this half a point from uh he doesn provide any reference here so I don know where he scale and in 1995 the FDA approved tretinoin for palliation again not cure palliation of Fine Lines model hyperpigmentation and rough texture associated with photo damage there cost I mean there from being the most studied anti-aging drug but there cost is that all of your dirty laundry is there to be to be to be viewed and seen in black and white and really there are two papers uh from the from the investigators who actually helped get Renee approved one looked at histology at one year and another paper looked at the histology at one year and then four years and I papers and it quite plainly that the amongst other things the upper dermis is thinned out by long-term retina use by uh anywhere from 15 to 60 percent that they show papillary dermal thickness increased slightly between 12 months and four years the best I can tell as he referring to the decrease in dermal elastosis elastosis is a degenerative change that occurs in the dermis and basically you get increased deposition of elastic material real and that is seen in extreme sun damage and clinically the manifestation of that is coarse deep wrinkling yellowing of the skin and what this paper showed is that at four years there was a 34 decrease in that degenerative change in the dermis so that increase in papillary dermal thickness the other thing that you need to know about the study is there meaning everyone is on tretinoin there no vehicle control and they different percentage strengths so you getting a lot of variability and you don the Baseline degenerative change over time in the skin is going to be to give you an idea of that the participants in the study I using tretinoin at varying frequencies some as little as just once a week and there evidence that contradicts this see there is evidence that contradicts it the entire body of research regarding topical tread known in people contradicts what he he dermis and it absolutely does not you can see evidence histologically of increased collagen production and deposition in the skin importantly tretinoin also has been shown by uh Woodley at all in 1990 to increase the number of collagenous anchoring fibrils at the junction between the epidermis and the dermis and this has a strengthening effect for the skin usually in in science you know it you know it white you that says one thing and then some evidence that says another thing and then your job as a as a leader of Sciences to balance one with the other in this particular case uh all the evidence points to the fact that Retin-A does some significant um alteration uh to the upper at least the upper dermis of the skin so that not correct at all he cherry-picked a data point misrepresented that data point and now is making it seem as though there body of research out there that we just ignoring in dermatology it doesn exist you say all the evidence points to that but Dr Chen I mean it does seem to fly in the face of what has become the accepted you even if you just Google tretinoin and skin thinning you will find dermatologists after dermatologists lining up to say that that and actually thickens our epidermis I mean looking at Yvonne your view on what he whether it could thin or weaken our Skin interesting actually and um with these kind of scientific evidence obviously the studies are done to study a particular thing under a particular condition and um I imagine they random control trials ideally they should be Phantom control trials and and really my question is in the subjects that they studied how much tretinoin were they using what concentration what frequency um because in clinical practice in actual everyday practice the amount of tretinoin the concentration that I recommend the clients to use and frequency really depends on their reactions and and um how they how the skin is higher percentages of treadone tend to be more irritating in the beginning in comparison to lower percentages I mean treasurement definitely can thin the skin and because it does that by speeding up cell renewal and that not correct Trent no one does not thin the skin it cells to shed off so in someone who uses tretinoin perhaps too much um their skin definitely will thin out and they will get the undesirable effects the undesirable effects from tretinoa are not due to skin thinning she effects that happen with tretinoin in the beginning that thinning of the skin though it related to uh transient changes in the permeability barrier and with time that can improve it can also be addressed by concurrent use of moisturizers or by backing down on the frequency of use to a few times a week but it to the skin it drying it can leave you uh red and makes the skin peel in the beginning because all of those cells are kind of you know stuck there at the top they kicked off like she says but it thinning the skin so it really is but as with many drugs medications even oxygen if you have too much oxygen it finding the right level right concentration the right frequency to use for a particular individual that to give them the benefit without the side effects I think that probably one of those things that it kind of um has a potential to be damaging but with a small concentration um and use if used properly it can definitely give people some benefits proper use is key I 100 agree with that these studies come from the actually from an extension of the clinical trial program used to approve Retin-A so this was um the 0.5 and 0.1 concentration uh daily the clinical trial looked at 0.05 0.01 0.001 or vehicle alone just just the cream of of tretinoin to go back and look at the other paper but this was you know this was the clinically approved concentration in a you know super scrupulous you know clinical study this was not a you know Beauty uh study this was really from the groups that followed the subjects and got the you know from the same data set that got the um got the drug approved um so it yeah and it really interesting is you see uh you know you see clearly a dose response so the the lower concentration has less in effect than the than the higher concentration less of what kind of effect a thinning effect or less of a less of a thinning effect than the than the higher concentration you mentioned no that that misrepresentation the histologic changes that they showed with tretinoin were an increase in epidermal thickness an increase in the number of the granular cell layers part of the epidermis a decrease in melanin content and a altered stratum corneum pattern with tretinoin use you go from a basket weave to a more compact stratum corneum nothing in this paper shows skin thinning question about these um the clinical trials is that also I wonder in the trials where they testimony at that concentration to treat the medical condition or was it were they using it to treat wrinkles no this was all wrinkles this was from the wrinkle studies you know it was all photo damaged facial skin so it know it you know other medical conditions they wrinkles and at the end of the trial did they see visible improvements in their skin they did yeah absolutely yeah so and and this was also dose dependent so there were you know as I said you know there does work it does improve the appearance of of Fine Lines that incontrovertible and so it my point is not to scare people off uh a retina um I I I um completely and wholehearted agreement with Dr Chen who says it you use the product and what is your you know what is your goal you know do you have acne and you it um um to treat your acne and then the acne resolves and then you you take a break do you have a melasma condition that you condition um all those uses I think are actually make a lot of sense but if you years old to be clear if you have acne or melasma I highly suggest sticking with your dermatologists in terms of treatment with tretinoin because um yeah your acne may clear up or your melasma May improve but in many cases it treatment in fact that is a reason and why a lot of people have a recurrence of their acne flares or a flare of their melasma is that they stop treatments prematurely because what clears up on the skin surface everything looks good so the patient stops using their treatment but there that can be had and by stopping it prematurely you can get worsening of your skin disease so don consulting with the prescriber to say hey am I at a point right now where I could consider stopping this and ask yourself why do you want to consider stopping it is it because it is it because it with is it because you just would rather you know not have to have to be doing this every night or every other night all those are more than reasonable but to to want to stop because you watch this video and have been made to feel like tretinoin is going to have some damaging effect to your skin I want to make it clear there that happens and you standard and that you should like use preventative redneck well you know for the next 40 years then I know it voice of reason and some critical mind in which you go into any treatment and nothing as Dr Shan said nothing is without um you know there to every benefit and so that that to we need to keep this in mind but you know there are so many I think unexplored factors or or uh um thoughts about vitamin A for example if you ask a dermatologist well why why should someone uh use uh redneck they will no doubt tell you well it builds collagen well no I I would say we have no evidence of that we absolutely have evidence that Retin-A builds collagen Griffiths at all clearly showed that topical tretinoin stimulates Pro collagen 1 synthesis in human skin and actual people and that it also was associated with an increase in collagen in with with ongoing treatment and there at the beginning of the video tretinoin binds to retinoic acid receptors and cells and that affects Gene transcription and influences collagen production I mean that that is basically how it works there by which retina would build collagen directly it does it directly as I just mentioned and it also helps indirectly because uh tretinoin inhibits the expression of Matrix metalloproteinase enzymes that are otherwise up regulated upon exposure to UV rays and those Matrix metallic proteinase enzymes are responsible for collagen degradation and subsequent wrinkle formation so the mechanism for collagen hell Health if you will with topical TriNoma is twofold and increasing levels of pro collagen 1 and subsequent collagen production so actually increasing production as well as inhibiting destruction so in fact if you take the cells that make collagen the fibroblasts and you expose them to Retin-A they will completely shut down they won I some in vitro study maybe I you know there so I have no idea what he about but what happens to cells in a dish ends up oftentimes in most cases being very different from what ends up happening in actual human skin in real world conditions so to take an in vitro study meaning cells in a dish and try and assume that onto humans is wrong especially in the background of data that we have in actual humans saying the opposite and so there may be some indirect Way by which uh by treating uh the epidermis that the that your skin derives an otherwise benefit but that taste has not been made clearly but it has I mean it really has uh going back to the 90s that you know despite all the evidence I think we have to look at the good and the bad and make decisions for ourselves um does it does this make sense for me and not go into it on critically while I agree that tretinoin is not something that everybody should go out and get immediately and everybody be on and you know you should start doing it as soon as possible I mean it individual uh decision but in the background of this video and the statements that they it seem as though you and benefits which you always are with any medication risks and benefits but in this video they though they that you have to weigh which don but when you do start using it I mean for me it was sort of Head and Shoulders above anything else I tried for skin resurfacing skin smoothing but not only that um you know you can see that it clears your fine lines yeah the skin smoothing is is related to that compaction of the stratum corneum smoothing out the skin surface and the Improvement in Fine Lines likely comes from Improvement in collagen that can take some time but the other benefit of Tourette knowing is that it increases the expression of glycosaminoglycans in the epidermis hyaluronic acid so the epidermis has better water binding ability and for that reason it hydrated and fine lines get smoothed out it doesn improves the fine lines not the Deep lines unfortunately but also as we age in our skin weakens that start to get into the things like enlarged pores which I started noticing in the last year you know your Skin not strong enough to hold the you start getting these enlarged pores it deals with that within a few months that strengthening of the skin to the user I can histologically there to the skin clinically there strengthening to the skin bodies of research to support those so that there say that topical tretinoin weakens the skin in any way or that it have a skin thinning effect say that it gave me any volume but um I think that for tretinoin isn these millions of users around the world some have been using it for decades and they swear by it yeah and I would completely I would say that experience is is uh is completely validated I don you know you can invalidate that experience that is absolutely true and it it clinical trials the question is if you do if we do believe right which the data suggests that long-term use uh will undermine at least um a component of the skin long-term data doesn though the fact that he keeps stating that over and over again is incredibly misleading in the skin are is Retin-A smarter right can we you know use it for a period of time get that get that effect on the pores and then go off of it and see how long it takes for the for the force to become enlarged again I think I think it been explored and I think that you know when we look at all the data together we consequences without negative consequences and let best way to use it Dr Chen that chines with something you actually you recommend that you use pretend for a certain period of time and then you move on to a another retinoid less potent a retinol or a retinol of a higher strength I mean what and actually um Yvonne I agree with that I do think we need to use trust knowing smart more smartly smarter in a Smart Way um Fresno it is very irritating and stimulating for the skin and even with a lot of the skin treatments I do the point of doing those things is to simulate the skin to make it to um get the skin to do something different become more active but the thing is there the skin and not giving the skin chance to heal and recover because actually a lot of the benefit the antigen benefit that you see comes from the recovery phase so I personally feel like it a good idea to use these really stimulating treatments in short bursts so you have a cause of treatment and then you go into maintenance and what I tend to recommend people um to do is if they choose to go on the trestinoin for the initial treatment pyramid which I would recommend about three months or so then go on to Retinol for the maintenance which is a milder form of a precursor vitamin A it it safer to use longer term and retinol and right now the high they are generally less irritating than Tourette knowing but I will remind you that there are newer forms of tretino and newer uh brands of tretinoin in which the vehicle has been tweaked so that overall it lot less irritating to users giving your skin a break from a retinoid you know I mean it there that that is necessary or particularly helpful if anything you know you would be concerned that if you took a break for too long and you start back up well then you irritation process all over again so people don give the skin the chance to heal and recover um without constantly stimulating it to to thin down um and that way I find people get the best results and they don get the dryness appealing of the skin you know the downtime from tretinoin is really quite difficult to to take to handle for a lot of people as a user I would say I wouldn feel that my skin is just on the edge so if I change moisturizer or it colder all of a sudden I got that dry skin again um so it you both I am tempted to come off it for a while use I that I very effective you know give it a go for a couple of months and see it you know but if these pores come back either I blaming you I blame I think quite often with these things you know that it and white it every single individual is different skin quality is different and the needs and goals are different and I when I explain to my clients about using these sort of treatments I often compare compare it to going to the gym to you know to do strength training for example you can expect it to to keep on getting stronger you have to give your body to rest you would train hard for a while give your body to rest and then you train hard again and um and that results and obviously you have to give your body the nutrition as well the analogy of taking a rest day like you would with exercise for your skin and from tretinoin sounds sounds compelling but in reality there that rest day I physiologist but my understanding is that taking a rest day can be beneficial for muscle building for recovery and that sort of thing there evidence there that to support that but with using topical retinoid there I especially if somebody is developing a lot of irritation or maybe they um like like was mentioned earlier the winter it the Skin you may want to to take a break from it or if you pregnant you know your doctor May advise you to come off of it but to just stop it on these theoretical ideas that you know it doesn sense especially if you like I said has been given a prescription for tretinoin to treat a skin disease coming off of it prematurely in an effort to let the skin breathe or recover your disease can flare that reason why people fail acne medications for example or any dermatologic treatment is they stop too early any evidence I mean your own kind of specialist area now is in volume restoration through fat renewal are you concerned that uh tretinoin can interfere with fat renewal or or no yeah you know I that question because we know we get we get that a lot and so so so again the the data is mostly pointed in One Direction that in both in Vivo in animal setting and in vitro in a in a um in a Cell setting if you expose uh preadipocytes to Retin-A it will prevent them becoming mature deficits now it there may be a question of dose that if you go to a dose low enough that that doesn the controversial bit so I would say that most of the data suggests that Retin-A suppresses new fat cell formation there that using topical treadmillion has any negative consequences on fat subcutaneous fat fat pockets none whatsoever in fact clinical experience and clinical trials don effect on fat cells because adipocytes pre-adipocytes are key for wound healing and treadmillan has actually been shown to improve wound healing specifically wounds on the lower leg so if it had an inhibitory effect or was problematic for this population of cells well you would expect it to have a negative impact on wound healing where in reality it does not predipocytes are also very important for the hair follicle for hair growth interestingly Trent no one has been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of androgenetic alopecia alongside topical minoxidil it by perhaps allowing for better uptake of the minoxidil which is the sold by the brand name Rogaine so if Trent Newman had this negative effect on that population of cells you would expect that it would not be beneficial in hair loss I mean this is all very theoretical a very theoretical discussion based on pre-clinical lab studies that he talking about here and like I said earlier pre-clinical models cells in a dish animal models they are what get things rolling in terms of further research but they are not meant to be extended onto humans especially when this drug has been in use for going on over 50 years now there of any harm to fat um and you might look at somebody who been on tretinoin for 30 years and say well they eye Hollows guess what fat shrinks with age that tretinoin tretinoin is not going to change that the the way you retina is you retinols is supposed to you to get them into the epidermis into the stratoconium and so if you rub them in right then you prevent them from going down the hair follicle to accessing the adipocytes that rub tretinoin in uh it will be guided down your pore and be absorbed into the poor I mean there you rub tretinoin in it definitely does make its way into the poor same thing with other retinoids and adaptolene for example so that definitely gets in there and patting it in versus rubbing it in that um definitely we the poor and also one other thing that I recommend is to not use a retinol or Retin-A in conjunction with hyaluronic acid because as we discussed before that will create channels through the shadow corneum that the Retin-A can then use to get deeper than it hyaluronic acid in formulations May enhance penetration of ingredients that reduce the side effects of dryness and irritation and there pairing hyaluronic acid with tretinoin is harmful and let alone damaging to pre-adipocytes in actual people and in fact altrano lotion which is a newer form of tretino and it lotion is a lot less drying and irritating and it hyaluronic acid so it you know it say that you can with hyaluronic acid it more irritating I will say that it possible but that can be possible too with any other hydrating ingredient it may enhance penetration you may get a little bit more irritation especially in the beginning it act on the upper layer of the skin and to stimulate the the production of new keratinocytes so you don to want it to go deeper so if you you he retinoids work they work at the level of the retinoid receptor and the nucleus it of the stratum corneum and work there the top the top layers of the epidermis the cells that are already differentiated they don very top they don so there um changing there of the of the behavior of the cells so that that doesn sense if anything you do want to to penetrate as a deeply as possible while minimizing irritation Retin-A regimen uh you shouldn use a hyaluronic acid good to know well I actually think we got somewhere here haven actually come to an agreement on so to summarize I just want to make it clear tretinoin applied to the skin is more than safe it 50 years in dermatology to treat a wide array of skin conditions it approved by the FDA since the 90s for the treatment of Fine Lines model hyperpigmentation and rough skin texture associated with photo damage and it does in fact work to improve collagen synthesis smoothing out wrinkles and Fine Lines there does not thin the skin it does not thin the dermis for example betamethasone dipropionate a topical steroid can thin the epidermis for sure when used with tretinoin that thinning is mitigated tretinoin can treat dermal atrophies like like stretch marks and it does not likely by improving collagen synthesis so there studies that that tretinoin thins the scan and is damaging to the skin if you want to take a break from tretinoin for anti-aging purposes that it can be drying and irritating and it can be you know a pain to keep up with cost prohibitive perhaps a burden to get in to see your dermatologist for renewal of your prescription those sorts of things there are over-the-counter Alternatives like retinol that likewise are safe but they they and last but not least there is no evidence that tretinoin causes fat loss or is harmful to the pre-adipocyte population to even bring that up I think just evokes fear in people so I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you are new to starting tretinoin or maybe you tried it in the past and you found it was very drying and irritating on the end slate I video I did sharing a technique called short contact therapy to minimize irritation so check that one out next if you are so inclined but if you guys like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen And subscribe I to you guys tomorrow bye [Music]	Success
*LIVER KING EXPOSED* Influencers and Brands WILL LIE TO YOU	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqQC_xOgERI	Dr Day	Brian Johnson aka the liver King has been exposed for lying to his millions of followers across Tik Tok YouTube and Instagram regarding how he gets his Jack physique he it his diet of raw meat raw testicles and living the ancestral tenants which are a bit vague but focused on things like sleep AR finally come out and admitted to what surprise surprise most of us already knew he performance-enhancing drugs and by a boatload I mean $122,000 a month worth he admitted this only after Derek of the channel more plates more dates released an hourlong video exposing blood test results and a full steroid cycle breakdown that getting into in this video and it is shocking to say the least based on some leaked emails that he had received uh from we the heck am I talking about the liver King like this is a skinc care Channel why am I not just talking about how to layer aoic acid with troan like I supposed to well I see a lot of parallels between this guy stick how he grifted and scammed his audience with a lot of things in skin care and Beauty the thing about the liver King is that he has a supplement company and his supplement company before even getting on social media he was already making like $100 million a year off of selling supplements which surprise surprise are consist of dried up organ Meats $3 to $65 a bottle for capsules of beef liver has a supplement company and then gets on social media claiming that you need to be living this ancestral diet to look like him all while hiding the fact that he performance-enhancing drugs to get the physique that he has uh not to mention the adverse health effects taking those drugs can have on somebody and influencing a really young audience only to sell these supplements praying on vulnerable people chasing Aesthetics some of the same manipulative tactics that they use in the fitness space on social media likewise are utilized in across skin care and Beauty content when it comes to skin care you have to be very careful over on Instagram and Tik Tok a lot of times one thing I see people selling products all while using a filter claiming that they get the skin that they have because of a product all the while selling it with a filter on and sometimes they even hide the fact that they kind of tell if you pay close attention you may see something kind of twitching in the background a line Jumping All Around it video even an eyelash serum and it clear that they have a filter on that makes their eyelashes look longer it incredibly misleading if you see an influencer doing that talking about a skincare product a makeup product all while wearing a filter if you are influencing people to buy a product and you you product by using a filter that unethical and then of course we have a ton of cosmetic procedures available to us and people may not be as forthcoming about the Cosmetic procedures they have received that are impacting how their skin looks the tightness and all of that sort of thing there are a lot of creators here on YouTube who make content around whether or not a celebrity has had certain perent procedures and it may not seem fair like why should we speculate on whether this celebrity has had cosmetic procedures and to a certain extent I agree until they start trying to sell you skincare products claiming that their olive oil cream got them their glowing skin what else are you not telling us some people will believe this and they it know everyone have different skin needs and just following somebody it always remember that there are a ton of things that go into having healthy radiant skin besides just the products that you use the products are like a very very small to non-existent part of it all it your diet your sleep how you manage your stress and your genetics genetics play a huge role in your skin Health how you look and your physique one thing female celebrities who are postmental pule may not be revealing to you that plays a huge role and I pointed this out in my video on JLo is that they could be taking HRT hormone replacement therapy hormone replacement therapy can definitely have an impact on postmenopausal skin as you guys know from my videos with menopause estrogen levels Decline and estrogen turns out plays a key role in building strong collagen in women and that the reason why collagen levels in the skin in women start to decline around the time of menopause and thereafter and you are more likely to have wrinkles and saggy skin and and finally lines and the visible signs of skin aging become more obvious hormone replacement therapy can Rectify that to a certain extent and if someone who is postmenopausal is claiming that a particular serum gave them this new bouncy radiant skin or one of those devices devices that are meant to tighten and tone like the new face for example if they transparent with you and letting you know that they also are on HRT I saying that everybody who talks about these devices is hiding the fact that they um but it keep in your mind maybe they told you they keep that in mind though that it certainly can be responsible for some of the changes that they might also see this in people who are talking about dietary supplements for skin hair and nails I have a lot of videos on this channel about different supplements that people t for wrinkles namely collagen supplements hyaluronic acid pills and I research pretty limited actually and has many limit itations to support telling everybody that they should be taking these supplements there long-term research to really know the safety let alone the efficacy and who if anyone this particular type of supplement might be right for so when influencers get on and talk about how a certain supplement has just completely changed their skin well you have to start thinking about other things that could explain the results that they seeing if you see a true change in their skin you need to ask yourself what other things might be going on in their life that I this change Beyond this collagen gummy there effect we something is working because we actively pursuing it and we want it to work there well not only in skin care but you see a lot of this in the hair loss space as well a lot of types of hair loss they will spontaneously Pro improve when the underlying cause is addressed for example teen aium hair shedding related to um a variety of things that put stress on the body once that stress is removed well the hair shedding will slowly resolve uh it right now especially for people to be shedding a lot of hair if they had covid I have a lot of videos on that by the way if you want to learn more about it but guess what it thing it takes a long time to resolve it through but don second that somebody routine is what changed the game for them it disease and they fact that it to how these disease processes unfold there alopecia Arata it loss the immune system decides one day to attack your hair follicles boom all of a sudden you get a bald patch not only can it affect the scalp but the beard as well and in many cases majority of cases actually it will spontaneously resolve on its own with no treatment so bear that in mind as well when someone gets on claiming that a particular hair supplement or oil or lotion or potion regrew their hair you need to ask yourself what type of hair loss did they actually have was it a scarring hair loss you can follicle simply can biologically impossible to do that um second of all did they have a type of hair loss that is known to resolve on its own but they fact that the majority of people do not have a working knowledge of all the types of hair loss diagnoses and they disease course I mean that a dermatologist not your average person out there who which is incredibly distressing there are also a lot of medications that can impact how the skin and the hair and the nails look maybe somebody was taking something that led to um hair loss or that dried out their skin but they stopped taking it and that problem went away and now they particular product now to be clear nobody owes you a detailed medical history of all of the things that they are taking however when they are selling you something you need to be aware of the fact that it are taking something a medication or that they have a diagnosis and that might be what is explaining the results that they have to reveal this well I definitely think in the case of a liver King if you your audience you know you have this jacked physique based on your diet if you claiming that you got the Physique in way in which we all know are not true then yeah I do think you have a responsibility to be honest with your audience in that regard but I mean a lot of things that can impact the skin and the hair people may not realize it so they may be ignorant to the fact and it to give you their entire medical history they are entitled to some privacy from health information so it a fine line between them having to give you every single detail a full-on medical workout to prove that the face cream moisturized their skin but it to keep in mind are there things that I am not privy to that could be influencing this person of things in the skin spontaneously resolve on their own melasma can actually be triggered as you you probably are aware it can be triggered by pregnancy and it can be triggered by certain medications but in those cases either once the mother delivers the child or uh once the medications are stopped the melasma has a decent chance of resolving on its own without any intervention it truths of influencers and celebrities that can get you I think Brands really can push the limits in terms of claims that they make that lead to unrealistic expectations in terms of what a product can actually deliver for example our jirin claims to be Botox in a bottle it may look like botox it may be shaped like botox in addition it might act like botox but can it actually get down to the level of the neuromuscular Junction and truly act like botox highly unlikely and the studies don actually does but Brands continue to Market Argin as Botox in a bottle or you continue to hear that claim being made it think that if you can you just buy the serum and use it instead which is a lot less expensive that you it product out there that I think can really give some misleading expectations are a lot of the beauty devices um some of them are actually good and some of them actually can give you results certain red light devices for example can definitely give you results whether it be for improving collagen having an anti- wrinkle effect or whether it be for pattern hair loss androgenetic alopecia uh low-level laser therapy certainly there is evidence that those at home devices can definitely yield benefit but there are a lot of other devices out there you go on Pub Med you they treatments in dermatology like newface for example I have a video all about the newface device check that out but that kind of a similar product where it like people really believe that this energy based device is truly changing the biology of their skin and to what extent it is we don it comes to these types of griffs online whether it be from a brand or from an influencer or celebrity I find they often use very nebulous language to Capital I I on the fact that the majority of the lay public is ignorant on the topic that they and they are ignorant on the topic they hormones or I healed my gut health well what disease did you actually have did you have a stomach ulcer did you have like did you have thyroid disease like what do you mean Hormone Health very nebulous I mean Endocrinology is a pretty big specialty that covers a lot of different conditions there are a lot of hor hormones in the body what exactly are you talking about they also like to lean into the anti-m medicine angle that doctors don are just trained to prescribe drugs not to address the root cause which is absolutely not true nothing infuriates me more than somebody who has zero credentials getting online pedaling something claiming they know what goes into to medical education do you teach at a medical school did you go to medical school if not sit down shut shut your mouth it drives me up the wall when people make these claims that doctors are just trained to prescribe drugs because I have strong memories of my rotations in medical school and as a resident being grilled in front of large you know a lot of people about why I was choosing to prescribe or recommend a medication you know and you know being pushed to think about all other possibilities before prescribing a medication there people coming online selling something I have no problem with that but when you spread misinformation about doctors or spread misinformation about health that can put people in danger and when you pray on people who already have a baseline mistrust for the medical community and you further widen that divide the best part of all this is this guy me up I mean bear in mind before he gets on social media and has any kind of audience he company allegedly worth making $100 million a year selling dry beef liver because before social media I was rich and Anonymous and after social media I still rich but no longer Anonymous and I never expected this kind of exposure sit down what are you even talking about you mean to tell me you didn got on Tik talkk and ate a bunch of raw testicles people would not comment in my opinion this guy knew exactly what he was doing he saw social media as a nice Avenue to widely Market his supplement Company by creating this Persona the liver King in this lifestyle and marketing to vulnerable young people especially over on Tik Tok praying on their insecurities about their physical appearance same as can happen in skincare and Beauty to sell a lie all the while taking an insane amount of performance-enhancing drugs all right y to say about the liver King I felt compelled to speak about this because there are a lot of grifters online who really scam Their audience I mean I think most people realize that this guy did not have this physique solely based off of eating animal liver and moving a cement block around but young impressionable people you know they might not realize that they susceptible to getting scammed and uh this is not unique to the liver King he example of this let me know in the comments if you even know who the liver King is if you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow [Music] bye

SHOULD YOU FOLLOW THE TIKTOK SKIN CYCLING TREND? ?? @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHvKg3T4fYk	Dr Day	well hey guys in today to be talking all about my thoughts on The Tick Tock viral trend of skin cycling but before getting into it make sure you skincare content from a board certified dermatologist and hit that little bell Icon by turning on your bell notifications YouTube will let you know as soon as my videos go live if you not on Tick Tock you may not be aware of this but there is a trend going around of something called Skin cycling it was actually started by a dermatologist over on Tick Tock Whitney Beau and basically what it is is a way to alternate or cycle your skin care products on different nights of the week so as to minimize irritation on the first night you use a retinol on the second night you third and fourth nights are referred to as rest and recover they focus around moisturizing using hydrating ingredients and the goal here is to use these ingredients in such a way to minimize irritation and dryness and on a platform unlike Tick Tock where there is so much misinformation heavy heavy you need I obsessed run by this right now it easy for people who are consuming skincare Tick Tock to get overwhelmed buy too much stuff use too much stuff and end up with a lot of irritation and dryness and if you on ingredients not to use together you know that the combination of retinol and exfoliating acids applied at the same time can lead to a lot of irritation for people that worsens dryness it can cause a kind of irritation that for people with deeper skin tones can put them at risk for hyperpigmentation that becomes very stubborn to fade it also can aggravate people common complaint people deal with when they start say a retinol is that they getting so much irritation that their acne is actually getting worse a lot of people think that they in reality it too irritated if you have a history of eczema or you have Asia this really can put you in the House of Pain too all of this irritation can leave you in the House of Pain you know the Skin Care Market it is so saturated with a variety of different products retinols hydroxy acids all sorts of active ingredients it really is a tricky territory for consumers to navigate and honestly I don adequate job on their instructions counseling people how to use their products and what things not to use them alongside with so all that to say you know this is a really popular Trend over there right now and I get a lot of questions what do you think of skin cycling is it good is it bad should I be doing it here landscape of tick tock skin cycling is a way to simplify and reduce all the noise and help consumers introduce these ingredients into their routines so as to minimize irritation it straightforward approach if you watched any of my videos on how to start a retinol or how do you exfoliate the skin I always encourage people to go very slowly with introducing these ingredients because they can lead to a lot of irritation it hear recommended either online or from your dermatologist to introduce a retinol very slowly start using it one night a week and then gradually increase to every other night and then nightly as tolerated this approach is kind of have some version of that however this approach also layers in using an exfoliant while I think this approach is very safe I don approach of skin cycling is the best thing for everyone most of these products you can get a lot of benefit from using them on a daily basis Retinol for example is intended to be used daily as tolerated by sticking to this routine long term and only ever using your retinol every fourth night I think you are potentially missing out on some of the maximum benefits of using retinol now that this infrequently has no benefit but for certain things you better results using that more frequently it depends on what it is that you hyperpigmentation that you may be trying to improve upon using it more frequently is probably going to be a better bet for a lot of people there truth remember everyone different your individual skin needs are all going to be different so there going to be a one-size-fits-all approach in the long run there are a lot of benefits that can be had from using a retinol not only can It help impart some acne control and in the case of the over-the-counter retinoid adapling it is an FDA approved acne treatment intended for daily use it gentle so for things like acne hyperpigmentation I do think going at the snails pace it very very long time and is just unnecessarily dragging things out now a lot of people will say well I can only tolerate using my retinol one night a week if you can only tolerate using a retinol one night a week and you using it for greater than a month month it you and either switch to another product or in the case of the prescription stuff definitely give your Derm a call or follow up with them because in the case of say tretinoin for example it may be that you could be better served by a lower percentage strength or you would be better served by another brand of the active retinoid whether it be tretinoin or the other prescription retinoids to serotine for example you know different pharmaceutical companies they have done tweaks here and there to their retinoid formulations to make them easier to tolerate so when we tretinoin as a prescription treatment I think most dermatologists would rather you be with a retinoid that you can use on a daily basis without irritation than one that you because for treatment purposes that just going too slowly retinol takes some time to start working so if you at the snails pace indefinitely then it you to derive those maximum benefits and when we condition like acne that heals with hyperpigmentation and or scarring that just going to be too long so it going to be right for everybody let talk about the exfoliating piece of things here with skin cycling again night one is retinol and night two isn some sort of exfoliant you guys have heard me say this ad nauseam but if you use an exfoliant I think marketing around exfoliating products has led consumers to believe that an exfoliant is something we all have to be using and that we all need but in reality your skin exfoliates naturally on its own you don for a lot of people not only is it unnecessary but it can be irritating to them now I have videos on how to exfoliate what types of exfoliants to use depending on your skin types skin concerns but again not everybody needs to people who benefit from an exfoliant or people who are looking to improve the look of hyperpigmentation alpha hydroxy acids certainly can help improve the look of Sundance image and may improve the look of wrinkles and fine lines with long-term consistent use and they may actually augment the effects of retinol salicylic acid is an exfoliant that benefits acne but if you have skin and you don that you really have to ask yourself what is the point of me exfoliating right if you already using a retinol or a prescription retinoid it smooth out the surface of the skin and it does that by improving the rate at which the skin cells turn over and by helping them behave more appropriately so you don and dry built up skin cells that is that is one way in which retinoids work so there surface is already smooth and that adding an exfoliant into your routine it exfoliants are a very broad category you not such a fan of because they precise as chemical exfoliants and they can end up being pretty abrasive serve especially for people who have a more sensitive skin type then you have chemical exfoliants and in the category of chemical exfoliants you have so much you most commonly in over-the-counter products are going to be glycolic lactic mandelic or some blend of those then you have salicylic acid and FDA approved acne treatment it seborrheic dermatitis you also have polyhydroxy acids really gentle ideal for more sensitive skin types and across this gamut of just the chemical exfoliants alone within each of those categories Alpha Sal acid poly you have so many different formulation types and when it comes to the chemical exfoliants the formulation overall really has an influence on the performance of the product some products the manufacturer intentionally adds things to slow the penetration of the acid into the skin and therefore they work much more slowly so as to reduce irritation they gentler so if you are using those types of products every fourth night they probably not doing that much for you it other products are meant to be used less frequently and maybe even the instructions say to use once a week talking about salicylic acid you know this is an FDA approved acne treatment majority of salicylic acid products out there at least what we for acne they can be used safely even twice a day and they help to control the acne breakouts they also are anti-inflammatory so to comp to say that the frequency of use of a salicylic acid and Alpha hydroxy acid and polyhydroxy acids are all just going to be universally the same universally for all skin types indefinitely forever and ever amen it a country song right no uh and you really can that fourth day and generalize them because there exfoliating product to exfoliating product so much so that you can go into the drugstore for example and you can pick up a 10 glycolic acid toner from one brand and a 10 glycolic acid toner from another brand and they perform entirely differently in terms of exfoliation just based on how they formulated overall the free acid values of these products and other ingredients that are added that may slow or enhance penetration of glycolic acid into the skin so you degrees of exfoliation different effects they and so the every fourth night thing it may just be too slow it kind of creates a little bit of room for more confusion for you if you do develop irritation because you an exfoliant together in this drawn out routine in my opinion it opinion it opinion it makes more sense to introduce a retinol first and introduce it slowly get used to it feel comfortable with it start once a week increase to more frequently as tolerated every other night up to night light once you comfortable using the retinol and you been using it comfortably for at least six weeks ideally three months because these things take a long time to actually start working once you patient enough and you consistently enough for again six weeks to three months then you might want to consider the benefits for you of introducing an exfoliant do you even need to at that point at the end of the day skincare and skincare routines they are very individualized this approach of skin cycling is very slow which offers the benefit of kind of simplifying skin care for people who maybe are skincare overloaded from the internet and it offers the benefit of having these ingredients in your routine while safely reducing irritation doesn the risk however the other piece of the skin cycling is the recovery days day three and day four where you basically focusing on just using moisturizers and that moisturizers are really helpful for all skin types to help reduce water loss from the skin that can help make it so that products are less irritating in my opinion using retinol you should be using it alongside a moisturizer anyway which you know this skin cycling doesn say that you shouldn the day three and day four on moisturizing no one skincare routine is going to be right for everyone skin is so variable we all have different skin types we all have different skin tones we all are have our own issues things that are more likely to cause problems for our skin you know if you have a deeper skin type certain ingredients may be too irritating for you and that could put you at risk for hyperpigmentation if you have a more sensitive skin type if you have rosacea for example certain ingredients are going to burn and sting and can elicit symptoms of flushing redness that you regardless of skin cycling or not the frequency you know it doesn as much exfoliants are such a broad category that it generalize them into a one-size-fits-all frequency of use in my opinion skin cycling makes the most sense in the setting where say you have a cosmetic Dermatology practice and you have products in office that you sell that are intended to either enhance the treatments that you are offering and you counseling patients on how to introduce these products into their routine in a safe and effective manner these active ingredients like retinol glycolic acid a safe manner so as to minimize irritation then skin cycling makes some sense you tell the patient these products are intended to improve the visible signs of skin aging we did some treatments today that Target those things and this is kind of your going to be your maintenance that those things as well and this is how I want you to use them because these ingredients can be irritating if you use too much of them or you use them too frequently and I think again it makes the most sense if you have products in your office that you sell that you are familiar with so we limited a limited selection of products as opposed to the whole internet where you have so many different skin types you have so many ages of people consuming content not only ages but skin ages because skin age and chronologic age they don different skin goals and so many products that consumers have access to that it becomes very difficult to just generalize frequency of use for any one product so I think it can be I think it can be a less than optimal for such a large audience but it makes the most sense in my mind if you have a cosmetic practice like I said and you own products or you know branded products or whatever that you familiar with and you know it limited selection then it makes more sense to me all right you guys that opinion on skin cycling seems safe but again skincare is not a one-size-fits-all approach if you have a skin condition whether it be eczema acne psoriasis melasma see a board certified dermatologist for evaluation and treatment advice skin care is not a universal do this do that cookbook approach and so no there one-size-fits all but this seems like a safe way to maybe introduce ingredients with the caveats that I went over in this video I hope you all enjoyed this and answered your questions on my thoughts on skin cycling let me know in the comments if you have started doing skin cycling if you you maybe it us all know in the comments but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don I foreign [Music]	Success
KHLOE KARDASHIAN'S FACE TUMOR ?? DERMATOLOGIST @DrDrayzday REACTS ??	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsYDzPYQ0m0	Dr Day	recently Khloe Kardashian shared with her followers over on her Instagram stories that she had developed a tumor on her face that had to be removed we going to talk all about it in this video but before getting into it be sure you content from a board-certified dermatologist and hit that little bell icon to turn on your bell notifications that way YouTube will let you know as soon as my videos go live that way you don Kardashians are well known for abundantly sharing with their following and as I said Chloe shared on her story she had developed this tumor she thought it was a pimple originally a pimple an acne cyst however it didn doesn her she didn being painful itchy bleeding oozing we really don about it from her seven months later it was still there she had her dermatologist look at it sounds like they did a skin biopsy and she even had another dermatologist I believe look at it she was told that she had a skin tumor that immediately needed to be removed she sought out the services of a plastic surgeon who excised it and she was told that the margins were clear which is reassuring to hear whenever we that is the goal is to remove it in total so what the heck did she have on her face honestly I don didn it following about having a skin tumor that had to be excise but we don kind it is there are a lot of different types of tumors that can pop up especially on the face the head the neck in general many of them while not cancerous do need to be removed because they can put down roots and spread into the skin and become cosmetically disfiguring and their removal if put off becomes more involved and you with a larger scar I what they meant by this needs to be removed immediately we anything about the type of tumor I believe Chloe has revealed however in the past that she does actually have a history of melanoma that she developed at the age of 19 on the back so that is certainly relevant event great that she shared that history as well with her following skin cancers they something that you hear about actual people even young people do develop them one of the things I want to highlight about her history though that is so important and one of the reasons why I so glad that she shared this with her audience she said it said it started out as something that she thought was a pimple but it didn months later it was still there that something that is very common in the history of any type of skin tumor or skin cancer if you have something that you think is a pimple or an acne cyst but it doesn months and months that you can get a new breakout somewhere nearby you can get another pimple after that one goes away in the same place but an individual skin lesion that persists for months and months and months it that older adults commonly report when they come into the dermatologist or like I had this bump on my nose for a long time I just thought it was a pimple I squeezed it but it never goes away that is a classic history that people give when they actually have a skin cancer there are a lot of different skin tumors that can occur especially on the face you have a lot of sebaceous oil glands you have a lot of hair follicles on your face and you can develop tumors within the hair follicles in any part of the hair follicle there are a lot of different types of cells within a hair follicle or within a pore and each of those types of cells has a potential to grow some type of tumor as a dermatologist trust me when I tell you there are so many tumors that can happen in a hair follicle but skin cancers they are very common I have a lot of videos on this channel all about skin cancers I even have a whole playlist about skin cancer highly suggest you check it out of course the deadly melanoma which she obviously said she had a history of you also have more commonly something called basal cell carcinoma this is a skin cancer that arises in the keratinocytes basal cell carcinoma is probably one of the most common skin cancers out there it it can happen really anywhere on the body but it a matter of fact 85 percent of all basal cell skin cancers will occur on the face the head or the neck and that includes the scalp as well and they can look like a variety of different things the one way that they appear that kind of tricks people into assuming initially that it like an acne cyst is they can have kind of a nodular appearance by nodule I mean something that you can almost kind of put your fingers around they can be skin colored and they often have little blood vessels overlying them and eventually they can ulcerate meaning they get a little dimple in the center they can ooze bleed crust over they not painful but they can they aren clue that maybe they are going a little bit deeper into the skin and possibly involving one of the little nerves in the skin the borders of these skin cancers they kind of have this rolled appearance to them they described as a pearly papule but basal cells can also have different colors in them they can be brown black they can be more flat they can actually look like a scar in some cases certain types risk factors for developing basal cell carcinoma are related to sun exposure UV Expo closure especially in early childhood the sun exposure that you get in your Early Childhood probably is what sets the stage for basal cell carcinoma later on in life the latency period from exposure to UV to actually forming a basal cells carcinoma is approximately 20 to 50 years now people are living longer and longer and the older you get the greater your risk of developing a basal cell carcinoma one of the greatest risks for basal cell carcinoma is living a long time the longer you live the greater the chances that you make one of these eventually especially if you are a pale skin type and especially if you got a lot of sun exposure in early childhood if you ever used a tanning bed that certainly is a risk factor if you have a history of receiving radiation treatments for something else in the past that puts you at an increased risk for developing basal cell carcinoma historically men are more likely to develop these than women likely because at least in the past men were more likely to have occupations that required them to have a lot of outdoor sun exposure the medication Hydrochlorothiazide it diuretic that blood pressure it learned is a very strong photosensitizer it makes you a lot more sensitive to the sun and it certainly can increase your risk for developing basal cell carcinoma and that is dose dependent meaning the longer that you accumulative dose that you receive the greater your risk for basal cell carcinoma now basal salt carcinoma it not dangerous people are not dropping debt from basal cell carcinoma sure there are rare instances where it can potentially metastasize but usually that an underlying genetic condition that puts them at risk for making these it is slow growing non-dangerous but we do need to take care of it because it can infiltrate into the deeper layers of the skin and it can spread out and kind of take over and we face that ends up being predisfiguring treating it early and making sure that we get all of it out ensures the best possible outcome a type of surgery that we do on these especially when they occur on the face is called nose surgery basically what that is is removing small pieces at a time and examining those pieces of excised tissue under the microscope until there Loft in the skin this way you remove as little skin and tissue as possible while ensuring that you get all of it out that about your face because the more stuff you take out the harder it to piece things back together and so that is why most surgery that is another benefit of most surgeries there another tumor that common in young children it pylo matricoma these derive from the hair cells in the hair the Matrix cells and the hair and they can occur on the face really anywhere where you have a hair follicle but they are more common on on the head and neck they are rock hard usually because they calcify and because of the calcium education they kind of take on this angulated shape it almost look like a little tint I brought these up because they are a lot more common on the cheek for whatever reason and it sounds like that is where this skin lesion she developed that she describes as a tumor arose they usually solitary meaning you don multiple very slow growing firm they not dangerous they they do need to be excised they going to spontaneously go away and they can continue to grow very very rarely however a pylometricoma it actually can develop into a cancer it matrix carcinoma very rare but they can have they can occur as well another reason to remove these because a pylo matrix carcinoma it actually can go on to spread to the lymph nodes and metastasize you have a tumor called a tricho-epithelioma you can have just one of these or you can have multiple of them there are certain genetic conditions that pretty dispose individuals to making multiple of these but you can spontaneously develop one they like a little nodule they cancer they likely come about from the cells that make up a part of the hair referred to as the Bulge region they grow really really slowly but they not going to just spontaneously go away so they need to be removed as well with an excision very rarely they can develop into a high grade cancer but that again is super rare you also can develop a tumor on the face within the sweat glands one that comes to mind is microcystic adnexyl carcinoma or a Mac they have a predilection for the central face especially on the upper lip but they can happen really anywhere on the face I the cheek but it can appear at any age as a matter of fact there occurring in an infant and I think the oldest age reported as 90 but the average age is in the fifth and sixth decades 50s and 60s but these are actually pretty aggressive meaning they invade around the area pretty tenaciously and they do need to be excised now they cancer that goes on to cause death but they do need to be removed because they can certainly be incredibly disfiguring they can cause pain discomfort and they have to be removed using that special type of surgery Mohs surgery to ensure the margins are clear because if you get all the all the tumor out the the prognosis meaning the the outcome is actually quite good they have a very very modest risk of reoccurring and the risk of them metastasizing meaning spreading to other areas of the body is pretty low people who develop these often have a history of radiation therapy anywhere from 19 to 50 percent of patients who get these have that history those are some tumors that can happen on your face but by all means this is not an exhaustive review of all adnexal neoplasms that can arise on the head and neck that would that that is that is you know do a Derm residency if you want to learn that stuff um it had a skin cancer she may have had a tumor that just becomes very comfortable in the area and spreads out and needs to be removed but is not necessarily life-threatening but is just you know potentially disfiguring it the Kardashians their brand is is their appearance so no pressure on the surgeon who had to remove this but it sounds like you know she was happy and things worked out well which is good so hopefully that information you know is educational and helpful for you guys take-home point is tumors on the head and neck very common and if it looks like a pimple and you think it pimple but it doesn get in to see a board-certified dermatologist have it looked at because it could be any one of these you know what are referred to as adenects or tumors meaning tumors that arise from like the hair follicle the sweat gland the sebaceous oil gland or it could be a skin cancer like a basal cell carcinoma just because you not mean you you can you know all the more reason to be extra militant tanning beds do increase your risk of developing skin cancers especially if you wanted one before the age of 25. I really like I said at the beginning I really appreciate that she shared this information with her audience uh you know the Kardashians say what you will about them but I I do like it when celebrities are open With Their audience that they had some kind of a medical thing and you know encouraging Their audience to see a health care professional to have things looked at to not blow things off I really think that read you know I saw an interview she reiterated that she wears sunscreen every day given her history of melanoma which I think is a really good thing for her to be doing and I greatly appreciate that you know Kim Kardashian has been very open about having psoriasis and the impacts of that and I think that that with your audience provided they trying to give out medical advice on these things other than see a health care professional which sounds like that is what what she did all that to say you know recently I did a video about the increasing wait time to get in to see a board-certified dermatologist and that is something that is really actually across the board of all Medical Specialties not all but many Medical Specialties there is an increased wait time to get in to see to see the doctor and that is even more of an issue for people who live in rural areas where there may be fewer doctors per person and it people who are low income and or uninsured to have that access so the the message while correct and good it becoming even more challenging for people these days and like I said a lot of these tumors they life-threatening but they certainly can be incredibly disfiguring and the longer the wait time to get in to see a dermatologist it can impact the extent to which these things grow and and end up meeting even more care delays in treatment are serious and I think that is one thing that while it shared this let Kardashian and you have a sniffle you can get in to see you know the best ENT on the planet in a matter of seconds they have that fast access they have the money to fund it and that be the case for majority of the general public what do you guys think though let me know in the comments because I have some thoughts on this which I won into in this video but what do you guys think about the fact that in media articles and on her social media she tagging the Instagram accounts of the doctors that she saw what do you guys think of that the silver endorsement for the medical care that she received how do you think that that impacts people perceptions of I don them thinking that these are the best doctors what do you guys think about that I have some opinions maybe something to talk about in a later video on taking care of VIP patients because it thing you know celebrities get sick they need they need medical care and they should have Medical Care not denying that but you know remaining unbiased in treating VIPs as they she wanted to you know say thank you but you could do that by just leaving the names out like a big thank you to my medical team it that she tagged the individual Instagram accounts of the physician she saw it like you know an endorsement basically I am going to wrap this video up here I hope you guys enjoyed it on the end slate I will link one of my other celebrity response videos uh if you want to check that out I think the last one I did was reacting to Brad Pitt exorbitantly overpriced skin care brand so check that out if you missed it but if you guys enjoyed this one give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe I bye [Music] thank you [Music]	Success
TIKTOK MAN'S SKIN TURNS BLACK AFTER PROZAC ?? DERMATOLOGIST REACTS	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3fOysYAhFA	Dr Day	have you guys seen The Man on Tick Tock whose skin started turning black after taking Prozac we about it before getting into it give this video a thumbs up if you like skincare content from a board certified dermatologist be sure you and you have your bell notifications on that way YouTube lets you know as soon as my videos go live a Woman by the name of Emily monk over on Tick Tock has been sharing videos about her husband turning black after taking fluoxetine otherwise known as Prozac hey everyone this video is of my husband Tyler in January 2021 he started taking medication for depression and anxiety and by March 2021 he started turning a grayish blue color and um as you can see by the end of the video he none of the Specialists know why his body reacted this way to the medicine um but they won anyone else out there that this has happened to or if anyone has any Aunt he started taking this medication in January of 2021 for depression and anxiety and around March he started developing hyperpigmentation in Sun exposed areas he stopped taking the medication about the hyperpigmentation continued to worsen continued to deepen drug induced hyperpigmentation accounts for 10 to 20 percent of all cases of acquired hyperpigmentation there are a handful of medications for which this is a known side effect and we get into those medications in a moment how exactly is it that a medication could change the color of your skin there are a few potential mechanisms by which medications can lead to hyperpigmentation in the case of heavy metals like iron gold silver they actually can deposit in the dermis the deeper layers of the skin as they are leaked out of blood vessels and if they quantities well that can lead to discoloration of the skin independent of your Skin melanin other medications actually can interact with your Skin melanin to form drug melanin complexes that are deposited and lead to discoloration and then when your skin is exposed to the sun well that kicks off more melanin production and more of these complexes form so you get progressive discoloration some medications will actually trigger increased production of melanin and this type of hyperpigmentation will worsen with sun exposure now other medications can lead to discoloration by accumulating in the skin and or reacting with different proteins and compounds in the skin to lead to a characteristic type of discoloration so what types of medications can lead to changing the color of your skin not super common antidepressant medications certainly can lead to drug-induced acquired hyperpigmentation the antidepressant type selective serotonin reuptake Inhibitors or ssris can cause a brownish black pigmentation on the face neck and forearms in Sun exposed areas and the class of medications known as tricyclic antidepressants including decipramine and amipramine this can cause a slight grade discoloration in Sun exposed areas let think about iron iron infusions the iron actually can leak out into the skin and cause discoloration it siderosis and it discoloration at the injection site so for example if you treatment some of it leaks out into the skin it can lead to this discoloration back in the day a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis was actually gold and a complication of that treatment was something called chrysius hyperpigmentation related to Gold therapy this rarely ever occurs anymore because we have better medications to treat rheumatoid arthritis and gold is no longer really used at all with gold you get a blue gray or purple pigmentation in Sun exposed areas and it can also impact the eyes the whites of the eyes while gold is rarely used anymore in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis chrysius can happen decades after stopping the gold so it something important to consider if the patient received gold in the past ingestion of colloidal silver can lead to discoloration it it also potentially a problem for people who work around silver are exposed to it occupationally maybe they work in a silver mine or maybe they work in a factory where they and they get a lot of silver exposure it can cause the skin to turn bluish gray one medication that is notorious for having a risk of hyperpigmentation patient is the antibiotic Minocycline not only can It impact the skin but it can lead to discoloration of your gums your bones your teeth and even your thyroid and other organs the incidence of drug-induced hyperpigmentation from Minocycline ranges anywhere from three to fifteen percent there are a few different ways in which Minocycline can lead to hyperpigmentation or discoloration the first time is a bluish block discoloration in areas of Prior skin injury so think of it like acne scars suddenly developing this blue black discoloration this is a result of pigment granules being deposited in the dermis in those areas of Prior inflammation the second type of Minocycline hyperpigmentation is a bluish black discoloration in areas of skin that were previously healthy so no prior skin injury or inflammation this most often affects the extremities especially The Shins then Minocycline can also lead to this muddy Brown discoloration that is how it in Sun exposed areas and that is related to an increase in melanization of the basal layer of the skin with Minocycline the acquired hyperpigmentation can happen as early as three months of of therapy hours to five years you can get an acquired hyperpigmentation with the psychiatric medications chlorpromazine and phenothiazine it exposed areas and it longer you intense the pigment is going to be the medication phenytoin it anti-epileptic for seizures but it also used for other other purposes about 10 of patients who take that medication will develop acquired hyperpigmentation on the face that looks an awful lot like melasma fortunately when that medication is stopped the hyperpigmentation will resolve anti-malarial medications can definitely cause an acquired hyperpigmentation and while these medications are used for malaria they also used to treat a variety of other things about 25 percent of patients who are on these medications will actually develop an acquired hyperpigmentation but this side effect isn until after several years of being on these medications and it bluish black discoloration in Sun exposed areas it also can affect the mucous membranes the nails can be involved chemotherapeutics or cytotoxic medications used to treat cancers definitely can have the side effect of hyperpigmentation a rather strange hyperpigmentation with the medication bleomyosin it hyperpigmentation flagellate because it looks like you have been flagellating yourself you can also get acquired hyperpigmentation with the chemotherapeutics cyclophosphamide and adriomyosin the cardiac medication amiodarone notorious for potentially causing acquired hyperpigmentation with this medication you get a blue gray discoloration on the face and the hands amiodarone can also make you very sensitive to the sun then then you got non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen and they can cause a drug reaction if you will it a fixed drug eruption it happens after you while and all of a sudden your immune system decides that it doesn care for something about this medication and you develop this uh around rash in most cases initially that doesn until you know maybe a couple weeks after you took the medication but once you develop this reaction it fixed drug eruption then anytime you are exposed anytime you take that medication it will appear very quickly and most often happens on like the hands the feet and the genitalia around the mouth it happens in the same location every time and it can be uncomfortable sometimes there most cases there are it also can have a blister in the center so those are some common medications that can lead to acquired hyperpigmentation but you know you got to think broadly in these cases too it could be an underlying medical problem there are a variety of you know for example endocrinologic diseases that present with hyperpigmentation like something called Addison can also develop hyperpigmentation if you deficiency and in some cases hyperthyroidism you can develop hyperpigmentation you know while there not that much research on acquired hyperpigmentation from supplements or you know nutraceuticals definitely need to consider those herbal supplements could potentially likewise be a trigger so that would be a really important piece of getting a good history from a patient who hyperpigmentation how do you make the diagnosis like how do you nail it down it going to take some blood work to again evaluate for potential underlying medical causes like thyroid problems and whatnot and honestly a biopsy can be incredibly valuable in these cases a skin biopsy because you can actually see deposits in some cases that are characteristic of certain types of medication acquired hyperpigmentation so to be clear I know suggest any potential diagnosis for this individual I don know anything I out medical advice this video is merely for educational purposes on drug-induced hyperpigmentation in some cases the hyperpigmentation depending on the cause it will slowly resolve with time sun avoidance and sun protection is key because sun exposure is going to increase melanin production and if it related to a medication that makes those you know kind of complexes with melanin well it the the appearance of the discoloration with sun exposure so aggressive sun protection is really important and in some cases certain lasers can be helpful for improving the appearance sometimes it is permanent and you know it can be pretty disfiguring and I also I also size I know a lot of you guys deal with hyperpigmentation but hopefully this video illustrates to you that it conditions you know we other videos about melasma we about post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation like from healing acne but you can also see here how certain medications can lead to acquired hyperpigmentation so that is why you know to emphasize it with a skin problem like acquired hyperpigmentation to see a board-certified dermatologist rather than you know trying to diagnose and manage it yourself you can make things much worse and in some cases it different from what other people online who are you know sharing their favorite skincare routine it from what they might be dealing with so their tips are just not going to apply to you and you know that we going to make the most difference for you moving forward I hope this video was informative and you guys enjoyed it let me know in the comments if you guys are over on Tick Tock if you you enjoyed it make sure you give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe I bye foreign [Music]	Success

THE WAIT TO SEE A DERMATOLOGIST IS GETTING TOO LONG ?? @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-rYyVf2pxo	Dr Day	well hey guys comment below are you waiting to get in to see a dermatologist does it seem like it we video but before we do give it a thumbs up if you like skincare content from a board-certified dermatologist and be sure you bell notifications on that way you know as soon as my videos go live in my videos I a board certified dermatologist if you have a skin problem don try and self-diagnose whatever you do don definitely lead you down a path where you end up far worse off than you ever would have been had you not just gone and seen a dermatologist sounds easy sounds straightforward but I am not completely blind to the fact that it is very difficult to get in to see a dermatologist a recent study came out actually showing that the wait time to get in to see a doctor for the first time as a new patient has increased quite a bit since prior surveys done in 2017. force four Specialties in particular saw a noticeable increase in wait time for new patients in comparison to 2017 cardiologists orthopedic surgeons OB gyns and dermatologists across these four Specialties was an average increase of eight percent in the amount of days it takes to get in to see one of these providers for the first time this survey looked at 15 metropolitan areas throughout the U.S Los Angeles New York City Seattle Houston Dallas San Diego Miami Detroit Portland Boston as well as a few others 15 major cities not only did the time that it takes to schedule an appointment as a new patient increase by eight percent in comparison to 2017 but in comparison to 2004 it increased by 24 when it comes to your health time is of the essence in a lot of situations just speaking about Dermatology skin problem problems the longer you wait it can definitely be tricky once you finally do get in to see a dermatologist because a lot of things change there are a lot of skin conditions that come and go for example hives come and go they don temporary Improvement only to have them recur and during this wait time it can be very distressing certain skin conditions not only are they psychologically devastating to go through you and people are like why is your face red what is that bump on your nose why is hair seemingly thinning what with your hairline do you inevitably are going to get some of these ignorant comments about your appearance that can be incredibly isolating distressing and it can impact your performance at work for example studies show that women who deal with acne they feel less confident in their role in their job and they feel like they are discriminated against because of their acne and perceived as being too young and too immature to handle the responsibilities that come with their job it true this does happen to people who are coping with skin conditions speaking of bumps on your face or other body sites let you go with a skin cancer undiagnosed that means when it finally is diagnosed you involved treatment it expensive to treat potentially and so time is very important the average number of days a patient had to wait for an appointment as a new patient was 26 days days in New York City Los Angeles and Seattle those are major metropolitan areas with a very high physician number per capita 26 days currently as opposed to 24.1 days in 2017 and 21 days in 2004. however it differs a lot depending on the specialty for example OB GYN 31.4 days that is an increase of 19 up from 2017. and OBGYN Obstetrics and Gynecology cardiologists those are the heart doctors the number of days it takes to get in to see a cardiologist for the first time 26.6 days orthopedic surgeons it takes about 16.9 days to get in as a new patient that is up 48 from 2017. the specialty with the longest wait time to get in as a new patient is Dermatology 34.5 days it takes to get in as a new patient to see a dermatologist that is up actually only seven percent from 2017 so it some of these other Specialties but it is a large delay in the time for soliciting an appointment to the time you actually see the dermatologist which again a lot of dermatologic conditions they are very distressing to cope with they can impact your sleep if you are waking up in the night very itchy say again you you have a rash for the first time maybe you develop a rash this happens a lot with certain viral illnesses and the rash can be very itchy it can be very uncomfortable and guess what a lot of these rashes spontaneously resolve so you kind of are going at it alone for a while and by the time you get in to see the dermatologist the rash has resolved and you are left without any answers there really look at that is active they just going off of your history at that point so you are left with no answer and for you as a patient that can be very very distressing because you there wondering like is this going to come back was it something I was exposed to was it mold was it this was it that and you may not necessarily even make the connection that you had been sick previously because there can be a delay in the time in which these rashes appear from a prior illness and so you may not make that connection or it could be something that you off and on a contact dermatitis and maybe you are removed from that contact allergen the rash resolved you get in to see a dermatologist there there you looking at you like you though we see this all the time we patients make an appointment and then by the time I see this there look at so we don but anyways you feel very defeated one thing that was interesting to me is that the amount of days that it takes to get in to see a dermatologist varies a lot depending on what city that you live in Portland it takes 84 days to see a dermatologist as a new patient I think Portland was pretty bad in terms of wait time for a few other Specialties as well whereas if you live in Philly the City of Brotherly Love uh it nine days not too bad this survey demonstrated pretty much across the board majority of Specialties showing an increase in the number of days it takes to get in to see a provider as a new patient the exception being Family Medicine Family Medicine actually saw a decrease in the number of days it takes to get into CA Family Medicine doctor for the first time now one potential explanation is that there is an increase in telemedicine Services direct to consumer services that a lot of patients especially those who are you know younger they are more interested in they don to see a doctor but they don you know their schedules are very busy they like the convenience of being able to go online to some sort of Telehealth platform and access a primary care service that way so that for you know random little colds and flus and sorts of things are amenable to to that kind of thing but you really are you really developing a rapport and a relationship with somebody who is your doctor you know those things are kind of one and done for the most part although you know some cases there is some continuity there but when we talking about that physician-patient relationship it important to the younger generation and that may sound like not such a big deal but if you think about it if something changes in your health you become acutely ill it somebody who knows you very well and knows your medical history and that really what family medicine is you know there to be the primary the primary go-to person why are wait times to get in to see a doctor whether it be a dermatologist apologize or some of these other Specialists that I mentioned why is a wait time as a new patient increasing simple likely due to supply versus demand for a long time there have been looming projections regarding physician shortages why well we have an aging population the number of people over the age of 65 is increasing and our lifespan is increasing so this brings with it an increased demand for Health Care the longer you live the more Health Care Services you people are living longer they through different types of cancers in the case of Dermatology we about skin cancers they tend to appear first in middle age and an increasing number of them appear the longer you are on this planet having one skin cancer means you developing another so you can imagine with a population of people over the age of 65 increasing living longer that lot more skin cancers a lot more demand for dermatologists the number of dermatologists maybe is not meeting this increase in demand enough to not only handle that but to take care of all the other dermatologic needs hence an increase in the amount of days needed before you can actually get in to see a Derm the association of American medical colleges or the double AMC they put out a report predicting shortages now for primary care doctors that Medicine Pediatrics geriatric medicine it 48 000 Physicians short in the year 2034. for more specialized Physicians Specialty Physicians it we of positions required to meet the demands the increasing demands by about 77 000 physicians in 2034 so basically not enough docs to meet the increase increase demand of an aging population the number of people over the age of 65 in the United States is expected to be about 42.4 percent in the year 2034. so that is a big uptick and people over the age of 65 who are expected to live longer than years past and as a result they they stents in the case of Cardiology even eventually you know going on to require bypass that the Health Care System the longer you exist on this planet the greater the likelihood that you health care services that you to develop a health complication it just a fact of life and the fact that we are living a long time it means that this aging population is going to require a lot more attention from Physicians and we simply don physician Workforce needed to meet the demands of the Aging population and that is trickling in and we an increase in number of days it taking over time to get him to see a doctor as a new patient during that time of the pandemic with the stay-at-home orders where people were not necessarily going into a dermatologist to have a spot or a mole evaluated where people weren office what ended up happening is that a lot of skin cancers went undiagnosed and a lot of dermatologists if you talk to them they will tell you that they are seeing more melanomas they more skin cancers more advanced skin cancers likely because of that delay in diagnosis this impacts everybody but who it impacts the most are the uninsured the poor and those who live in rural areas this study was done in metropolitan areas with a very high number of Physicians per capita so you can only imagine that if you live in a rural area a small town far removed from a major city it even greater wait time to get in to see your local specialist if you have one in your area so the number of slots for medical students may be increasing meaning we students more people graduating from medical school that means like a solution but it unfortunately the number of residency training slots is not increasing to match that so what you then have is an increased number of people who have a medical degree but they can required training in order to obtain a license to actually practice and if you weren a medical degree it is expensive it is very very expensive average medical debt is the average debt of a graduating medical student is around two hundred thousand dollars by conservative estimates very limited number of Dermatology residency slots available for for this increased interest in in people wanting to go into Dermatology I found this survey telling as it highlights the issue around physician shortages which you can see trickling down into the number of days it takes to actually get in to see a physician for the first time especially in fields like Dermatology orthopedic surgery OB GYN and Cardiology throughout my channel I always emphasize in videos see a board-certified dermatologist don self-treat it you it can be harmful don internet and now that we have Tick Tock messing everybody up you know now more than ever I want to emphasize to you guys that if you have a skin problem please see a board-certified dermatologist however I always feel like especially as I my videos like that it comes across I don to call it like does she not realize that if we could we would I emphasize that because it it people take matters into their own hands we see a lot of harm from that you know for example those skin tag removal devices we see harm from people trying to do that themselves the FDA has even issued a warning against doing that it can be pretty harmful things that you wouldn dangerous to try at home they actually can end up leading to pretty adverse Health outcomes but it can be very tempting in this climate where there is such a delay in the amount of time it takes to get in to see a physician and that delay is very much dependent on where you live uh you know what city you live in or if you live in a rural area it is definitely felt a lot harder in those areas you definitely going to feel the pressures of that a lot greater and I ignorant to that and for those who are uninsured it worse this is a population already vulnerable to delays in diagnosis and it to get worse with impending physician shortages you know if you are waiting to see a dermatologist and you have a skin problem I do suggest taking photographs of the problem that certainly can be helpful in the long run especially by the time you get in to see them as a new patient the problem has resolved call every day believe it or not a lot of people cancel their appointments call every day be very persistent ask is there an opening is there an opening don two weeks ago because there is a chance that there is an opening on a given day if you just call so be persistent call that would be my other tip if you already have a primary care doctor I do also suggest giving them a call going in to see them because either they can get you in as a referral showing you know the photographs and things may push things along further I want to hear from you guys though in the comments have you tried to get in to see a dermatologist as a new patient in the last year what was that like how many days did it take weeks months and are you you probably maybe even still waiting to get in it can be very frustrating I will emphasize I don self-diagnose attempting to self-treat or following random advice from people online with the internet people are gonna want to give their opinion on everything and it can be tempting to go on one of these sites like Reddit or other websites where people are dealing with things like hair loss and it can be feel like a very supportive community and it can feel like people resonate with what you can be great for support but you can also get a lot of misinformation on these sites I I hope this video was informative if you guys liked it give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen And subscribe I to you guys tomorrow bye foreign [Music]	Success
HAS BRAD PITT LOST HIS MIND? LE DOMAINE SKIN CARE ?? @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwOvL31-_tU	Dr Day	Brad Pitt has lost his mind with the launch of his new skincare brand and we but before we do give it a thumbs up if you like skincare content from a board-certified dermatologist make sure you notifications on so YouTube lets you know as soon as my videos go live recently Brad Pitt announced that he coming out with a skincare brand in the vein of all celebrities these days really getting on our nerves isn seems like every minute a celebrity is launching a skincare brand they need to get the message that we are over it at least I am comment below are you over skincare from celebrities the Kardashians they left and right as a matter of fact I think they are on Gummy vitamin 3.0 I sure it candy with a high dose of a B vitamin to trigger your acne all right what has Brad come up with the brand is called Le domain where science meets nature all right implying science is unnatural love it uh this brand was done in partnership with these Vintners that own this massive Winery and it grape-derived ingredients which are not novel in skin care products the antioxidant Resveratrol I about in other videos before it comes from grapes as well as other plants and it oxidative stress and when applied to the skin it may help in reducing free radicals that form upon exposure to things like ultraviolet radiation pollution infrared radiation tobacco smoke visible light these things lead to free radicals they damaged DNA they damage collagen proteins in our skin lead to the signs of premature skin aging they also aggravate hyperpigmentation and a variety of other skin problems and there are many skin care products out there that contain either Resveratrol or other antioxidants certainly not a replacement for sun protection but you know consider it an add-on in addition it may have benefit not only in reducing the burden of sun damage but also slowing down the rate of skin aging now Brad counts the grape-based stuff centered around the scientist that he claims to partner with who allegedly is interested in Progeria there are a variety of genetic conditions called progeroid conditions due to a variety of underlying Gene abnormalities whether it be laminin or DNA helicase enzymes things like Hutchinson Guilford and Werner syndrome where you have accelerated aging not just of the skin and some of these conditions but also the cardiovascular system sorry you guys I the lizards returning look at the Lizard King out there hello um yeah I mean going from research on how conditions lead to aging all the way to using that in your skin care products it pretty big leap I will say it big leap uh yeah because honestly grape derived ingredients they the beginning of the video they novel on skin care products I recently reviewed as a matter of fact Resveratrol in skin care the ordinaries Resveratrol serum uh is you know a wonderful affordable option but what has Brad come up with here all right so the products he cleansing Emulsion and stay tuned in January we which I lotion and consistency they got to be cool and you know take a handful of the ingredients and give them some Jazzy trademark names so they came up with GSM 10 and pro gr3 which I guess is uh you know kind of around the Progeria but don not proprietary these propriety Terry ingredients they have nothing to do with progeria or like a treatment for that or you know they don that are problematic in those diseases so I I don huge stretch to take a rare genetic disease and layer it into your skin care even if it is a disease of accelerated aging like dude uh let the Nobel laureates do their thing uh anyways so what do these have in it grape water grape flour extract and grape skin extract and so that guess that gr3 just those great derived ingredients and my understanding is you know the Resveratrol is predominant in the grape skin but to what extent you getting much Resveratrol from this product that evidence-based compound there are a variety of other antioxidants as well but to what extent these three ingredients are really delivering you potent levels of those antioxidants it probably it is what I if they just extracted the Active Components and put them in the skin care but they don this also has centella leaf extract centella or centella asiatica the Asiatic pennywort it and there that may accelerate skin healing like after a surgical SCAR or any type of skin injury this also has a variety of nice evidence-based humectants red algae extract the red algae is not listed out it for red algae lactobacillus ferment filtrate ferment filtrates are enriched in theory for antioxidants humectants moisturizing factors and there Crispus extract and hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid as well as tea extract Camellia and tea we know rich in antioxidants so that cream kind of has some of those same components grape skin extract so the grape ingredients it also has centella sunflower seed oil which is an emollient shea butter and occlusive to reduce water loss I want to make sure I don the ingredients I took note of olive oil you know olive oil is interesting it obviously an oil that depending on you know how it know a very rich source of antioxidants but applying it to the skin interestingly enough a very small study showed that using just straight up olive oil on the skin is like a moisturizer actually increase the rate of water loss out of the skin that moisturizers that contain olive oil can uh I always point that out because I think olive oil people have this tendency to put it on a pedestal you know given what we know about the Mediterranean diet showing promise so everybody focused on olive oil it component of you know many diets around the world uh but so I I think skin care Brands they like to take olive oil and you know make you feel like you know you that old Italian grandmother time tested cooking somehow in your skincare I really do think that that that olive oil I mean JLo did the same thing with the olive oil and you know and here here we are again yet again cream unlike the serum does have fragrance now they claim that the serum this is something Brands love to do the serum is like more potent than the cream sure but do we even know if these trademark complexes of these ingredients are actually you know effective in terms of getting in and doing these things hard to say not sure what the fluid cream that contain I would imagine it a more lightweight version of the cream the fluid cream you know maybe they omit the shea butter maybe they know make it more watery so if you don like heavy creams that more up your alley the cleansing Emulsion like the cream does have fragrance it seed oil sounds like it might be a very nice mild cream cleanser for dry skin I will not be buying this trying it out because like I said at the beginning of the video Brad has lost his mind or whoever is advising him on this they they reality completely out of touch with reality because the serum is 300 185 dollars for one ounce the cream is three hundred and twenty dollars for 1.7 ounces and the cleansing Emulsion is coming in at the low low rate of eighty dollars which is just absurd it is absolutely absurd I don going to pay these prices because first of all majority of people are not going to be able to afford this and I don believe that uber wealthy people who can afford this are they really going to go to Brad Pitt for their skin care products they some other you know overly grossly overpriced skin care product or maybe they buying the same drugstore stuff we all are um I just don target market is with these insane prices um I actor but this is just completely out of touch with reality completely out of Touch first of all we are living in a time now where consumers are far more Savvy about skin care especially those of you who are skin care enthusiasts whether you like my content or not you know maybe you who likes you know to try all sorts of exotic skin care products you love buying them you love the beautiful bottles and you know all the toners and all of the fluff even I know you are giving this the side eye that this is insanely overpriced for what it is and that these people are out of their minds they of touch with reality because like I said grape derived ingredients are not novel in skin care product grape seed oil very commonly found and Resveratrol affordable in the ordinary serum even codale a brand I don have been doing the wine stuff for a long time now he the lines of he took inspiration from what Gwyneth has developed with goop I mean that right there is going to be a huge turn off for majority of skin care enthusiasts people into skincare and people in general goop has its fan base but uh many people in the skin care space Gwyneth is a hard now so endorsing Gwyneth is going to put a lot of people off everything from the Jade egg to her wonky sunscreen tips he markets the products as I already said science meets nature mostly recyclable because the bottles have these Oak um caps are made out of wood which I also wonder how that fares in terms of just a packaging design I cosmetic chemist or manufacturer but that just seems like maybe not the best material from the longevity standpoint I don is the new thing I mean it thing in principle but if you celebrity Brown it that you packaging and it sounds really awesome right like we you critically look at their packaging and their refills you equivalent of I don little ring of plastic which is you know great in the long run but who are they kidding I mean they really it though they don trying to figure out how to make more you know reusable packaging it they put the bare minimum effort into the refillable packaging concept and you in the long run it seems I mean they could do a lot more and then this this cracked me up so you know they make claims antioxidant moisturizing improve Radiance anti-fatigue what is anti-fatigue like taking a nap I even sure I guess just rejuvenate the look of tired skin uh anti-wrinkle and improve elasticity but what really cracks me up is this quote so he like I guess on the advisory committee who has done some research on grapes and you know their compounds and and aging and whatnot we know that these extensively rigorous testing methods are not common in the Cosmetics industry but we couldn way it crush me I is like skincare brands do do their own little clinical testing is it like robust clinical trials peer-reviewed science absolutely not but don yourself into thinking that Brad you know is is going out and doing peer-reviewed studies on his 320 dollar cream here uh it just not happening uh so I don I thought that was comical uh like I said the guy is that these people are out of their mind they completely out of touch with reality they have too much money and they want to make a skincare brand because that what everybody else is doing and there zero creativity here it a pump and dump type scheme very easy for these celebrities to launch a skincare brand with minimal effort charge exorbitant prices you know selling with their image and it stop soon it people in skincare they Savvy we there who are getting into skin care consumers have a lot more knowledge about ingredients and things like that and they have come many have come to realize learn and appreciate that more expensive does not necessarily mean better sure there are many people who adore luxury expensive skin care products but they are still Discerning with their purchases and they for this garbage they um they don is this actually going to make them any money are they actually going to make it to January to launch the the lotion and why was the lotion delayed is that just to keep you on the edge of your seat do people actually here as a consumer like is the the promise of a lightweight a lighter weight fluid cream it really going to bring you back because even if you have a very rudimentary knowledge and understanding like you a first-time consumer into skin care I mean is that really going to to pull you in for another round I could see if if there was some promise of you know maybe a vitamin C serum those are super popular or an eye cream we all know people love eye creams but they teasing the the fluid cream I don uh seems like a stretch and we really don moisturizer serum which is what this is we don this is offering nothing new to the table of an already saturated Market full of products and you know it opinion and I know I that the basic stuff that you can get in the drugstore is more than adequate of course if you want to buy expensive luxury products you like the way they look that is your prerogative but when we actual skin Health needs you you really there that is that is compelling truthfully for you to be dropping this kind of price point it there are a lot of cosmetic manufacturers there are a lot of cosmetic chemists manufacturers people who love skin care take it very seriously and spend a lot of time on the research and development of their products a lot of back and forth getting the formula exactly right and these celebrities they just swoop in and they use their influence to sell mediocre products at an exorbitant price I don need you guys to let me know in the comments but humor me if you want to will you be buying this please tell me now um I I know my audience pretty well and I going to you guys are not sitting there waiting to add to card I mean you knew clicking into this video If you new here you knew clicking into this video that I wasn you guys go buy this stuff because it insane the price point um and and so you knew what you were getting into but let me know were you were you contemplating purchasing this or are you just are you just here lurking for for the rantage there are a lot of other merchandise type product lines that celebrities could come out with that are not just skin care like how hard can I don be really into olive oil why don just come out with their own line of olive oil um and you know partner like what or I know wine is another one but why I guess wine is more difficult probably just sell than skin care you know he made a big deal about partnering with the this Winery but why not just make wine and you can tell me Brad Pitt suddenly out of nowhere is become passionate about skin care he Brad gives two rats rear ends about skin care products so to me it says cash grab but the pricing is just like who is their target market anyways that you guys enjoyed this video if so give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow bye [Music] thank you [Music]	Success
INSANE TREND OF TAPING YOUR MOUTH SHUT ?? @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFkqCxN_RPc	Dr Day	well you guys there need to talk about i but before we get into it make sure you skincare content from me a dermatologist hit the bell notification and let you know when my videos go live consider following me on tick tock where i keep track of these crazy trends or instagram if you prefer short form content a lot of people have been tagging me on this trend of taping your face [Music] and this is actually nothing new i mean i they 1889. now with age and accumulation of sun damage our skin loses a lot of elasticity we get sag and this taping thing it people have been doing for a long time just to kind of give themselves a temporary facelift almost like a form of pre makeup but people on tick tock are taking it so far as to wear these things like overnight claiming that it will immobilize the muscles in your face prevent you from contracting your face in your sleep and prevent you from developing wrinkles [Music] i think that is a bit of a stretch now they do make a variety of patches for the face that have a wrinkle smoothing effect but they do that by trapping hydration in the skin as you guys know from my videos your skin loses more water when you sleep it makes your skin more prone to dryness and a lot of these face patches are made out of like medical grade silicone similar to what you find in a silicone scar sheet for scars it does definitely have a skin smoothing effect but it doesn prevent wrinkles that really just temporarily smooths out the skin what i kinesiology tape and if you don what that is i it looks like here it of tape for you know taping knees and injuries so i see people do using this on their face and i doing [Music] that immobilizing your face um so yeah i mean i guess it harmless aside from the fact that you can develop irritation from the tape and anywhere where you have the skin occluded especially with a tape that to be put on your skin you certainly can not only develop irritation but you can get like acne breakouts now people wear these during the day i think it would be really hard to camouflage them under makeup i think a lot of people end up putting the tapes like here where you can lift oh i kind of like that maybe i should start taping my face um to just kind of lift up in the past most people that i have seen doing this seem to understand the fact that this is really just like a temporary makeup thing but now they taking it so far as to be sleeping with these i suppose it could also give you kind of a visual representation of what a facelift might achieve for you depending on how the tape is placed the other claim i your face and going to sleep with that can help decrease the creasing on your skin from like your pillowcase and that sort of thing i because yeah sure wherever you have the tape it but it doesn going to crease to some extent when you roll over sleeping on your back can definitely reduce creasing and you guys know i have that sleep and glow pillow it really does provide a nice supportive cradle to the sides of the face preventing twisting but i don if anything it can be kind of hard to get the tape to lie down flat and not be creasing your skin so that seems like a pretty big stretch to me that taping your face would prevent puffiness and sleep creases the real way though to prevent sagging and loss of elasticity is to protect your skin from the sun and healthy lifestyle factors that being said i think going to sleep with tape on your face can get in the way of a good night something you should be doing and i mean if you want to for the cosmetic temporary lifting effect prior to makeup sure do your thing just know it can be irritating but uh it do like those silicone patches though and i do find them effective for offering a temporary wrinkle smoothing effect but tick tock doesn you guys seen this trend taking it a step further where people are taping their mouths shut before they go to sleep i we taping your mouth shut before bed is really important to your breathing to your face structure if you can imagine that i on it but i get mine specifically on amazon if you look up mouth tape though you x-shaped ones which i really can i like this one because you can cut it to any size and you can reuse it a bunch of times it doesn the mouth i really really like it and it has completely transformed my sleep when i started using it mouth taping mouth taping try it you can get the zombies on sleep with it it prevents you mouth breathing all night you sleep you it and you do have to get used to it but try it out and i can share the techniques and the benefits if you it mouth breathing tape so i i mindful of my breathing during the day like i and correcting it which is great anyways i and then update in the morning the tape worked again i want to continue to do it i might actually get like some mouth tape eventually though but i really enjoying like breathing through my nose and not waking up with my mouth like dry and they claim that it you just to breathe through your nose and not mouth breathe now breathing through your mouth it can it your nose your nose is really good at filtering the air whereas your mouth doesn lubricate the air a little bit better what do i think about this mouth taping trend i think it ridiculous and potentially harmful to be clear they make special mouth tape i know uh there can buy that but other people are being like oh i plenty of tape in the in the drawer i just gonna use the tape i have don dangerous you know potentially very irritating harmful uh other types of tape you know the adhesive can be very irritating it funny to me because one of the most common complaints that i hear from patients uh is that they get irritation from adhesives and bandages i mean it really common actually and now there this trend on the internet of taping your face it okay uh but as far as the claim that going to help you breathe through your nose um better way to do that is to during the day when you uh to do some breathing exercises where you focus on breathing through your nose trying to be more more mindful of breathing through your nose and then when you go to sleep you more inclined to breathe through your nose now why might somebody mouth breathe there underlying health problems that could lead you to mouth breathe perhaps you have seasonal allergies or some kind of obstruction in the nose like on the nasal polyp make you making it more difficult to get in air if you have that type of underlying health problem and you go taping your mouth shut there is a significant risk that you going to get enough oxygen and that has serious health consequences hypo that hypoxia lack of oxygen can lead to high blood pressure and a myriad of other health problems the other claim i that by taping your mouth shut it going to help you not snore one of the reasons people snore is actually sleep apnea they get blockage of the passage of air episodically and that them snore so if you are snoring rather than taping your mouth shut i definitely encourage you to see your health care provider your primary care doctor for evaluation perhaps you may need to undergo what find out if you have sleep apnea sleep apnea is pretty serious actually similar to what i was saying earlier about lack of oxygen and good quality air when you sleep when you have sleep apnea that can lead to high blood pressure and a myriad of health problems cardiovascular disease headaches daytime sleepiness it is not something to take lightly so if you snore you should definitely talk to your doctor it there be you know given to you it insurance typically and there you go so don the snoring definitely tell your doctor if you are snoring likewise if you have seasonal allergies the nasal mucosa may be kind of swollen inflamed and as a result you through your nose you mouth breathing talk to your doctor get your allergies addressed if you have nasal polyps you know maybe you need to see in your nose and throat doctor or something like that for evaluation and get it fixed but the problem with the mouth taping is like i said you not getting enough good quality air in you can have you know problems with oxygenation i imagine that it probably is quite disruptive to the quality of sleep that you get and that in and of itself a poor night definitely set you up for failure it associated with a lot of health problems and injury because when you deprived you are not as sharp it of like being it under the influence of alcohol actually and i would imagine you would just feel very very anxious having your mouth tape shut is it just me that seems like it would be really anxiety inducing i can imagine going to sleep with your mouth tape shut not to mention the tape under occlusion there that can be very irritating to your mouth although i will say this many people drool in their sleep the saliva collects around their mouth and that can cause a lot of irritation angular chelitas but i don shut is the right approach instead just try and train yourself to sleep on your back if you are getting a lot of drool collecting around the mouth just put a little petrolatum like vaseline serum healing ointment my favorite in the corners of your mouth so that that saliva which can be pretty irritating doesn breakdown of the skin and subsequent colonization with the yeast that are naturally present in your mouth and you get those white patches angular kelitis be pretty painful and uncomfortable [Music] if you are looking for just a quick easy way to improve your health these are literally all of the benefits of nose breathing if you snore try mouth-taking if you constantly getting cavities or gum disease or tooth decay try mouth taping if your immune system isn taping if you wake up feeling like crap or feeling hungover without the alcohol try mouth taping literally [Music] have you guys ever taped your face i saw a youtube video i can was a while ago of an older woman who used some of these facial this facial taping thing and i have to say the results were pretty impressive she didn doing it on tik tok where you like sleep with it she just did it prior to putting on her makeup and she concealed the tapes underneath her hair and it actually was pretty pretty impressive the results that she got it was like this halo thing that went around her head almost like a headband i want to say and she taped she taped the sides of her face and it gave a very nice lifting effect and it actually looked very natural it didn look you know like she had tape on her face i actually have seen people on tik tok using like regular tape that you would use to tape a package on their mouth and that irritating all right so obviously you shouldn think it is potentially problematic is it the worst thing i tock sadly no there are a lot more harmful things out there but man that app stuff just takes off sometimes i think the people who create these things i think they do people i can never really tell if they know maybe they attention do they honestly believe some of these things work uh you would be baffled by the things that just suddenly become popularized but you have to be really careful when it comes to these apps and attractive people because i find that some of the biggest grifters on on these apps i think they successful because they are attractive and attractive people are more likely to be believable it just i guess human nature attractive people are often more likely to be hired even if they are less qualified than the competing applicant and now with tick tock we have all these filters it you know make yourself even more you know quote-unquote conventionally attractive and seriously mislead people easily and i i think it from time to time uh throughout social media like well i would believe you if you didn like this well yeah when i see those comments it no self-awareness as to how malleable you are if all it takes is like perfect teeth to make you believe in something nowadays with all the cosmetic procedures it alter your face to meet these weird beauty standards that people come to expect as a form of credibility which is really odd so it becomes a lot more a lot easier to manipulate people with sales tactics and layer on to that quite literally all of these filters then you have a scenario where people can just say complete bs and people are not thinking critically about the stuff that they are seeing online it things that are spread around the latest thing it has nothing to do with skin care but i thought i would mention it it vinegar and seltzer water together as a drink i haven but they it tastes like coca-cola and come on man you know it doesn probably tastes like watered down balsamic vinegar i guess that seems relatively harmless aside from you know if you put too much vinegar and you suppose that could be too acidic for the enamel of your teeth but how it compares acidity wise to coke i coke so yeah i mean it that people come up with on these apps so long story short no i don taping up your face yes some of these patches like the frownies the co patches they can have a temporary wrinkle smoothing effect by trapping water in the skin and reducing trans epidermal water loss but taping your face up i mean it that lifestyle factors like eating a healthy diet getting good sleep the boring stuff protecting your skin from the sun not taping your face up in a strategic way with kinesiology tape man that when i saw that i was just like if you have problems with mouth breathing at night talk to your doctor rule out an underlying medical cause don start scotch tape in your mouth shut let me know in the comments what you guys think i had to comment on this because i are tagging me in their posts but if you guys enjoyed this video on the end slate i reacted to some tick tock nonsense so check that one out but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen and subscribe i guys tomorrow [Music]

FDA WARNS AGAINST SKIN TAG & MOLE REMOVAL PRODUCTS ?? DERMATOLOGIST @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IiUvv_F2Ho	Dr Day	well hey guys the fda has issued another warning against a type of skin care product that i to stay away from for some time both myself and other dermatologists strongly caution against the use of this type of product it can cause a lot of harm we going to get into that in this video but before we do make sure you are subscribed to this youtube channel if you like skincare from a dermatologist i upload content here daily hit the bell notification and let you know when my videos go live or consider following me over on tick tock or instagram i those platforms too so if you like the more short form videos head on over there and check those out as we go through life it is inevitable that eventually you kind of bump that you do not like on your skin and as we acquire wisdom as i like to put it aka age these things are more likely seborrheic keratoses people like to refer to them as the barnacles on the ship of life they are these waxy brown to tan stuck on warty looking things they can happen pretty much anywhere on the body some people make a lot of them they they are a nuisance for patients and they can become irritated if stuff rubs up against them sometimes they fall off and then come right back i mean they bother people they want them taken care of another nuisance bump which is the skin tag let me know in the comments if you have skin tags that you are tired of they are on a little stock they kind of hang just like a little blob of skin they often common in the underarm area around the neck and they are a nuisance i mean you this little skin tag there that keeps getting caught they bleed they become irritated if you wear necklaces and you have a lot of them around your neck then you get caught up in the necklaces some people even develop them on the eyelids it can get in the way of your vision they are a pain for patients and they want them taken care of but herein lies the problem getting in to see a dermatologist is not always the easiest and most straightforward thing and it can be cost prohibitive these skin bumps while they are a pain in a nuisance they are benign meaning not cancerous they life-threatening and the treatment of them for the most part is considered cosmetic meaning your insurance is not going to cover the cost to remove them so here we now have a population of people dealing with bumps that are annoying so that is a perfect audience to sell something nonsensical to here in comes the at-home skin tag removal kits if you go on amazon you can find tons of these with rave reviews by the way who knows if they are paid reviews or not you always have to be aware of that as a side note on amazon not everything you read online is the truth so buyer beware but speaking of buyer beware the fda has issued a warning against these products these at home skin tag removers mole removers because they have the potential to cause harm and they are not fda approved for the treatment of these issues i honestly don these products even can exist marketing themselves in the way that they do as like at home mole removers or at home skin tag removers because they basically making treatment claims and the fda doesn like that i mean in order to make a drug or treatment claim you actually have to be an fda approved over-the-counter drug or medication for example a two percent salicylic acid face wash can make the drug claim that it is an acne treatment and that two percent salicylic acid it has to be clearly labeled as the active ingredient outside of all the other ingredients in the product these products that you can buy online these at home skin tag removal tools or whatever first of all they don ingredients that are evidence based or fda approved for the treatment of these skin issues and they a treatment claim that they can treat a skin condition skin tags just ask any dermatologist there is a good chance that in a given year they see multiple patients who come into their office who have harmed themselves using these types of products they often contain very high percentages or very high strength of hydroxy acids like salicylic acid which is not a bad ingredient but remember it oftentimes these at home mole remover treatments have very high percentages so patients can develop not only bad skin irritation chemical burns they can develop scarring and worse skin infection requiring oral antibiotics to treat if you antibiotics they can disrupt your digestive health it want to have to go on probably one of the deadliest risks though in my mind with these at home mole or skin tag treatment tools that you can buy online or i think you can even buy them sometimes in the store is that not everything on your skin that looks like just a skin tag or a mole is that benign you could actually be targeting a skin cancer like melanoma people commonly think of melanoma as like dark black strange looking mole that lot of melanomas do look like that that of checking your skin looking for changing moles that are asymmetrical have your regular borders a bunch of different colors uh changing in you know diameter doing self skin checks at home looking for signs that a mole may be maybe worrisome maybe even possibly a melanoma but not all melanomas follow this abcde rule that you have melanomas that are look just like skin tags you have melanomas that don abnormal color some that are referred to as amylonic so melanoma really is quite a chameleon of a skin cancer not to mention melanoma is kind of an umbrella term for a variety of different types of cancers superficial spreading melanoma lentigo malignant melanoma acryl-antigenous melanoma these are a lot of actually very different cancers under the umbrella of melanoma blah blah blah all of that jargon to let you know that what you might think is a skin tag or a benign mole could in fact be a deadly skin cancer and by using a product like this it remove the very top portion of it but it doesn down in the dermis that be there so by using a product like this it can actually obscure the appearance of a potentially deadly skin cancer and making it harder to diagnose if you do eventually make your way into a doctor office to have it looked at not only that but it can obscure the pathology and that actually do remove it and look at it under the microscope to make the diagnosis things can look kind of abnormal and it can be harder to diagnose and it can be much more difficult to treat anytime there is a delay and diagnosis of a skin cancer they to put out roots take over go down deeper these are things you do not want like i said these types of products they typically have a very high concentration of salicylic acid very high concentrations of salicylic acid can actually be very harmful especially if you body where the skin is more delicate like the neck where skin tags often appear or you armpits where you have skin on skin occlusion it the irritancy potential of salicylic acid is much greater they come in the form of gels liquids sticks ointments and there are a variety of like devices to pick them off zap them cut them and that comes with a risk of bleeding infection and scarring there are a variety of like more natural marketed products that can be equally if not more dangerous which can really cause some bad skin problems burns etc because it has become so cost prohibitive for people to seek out specialist care at least in especially in the realm of dermatology there are a variety of otherwise harmless things that occur on the skin that bother people whether it be cosmetically or maybe they just become irritated skin tags and seborrheic keratoses and moles are common causes of this frustration and so people just decide to take matters into their own hands they say why not i it off myself it desperation i totally understand that because these things are frustrating to deal with but i the fda is warning you now that the risks with these products can lead to far more harm than good there are so many evidence-based established safe and effective treatments that we can do in the office to remove these and plus we can make sure that they are you know we can reassure you that they are a benign skin lesion like a skin tag or a separate keratosis and if it is something that we suspect maybe have some suspicious signs of potentially a skin cancer well then we have the opportunity to intervene and make the diagnosis and by treating it earlier then you have better chance of of it not coming back and causing problems for you so those are the benefits of seeing a dermatologist and having it treated properly less likely to go on to cause serious problems like infection scarring anytime i make a video like this pointing out the risks and potential harm of at home treatments i always get comments from people that are like oh just you know reiterating what big pharma wants you to say which i comes to skin tags and seborrheic keratoses trust me big pharma does not care there these and so like there in you avoiding those from a pharmaceutical industry perspective they could care less um honestly there not a drug that treats these so that this argument that there cautioning against things with established side effects just doesn make sense i think if you down the route of trying to take matters into your own hands it that are associated with that for example you know some people still choose to ride a motorcycle without a helmet um despite ample warnings that that is not a good idea but it doesn like stop telling people you should wear a helmet or stop you know promoting safe motorcycle behaviors um yeah i so i don rebuttals that i see in the comments all right you guys so friendly reminder for myself in the fda not to use these at home skin tag removal kits mole removers they can cause a lot more harm than good including infection bleeding scarring and potentially delay in the treatment of a skin cancer and you don because a delay in treatment not a good thing all right let me know in the comments so if you deal with things like skin tags and seborrheic keratoses have you ever thought about buying one of these hopefully this video discourages you from it but if you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen and subscribe i guys tomorrow bye [Music] you	Success
KIM KARDASHIAN'S SKIN CARE LINE ?? MY HONEST THOUGHTS ON SKKN BY KIM @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoypeicZK9w	Dr Day	Kim Kardashian is coming out with a skincare line is anyone surprised I certainly am not as a matter of fact I am actually more surprised that it has taken her this long to come out with a skincare line she has launched other endeavors in the beauty space she had a makeup line perfume she launches a variety of different brands not all of them are a flop though her clothing line for example skims it should say that and well received so what do I think of this skincare skin by Kim skk n by Kim and there already been a lot of controversy about the name of her brand because there are two other companies that have a very very similar name which is trademarked so there about her choice of name skk n plus skin or skin plus which has been around since 2018 and Tra filed for trademark in March of 2021 and then the other one is skn by LH so these brands are not too happy because they for their company and now all of a sudden Kim Kardashian is going to swoop in with her skincare brand and overrun Google search engines and their brands are going to get lost in in the flood of online searches and things so understandably they are upset I don know much beyond that anyways what exactly is slated to arrive in these products is it just another celebrity skincare gimmick it going to be hard to tell is this going to be a flop or success she to be coming out with nine products and she claims that they have been heavily tested on a variety of human volunteers of a variety of skin types skin tones textures she claims they suitable for all maturity levels fine for both men and women the packaging at least what I can make of it looks very monotone kind of sleek spelt not over the top interestingly the products will be refillable and the refills are about 15% less than the actual products themselves which is good because all nine products together are $630 and you might think like who is going to pay that much money somebody might I don actually end up dabbling and at least a few of these products just to kind of see I don stick though I don going to stick with these Kim doesn really care that it wants it to be expensive first of all she probably knows that she can get away with charging this much she knows that there are some people out there who will pay this much the price point is not of a concern to her she doesn people think it her mind she probably assumes that they there who will buy it regardless she makes statements that suggest she feels that she has put a lot of work into this it brand I don says she lot of people in the industry many people will say why should I buy skincare products from Kim Kardashian she dermatologist so just because someone a dermatologist and has a skincare line it doesn it is any better than anything else that you could get on the market just because someone necessarily mean that the products are a cash grab although in my experience more often than not they kind of are so interested to see what these products are that she comes out with she says I think the credibility of knowing that I got the best advice ever and the best formulations from some of the people that I just respect the most that of a nebulous rebuttal to The credibility question anyways all right what are the products she cleanser a toner an exfoliator a hyaluronic acid serum a vitamin C serum a face cream an eye cream oil drops and a night oil I imagine the oil drops are probably going to be something that you just add a few drops to your moisturizer to boost uh you know the emolient effect I guess and enhance the radiance that you achieve from the moisturizer if she comes out with like a rose hip oil or hoba seed oil for $90 you guys if people fall for that and buy that oh man just go just go to the health food store and you can buy hoba seed oil it yeah I predict that it to be something like that maybe it scented fragranced and you know people think that it something I don going to do a hydrating toner or a toner with some kind of skin brightening active ingredient in it that interesting to see the exfoliator I imagine is going to uh contain glycolic and or lactic acid which are alpha hydroxy acids marketing would have you believe that you constantly need to be exfoliating your skin you really don mean truthfully aside from uh certain dry skin condition or with age you know the skin turns over a little bit more slowly that can lead to kind of buildup of dry skin but simply cons being consistent with cleansing moisturizing and protecting your skin from the Sun it can help with moisture retention and barrier function and ultimately that facilitates the natural turnover of your skin the importance of exfoliating as part of a skincare routine is very much overstated now for people who have hyperpigmentation incorporating an exfoliant a few times a week I depending on how the product is formulated can help in accelerating the rate of clearance of that hyperpigmentation but to what extent everyone needs to use it yeah and then the hyaluronic acid serum this I mean I don would plunk down in the ballpark of $90 for a hyaluronic acid serum hyaluronic acid uh I think it misunderstood ingredients as of late a lot of people are you know worried that it a product is form formulated properly hyaluronic acid shouldn water loss out of the skin uh if you use it along with a moisturizer to seal in the hydration it really shouldn to more evaporative water loss hyaluronic acid really just kind of helps pull water into the top Shum corneum and that can have a r a temporary wrinkle smoothing effect but you do not need to spend big bucks she also has a vitamin C serum coming out of course vitamin C is one of the most popular ingredients um that people look at look for in skincare I before it is not an essential and the problem with vitamin C serums is they tricky to formulate according to her she thinks that hers is going to be a good one comment below do you think Kim vitamin C serum is going to have L ascorbic acid or is it going to have one of the stabilized vitamin C derivatives which I research to support their efficacy in terms of improving collagen synthesis let me know if I were a betting person I would be willing to bet she is going to do one of the stabilized forms because ascorbic acid not only is it tricky to formulate so that it actually gets into the skin But It stable and it can oxidize and lead to discoloration and consumers don that it causes problems so I would imagine she stabilized derivatives like Magnesium escor phosphate maybe or maybe she use sodium escor phosphate you know there is some evidence that that may be helpful for people who have oily skin or acne prone skin we shall see the face cream she like a nighttime moisturizer and she an eye cream I if you you have to have an eye cream it is a rule if you don you Choice she held off on having an eye cream for a long time and then finally she came out with one and people were pissed at her but there was so much consumer demand it want to do do you want to have a skincare brand or do you want to uphold some kind of a ethos it stay competitive in a skincare Market without at least an eye cream the oil drops I already mentioned I think it going to be the kind of thing that they tell you to just add a few drops to your moisturizer if you extra dry skin or maybe if you experiencing some peeling with their exfoliant in the beginning they probably tell you to boost the moisturizer with some expensive oil drops and then a night oil a lot of people like to incorporate a facial oil into their skincare routine oils they smooth everything out they but they don so using an oil on its own isn necessarily the best approach to moisturizing the skin you want to use a moisturizing cream that has exclusives humectants to help hydrate but herline wants you to use both so there wonder what oil she will use for the facial oil it of different oils and she like heavily promote one of the oils maybe something that is more unique or less wellknown and then there will be some basic oils in the oil like a hoba seed oil sunflower seed oil these are not bad or anything but I my mind how is she going to Market a facial oil and a mar I mean these products that she vitamin C serum eye cream face cream uh cleanser the market for these products is saturated so how is she going to set hers apart is it just going to be this packaging and the refills and her face I don I don brand alive she makes it seem like they the consistency of these so it be something like how much how can a face cream be so strikingly different that the face cream you using you of hers I mean what for you to drop whatever facial moisturizer you are using and go to hers it seems like seems like the consistency here better be like money cuz that what you know in her mind this is not an exorbitant price point which I think is a bit out of touch with the realities of our life these days with inflation everybody her $630 for nine products or $90 for a Serum is nothing because have you guys looked back ever at what types of skincare products she uses they are not cheap she uses some of the most expensive products on the market her skincare routine and the products that she uses in total in her bathroom allegedly she has about $4,500 worth of products she uses this $525 um product from geran their longevity concentrate which just a bunch of fragrance and humectant uh she also uses the creme de la mer which is really popular scented moisturizer I reviewed for you guys in the past it it $315 she uses Barbara sturm acid which goes for $300 man if you are spending $300 on sodium hyaluronate we need to talk we need to talk if you are spending $300 on a dropper bottle of sodium hyaluronate what are you doing with your money what are you doing with your money I know it you want but come on come on you could grow an Empire with all that hyaluronic acid so in her mind she guys a deal on her products only charging you $630 um and they can save on the refills by not having you buy the full package I wonder if they Were 3 or 4 years ago I would have predicted 100% they fragrance but there is a larger consumer demand these days for fragrance-free products that being said many people who like to drop coin on expensive skincare Brands like that self-care or whatever they really like the fragrance and I think that is likely going to capture people who are already using Lam mer people who are already using that augustinus Bader cream people who are already using the truth serums and all of those super expensive luxury skincare Brands which at the end of the day are not actually going to change anything about your skin in any appreciable way any differently than any basic moisturizer that you could probably buy you know at the dollar store but people really like their skin care they like the textures the consistencies the scents you name it that for is the experience they like the packaging they like The Prestige of having the look of it on their bathroom counter nine products seems like kind of a lot to me y two to three plus one category of a skincare routine keeping it simple but uh you know she is marketing it in a way that like this is what you need you need to focus this kind of energy into your skincare routine in order to look like me which is a bit you know manipulative because let money and she gets a lot of custom attention different treatments she one who popularized the vampire facial and all of that and let skincare line is lacking and one of the most important pieces of any skincare routine and that is sun protection now I know that creating a sunscreen is not easy and it of legislative hurdles testing that you have to go through it expensive to come out with a sunscreen so I don brands for not having a sunscreen but when you her financial backing I do find it a little bit suspicious that she doesn have a sunscreen uh maybe she out with one later on if the line continues to be fruitful which brings me to my next point is this just a quick cash grab or is it something like her like her shapewear line that may may take off and be something that people actually buy and take seriously I going to predict that it fizzle out and not because sure brand necessarily will be bad or the products will be bad or or whatever I just think that the consumer interest is not quite there and it nothing to do with her actually it really just that I think that consumers it attention long enough to be something that is sustained I think the launch she and for her you know which is billions of dollars probably but thereafter are people actually going to be purchasing the refills I doubt it I I doubt that people especially people who are in the luxury skincare that like luxurious skincare I doubt they going to break up with their Lam mer creams to start using her product I I going to be the case uh Maybe I uh but I the case because Lam mer has been around for a long time and has held people interest for a long long long time I doubt they abandon that and go to her product brand is backed by the beauty conglomerate Cody so I what extent the R&D is going to be there for some kind of innovative peptide serum or something like that one might expect from her especially since she seems keen on using that $500 $525 Gan product which has peptides in it so you know it that unfolds but like I said I really don consumer attention enough not only do I doubt they their current luxury skincare products I doubt new people are suddenly going to you know bail on their skincare routine and start shelling out this premium price point I guess the one thing that could keep people coming back to her is if these products like she claims really do have a more cosmetically pleasing texture something that people enjoy applying to the skin that actually is key because you can have a product that is actually fantastic the ingredient is wonderful but if the formulation is not comfortable or pleasing to the consumer they going to be put off by different textures some people just like trying out new skincare products all the time you know they stuff so I have I have no doubt that people will buy this mostly out of intrigue and some people may actually enjoy the products but I going to keep coming back and repurchasing and I can say all that honestly confidently without having any knowledge of what the actual ingredients are aside from the types of products I don don myself I will still have the same prediction that this is how this is going to go in my opinion this maybe would have been more successful if she had tried it in lie of the makeup or the perfume because I think her makeup brand came out maybe when people were less interested in makeup around the lockdown time that would have been the time to get into skin care now I think people are less interested in skincare than they were say in 2020 and I think it going to be harder for this to take off in popularity her whole brand though is basically selling her appearance um and she kind of goes to great length with her appearance doing all sorts of procedures and treatments and you know she always kind of is pushing the boundaries so we shall see how this goes but anyways those are my thoughts let me know in the comments what your predictions are for this brand what type of vitamin C serum do you think she come out with do you think this will last or will it just be a quick cash grab and then we about it again if you guys like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow bye

SUNLESS TANNER CHANGE| EU RESTRICTS DHA ?? @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-T84TmtwPE	Dr Day	well hey guys i comments across my videos please discuss the new eu regulations on sunless tanners are they safe are they banned so that about in this video if you welcome my name is andrea i certified dermatologist i upload skincare content here on youtube if that subscribe hit the bell notification that alerts you when my videos go live i also over on tick tock and instagram pretty regularly so consider following me there as well sunless tanner dihydroxyacetone is the active ingredient in sunless tanners dihydroxyacetone it from glycerol and when you put it on the skin it interacts with the protein keratin amino acids and keratin proteins in the very top layer of the skin undergoes something called the may yard reaction to produce brown pigments known as melanoidins and that is what gives the skin a brown to caramel tan color without requiring you to expose yourself to the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation this was actually first discovered as an accident scientists spilled this on the skin they noticed hey i turned my skin brown and so later it was pioneered into sunless tanning products back in the 50s one of the first sunless tanning products that came out this is a historical point was around 1959 it was called mantan it was an aftershave lotion and that was so popular that they made like 20 million in sales in the first six months which for 1959 was a pretty hefty chunk of change and after that a lot of other companies you know followed suit creating different types of sunless tanning products at the time they were not as sophisticated as they are today it went on very streaky left the skin very orange but people still really like that so this ingredient it has been used in sunless tanning products for a good long while now and it is very very safe one of the benefits actually of sunless tanners is that you don to uv to get that brown pigment color that you for and so it deters people from choosing either to sunbathe or to go in a tanning bed which one trip to the tanning bed elevates your risk of skin cancers including the deadly melanoma substantially tanning beds give you a really really really intense dose of deadly uva rays that really just destroy your skin so this is a much better option totally safe to apply to the skin in terms of dermatology patients who have the skin condition vitiligo it autoimmune attack against your pigment cells you get patches of skin that are deep pigmented a lot of patients with vitiligo enjoy using sunless tanners to camouflage the patches of vitiligo and one thing you may not be aware of about sunless tanners is that they actually can offer a little bit of protection against certain long wavelengths of uva rays that come from the sun and those long wavelengths penetrate really deeply they damage collagen and a lot of sunscreens don rays so well with the exception of the new yuvamune 400 from la roche posay their new filter but you know prior to that sunscreens they can only block up to a certain point of the uva wavelengths but we discovered a while ago that dha and stimulus tanners can actually help add some additional protection against those longer wavelengths and you may be like so what who cares but for people with certain photosensitive skin conditions namely polymorphous light eruption something called actinic parigo and certain medications can make you sensitive to the sun this has always been something that has been of interest as an adjuvant to sun protection for these patients because many sunscreens don protect against the rays from the sun that do trigger those diseases for example a three percent dha cream has been shown to increase the sun tolerance of patients with polymorphous light eruption anywhere from 2.4 to 13.5 fold and i know a lot of you guys have pmle or polymorphous light eruption it pretty it can be pretty debilitating depending on you know the severity of your skin condition also has been shown to be helpful for patients who deal with solar urticaria what the heck is that urticaria is a medical term for hives um and certain certain types of hives are triggered by uh exposures i about aquagenic urticaria basically you come in your skin comes in contact with water and that triggers hives but you also can develop hives when you are exposed to uv rays and a lot of times it come through glass so it you hives and getting um sunscreens that adequately protect against those rays is actually quite challenging so sunless tanner with dhea is isn attractive adjuvant for these patients so all that to say it ingredient to apply to the skin it can be irritating some people develop a contact dermatitis to it but it harmful ingredient i the internet that it you know accelerates skin aging that is absolutely a myth if anything because of its ability to offer some protection against those long wavelengths of uva it may actually you know ultimately have some sort of anti-aging benefit although that has not been substantiated so what now with the eu then that clicked on this video to learn about it u.s dha has been regulated for a long time as a colorant so it has to meet certain standards for purity but in the eu up until this point it has not really been regulated but recently the eu has introduced some restrictions around the use of dha and sunless tanners it as scary as it sounds trust me it probably not going to even affect whatever product that you are currently using if you live in the eu and you like to use a sunless tanning product basically the scientific committee of consumer safety has deemed dha safe to apply to the skin in concentrations up to ten percent and also has deemed it safe in um and hair dyes up to six point two five percent that being said is not that commonly used in hair dyes at least as my understanding anyway so the eu has been like okay well let that we limit it to no more than 10 percent in sunless tanning products and no more than 6.25 percent in in hair dyes which you know like i said it anyways so it really not as scary as it sounds they basically just limiting the maximum amount that is allowed to be sold in products sunless tanning products but it safe for human use up until a maximum threshold not much is really changing other than the fact that there is a rule now and the reason i say this is because most sunless tanning products on the market they don dha they usually typically you know three to five percent max because higher percentages end up giving you that orangy streaky look they go on a lot more streaky higher percentages typically are going to be found in products that are offering more of an instant tan products with concentrations of dha greater than 10 they kind of marketed as a more faster onset of tan or a deeper tan so the deeper the darker coloration of the tan is going to be higher percentages so that may impact some sunless tanner products that use a very high percentage but they typically it percent especially um in more of the gradual tanning products it to be as high as as greater than 10 so all that to say you know there may be a few brands a few products here and there where the companies have to reformulate them and if you that offer that gives a very deep tan almost instantly you may notice that that has been tweaked changed and it same product but it one thing i want to make clear though just because they put this regulation in place this restriction on the maximum amount don anything about the safety of dha it really doesn basically okay we know this ingredient is safe it but what we ten percent in the levon products it six point two five percent of the hair care products so let that that it have higher percentages are unsafe it it we don those haven of products have been used with no evidence of any harm to human health so if you use products with high percentages of dha don this legislation it because they cancer causing there misrepresentation out there about how legislation around cosmetic ingredients what it actually means and as a result it can end up fear-mongering and dha is one of those ingredients that often does get get demonized i fan of it i don although i dabble in it from time to time i don too lazy and b i tan but i do like the idea of having that potentially that long wave uva protection on board in some fashion because very you know sunscreens aside from the new uv immune filter from la roche posay they don wavelengths in the u.s dha use is restricted to external application only uh it mucous membranes so the eyes the lips inside the mouth and the reason for that is that the fda has not received any safety data from those routes only from the external application so don now if you go in a spray tan booth make sure you know spray tan booths or whatever they should be offering you protection for your eyes for your lips and to make sure that you don spray tan but totally safe to be applying to the skin and i actually encourage people who enjoy having a tan i really do encourage you to use sunless tanners and protect your skin from the sun with sunscreen and sun protective clothing limiting your time outdoors don because tanning from the sun or from a tanning bed that is a form of skin injury if you like the way that injured skin looks get it from a sunless tanner totally safe to do that doesn doesn wrinkles nothing like that so much safer so please do not you know hear this new legislation and misinterpret it as that this ingredient is unsafe it totally safe it have to be restrictions in place for any ingredient and products in terms of a maximum concentration and route those kinds of things but it anything really about this being an unsafe ingredient so i want to make that clear now i mentioned earlier that dha has been shown to offer some protection against those long wavelengths of uva but i want to make it clear that this that using a sunless tanner is not a substitute for sunscreen it doesn offer broad spectrum protection against all the uv rays that come from the sun still need to wear sunscreen over the sunless tanner and you need to also be wearing your sun protective clothing not staying out too long during midday hours especially when uv rays are most intense this new restriction went into effect in january but i think a lot of people have been asking me more about it recently because maybe it coming up people are more interested in using sunless tanning products and they were back in january if you used a sunless tanning product last year that produced a very deep tan or one that produced a deep tan pretty quickly you may notice a difference in it the thing about sunless tanning products is that they don reveal the percentage of dha in the product i mean that proprietary formula so it very difficult for you to know which ones have changed and which ones haven but if you notice a difference in your product it may be that previously it had greater than 10 dha in it um but again brands they don of dha in their product they going to reveal that kind of trade secret stuff you know in the u.s dha it they in the sense of purity they a drug you know it over-the-counter medication so they don of it as you know an active ingredient they treatment for anything all right you guys let me know in the comments though do you guys use sunless tanners i i advocate for them i think they are great obviously they my mind to a uv tan which puts you at risk for premature skin aging and all sorts of skin cancers and i think they also do have some potential to offer a little bit of additional protection against those those long uva wavelengths that contribute to certain photosensitive conditions like polymorphous light eruption actinic parigo solar urticaria and perhaps even melasma hyperpigmentation i think they also are a great cosmetic for people who are just looking to camouflage skin conditions that lead to depigmentation like vitiligo let me know in the comments though if you guys use some and what brands do you use i in case i ever decide to start dabbling in it my experience is pretty limited with them to the jergens gradual tan product i always like that it works inexpensive but i know there are a ton others anyways i hope this video answered your questions about the eu on the percentage max of dha in sunless tanning products on the end slide i going to put my video talking about how dha does not lead to more accelerated skin aging that common myth on the internet so check that video out but if you like this one give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen and

SCAM ALERT ?? WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT YOUTUBE'S BOT PROBLEM ?? @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQn5LNkBpvw	Dr Day	well hey guys there is a serious problem going on my youtube channel right now that i need to warn you guys about and so i wanted to make a dedicated video explaining what the problem is and explaining how to identify it and how to avoid being harmed by it if you are new here welcome my name is andrea i board-certified dermatologist my content here on youtube is primarily skincare and hair care this video has nothing to do with skin care or hair care but if you are someone who watches youtube i encourage you to keep watching this video so you can learn about this issue because it doesn channel it on many channels what is the problem the problem is bot scam accounts now bots and scammers they are nothing new on youtube but i would say over the last six months to a year they have increasingly become more and more of an issue specifically one type of bot scam comment which is along the lines of hey guess what you have been selected to win my special giveaway just direct message me on telegraph or whatsapp or click this link and the problem is that these bot scam accounts use my image and some version of my name so it seems as though it a lot of you recognize that these are bot scam accounts i do worry that some of you out there may fall for this and inadvertently click on a link or message this bot and go down a rabbit hole where i don looking for i you know maybe it personal information just don with these comments and later in the video i recognize them and what to do about them when you see them but yeah this is a a major problem across youtube right now bot accounts are nothing new since the start of my channel there have been a series of flavors of different types of bots and scam accounts but this new thing of pretending to be me and trying to get my audience to engage in some kind of a third party messaging app or click on a link this is relatively new and it i see it on all kinds of channels on youtube it is actually a widespread and growing problem that is very difficult to control as a creator there really isn these accounts because they multiply like wildfire you can block as a creator you can block one of these accounts you can report one of these accounts but for every account there are a hundred more that come in and it to keep on track of these so the best i can do is make this video warning you guys and sharing with you how to recognize these accounts and what to do how you can report them so hopefully youtube will do something about them many youtubers myself included we do host giveaways from time to time i done many in the past and a lot of times these bot spam accounts will really infiltrate there because they want to fool the audience into thinking that they have won the giveaway that the youtuber is actually putting on i haven of those in a long time but regardless these comments they do still pop up across my videos and so whatever you do do not engage with these and don because god knows what the heck they are what the heck those links are going to take you to or take from you do not engage with these accounts while this is a widespread problem on youtube youtube been to just tell creators to use the comment moderation tools to block the accounts but this is not an effective intervention for reasons that i kind of mentioned earlier is that basically the tools that i have as a creator to moderate comments or i can report an account as spam and i can block that account but like i said these bot accounts they are there there are hundreds to two hundreds of thousands more ready and waiting to infiltrate more comments so it difficult and they come in in massive batches so for example i will step away from youtube for the night or whatever and then when i come back the next time i go to my comments section there they are again hundreds of thousands of them so this tool that youtube is relying on creators to use the comment moderation tool it is not effective for managing this problem it tool the comment moderation tools in youtube they order to effectively moderate this i mean you would have to be in the comments section round the clock of all of your videos and it possible to do that i have so many videos on my platform i uploading content to youtube daily since 2016. so for me to have my eyes on every single comment across all of those videos in order to find these bot accounts there the day to dedicate to doing that it not physically possible and for everyone that i block and report 10 000 more are going to appear so here are some signs to clue you into the fact that you are dealing with one of these bot comments and not me and the first of all first thing i see a fair amount is that the wording is very uncharacteristic of how i would speak or the grammar is poor and you know kind of just not clear what it is that they talking about the second thing is that i will never ask anyone on a youtube comment to direct message me to one of these third-party apps if i were to ask my audience to direct message me it would likely be to direct message me on instagram not on one of these other like whatsapp another clue are strange links um putting links in your comments usually will get your comment uh not blocked but binned into some a for review file that i have on my on the back end so when i look at comments i have comments that are you know published immediately and then i have a separate tab of comments that are held for review meaning i have to approve them in order for them to show up and if you leave a comment with a link youtube will automatically put that comment into the file for review somehow a lot of these bot accounts somehow are overcoming that i don you see me sharing a link and asking you to click on it in order to win a prize that is not me one so one major theme which i touched on here with these accounts is that they claim that you have won some kind of prize or giveaway the other claim that i some sort of investment strategy whether it be bitcoin or some other financial investment strategy i am not going to be giving out financial advice you guys that is not me i would never randomly just comment to you guys about an investment opportunity that is definitely a bot account right there and then the other one which actually has been a problem on my channel since like the very first youtube video i uploaded back in 2016 and continues to be a problem no matter how often i report reach out to youtube directly is bought accounts that don pretend to be me they pretend to be just a random person on the internet commenting on my videos and they claim that they have discovered a cure so for example there is a really common bot set of bots that claim i call them the herpes bots they you just contact this doctor or go to this doctor got the cure for herpes there for herpes so don either they into some kind of scam and they forbidden on youtube but they pretend to be just an average joe commenting on the videos they don image or likeness or or my name they just pretend to be a person saying i had i they usually go along the lines of i been suffering with this problem for so many years but i xyz for providing me the cure definitely check out their youtube channel and like or they those are bots so the i call them the herpes bots because they usually are claiming to have a cure for herpes they really heavily hit any videos where i talking about a viral infection or a viral rash my video on cold sores is packed with these bot accounts i can keep up with it every day there are hundreds of new comments from these boxing bot accounts on that particular video on cold sores and my recent video talking about the rash of monkey pox has attracted the herpes bots as well um yeah don they google something weird and that will probably take you to a page that selling some kind of a you know scam so don but the one that is really you know right now more of a widespread issue that is i think not as obvious about and that i worried that people will engage with are these are these bots that are pretending to be me and you know using some version of my name and are promising you know that you won a prize or a giveaway if you only contact them at this number or at this link that is not me whatsoever and i worry that they might be trying to get your information do not engage with these the other clue that it is a bot account is that my comments comments from me when i reply to your comments there to my name that on youtube the scammer accounts they don thing i accounts that is not very characteristic of me is they will use a lot of strange fonts unique fonts that i don don you know type in the computer your my reply and the same font that everybody else has is what i have so if it kind of different fonts that is a clue that you account as well so those are some signs now here i haven in a while but if you are watching a video where the youtuber is hosting a giveaway pay very careful attention to the details surrounding the giveaway what the youtuber says is going to go on as far as how to enter the giveaway and how the winner will be notified because those types of videos are hit the hardest by these bot accounts because they already see it as an opportunity to scam you into thinking that you won what the youtuber is talking about pay very careful attention youtubers are unlikely to i mean i can but it randomly comment to you that you had won a giveaway and asked you to whatsapp them without especially if they haven clarified that that happen just be very mindful any giveaway that you enter on youtube listen to what the actual instructions are for entering and for how the winner will be notified you can report a bot account as well and i extent that ends up being helpful i am very pessimistic because i trying to report and block these accounts i report and block these accounts in mass batches daily and i gotten nowhere the way to report them is to click on their name not any link that they are providing just their name and it will take you to their youtube page and then you about tab and you icon click on that flag icon and you can report user and then you just follow the instructions there to report it as spam as a side note you can also do this if you find that someone is leaving um comments that fall under the categories of harassment bullying abuse so you can report other types of comments in this way all right you guys so that is that is the problem right now again whatever you do do not go to the links that these accounts are trying to get you to click on don comment just report them if you have the time to i understand if you don honestly like i said i pessimistic that the reporting actually ends up doing anything because ultimately that for every bot that gets reported and blocked there are hundreds of thousands more that are ready and waiting to come in and they infiltrate all at once multiple across multiple videos across multiple comments to people so like i said as a creator there really no mechanism in place for me to actively control this issue and so definitely you know if you have the time report them but whatever you do do not engage with them don links or or answer their numbers or whatsapp them i will never ask you guys to whatsapp me i don never ask you all to do that and i will never ask you all you know i will never just randomly comment that you have won a giveaway unless i have announced it in a video that i not just gonna like randomly pick somebody and say that i giveaway i think that terms of service all the more reason you know if i have not announced a giveaway there is no giveaway you have won nothing the bot is fake you know it fake bot account when i do give giveaways i how the winner will be notified and i am very clear about how how the winner should go about contacting me it typically going to be very clear in the video it these bot accounts are claiming so if i do if and when i do a giveaway again in the future just pay very close attention to to my wording i appreciate you guys for bringing this to my attention um you know i i definitely have seen it and like i said i comments the best that i feel i can do to hopefully keep you guys from engaging in these is just make this video telling you you know that it is how to report it and not to engage with it i don going to go away so i i don else to do at this point but all that to say there you have one nothing there herpes all the the people who claim that some doctor on youtube cured them those are bots it they take my photo and my name and it not as simple as oh we your photo because these bots they just keep using your new photo the other thing i don use is ever 100 exactly the name that you see so my youtube name is dr dre all right you guys so hopefully this video is informative it it different types of channels if you take the time to report the comments i greatly appreciate that but i like i said i don helpful that ends up being in the long run hopefully youtube will do something about it in the future but i daily since 2016 and ah there have always been these bot comments and youtube creator to go about using the comment moderation tools to block and report but that doesn bot sphere out there for every bot that is reported and blocked there are hundreds of thousands more already and waiting let me know in the comments if you have ever seen these i know a lot of you guys have because you me you to let them know and they have notified me so i appreciate you guys taking the time to let me know i across my videos saying hey i think somebody is pretending to be you in an effort to scam your viewers really i appreciate you guys commenting that and i in any of these it it that you get um you know wanting you to talk about selling your house or whatever i mean it youtube sphere and you might say well just ignore them but unfortunately i do believe that a small proportion of people actually do end up falling for these scammers and it they didn using this tactic they would use something else so i do end up accidentally engaging with these and getting harmed and that is frustrating that youtube doesn place to remove these all right you guys i hope this video was informative and helpful if you liked it give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don i [Music]

THE TRUE COST OF SUNSCREEN: LUXURY OR HEALTHCARE? ?? DERMATOLOGIST @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6ThfzX-9Xw	Dr Day	sunscreen is too expensive this is something i hear all the time in the comments in my videos and you know it is a common uh concern people have and rightfully so we comes to protecting your skin from the sun the recommendation is to wear sunscreen daily to sun exposed areas if you you need to reapply every two hours not only is sunscreen uncomfortable to put on it but that ends up being quite a bit of sunscreen many people feel as though it is cost prohibitive so in this video we that looked at uh the cost of sunscreen is sunscreen a luxury we already know if you didn uv rays that come from the sun they damage the dna and our skin cells and they put us at risk for skin cancer skin cancer is very very very common and it you know many skin cancers while they don the individual doesn them they do require treatment they can be very invasive meaning grow down deep in your skin require very involved surgeries to correct leaving you with scars it not anything you want and we know that uv rays from the sun they also lead to premature skin aging that weakens our skin long term things like impairment in our skin barrier weakening of the collagen loss of elasticity really those those changes while part of normal aging they come about much sooner in the setting of unprotected sun exposure because of those uv rays that are so damaging because of those things the recommendations are to protect your skin from the sun with a variety of measures one is don long especially during midday when those uv rays are most intense to wear sun protective clothing like long sleeves long pants or skirts a hat of course sunglasses and number three not ever ever ever get in a tanning bed that very strong mega dose of uv rays right on your skin really really really dramatically increases your risk of skin cancer and number four wear sunscreen to sun exposed surfaces of the skin usually that your ears the backs of your hands but if you are like at the beach wearing a bathing suit it areas your legs if you you on your legs and people start questioning well okay all right that fine but then throw in the the fact that if you are wearing sunscreen and you are outside well it off uh it so guess what you need to reapply it every two hours while you are out in the sun people are going wow okay then say you in the water well guess what as soon as you get out you need to reapply sunscreen wait i thought it was water resistant yes even if it resistant you still need to reapply it because it comes off so this starts to get people questioning like how do people afford this this is too cost prohibitive sunscreen certainly is helpful it has been shown to reduce the risk of skin cancer and premature skin aging and it protects you from a sunburn but it a lot of limitations what are the limitations of sunscreen well historically sunscreens did not offer very good protection against uva rays so from the sun you damage your skin historically sunscreen is really only protected from the uvb rays we the uva protection piece of things which is good because the uva rays definitely are very very much active in the skin cancer risk age okay and then the other thing is there this idea and a lot of studies support this that wearing sunscreen actually prompts people to end up staying out in the sun too long and as a result they end up getting too much sun exposure number three is that we know people actually don enough sunscreen you actually have to apply a pretty thick layer to achieve the stated protection factor factor on the bottle it measure that they measure it uh after applying it at a density of two milligrams per centimeter square which is just honestly not realistic in real world use nobody does that nobody applies it at that thickness uh number four is just the labeling is confusing people don what spf means it protecting from a burn is one piece of things but sunscreen does a lot a lot more and so a lot of people i think because of the way sunscreens are labeled i think people are misled in many ways and one way is perhaps by staying out too long or another way is in people who don this is supposed to protect me from a burn i don then the other major issue is the cost which is what we in this video okay so this is a study that looked at the tried to figure out the true cost of sunscreen they looked at countries throughout europe and in north america um and they created a few hypoth two hypothetical situations which we they priced out sunscreen in the u.s canada france belgium the uk germany spain italy and sweden this was a 2011 study so you got to factor in now we but going back to 2011 at that time the median price for sunscreen was 1.70 per 10 grams there was variation of course uh the highs i think were somewhere around twenty dollars per ten grams and the lows you know fractions of a dollar anyways uh interestingly enough italy had the most expensive sunscreens there they medium price whereas canada had the lowest median price another interesting finding was that europe the price of sunscreen got more expensive as the protective factor increased whereas in north america the opposite the price dropped as the protection went up this particular study they they came out with some some theoretical scenarios trying to calculate what the true cost of sunscreen usage would be they decided they were going to create this fictional family of a mother a father and two children who were going to be at the beach for a week and they were going to be spending four hours a day for the entire week seven days a week out at the beach and all they were going to do was wear sunscreen but they were going to wear sunscreen as directed meaning they were going to apply 2 milligrams per centimeter square that thick thick layer that almost no one does they were going to reapply it as directed so for the four hours a day spent at the beach they decided in in this fictional case that the kids because kids run around they play they get in the water more than mom and dad might kids were gonna apply sunscreen three times during the four hour period um whereas mom and dad were going to apply twice a day each presuming that mom and dad were just chilling on the beach not doing much um so they calculated that and they actually calculated it based on having children of different ages dad swim trunks mom is in a bikini they didn wearing so if you have two two-year-olds that is 53.3 meters squared of body surface area for kids a week at this beach scenario that you need whereas if you have 10 year olds once they grow up but you need a lot more sunscreen 71.4 meters squared surface area needs to be covered so what does this end up costing like what is the true cost of this well in 2011 which is when the study was done that would come out to you a hundred and seventy eight dollars and twenty cents for a week at the beach where you are spending four hours in the sun uh if you have two two-year-olds if you have two ten-year-old children and mom and dad it 40 cents per week so that is that your vacation budget right there for sure then they repeated this analysis but they threw in something different now everybody is going to be wearing upf shirts sun protective shirts swim shirts they and they buy a specific type of sunscreen they going to buy a sunscreen in a big bottle an economy size by throwing in the sun shirt it decreases the cost by a third you spend a third less money on sunscreen if you buy a shirt if you wear a shirt and you may say well those shirts are expensive they are expensive but you can reuse them whereas sunscreen you cannot reuse sunscreen if you don time three years it expires so it but it does save you on the sunscreen cost and then they looked at the combination of using the sun shirts plus buying a big bottle of sunscreen you guys frequently commented this you know the little a lot of sunscreens are in these tiny bottles they pretty expensive per per ounce so if you go for the big big bottle like the big you know econo size then that ends up decreasing your cost by 58 so those are some things that you could do to to cut costs get a bigger bottle of sunscreen and get a sun protect a sun shirt if you beach but it is that is a chunk of money right there for sure undeniably it out though that this study doesn actually look at like the specifics of the sunscreen when they bigger bottle they don necessarily take into account what is that a water resistant sunscreen is that an spf 50 or is it an spf 30 what type of consistency is it they didn just going purely on volume here buying a bigger bottle is less expensive but this is a scenario that i think is more relevant to where people you know kind of chime in like how cost effective is that in the long run so here they have an individual they wear sun protective clothing every day they avoid the sun during peak exposure hours and they wear sunscreen daily to sun exposed areas which are going to be the face the neck and the backs of the hands and this in this individual we works monday through friday and monday through friday they apply sunscreen once a day they don errands they apply sunscreen twice a day on the weekends this is an adult that going to be a 1.2 to 1.4 meters squared body surface area that needs sunscreen per week so in 2011 that works out to being 4.7 to 5.6 dollars a week for year-round application to apply sunscreen like that to the face the neck the backs of hands every single day twice a day on the weekends in a year you dollars and 30 cents to 292 dollars and 30 cents so that is i don in 2011 i wouldn that was too expensive i don it would be now with inflation i recognize however that for a lot of people it prohibitive like spending we in 2022 it 400 a year 500 a year is that worth it to you 500 a year everybody everybody definition of what is cost prohibitive varies i think um for some people you know it they that people spend a lot more money on other things that nobody bats an eye at starbucks drinks different tv packages a lot of people spend that kind of money on on other health and wellness things too so for some people it but for some people who are really struggling financially that is a lot of money that could go towards other things paying off debt uh you know getting food paying bills you know more pressing upfront costs that need to be taken care of acutely and you know this preventative piece of things is just not not a priority i totally understand that and so when people comment like sunscreen is cost prohibitive i am not like blind to the fact that for a lot of people it is just too expensive in my opinion and studies support doing this in my opinion at least in public spaces like parks zoos the beach i do think that sunscreen should be offered for free we have good studies to show that when sunscreen is free people are more likely to use it and i observe this firsthand when i was living in colorado there rocky mountain sunscreen and they would be at all sorts of outdoor events summer time there you know festivals go on little food festivals arts arts and crafts festivals this sunscreen brand would have a tent at every single one of these things giving out free sunscreen and i was always like that was the first time i actually saw people putting sunscreen on willingly outside of being at the beach or the pool and so it really can make a difference if sunscreen is is provided i do think that health insurance plans should offer some cost coverage for sunscreen especially in people who have photosensitive skin conditions like rare skin conditions of course like something called xeroderma pigmentosa very rare but basically those people they can repair damage to the dna and their skin cells upon uv exposure they get skin cancers very very young they have to be really really sun avoidant uh people who have had a transplant an organ transplant they have to be really sun sun avoidant because they greater risk for skin cancer because the medicines that they go on to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ lower their immune system make them at great risk for skin cancer so i really think that their insurance plans should cover the cost of sunscreens now here in the u.s many people have a certain type of insurance plan within their insurance they have something called a flexible spending account a health savings account basically money that is set aside each year out of your paycheck that goes to that goes to buying health related items including sunscreen and that money you then do not have to pay income tax on so that ends up being being great for a lot of people i definitely encourage you to take advantage of that if you have that you have to be careful if you do have that not all sunscreens are approved for that so if you go to sephora to buy a sunscreen it likely on your health savings account um so just know that do your do your research as they say before before that but all this to say i did want to make this video because i do get this comment a lot and i dismissing you guys when you leave that comment that it totally understand that um and i would highly encourage you to reign in other sun protected behaviors being very mindful of your exposures wearing hats sun protective clothing i do think having a few items of clothing that you can rely on i think it ends up being a huge cost savings relying on sun protective clothing is actually a lot more reliable in the long run it sunscreen you inconsistencies you application density you rubbing off and then you have just people being forgetful it whereas an item of clothing you just put it on and that the clothing becomes more of an issue in hotter climates in the description box i my video on sun protective clothing you don upf specific clothing upf is kind of like spf for clothing there are a variety of brands that make upf clothing i wear like bar on amazon you can get less expensive brands like belief and those are great options but you don certain weaves of fabric offer very good uv protection so i in the description box that is another way to cut the cost when it comes to your sun protection shouldn prohibitive and uh the the goal is not to you know make you go out and buy a bunch of sunscreen with this messaging it is really just to inform you as to how best to protect your largest organ and that includes multiple behaviors it sunscreen if you think about if you doing all the other behaviors you really shouldn much sunscreen because it to be just your face the backs of your hands your neck and so it ends up being less expensive in the long run i know a lot of you guys for example you work jobs where you are you are out in the sun you work construction or landscaping and you are out in the sun all day does your employer provide you sun protective clothing a hat at least i i doubt they provide you with sunscreen but i think these are things that we should talk more openly about let me know in the comments though what are your barriers when it comes to sunscreen is it the consistency is it the cost is it the um just the time that it takes to apply it do you find that sun protective clothing is more useful and that you rely on it are you someone who just chooses to avoid the sun as much as possible during peak exposure what do you do to protect your skin from the sun how is sunscreen helpful to you and what are the barriers that you experience when it comes to accessing it or using it on the insulate i video where i break down some common misconceptions about sunscreen so definitely check that one out but if you

STOP COMMENTING ON SOMEONE'S SKIN ?? DERMATOLOGIST @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mOrgFqe5Uo	Dr Day	well hey guys if you deal with acne have you ever had somebody comment on your appearance it i don emotional toll that having acne can take on somebody let alone hearing those kinds of comments all the time in this video we mental health impacts of having acne in adults it affects teenagers but it also affects many adults especially adult women my hope in making this video is that if you you a little bit better insight help you understand that you are not alone but if you don twice before ever commenting on someone something that you have done you know making these kind of offhand comments like what does your face look like that why are you breaking out oh you should eat healthier or oh my gosh you should clean up your diet otherwise you wouldn breaking out like that these kinds of comments i don how they can really impact someone day-to-day and ultimately really have a negative impact on their overall emotional health before getting into this topic though i want to take a moment to thank today hero cosmetics the maker of the mighty patch i product for a few years now i love it what is it it is a hydrocolloid patch that you can put on a pimple and the reason i love these so much is that a lot of people struggle with picking their skin and that significantly delays healing of the acne this forms a nice barrier to your fingers protecting the pimple the hydrocolloid material also helps to absorb exudate that comes out of the pimple facilitating healing and recovery now they for just isolated pimples i love them you can comfortable recently they came out with a patch for the nose if you get breakouts on your nose highly suggest checking this out they really thin flexible material that very comfortable to wear you can wear it overnight or honestly the little round ones you can pop on a pimple you can even see them you wake up the following morning and peel it away if you have some inflammatory exudate you to see it for some people that is a bit gratifying hero cosmetics is available worldwide and these patches are vegan and cruelty free and they pregnancy most people wear them at night time like to bed you can wear them approximately six to eight hours but like i said they these the original for camouflaging pimples i think they work better personally in my opinion they are a better option than putting makeup on over a pimple because if you makeup on over a pimple whether it be concealer or foundation or whatever it starts to cake up flake off and it can be irritating to the pimple itself ends up making it look 10 times worse this nicely camouflages it blends in with your background skin you can alternative um and with the nose patches you get 10 patches in this box and then their mighty patch you get 36 in a box hero cosmetics makes a lot of great products you all know i fan of the four shield their sunscreens the mineral sunscreen it has a green tint to it which helps to minimize the appearance of redness i reviewed this product for you guys in a video a while ago on sunscreens you need to check out but right now hero cosmetics is offering a great deal for you guys if you click the link in my description box and use my code you can get 15 off site wide plus free shipping on orders over 35 dollars so definitely check it out and if you haven throw that in your car and give it a try because it is a good one the global disease burden of acne is pretty significant i don realize that but there are a lot of people walking around with acne either on their face or their back their chest or body somewhere else it is a very prevalent because not only does it impact teenagers and and tweens but also many many adults struggle with acne especially adult women acne is not just a disease of oiliness but it governed by hormones and as we get into our adult years there can be a lot of hormonal changes going along that influence our acne for adults who deal with acne it is very annoying because you thought this was something you were going to get over as a young adult and you would be done with it and now you still dealing with it acne can be physically painful and it can go on to scar these outcomes have a significant impact on an individual life having acne is associated with an increased risk of a variety of mental health issues depression anxiety social isolation many of the qualitative studies that we have today do focus on the health mental health impacts of acne on teenagers for example we know that teenagers with acne are more likely to struggle with depression anxiety social isolation acne can actually lead to strains in relationships both within the home and outside of the home more recent studies actually examine the qualitative impacts of having acne on adults and their quality of life and the lived experiences of adults with acne mirrors that of teenagers with acne and that it too really can have a tremendous negative impact on quality of life and emotional well-being many women with adult acne express a lot of concern around their appearance one thing you may be surprised to hear is that adult women with acne report that it has a profound impact in disrupting their professional relationships they say things like having acne a lot of people don acne some people think that i am not as capable and having acne makes me appear younger and less qualified i thought that was a really interesting finding from the study to really capture how a skin disease can have such an impact on your interpersonal relationships including professionally i mean you think going into a professional setting that you are solely being judged on your ability to perform but in reality we all know that appearance-based metrics subconsciously they do play a role and that is unfortunate hopefully this video makes you more aware of any potential subconscious bias you may have towards people with a skin condition like acne women with acne report feeling very anxious and socially isolating what they say about how they socially isolate is really noteworthy many women report that having acne prevents me from doing what i love this may be due to just the appearance of acne but remember acne is also physically uncomfortable so if you have acne on your back for example your body you may be more uncomfortable doing things that have a lot of friction like running things like that can be more uncomfortable some people may be less inclined to wear a certain dress because they have acne on their chest and back they may turn down their friend to have them as their bridesmaid because they don going to reveal their body acne some women may also shy away from romantic relationships due to feeling self-conscious about their acne and you may say what just a little bit of acne but if you have acne you know firsthand that people feel the need to constantly comment on your appearance whether it be your acne or really anything else it something that many people cannot resist the urge to do is to just constantly be commenting on random things about your appearance whether it be a full-blown skin disease that you have no control over and they on what you should be doing what skin care products you should be using what supplements you should be doing you know seed oils is the latest thing they trying to give you advice telling you to go keto telling you to do this telling you do that giving you all of these anecdotes and it tone-deaf because acne is largely governed by things like our hormones and genetics and sure lifestyle factors definitely help out the acne in the long run but to just be getting these opinions constantly from the armchair experts out there the keyboard warriors it definitely starts to feed into your emotional well-being it really starts to make people second-guess themselves second-guess their ability to do things it makes people second-guess their self-worth and whether or not they can have a relationship they start delaying things thinking once my acne is clear once my acne is gone i do that i know a lot of people go their whole lifetime really struggling with being overweight and putting off a lot of their living a lot of their lives to once i fit in that dress once i can you know wear the those jeans or whatever then i to do this then i they go long stretches not living their lives to the fullest and those folks do get a lot of unsolicited opinions further driving that narrative in their minds the same holds true for people who deal with skin conditions especially acne it it conditions but other things as well you know people who have psoriasis they really do deal with a lot of negative commentary from the randos out there and people who deal with vitiligo a lot of people are going to comment on that if you have eczema people are going to comment on it and i think people need to learn to self-police their comments on someone it reported having acne prevents me from leaving my house and a lot of this is centered around i don anywhere or do anything without makeup on and the makeup required to cover acne can be pretty involved concealer etc it is something that for people who look to camouflage their acne it takes a lot of effort and no one has all that time and so a lot of women are saying that they don they don with the whole makeup routine in order to go out they having acne is holding them back from going out and living their lives because they will not go out with a bare face some women even report that having acne prevents them from getting the mail uh because they don to go out and check the mail working in the home for example you know caregivers in the home don by the neighbors without makeup on for women who are dealing with acne like this and i say women because this is what the study was based on women with adult acne and adult acne is much more common in women than in men women who are dealing with this level of emotional distress from having acne remember acne can go on to scar too women dealing with this they actually end up setting the bar really really high for treatment expectations like they want to be a hundred percent clear because in their mind there is no acceptable amount of acne and because it get negative feedback from society it going to get commentary 90 clear and that 10 is still going to get comments it on you know people are still going to make rude comments people are still going to talk about it and so it ends up making women set unreasonable expectations for the clearance of their acne and the pace of that clearance and i think as a result it makes people very very vulnerable to a lot of you know gimmicky marketing falling for fad diets and juice cleanses and things like that zealots on the internet touting all sorts of unfounded claims uh if you just follow this diet or do that this or that you will clear your acne so i do think that this emotional piece of acne makes women a lot more vulnerable to to a lot of misleading claims other women said that they would just like to have their acne reduced to at least a manageable number of blemishes like something that is more easy to spot conceal or whatever and then other women tie it into the relationship piece clearance to a point where it will no longer impact my professional relationship that isn really eye-opening i have heard this from women before but to have it in a study where women are coming forward and saying the same thing over and over again that it impacts their profession their career career progress should be guided by your abilities not your appearance but in reality appearance does play a subconscious role so again if you are someone out there who doesn in your skin don people bias that you may judge somebody who has acne as being less capable or less qualified lazy not not exhibiting enough self-care poor hygiene these are all subconscious biases that a lot of people have towards people with acne especially adults with acne alright women with acne more likely to have depression anxiety social isolation so take all of that and layer on it the insane frustration that comes with trying to find a dermatologist who will actually listen to you this is one of the number one complaints that people have when it comes to seeking out acne treatment that they the dermatologist and the dermatologist breezes in and breezes out and all they prescription for an antibiotic and the antibiotics work maybe a little bit for them and then it just comes right back it overwhelmingly like they are not being heard and they amount of time it takes to actually find a dermatologist that will listen to them this is a problem in uh the way medicine is executed these days where we have a very uh corporatized infrastructure where dermatologists are required to see so many patients in such a short amount of time and therefore it is very important for dermatologists to listen to their patients and listen to what the patient has gone through and what the patient is hoping to achieve and really listen i mean that is the key to good medicine is listening it causes so much disruption that patients are like i don to do with this and they turn to the internet where there are a million zealots on there a million gurus ready and waiting to sell you a juice cleanse for people with deeper skin tones people of color their acne heals with discoloration that can take many many months to resolve it inflammatory hyperpigmentation and many times that is a big concern for people of color understandably sometimes they bumps themselves and they are obviously more interested in not having the acne heal with a dark mark that last a long time patients of color verbalize that not only are they equally frustrated by how complicated it is and difficult it is to find a dermatologist who actually listen to them but then the piece of their hyperpigmentation is often not part of the treatment discussion and i think just a few extra minutes to take the time to explain to patients that the acne treatments whether it be azelaic acid topical retinoid sunscreen that these treatments not only are going to help with clearing up the bumps they important to continue to use because they will not only prevent more bumps from occurring but they will prevent the hyperpigmentation and they will help clear up the hyperpigmentation and the patient may not even be that worried about the actual acne bumps it more the background changes that occur from having acne the hyperpigmentation or the scarring and let distress onto the package and that is at least here in the states getting your insurance to cover these medications like there for acne called when levy i about it in a few videos here and there it difficult to get insurance to cover it unfortunately and this is a case with with a lot of acne treatments they can be very

SKIN CARE LIES AND BAD ADVICE ON THE INTERNET ?? Dermatologist @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgZl2s1_A64	Dr Day	the internet is packed with misinformation you knew that right if you didn in mind whenever you read anything online because there are a lot of misleading claims that you will come across in the realm of skin care health in general you have to be very skeptical in this video we about a recent paper that came out in the journal of clinical and experimental dermatology doing a deep dive into misinformation online with regards to acne if you is andrea i dermatologist i upload skincare content here on youtube if you like that consider subscribing hit the bell if that alerts you when my videos go live or you may want to follow me over on tick tock or instagram acne is a really common skin condition it reasons why a lot of people find my channel and it mostly affects teenagers but you can get it in your 30s 40s 50s it acne whether it be on your face your body it can be physically painful and untreated it can go on to leave scars that likewise are psychologically distressing when you acne it rabbit hole of finding information online in an attempt to help yourself out but really you can stumble into a lot of bad information as the study highlights people who cope with acne they appearance maybe they bullied at school or in the workplace people just making offhand comments like oh you know like no just keep your mouth shut acne is common it visible and it has psychosocial impacts all these things make people who are dealing with acne incredibly vulnerable to misinformation online this group sought out to characterize and identify misinformation online they started with google searches and then they did a deep dive into twitter facebook my favorite tik tok which is just a platform of not only misinformation but bogus misinformation i mean the most like why are people believing this kind of misinformation anyways they also took a look at instagram as well and they noticed some themes in terms of different categories of misinformation diet is a big one misinformation about the causes of acne and misleading claims about potential cures as well as fear mongering around acne treatment kind of a distress for conventional medicine and overall medical treatments for acne which by the way conventional treatments while they are demonized and fear-mongered online they have a long-standing track record of safety and efficacy of course they don everyone and some things need to be tweaked but you know just because there are established risks and side effects of a medical treatment doesn devil and doesn things that people are trying to sell you any safer let alone more effective let people online are claiming allegedly cause acne poor hygiene honestly in my time on the internet making youtube videos instagram and now tick tock i really don apparently in this study they found that there were a lot of claims online that acne is just you know something that related to poor hygiene inevitably trying to sell you some kind of antiseptic or face wash to remove harmful bacteria acne is not an infectious disease while there is a bacteria that lives on everyone and plays a role in acne it cutie bacterium acnes it infectious disease and you can acne from somebody it to how your genetics play around with that little bacteria and the skin cells turning over all those things anyways so a lot of claims about poor hygiene and i guess i will say i have kind of come across this in comments here on youtube and seen stuff on like online where people claim that buying an antiseptic like hibiclens or betadine which are surgical scrubs used to disinfect the skin surface are a treatment for acne those are less problematic other people claim to use neosporin to treat their acne this is not helpful at all neosporin has antibiotics in it that are not particularly great and you do pose a risk of bacterial resistance using that on the skin unnecessarily not to mention it is a product that people commonly develop a reaction to and that can lead to more irritation and actually worsen your acne so i guess that come across frequently people kind of under the misunderstanding that if they use an over-the-counter antiseptic it will help clear the acne i can see why people would easily go down that rabbit hole i mean as far as treatments that work for acne a lot of them are antibiotics whether it be topical antibiotics like clindamycin that you put on the skin or oral antibiotics like doxycycline or minocycline that are taken for a period of time while those are antibiotics honestly the main way that they work to treat acne is actually because they have secondary anti-inflammatory properties and that is how they work and we don indefinitely it to control it get it under control to prevent scarring and then put you on something that can be taken more on a long-term basis to control the acne breakouts i guess they came across a lot of like antimicrobial face washes claiming to clear acne and kind of misrepresenting acne as an infectious disease so there misinformation about the relationship between certain foods your diet and acne and the most common category of foods that are proselytized against is going to be dairy in terms of dairy the only association is a weak association between skim milk consumption and more stubborn acne it association it everyone just because people who consume a lot more skim milk sometimes have more stubborn acne doesn that milk causes acne let alone the entire dairy category we have no evidence that cheese yogurt any other dairy product causes acne the strongest association between acne and diet is actually in the consumption of a diet with high glycemic load foods basically sugary processed foods that may lead to increases in what insulin-like growth factor that can feed back onto the cells that line your oil gland and the cells that line your pore cause them to proliferate too much plug up the pore and lead to more acne so a high glycemic load diet it has been associated with more stubborn acne and may play a role in the pathogenesis of it oddly enough amongst all the fear-mongering that they came across in terms of diet and acne nobody was really talking about glycemic low diets or promoting low sugar diets which i find odd i mean people are all about talking about cutting out sugar and all that kind of stuff you know you got to be careful when it comes to interpreting diet studies and acne or any skin issue because some dietary modifications can be harmful and if so if they evidence-based then no doctor is going to go recommending that you do this when it comes to you know minimizing the sugar in your diet that you know psychologically they can become a little bit too fixated on that and you know develop disordered eating coming across a study that shows the association between skim milk and more stubborn acne they just take that and run with it and bash the entire family of dairy foods you know batch all of dairy into one thing a lot of the websites and accounts that they came across claimed that fluoridated water was the cause of acne it is not i see a lot of people fear monger around fluoride in toothpaste and fluoride in toothpaste the thing is a lot of times those toothpastes may have more sls which is a detergent that if it gets on the skin it can be irritating and for people that often can trigger something called perioral dermatitis but there no proof that fluoride in the water supply is causative of any skin problems and fluoride in toothpaste it for preventing cavities the amount of flora that you are exposed to either in tap water or in or in toothpaste is like so so so so so low these wellness websites have perpetuated this idea and for a lot of people there is a false fixed belief that this is what is causative even though there whatsoever all right and then this is something i see on instagram a lot and i used to see it on youtube a fair amount or people trying it out on youtube in front of their audience and that is this idea that there infection whether it be a parasite or candida that is causing not only acne but a whole host of health problems maybe you that they candida cleanse or the candida candida diet it candida is a yeast that present in your mouth your gi tract the vagina and you can have overgrowth of that that leads to like yeast infections thrush but that immune systems diabetes maybe you been on antibiotics but it doesn acne and it doesn host of problems that a lot of these websites claim it does all right so what miracle cures are they hawking veganism as a cure for acne veganism is not a cure for acne and they came across as a fair amount that people would just miracle you know miraculously clear by going on a vegan diet and it just bothers me to no end that people would perpetuate false information in my opinion and as a way to coerce people into into the vegan lifestyle i don that that is right and it doesn message to be spreading misinformation veganism first of all veganism it loaded term there vegan diet some of which are healthier than others so it minimizing reliance on animals and you know focusing on animal well-being it about a given diet sure it excludes all animal derived things but there are a variety of ways that you can get there some healthier than others so just make a blanket statement that going vegan will cure your acne it doesn because there are a variety of ways you can go vegan making false promises to cure or treat any illness because if you go doing that to coerce people into your lifestyle and then it doesn because hello it do to treat those issues then those people are gonna be really pissed and they nothing to do with veganism so they may be vegan for you know six weeks couple of months and then when their acne doesn that they and they with veganisms a lot of vegan personalities and websites will say oh once i went vegan i just had this glowing skin and my skin cleared up this likewise perpetually perpetuates the idea that you have acne because of something that you are doing in your diet in your diet if you only ate a certain way in reality there evidence for that it other you know kind of miracle cure is dietary supplements and kind of making claims that certain nutrient deficiencies cause acne and they really you know there either and ironically enough a lot of the dietary supplements that are being sold contain high amounts of minerals and things that at those levels actually can trigger and worsen acne speaking of supplements another one that is frequently touted as being beneficial for acne is die into allele methane dim i have a whole video about dim supplements because i get a lot of questions about it this comes from this compound found in cruciferous vegetables which you all know i love my cruciferous vegetables can enough of them but it hormone balancer makes claims that it will block the androgen receptor and you know have more of a favorable estrogen profile and sure there are some studies in vitro which means cells in a dish not an actual human showing anti-inflammatory effects anti-cancer effects but that doesn mean that this compound has any outcome in people in my video on dim some of you commented that you tried it and it caused a lot of hormonal issues for you actually messed up your menstrual cycle and all these things so be cautious also in the paper there was a shout out to the medical medium i did a video on him and his dermatoxin claim recently anyways he was mentioned uh as someone online claiming to cure your acne if only you buy his book for 16.99 anyways he was mentioned and then you know the typical acne diys like the toothpaste spot treatment don toothpaste again like i said earlier it fine you know it but that can really be super irritating as a spot treatment it your acne why is the toothpaste thing still going strong toothpaste thing was around in the 80s and 90s probably around in the 30s like we have advanced leave the toothpaste for your mouth stop putting it on your skin and then the other offender that is always popping up on all these diy sites is lemon juice apparently they came across a lot of sites lauding the benefits of applying lemon juice to your skin please do not do that lemon juice is very acidic which is not good to the skin it can be highly irritating not to mention if you get sun exposure with lemon juice on your skin it can cause what blistering rash miserable that for your skin let alone your acne do not do it and then garlic was another topical that they found websites claiming you know would would cure your acne i assume they mean applying it to the skin no garlic actually on the skin can be pretty irritating a lot of food handlers people who work at you know professional chefs kitchen you know people who work in a kitchen as part of their occupation there food handling they often can develop dermatitis on their fingers from chopping up garlic is pretty irritating to be applying directly to the skin that gloves are important for people doing that as part of their occupation but putting it on the skin not a good idea it your acne now garlic supplements i see them in the health food stores all the time they are not evidence-based for treating acne you know maybe they have anti-inflammatory effects but one thing i will say about garlic supplements is they actually can increase your risk for bleeding and bruising so if you are taking a garlic supplement uh make sure you tell your doctor because it could interfere with certain medications and if you something like botox or fillers where they do you know an injection it will increase your risk of bruising just because these websites are hocking these natural remedies it doesn necessarily safe effective let alone evidence based then there was a lot of negative connotation around you know conventional treatments that are evidence-based first-line therapies a lot of negative talk about antibiotics that are prescribed you know kind of grossly misrepresenting side effects antibiotics they claim are pollutants you know they honestly they have their role in acne treatment they but they have a role in clearing it up quickly so as to prevent scarring and then you can be used more long term but the one they really love to fear monger online to no end is isotretinoin brand name accutane first of all they really play up the controversial link between accutane and depression saying that it you know be depressed and all this stuff when in reality numerous meta analyses dad they show actually that it may improve and your overall quality of life can improve of course it monitor for mood changes while on the medication but these websites they really misrepresent that and play into it to fear monger against it meanwhile selling you some you know bottle of who knows what the other uh controversial link is between accutane and inflammatory bowel disease like ulcerative colitis or crohn time ago it was you know thought hey there higher quality research has come out made analyses and things that actually show no link between inflammatory bowel disease and accutane people who have crohn ulcerative colitis they often have acne so it thing and the accutane is just guilty by association having having ulcerative colitis or crohn right y highlighted a lot of what i see on a regular basis creating content about skin care and dermatology online so much bs out there and with acne it is psychologically distressing it affects young people who are consuming a lot of the internet they too much and so they very vulnerable group but anybody can fall prey to this stuff and when you dealing with something a physical ailment whether it be on your skin or affecting you know you internally it can be you medicine is operating these days uh you know physicians are forced to see a high volume of patients in a very limited amount of time so it very difficult to feel as though you being heard taken seriously and you know as soon as you feel that way you you and i totally get that you know i totally understand why people go this route but i any better i mean you of misinformation uh it give up on on medicine on conventional medicine please try and find someone who will take your symptoms seriously whether it be your skin or your you know internal body health whatever issues you are dealing with be very very very careful with stuff that you come across online because a lot of it is with the intent to grow a following online or you know sell a product uh be very skeptical all right y this video was informative and if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen and subscribe i to you guys tomorrow bye [Music] you	Success
TUCKER CARLSON WANTS YOU TO TAN YOUR TESTICLES ?? @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2RBMyZtwqI	Dr Day	well hey guys we need to talk about this fox news commentator tucker carlson was going on about testicle tanning to boost testosterone okay there is so much here that we need to talk about obviously coming from me you know what i there okay so i guess this is a promo for a show about the decline in manhood and it got these shirtless muscle man walking around shooting rifles wrestling doing all these macho things and then there triumphantly exposing his crotch to a red light device and they go on to talk about how red light is going to boost your testosterone if you expose your scrotum to it which is just not true i love to get on here and whine about how many gimmicks there are in the skin care market and how it but for men boosting market is a sea of quackery you guys um tons of supplements and things that they young men to boost their testosterone low testosterone or hypogonadism it you know it discuss with your doctor there are medical reasons for lower testosterone but there are tons of these online testosterone replacement therapy clinics that you know so it consumer profit driven industry so they red light device for the scrotum but they talk about testicular tanning and you guys know that ultraviolet radiation comes from the sun that mutations in our dna and leads to skin cancers and skin aging but you also get a whopping dose of visible light from the sun including red light so the idea that you would go out and tan your scrotum you know somebody might think in their mind i going to boost my testosterone it going to be healthy my concern here is that people will be misled into thinking it obtain these quote benefits especially in those who have already been oversold on the benefits of sun exposure plus alongside this kind of marketing there are similar people talking about boosting vitamin d i this in other videos before but getting a tan is not a safe way to raise your vitamin d levels without simultaneously putting you at risk for skin cancers especially to the scrotum so the skin of the scrotum is very very thin and delicate a lot more vulnerable to ultraviolet radiation damage you know idea that they boost your testosterone by exposing your scrotum to red light you know they trying to extrapolate the ideas behind photobiomodulation there tanning it also full body red light therapy which has massive amount of benefits and there data out there that isn [Music] the idea that you can boost testosterone though from exposing your scrotum to red light is absurd and definitely not evidence-based at all the guy he talking to is just fitness professional so not a physician you know definitely not a urologist the fitness professional he name drops this red light device that he costs anywhere from 600 to almost 10 thousand dollars so there approved red light device for boosting testosterone it try and make the claim that the red light device is going to boost atp production and the lighting cells in the testicles to improve energy and boost up testosterone production there no evidence that red light therapy will increase testosterone production red light level of the testicles it through it the actual light itself they actually refer to this as bromiopathy which i think is really an interesting moniker so why is it crazy to seek solutions it think i was recently exposed to a term called bromiopathy and i think there lot of people out there right now that are don information melding homeopathy and bro ness like bro science which is just kind of i don opinion melding them together there are currently no fda cleared light based devices on the market for boosting testosterone production it just doesn make sense red light you know it effective for a variety of conditions it can help in improving pattern hair loss uh because it can help with improving circulation to the scalp the idea but the idea that putting red light to the scrotum is going to boost testosterone production in the testicles in a very specific cell compartment it it they say testicle tanning you can an internal organ they scrotum but internal to that is the is the testicles and there you can internal organs it doesn the men bloated with a ton of misinformation like i already alluded to earlier there are a ton of websites hawking different supplements that claim to boost testosterone and it you know like i not a urologist i because tanning is not safe it dangerous and i don there to think that it out and tan any skin surface and let alone that it possible to improve your you know boost your testosterone by doing this it just complete bs they really prey on young men in particular but all men i think because with age we you know testosterone levels do start to to drop off and low testosterone or hypogonadism can lead to fatigue poor energy decrease in muscle mass and erectile dysfunction but there are also a lot of other issues that can cause those problems and i do think that these online communities these kind of men websites i do really think that they just laser focus on boosting testosterone and they miss a bigger picture that there are a variety of other medical reasons that you can have those symptoms and have those issues poor sleep uh problem with your thyroid all sorts of things and when it comes to erectile dysfunction and low testosterone is not even like the most common reason for that it vascular problem a problem with you know the blood vessels as much as i am in favor of telemedicine it has its place the trt booming direct-to-consumer market it can easily start to blur the lines between patient care and just like you know selling stuff that is not necessarily helpful and missing bigger picture issues and i think it disservice there in this these communities that you know mainstream medicine is just missing the mark these concepts are things we need to keep an open mind about open your mind that says keep an open mind ken rock even questioned him dude our cameraman i guess is in your house right now you need to keep an open mind if you having symptoms that you think may be related to low testosterone you need to keep an open mind that there are a ton of other potential medical causes for these symptoms and to not just falsely attribute it to low testosterone testosterone levels are actually quite variable throughout the day and they are impacted by things like rem sleep and so there is a big direct to consumer market for testing testosterone levels testing testosterone levels and i do think it a situation where people are trying to self-diagnose their symptoms falsely attributing them to low testosterone and then getting on testosterone replacement therapy unnecessarily yes low testosterone is a thing it dismiss to take seriously it may be contributory or causative certain symptoms but don overall health to summarize it is absolutely not safe to tan your testicles you can get a skin cancer quite easily there not to mention a sunburn it testosterone exposing your skin to red light from the sun or from a device there are no fda cleared light based devices for putting red light to the scrotum it very unlikely red light is going to penetrate to the level of the light egg cell to boost up testosterone production and you know these things do not drop upwards of close to ten thousand dollars uh you are getting played if that if you do that you are getting you are getting played if you symptoms of low libido erectile dysfunction poor energy inability to put on muscle mass loss of muscle mass weight gain these kinds of things please talk to your primary care doctor blood work may be needed a physical exam goes a long way for thinking about this problem and approaching potential causes and if you do have hypogonadism low testosterone there are proven treatments for it topical androgen gels patches pellets testosterone replacement and you can get that from your primary doctor if you have an underlying problem with your testosterone levels and as with everything when it comes to our health diet exercise and sleep also play a major role i feel like a few years ago i saw some posts that it was trendy to tan your perineum people going out and basically you get the drift uh tanning downstairs that is not evidence-based for doing anything other than putting you at increased risk for squamous cell carcinoma melanoma yeah i definitely don zapping your privates with red light or go tanning them not safe or evidence-based for doing anything other than wasting your time and money and resources potentially putting you in harm think about it you could even burn yourself with one of these light-based devices they that the safety is even less likely to be legit i think men are also particularly vulnerable for this type of marketing because traditionally men have been far more resistant in comparison to women just based on historical data and trials and things like that men are far more resistant to seek out medical care they delay medical care it that is what the data suggests historically so because of that an increase in trend towards doubting the medical profession you have this population of young men who are really you know being taken advantage of to market a bunch of bs stuff to keep an open mind it you question something and say there no science for that like where are you coming up with this and they just their their rebuttal is keep an open mind that all of the time i make a video uh talking about why you shouldn or why you shouldn essential oils on your skin or why you shouldn tanning sprays or why i don a good idea to be advertising a controlled substance like amphetamine to young children i always get comments along these lines that i am a typical close-minded doctor which um sure but that should you know provide some evidence and usually these people they don any evidence they know that they just are able to market things to a naive audience in many cases do not be a sucker to tucker can we we should make that a hashtag um all right you guys anyways i hope this video was informative i mean you already know you your genitals but psa here again if you guys liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don i

FDA WARNS 12 BRANDS SELLING ILLEGAL HYDROQUINONE PRODUCTS ?? Dermatologist @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rlmdQEu0pY	Dr Day	well hey guys so it looks as though the FDA is finally cracking down on the remaining drgs of over-the-counter hydroquinone and this video we to talk about it I my opinion if you are new here welcome my name is Andrea I dermatologist I post skare content here on YouTube anti-aging tips so if that sounds of interest to you consider subscribing or if you like Instagram or Tik Tok is your preferred method of social media consider following me over there as well so the FDA has issued a warning to 12 companies who are still flying under the radar and selling over-the-counter hydroquinone now to bring you up to speed I in the description Box video I did what was that last year explaining why hydroquinone is no longer going to be sold over the counter but to summarize it in 2020 the car kind of expedite some things around the pandemic and with that there were a lot of little legislation pieces kind of built in that sort of got wrapped wrapped up all in one and one of those was hydroquinone and because of the cares act it just kind of made it so that they decided to remove it from being able to be something that we could buy over the counter what is hydroc canone it is the gold standard when it comes to a topical treatment for fading hyperpigmentation from like healing acne but also melasma and used to be that you could buy it over the counter and 2% strengths and it skin up to 3 months you do need to take a break from it but in that 2% strength that was sold over the counter it pretty safe there are some concerns with it you can develop irritation and the thing that people talk about the most is something called uh pseudo osis or exogenous ochronosis this is an adverse effect that can happen with prolonged use of hydroquinone especially in high percentages which is what is often prescribed for treatment of these skin conditions not what you would buy over the counter exogenous osis you get these patches of discoloration on sun Exposed Skin typically overlying bone it most common on the like uh it the zygomatic bone the cheekbones here starts out as like Pat dark brown kind of almost bluish brown patches and can go on to develop these little bumps that are referred to as caviar like in dermatology as a side note they always labeling actually medicine in general I should say always naming stuff after food always tapioca this caviar this they always naming stuff after food anyways I digress it condition there it treat treatments include certain laser procedures to Target this deposition of this pigment down in the dermis sunscreen is imperative because UV rays exacerbate and drive this issue even further I mean it it happens like I said when using uh High percentages of topical hydroc canone such as what you get in prescription strength stuff long term without ever taking a break and it also a lot of the cases that I reported actually come from these skin lightening creams online that can be adulterated with other things namely Mercury some countries throughout the world there is a huge huge market for skin bleaching and so in some areas of the world especially you have a huge huge demand for these uh skin lightening creams that can be adulterated with things a lot of them have super potent uh topical steroids along with high percentages of hydroquinone sometimes Mercury so a lot of cases of pseudo osis come from that the 2% stuff that was sold over the counter here sure it could happen but it common side effect was actually irritation but anyways um there been this fear-mongering around hydroquinone you know people talk about it causing cancer I debunked this in a video that a lot of that fear-mongering comes from research based in animal models looking at uh a type of cancer in the kidney as well as a cancer of the blood and that doesn human use when applying it to the skin suffice to say hydroquinone is safe but you know a lot of dermatologists Advocate it over-the-counter Market because it it can cause a lot of irritation which for people trying to treat hyperpigmentation can make that much worse and you do need to take a break from it and the other issue that can happen is you can get bleaching of the surrounding you know healthy skin the normal appearing skin can become bleached you can also get rebound worsening of hyperpigmentation so while it ingredient it honestly is better handled under the supervision of your dermatologist healthc care provider rather than as an over-the count if you want my opinion I been over the- counter and honestly it not really caused problems and a lot of people are comfortable using it it really helpful like if you get a pimple put it on right when you get the pimple it will reduce the chances that it heals with a dark mark and then stop it was a very weak concentration so I was you know I never really saw a problem with it honestly but you know other dermatologists are you know happy to see it gone they would prefer to not have patients use that over the counter due to the potential risk so it was removed um from the market in September of 2020 and a lot of Manufacturers have already taken it out different had a dark spot corrector I reviewed a few years ago they have since reformulated that to no longer have hydroquinone in it the brand specific beauty that I recommend to you guys I a hydroquinone a fragrance free hydroquinone cream that they no longer have but every time I do a shop With Me video amb be F cream is still on the shelves and you guys have commented it is still on the shelves of your your stores and I they were going to take that off or do something and they there standing their ground and the FDA has issued a warning to not just Ambi but 11 other companies for selling illicit skin brightening agents they were everyone was told to get rid of the hydroquinone back in September of 2020 and you know they made the car passed that was you know I thought oh is this all going to disappear in the next few months and like I said it it guess the FDA you know is finally getting around to slapping people on the wrist Ambi honestly aside from Ambi these other brands I clinical formula LLC elements Brands Inc genoma lab USA andell light/ Dr Thomas baly Eminem Beauty and Wellness neoteric Cosmetics SLS Scots Liquid Gold never heard of that skin Authority LLC skin Pro skin PS Brands true Earth Health Products and ultimark products anyway so interestingly enough if you go on Amazon you can still get the hydroquinone that a lot of brands have removed from their line it it is to expiring that I don so it is interesting you know I I wonder Amazon has kind of let that slide under the radar anyway all that to say you know a lot of people like I said a lot of dermatologists are in favor of the removal of hydroquinone but these direct to Consumer uh tella Health companies man they have really taken advantage of not only the boom and rise in tele medicine around the pandemi but also uh loosening of regulations as far as telea health and now you has banned the over-the-counter sales of hydroquinone it for these direct to Consumer skincare telea Health businesses who sell um hydroquinone you know prescription hydroquinone now presumably with these teleah Health companies like I of musle and there are a few others you know you provider and you then they give you a prescription either for hydroquinone or some kind of compounded formula of hydroquinone and you know whatever AIC acid some other skin lightening ingredients now a while ago I did a video on things um sponsorships I turn down or videos I don review these direct to consumer telea health companies and the reason I don do that is cuz I just feel like it little weird for me as a physician to like review the prescribing practices of another healthc care provider and essentially with these direct to Consumer tella Health companies that is what I would be doing but in this video I just wanted to point out that I notice a correlation with the removal of hydroquinone from the over-the-counter Market the loosening of regulations around telea health and the pandemic and increased demand for tele medicine as a whole uh and then these direct to Consumer tella Health companies that will gladly prescribe you uh hydroquinone for a fee I don it you are presumably being supervised by a healthc care provider to make sure that you effects so I think that as a whole I mean that model when I did my video what was it a year ago already at this point a lot of you guys were really upset and I understand why you on this off and on for years I had any problems with it you know my dermatologist has told me how to use it safely I feel comfortable using it I don months at a time without taking a break but anytime I get you know breakouts or whatever I kind of like to use it to not have hyperpigmentation and now this otherwise affordable over-the-counter treatment is now no longer available and these direct to consumer services while it monitored by a phys and in those you a prescription for the stronger stuff the higher percentages they to give you the 2% stuff those are not inexpensive services and so you know for a lot of people it now a gap in something that they previously were able to manage and now you know they have to rely on going to the doctor for prescription or whatever in my opinion this should come in the pipeline I really hope it does and that is is they need to approve Fina for over the- counter to sell over the counter without a prescription Fina if you not familiar is aoic acid a prescription strength 15 and 20% aoic acid should be sold over the counter finaa should be an over-the-counter medication in my opinion and for a few reasons first of all it is an effective skin lightening ingredient you don pseudo osis like you do with hydroquinone you don can be irritating it well tolerated you don worsening hyperpigmentation you can use it all over your face it bleach the surrounding skin it naturally present on your skin unlike hydroquinone it pregnancy and in addition to being an evidence-based treatment for hyperpigmentation it shown in clinical trials to be as effective as hydroquinone for melasma so in addition to being good for hyperpigmentation it treatment so people could safely use it for acne and it treatment so people with rosacea could use it I mean it in other countries it counter like Australia yeah I really think that that would be a suitable and nice option in the over-the-counter uh FDA approved treatments for skin conditions would be to make to make Fina AIC acid um over the counter and I know what you so many over-the-counter aoic acids why that well the ones that you can get now over the coun are only 10% and we have no studies at that lower percentage to to show that it works for anything so as it stands now that 10% or whatever percentage strength of aoic acid that you Polish Choice um aoic acid booster or any of the others out there they ton um those are not necessarily they not like approved treatments so because they a that strength is is effective or B that their formulation is you know they don efficacy at all of their products for that reason I just think you would do the public a huge service to make the prescription stuff the stuff that we know works available over the counter a lot of products also have potassium AAL diglycinate that is allegedly more stable or easier to work with but has never been shown in any clinical studies to do what actual aoic acid does so a lot of products will kind of Market themselves cleverly as like acid aoic or use some kind of nebulous terminology with that ingredient so for that reason I find that the aoic acid over the- counter stuff it Brands to sell you something that necessarily evidence-based for treating these issues people with acne rosacea and hyperpigmentation would benefit from having an over-the-counter FDA approved form of aoic acid and not having to rely on the cosmical formulations which are much weaker and not evidence-based given you know the percentages and they just not under the same degree of Regulation or stringency as like FASA over-the-counter fnaa would be a victory just like when they allowed us to have overthe counter different adapalene that was a huge victory for people managing their acne very safe to me Fina AIC acid at the prescription strength is a equally if not more compelling ingredient than even different for being available over the counter because it it for a lot of different skin conditions acne rosace melasma it not irritating and it pregnancy so I don just a natural thing to have available as an over-the-counter option I really wish that that would be the case but all of these skincare Brands out there that have their like a you know form of aoic acid they their boots if that ever happens because you know if consumers are smart and honestly consumers have gotten a lot smarter when it comes to skin care they know a lot more than you know stuff you could get away with in the early 2000s would never fly these days so if fantia became available over the counter consumers have gotten smart to the fact that hey this is an FDA approved treatment now why am I going to buy your potassium aoil D glycinate whatever thing that why am I going to buy your weaker aoic acid anymore I stuff that is has actually been shown to work and is actually FDA approved to treat the things that I Ambi will just not take their product off the market this I would love to know from like a regulatory standpoint like what is the penalty say for Ambi cuz let most popular well-known over-the-counter hydroquinone what would be the penalty if they just didn abide uh by the fda I have to pay because a lot of times in cases like this the fee might not be enough to justify to their profit removing it from the over-the-counter sales I honestly do not know enough about regulatory whatever to to know anything about that but I would wonder you know is it is a is the fine just you know a fee that to Ambi is like small change and they can they could hack it and keep it on there cuz I have noticed that every time I go on target I brands that I used to know as having an over-the-counter hydroquinone you start seeing it being removed a lot of brands have you know reformulated products that previously had it in it but Ambi is standing strong you know they their their Ambi fade cream for oily skin their Ambi fade cream their regular Ambi fade cream or whatever they going anywhere they there like I don cream is also useful for people who uh get ingrown hairs in the beard area because those and deeper skin tones that and Ambi was always really useful in those situations because it kind of is a little bit mildly exfoliating and it could help in reducing the chances of that healing with a dark mark not to mention like bug bites and stuff I mean for hyperpigmentation it was just a useful thing to have over the counter and to reiterate there causing cancer or anything the main risk with it as I see it is that it does it can be irritating but let lot of things sold over the counter to you are going to are also irritating like you know another ingredient in skin lightening products is niacinamide definitely can be helpful for hyperpigmentation but so many of you have verbalized in the comments and this definitely happens niacinamide can be irritating to people especially at the higher percentages which a lot of Brands pump into their products so you could just as easily get irritated from a non-hydroquinone skin lightening product like ni cinnamide or licorice root you know those things yeah I just wanted to give you guys a little update cuz you know I do a lot of these shop with me videos I did one recently going through Target and shopping all of the over-the-counter skin lightning products I description box if you alternatives to hydroquinone I go into detail about the different ingredients in that video so I will link that down below but I thought it was relevant to do an update because I do shop in those stores a lot and I did that video last year saying it would be removed from the market and you guys are like we still can get it we still see it but looks like the FDA is uh is slapping some warnings on people on Brands uh so I don going to abide or not but that update I hope you guys enjoyed this video on the ins slate actually I will put that Target video if you want to check it out but if you you like this give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys

Debunking the Medical Medium and Dermatoxins | Dermatologist @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnXyMHWL2z0	Dr Day	hey guys one of you sent me a post over on instagram from anthony william otherwise known as medical medium about lycan sclerosis like in sclerosis if you condition so he goes on to say lycan sclerosis a virus in the liver feeds on copper mercury and inherited ddt what is inherited ddt i mean ddt is a pesticide but you don inherit pesticides virus then excretes dermatotoxins that surface on skin the skin becomes more fragile typically on the lower body like in sclerosis is viral not genetic or autoimmune find out how to heal and cleanse to heal so this is a post promoting his book his whole thing is that you can heal a variety of medical conditions through his food recommendations books supplements it bit of a grift and he he no medical background and he claims to be a medium and commune with some sort of spirit and that where he gets his information here on instagram he has 3.9 million followers number one new york times best-selling author medical medium podcast and then helping people overcome illness originator of global celery juice movement what is like in sclerosis it a chronic inflammatory skin condition that for the most part primarily impacts the genital area and it can involve the skin around the anus the perianal area in some cases however it can involve skin outside of these regions that referred to as extra genital lichen sclerosis these patches of very thin delicate skin that porcelain white you can have involvement of the clitoris in the genital area and that can be very painful lead to scarring pain with sex when it involves a penis it can cause the foreskin to be scarred down and difficult to retract and those who are not circumcised the urethral opening can narrow as a result of this it causes what are referred to as adhesions basically scar tissue that starts to scar down the vulva or the head of the penis and it also can again involve the inner genital area same kind of thing painful these areas are prone to bleeding sores and because the involved area is very delicate fragile weakened it infections areas of fragile skin porcelain white very fragile tear easily very vulnerable to bruising just with very minor trauma to the skin very itchy in many cases it can be actually quite tricky to diagnose depending on how long it other skin conditions that appear in these areas and the way it is typically a biopsy it is a chronic skin condition there it steroid ointments as well as other anti-inflammatory topicals like calcium urine inhibitors although those can burn and sting sometimes the areas can even be injected with steroids what is the outlook like i said it condition there when we genital area a complication that can arise from lichen sclerosis is actually squamous cell carcinoma skin cancer because basically what these areas is a lot of chronic inflammation and that can set the stage for squamous cell carcinoma especially if it goes untreated and so delaying treatment is not a good idea not only because of the risk of squamous cell carcinoma but as this goes on you develop scar tissue that can have some disfiguring consequences to the genitalia and in women you can get actually narrowing of the vaginal opening you have to use dilators to get the vagina to open back up now why does it happen honestly it one of those chronic diseases where we don to this is exactly what causes it there is a lot of research as to the potential underlying etiology being cause of this disease there there also oftentimes either a personal or family history of having some autoimmune disease so there be autoimmune it may be hereditary all right but let this guy is saying lichen sclerosis results from epstein-barr in the liver consuming copper mercury and traces of inherited ddt wow that is the first line of his caption epstein-barr virus is a herpes virus that many people acquire and you know young adult adolescents you get it through contact with mucosal membranes and what ends up happening is you may get mono when you develop it that infection and then the virus actually goes to sleep in the cells of your immune system called the b lymphocytes and it lives there i mean it you cannot eradicate it if you get run down later on in life or something happens to you that virus can wake back up and it can be causative of some other health problems dna from this virus has been demonstrated in some biopsies from lycan sclerosis but that does not demonstrate causation because this virus is ubiquitous and if you earlier on in lifetime in your life there is a good chance that its dna is going to appear if we go looking for it in skin samples and that doesn necessarily prove causation i don what he mercury and these heavy metals this guy is like really big on this heavy metal detox thing like a sclerosis and epstein-barr virus have nothing to do with heavy metals the dna from this virus is found in the cells of your immune system the b lymphocytes and again when you get run down and that virus wakes back up it it has nothing to do with de consuming heavy metals let alone a pesticide and you don body i mean this guy claims that he talks to spirits and that gets his information from so i guess that but you on pubmed uh there idea that you inherit pesticides or that ebv consumes pesticides or mercury or copper or that those things cause any of this let alone like how it involves the liver i mean there many things here that just don align it then he goes on the resulting dermatoxin float to the surface of the skin and can go anywhere though they tend to stay lower in the body most of the time from the waist down i don with the dermatoxins antigens is that what he means an antigen is something that is going to elicit a specific immune reaction um i guess maybe that talking about but we don antigen is and liken sclerosis viruses in your immune system they do wake back up and start to replicate and produce their own surface proteins those are antigens and that recognize so i guess maybe that he don causes us and he says tend to occur lower in the body most of the time from the waist down i guess that saying genitals from the waist down most cases of lichen sclerosis do involve the vulva the penis or the skin around the anus but again you do have cases of extra genital lycopene sclerosis it can happen on the skin of like the shoulder the breast i mean anywhere on your body then he goes on to say often confused with eczema this condition is different i i wouldn say that this is commonly confused with eczema maybe contact dermatitis because a lot of times women especially who deal with vulvar liken sclerosis sometimes there using like a lot of vaginal cleansing products wipes and in the differential you dermatitis but um anyway so that you know whatever the skin becomes more fragile that is absolutely true the skin of glycosclerosis is super fragile so much so that you can easily get bruising and blisters form in the affected areas because that skin is so fragile the lycan really refers to the pattern of inflammation in the spot in these areas and the pattern of inflammation is that it comes in and it attacks the junction between the epidermis and the dermis and that is what is referred to as a lycanoid dermatitis basically a band of lymphocytes cells of your immune system coming in and chewing up that area making the skin very fragile it often confused with common dermatitis at first and then later considered to be an autoimmune condition when it doesn improve there is some thought that it might be an autoimmune disease but we know lycan sclerosis doesn itself it requires treatment and the consequences of not treating it are that it can go on to make scar tissue that can impact function and it also can go on in the genital area and you know anal area to put you at risk for squamous cell carcinoma it may be autoimmune we don emphatically that it is an autoimmune disease make no mistake this is a viral condition of the liver he says that with such conviction make no mistake this is a viral condition of the liver viral condition of the liver when i hear that i think hepatitis like hepatitis c virus hepatitis b virus or hepatitis a virus they actually you know there have been a few case reports here and there are patients who do have viral hepatitis and lycosclerosis and so larger studies were done to see hey is there an association with having viral hepatitis and lycosclerosis turned out that in the 61 patients they looked at with lycosclerosis none of them had hepatitis then he goes on to say it either though believing so is a classic medical blunder i find this language cleverly manipulative you know whenever people are selling these kinds of products they often like to call into question the medical community as a whole as though we out here doing a song and dance for big pharma making these blunders for patients dealing with this condition it frustrating oftentimes there in diagnosis and finding the right treatment getting it under control i mean it is a process but throwing in it though believing so is a classic medical blunder it suggests that we don what we diagnosing and treating this disease and that the reason we don that we are just stupidly blaming it on your genetics and that is not that goes on we can identify it once we have the diagnosis and we know how to treat it we going this is just your genetics that not what happens any occurrence through the family line is because of ddt passed from generation to generation there is no gene locus for pesticides cannot inherit pesticides it it genetic code works then of course he closes out the caption find out how to heal in the new york times best-selling book including foods to eat foods to avoid supplements with dosages and delicious healing recipes and cleanse to heal if you don this condition try and imagine what it like it is misery first of all like i said there can be a delay in diagnosis getting it diagnosed can be a challenge biopsies are painful you have these areas of very fragile skin that and it involves your genitals a chronic itch of any kind is being put in the house of pain but in contrast to an itchy elbow an itchy scalp or whatever when your genitals itch or the skin around your anus itches you can in public i mean so this is not only psychologically traumatic to go through but it is socially isolating a lot of these patients end up like you know having to make multiple trips to the bathroom they uncomfortable you have your your vulva is bleeding breaking down incredibly painful sex is painful it your interpersonal relationships it can go on to form scar tissue that starts to really impact the vulva or the penis that fosters a sense of desperation wouldn the perfect opportunity to sell you something that is complete snake oil um you know i have no problem with promoting eating healthy fruits and vegetables y say eat a balanced diet make sure you getting your fruits and veggies in this post just implies that you can you can heal your lichen sclerosis by buying his books and taking the supplements that he sells and that is really misleading advertising for this book this also preys on people who have poor access to health care or people who maybe are resistant a bit mistrustful of medicine and the medical community maybe from prior experiences and people just wanting to take some control of their condition that that is completely normal these are completely normal thoughts for patients to have so if you feel this way i am not invalidating your feelings whatsoever i totally understand why people end up getting sucked into this kind of stuff but it is it is harmful so not only does it prey on those people but by saying that your books your food plan your supplements can heal this condition it means a delay in appropriate treatment and like i said at the beginning of the video a risk of this condition when it involves the vulva the penis or the anus is that you can go on to get squamous cell carcinoma scrolling through the instagram i see a lot of really misleading posts i post here on endometriosis viruses and bacteria feed on toxins and foreign hormones viruses don they infect your cells of your body they don body and it exploit your cells the cells in your body to replicate and to reproduce themselves and to make all the stuff that goes into being a virus for them so they don in order to grow a virus in a lab you have to have cells you can virus that replicates independent of a cell it just doesn don just doesn different types of asthma viral neurological viral neurotoxins inflame vagus and pharonic nerves that asthma toxic heavy metal neurological and emotional neurological inflamed bra he just making up cat disease categories your selling point is that you can help heal chronic disease then that is super misleading for example if you ha if you cream you can your cream heals skin cancer any kind of disease or you can that unless it is an fda approved treatment for that condition like in the case of salicylic acid you can say acne treatment or adaptolene you can say acne treatment but otherwise you can say that something is a treatment or healing that misleading here again ebv is fueled by toxic heavy metals it work this is biology 101. these sales people they will often also speak very authoritatively on medical training and curricula and say that we don this about that or know anything about doctors don nutrition yeah i mean they will always comment like that we don and that we make all of these blunders so they use that to drive a further wedge between their potential customer and the medical compute community if they are telling you that their credentials are that they times best-selling author that they have the number one selling anything on amazon that they have been on insert your favorite podcast or that they have this many followers on social media those are those those things they don their credentials what they speak to is that they are very good at marketing themselves all of those things tell me you are very good at marketing yourself and or your products because that that that can have the number one best-selling book on the new york times that means that you are very good at marketing a book and that that doesn what you were talking about thank you to the person who sent me this post because i liking sclerosis for some time so this was a great opportunity to do so if you are dealing with this or you know someone who is i you know i know it can be very debilitating but do not fall for the claims that a certain diet or supplement is going to heal this process because it can potentially put you at risk for scarring and even squamous cell carcinoma

TIKTOK IS OUT OF CONTROL ?? We need to talk about this /Dermatologist @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p86fE99gGig	Dr Day	well hey guys we need to talk about what has been going on over on tick tock it is actually quite serious you know i know a lot of you guys choose to avoid that platform i think that thing so i like to consider myself your tick-tock liaison but this is actually pretty serious in my opinion so much so that i felt strongly compelled to make this video the fda and the dea have issued joint warnings against online pharmacies that are selling adderall without a prescription adderall if you to treat adhd attention deficit hyperactivity disorder it substance it medications scheduled drugs are those that the government regulates the prescribing of more tightly because of their potential for addiction for abuse so there are two pharmacies online right now cooperfarm.com and premiumlightsupplier.com that they have issued warnings against what was it about a month ago in one of my blogs i mentioned how every time i open that tick tock app i get one of these ads for an adhd medication and i just thought that was really icky and we of these ads and i know what you thinking why are you talking about this this is a skincare channel we here to hear about other things i totally understand but you guys this is actually pretty serious and to be honest i have not seen anyone talking about this and in this video i into why i why i think it awareness of what is going on in terms of these platforms these startups that are marketing really heavily to kids potentially very addictive medications if you have been on tick-tock at all you may have noticed this wave of these startups that are a form of telehealth a direct to consumer service offering basically treatment through telemedicine for adhd the thing that leaves a bad taste in my mouth is when you encounter these ads they are uh i of these ads from the startup done so you can see what i have another paper due tomorrow i it tomorrow i have a paper due tonight i first sentence on my paper and reward myself with a short nap i wake up at 11 pm and i write the most amazing paper the words are flowing through my fingers i life and then 11 59 comes i hit submit and then i realized i have another paper due tomorrow these tick tock ads are really heavily pushing the sales of schedule 2 uh adhd medications like bivance adderall concerta now to be clear i am not saying that these medications are bad if you have adhd that has been diagnosed by your health care provider and they are prescribing you that as part of your treatment and monitoring it that is part of the treatment for that however it becomes a whole separate issue in my mind when you take a controlled substance and you market it heavily on a platform that is largely comprised of young impressionable people the ads in my opinion are super shady because if you look at how they are done first of all when i came across them i didn was an ad because it felt just like any other tick tock being shown to me the nature of it as an ad it wasn to me right away it disclosed in the bottom and you know as i got more used to the app well then it became clear that this is just a recurring ad that i keep seeing creepy thing about their ads is they market like adderall for example almost like a performance enhancing drug not a medication to treat adhd and they make it seem as though this medication is going to write your paper for you it better it benefits and they kind of make it seem like it doesn you actually have adhd which is a huge issue in my mind adhd there are a lot of other things out there that can present with problems with attention and focus that are not adhd and taking stimulant medications like adderall can make you substantially worse poor sleep actually can present with inattentiveness and poor focus a sleep disturbance a sleep disorder maybe you have sleep apnea things like this taking a stimulant is not going to be the best thing if that the cause of your inattention and poor focus some people with other psychiatric illnesses like bipolar disorder for example they can present with poor focus and inattention giving a stimulant to someone with undiagnosed bipolar disorder can actually be pretty dangerous it can unmask their mania if you are having problems with attention with focus if you feel like there something right i highly highly encourage you to see your doctor about this not go to some like sketchy online service like this because like i said it could be another medical problem or it could be adhd you want to know that it actually is adhd there with these types of ads because they make it seem like you can just self-diagnose yourself the ads really blur the line between a medication with a clinical indication and basically a performance enhancing drug these medications actually are very commonly abused by people who do not have adhd and there is a huge drive market what have you of people seeking these either as basically performance enhancing drugs or as something that they can get like maybe from one of these online pharmacies and then sell to their friends it professionals i mean anybody who has a high stress job you will find this creeping its way wayne to study more focus more stay up later there is significant potential here for abuse and it can lead to serious adverse health effects long term convincing kids that they can diagnose themselves with conditions that they don i honestly see this being even more of a problem these days it problematic and unethical to market so heavily to kids convince them that they can self-diagnose and then you know that this is going to be the solution it could be too that they have an underlying learning disability i mean and in which case classroom modifications may be needed or they may need some special attention for their learning disability and this has no role in it i really find the language in these advertisements to be incredibly manipulative they say things like low cost without the stigma they say things like adhd is complicated but getting treatment doesn find that manipulative because it basically kind of paints the doctor as like this barrier to getting good care if you think about it in a way like a lot of people have fears about going to the doctor of cost here in the states because it can be expensive insurance may or may not cover things sometimes you never know if it be covered in the end that scary especially now with inflation people are really on a strict budget they a true fear that this advertisement is preying on and they also prey on the idea that oh adhd as a diagnosis is complicated but treatment doesn and i think they prey on that because they know it can be frustrating to deal with symptoms of inattentiveness uh and so they ahead and get on the medication and it the stigma but there like going to the doctor and saying that you have symptoms of poor attention and focus they you that anything we should be heavily encouraging people to see their health care provider if they have symptoms of poor attention and focus because like i said at the beginning of this video not only could this be a sign of adhd but there are a ton of other health problems both medical and psychiatric that present this way so it important to see your doctor if you have these symptoms not to be ashamed or not to you know feel poorly bad about yourself to me stigma would be like oh you you you must not be trying hard enough stop complaining that to me is stigma language of stigma not definitely see your doctor make sure you don medical problem an evaluation for potential underlying psychiatric issues discuss your symptoms with them you know maybe blood work is needed who knows i mean they poor attention and focus that that fever is a symptom imagine this imagine if there was an advertisement that like oh you of the night that can be complicated you don because it might be too expensive which let this pill come on you guys there are thousands of different potential causes for fever autoimmune disease infectious diseases you know you name it so to just like say that we have the solution to your symptom is really misleading and it makes all kids with these symptoms think that they must have adhd and you really need the evaluation piece to rule out all the other battery of things that could be that could be causing your symptoms i have to make the skin care related in some way because i know that guys follow me but remember i pointed this out in many videos before uh a lot of kids who have eczema have sleep disturbances throughout the night that cause them to be sleep deprived to have poor attention they have problems in school difficulty paying attention and they often do get misdiagnosed once their eczema is treated then their sleep improves and their attention and focus problems improve so there are a lot of things that can lead somebody to have poor attention there why stimulants are a scheduled class of medication they have a high potential for abuse and misuse and can be potentially very dangerous marketing them so heavily to young people many of which are actively seeking these uh you know looking for an avenue outside of their doctor to get these either to abuse themselves or to sell to friends for a profit i mean this can actually turn into a serious epidemic in my opinion the access now with online and people seeking these i think there for something very serious so how is this even possible then that these startups could market a scheduled drug so heavily to young people on tick tock like how is that even allowed if the dea regulates this like like you know a scheduled class of medications how is that possible well these startups are taking advantage of a bit of a loophole so in 2008 congress passed a bill called the ryan hate act basically an 18 year old died of an opioid overdose after getting an opioid from an online pharmacy so this bill was passed basically making it illegal to prescribe scheduled medications on the internet without actually seeing the patient in person personally i cannot imagine prescribing a scheduled class of medications without seeing a patient first and evaluating them to me that is just like i don comfortable ever doing that but whatever however you know the dea actually changed this a bit in 2020 in light of the covid19 pandemic because you know at that point we were all sheltering in place and a lot of people were able to actually go in and see their doctor in person so many doctors switched over to seeing their established patients by a telemedicine so there you can imagine you going to say your psychiatrist for a few years for your adhd medications there you know it be helpful in the setting of lockdown stay-at-home orders for you to be able to see your doctor on the internet that you know and get your medication safely but these startups have taken advantage of that to basically sell you drugs these medications are serious you really don want to just take them without doctor supervision because of the abuse potential and for potential for side effects and not to say that people who actually have adhd do not benefit from these medications they certainly do but they there you want to make sure you actually have this diagnosis while i psychiatrist i will also point out that when it comes to treating adhd it just about taking a stimulant and boom you therapy to just market the drug face forward without any discussion about how adhd is diagnosed i just think it super shady not to mention these ads are basically like you know they perform marketing them as performance enhancing drugs to get you through school to make you test better write your papers faster focus better there even one on there what it adhd meds for the first time i mean to me that is super shady am i does anyone else not find these ads highly suspicious the way they are marketing a scheduled class of prescription medications to young people does anyone else not find this suspicious i know here in the states we have a lot of big pharma marketing that is problematic and of its own but this is even worse so the dea eventually will reverse the loophole i believe when that happen though i don does it these startups change their marketing because a lot of what they the convenience factor of just being able to go online get your stimulants and not have to see a doctor so once the dea says hey you can this without seeing a doctor in person anymore i wonder how they will change their marketing i this can potentially turn turn sour for a lot of people for a lot of young people you know i know a lot of you guys avoid tick tock but i do think it how it can influence people especially young people a lot of college students you know are very impressionable it you whole future ahead of you this can be something very tempting you see other people taking this seemingly being able to study you know focus longer but the problem with these drugs is that you become dependent on them and the drug no longer works so you have to take more of it that pretty dangerous and they have serious side effects too they can kill your appetite get you know make you not able to sleep jittery i mean their their their potential for harm is quite quite high again i want to reiterate that if you have this diagnosis and you take these medications under the supervision of your doctor that indicated for so i in no way want you all to feel like i am stigmatizing that but it that these medications be appropriately prescribed not just obtained over the internet and the fact that there are these online pharmacies now where kids can just go online and get a scheduled class of drugs it potential to be the opioid epidemic part two only with a different drug and so that make this video you guys because i think it is going on let me know in the comments i know like i said many of you guys steer clear of the tick tock platform but let me know in the comments if you have seen these ads i don them to me so heavily all i and skin care routines i have no idea but they are pretty pretty heavy duty marketing and i i get one every time i go on that app i try and limit going on that app but like i said i guys so i have to do my homework anyways y talk about today on the end slate i going to put my last video reacting to you some tick-tock non-sensory so check that out but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it

CHRIS ROCK GETS SLAPPED FOR MOCKING ALOPECIA AT THE OSCARS ?? Dermatologist reacts @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTpHL4qiblU	Dr Day	well hey guys in this video we to be talking about the will smith chris rock slap down i hearing about this but i have a lot of thoughts that i want to share with you guys about what happened all right if you are not familiar there was an awards ceremony chris rock was up at the podium jada pinkett smith was sitting in the front row with will and chris rock made a joke and it went like this g.i jane 2 can apparently jada pinkett smith has hair loss and she it people realize how devastating it is to have hair loss if you it is psychologically very very traumatic does it matter the nature of the hair loss the volume of hair loss or if it is psychologically traumatic to go through any type of hair loss for the majority of people there are a lot of different types of hair loss and you may be wondering what type of hair loss does jada pinkett smith have i actually don know what type of hair loss she has i do think she has given some information about it in prior posts but i honestly don conversation because the take-home point is coping with hair loss regardless of the type is very distressing there are a lot of different types of hair loss i noticed the media kept saying she has a diagnosis of alopecia alopecia to be clear just means hair loss it diagnosis it loss there are many types of hair loss out there one of the more common types that affects both men and women is referred to as androgenetic alopecia i have a ton of videos on this type of hair loss by the way so i will link some of them down below in the description box if you basically a combination of your genetics and the hair follicles being sensitive to hormones it can be treated with things like minoxidil to slow it down and other modalities that i in other videos you also have telogen effluvium hair shedding and that really common right now in the era of covet we are steering seeing a lot of covet related hair loss that is a type of hair shedding from having a viral illness i have a video on that too by the way she will drive home how psychologically distressing it is to cope with just go read the comments of that video you will see people giving their testimonies of how traumatic and devastating the hair loss process has been for them it cosmetics of having a full head of hair it psyche that really makes hair an integral part of our identity you can also develop a type of hair loss called alopecia areata basically that is an autoimmune hair loss or all of a sudden you just randomly have bald patches or all of your hair falls out and it your immune system decides to rebel against you and attack your hair follicles a lot for a lot of people the hair eventually returns and they may have bouts of this again in the future but for some people they lose all their hair and they just never get it back they have to go through a lot of different treatments to try and control it and get the hairs to come back i mean it is psychologically distressing not only the hair loss part of things but just then you know having to go through trying to get your hair back and going through different treatments it i mean it to go through so i really really empathize with anybody anybody who has any degree of hair loss no matter how much it is there hair loss that black women exclusively pretty much get and it is really traumatic to go through it central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia it is a scarring type of hair loss so once the hair follicle scars down from that disease process you can hair to regrow yeah i mean for those patients it because again a lot of our identity is deeply rooted in our hair and so to make comments on someone hair in general it think as a society we need to be a little bit more sensitive about hair loss is not just a devastating problem for women it as well and they get a lot of teasing a lot of comments uh you know bald jokes or whatever and i don realize how emotionally draining that can be for someone because losing your hair it also kind of tied to i don idea that maybe your time here on earth is dwindling once you start seeing your hair receding i mean these types of negative thoughts can enter someone subconscious and then to be made fun of i mean it really can put the person in actually quite a dark place people are going to tease no matter what you cannot go through your life expecting to never be teased picked on made fun of people tease pic pick on people make fun of them it comes usually from a place of insecurity immaturity ignorance or in the case of church rock they paid to make fun of you that is what comedians do and comedians they you know have to pick and choose their jokes carefully and in this case the joke was not well received yeah people make jokes they tease all the time and again it comes from a place of immaturity insecurity ignorance or they people out there it somebody making fun of you is getting paid to unless you show and you sit in the front row you likely going to get made fun of that is a comedian carefully but in her case you know there the open as far as her backstory allegedly you know she has been very forthcoming with her hair loss diagnosis to her audience again i didn deep dive that diagnosis is because i think that actually irrelevant the bottom line is hair loss is psychologically devastating regardless of the type and a lot of people deal with hair loss both men and women and it equally is psychologically damaging to both the three eyes immaturity insecurity and ignorance there are a lot of the three eyes out there you can without encountering that you gonna get made fun of about your physical appearance at some point in your life and so just self-talk positive self-talk that you know words cannot hurt you that these things are not of significance that it likely comes from one of the three eyes that also can help you let go honestly sometimes people are not coming from necessarily a bad place either i mean ignorance we ignorant to many things and so when we learn things you know then we choose better so that can help you to let go of a grudge and just move on from whatever that person said whatever you do when somebody is mocking you i do not suggest doing the following i [Laughter] oh wow wow will smith just smacked out of me wow dude yeah it was a g.i janja keep my wife [Music] yeah violence is never the solution it really is not um so i definitely do not suggest that but honestly any kind of reaction is really just not helpful at all in these situations a lot of times people who are immature and mocking you they are seeking attention a lot of many times do not give them the attention they are seeking uh at all it really is not going to be of benefit to you or to them do not react because reacting only gives them the attention that they it is a form of reward to you know gratify that attention-seeking behavior it can be very difficult not to react when people are making fun of you commenting on your physical appearance your body oh you skinny your rib cage is too large your eyebrows are this why you should know this your eyeshadow looks weird your lipstick looks off you should be wearing lipstick don too much blush on you should wear blush you should do this you should look like this you should change this have you ever considered doing this to your body especially in 2022 with all these social media apps limiting our attention span people seem to suffer from an inability to self-regulate their actions people just pop on say whatever little thing comes into their mind and you know they think that they of reward from it i don give them any any type of attention it really it honestly when you do not do that it can be incredibly empowering it gives you the control to know that you are you are stronger than they are they are the ones who are struggling you can be empathetic to them and move on it empowering to just ignore people commenting on silliness about your physical appearance i mean honestly in 2022 if mother teresa were still alive she could be doing some you know mother teresa type act and there section she should really wear blush she should fix her eyebrows she should lose weight she should gain weight her rib cage is too big i mean that that is the world that we live in you know with these little silos on the internet that people just feel like they can comment whatever whenever it okay to respond with violence for sure but seriously don empowering to just let it slide off your back so hopefully this video clarifies to you all that you know hair loss it on people questions if they want to volunteer that information to you they will but it on with their hair or their eyebrows their eyelashes you know the color of their skin whether they spots you know green spots don it is so psychologically devastating and again it doesn how much hair they you don obviously going bald to be psychologically devastated by hair loss it i mean it many people and then experiencing it is though that nightmare is somehow coming true but let me tell you what i actually think about all this i believe in watching this and seeing it that this is nothing more than a publicity stunt it is nothing more than that and done to evoke outrage and for pr there is no such thing as bad publicity so celebrities and their publicists they you know will tell the line sometimes on what is considered socially acceptable just for more publicity because there thing as bad pr i mean always remind yourself of that when you outraged by something a celebrity did it attention attention-seeking behavior is a rampant in in hollywood i mean that is you know how careers are made is by having eyes on you i mean just watch very carefully the cadence of how all this went on i mean when the joke was initially executed will smith just didn upset about it whatever um and then when i was watching it i was like that doesn him i mean it didn like an actual i mean the it looked choreographed in a sense and i just i i thought that was suspicious so i believe this is nothing more than a publicity stunt for the will smith chris rock celebrity boxing match that i suspect is going to be happening i don this is a big thing right now these celebrity boxing matches they make a lot of money a lot of times it goes to charity which you know sounds great hopefully it does go to charity anyways i mean i really believe that that this was i mean to get people outraged you know pick a side are you on team chris rock or will smith i mean really it is i mean one gives a really offensive joke to people struggling with hair loss so we other one reacts with in a violent way some people may side with him or what i mean it perfect setup for a celebrity boxing match which i guaran you know i would not be surprised if that is what is coming down the pipeline and it these people a lot of money i mean just just think about the reality of this situation if it were actually happening in real life say say for example you go to a comedy show and you sit in the front row and a comic makes an offensive joke and you decide you comic you will be escorted off the premises the police will be called and i mean this is not something that everyday people could ever get away with nor should they and just saying oh so and so made fun of me that i mean the comic was doing what he or she is getting paid to do make jokes so and you were in the audience i mean it not the fact that your feelings are heard does not justify that behavior and you you know can potentially even end up in jail for doing something like that celebrities are not above the law but the fact that there was like no intervention and then not to mention the fact that the other one eventually got an award to me it really is suggests that this was nothing more than a publicity stunt maybe even just for this award ceremony because let these awards ceremonies they boring they used to be really popular when i was growing up but now we have a lot more entertaining things out there like you know tick tock people attention span is way too short for an award ceremony these days so they there to put the attention on it and i believe honestly it stunt for this boxing match that i predict is going to happen so when the boxing match happens what team are you going to be on i mean these are really popular for example what name on youtube you know when i started on youtube this guy had done um what his name jake paul the jake paul he they when i first started on youtube i thought you know he did something really really bad um he made a big big mistake we you can look that up and at the time i thought oh gosh this guy you know his youtube days are over fast forward now 2022 people have forgotten all about that he killing it in these boxing matches making a ton of money and so people you know people get outraged and then they forget and the outrage can fuel the attention for phase two three of a career and these boxing matches are really in my opinion i the the renaissance of someone don actually got slapped i think it was all staged i really do and i don offended angry or mad and i think they the bank as celebrities often do with these stunts just look at all of the publicity i mean i can without seeing a bunch of people videos on this topic so much so that it compelled me to make a video on this topic you guys are probably sick of hearing about it so it evidence that the stunt is working it working because we it let me know in the comments so what you guys think if you are dealing with hair loss understand you are not alone i empathize it doesn losing one extra hair a day versus the hundred that you to lose uh it is it is very traumatic to go through people are gonna be you know weak and make dumb comments just know it them having their own issues i hope this was helpful to you guys if you liked it give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don sunscreen and subscribe i guys tomorrow bye [Music] you	Success
DEATH BY AROMATHERAPY SPRAY, YET SUNSCREEN IS CONTROVERSIAL ?? @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2hCFDz-Ukk	Dr Day	well hey guys in this video we to be talking about how an essential oil spray has been linked to cases here in the u.s of a pretty serious infection burkhold area pseudomalea now typically this is pretty rare in the us there are a lot of cases however in different areas of south asia and when we do have cases here it usually from people who have traveled recently but this all started with a couple of cases actually four of people becoming critically ill going to the hospital two of which died as a result of this but come to find out the source of this infection turns out to be a contaminated essential oil spray that you could buy a walmart from better homes and gardens their lavender and chamomile room spray now walmart has since recalled this product they sprays from the better homes and gardens line the lemon and mandarin lavender peppermint lime and eucalyptus and the sandalwood and vanilla this particular infectious organism causes something called melodosis which is pretty serious in the initial stages it can present with skin infections feeling fatigued and then you can develop lung infections and it actually can become chronic and it tends to relapse it difficult to treat it many antibiotics it causes pneumonia it can make you go into septic shock it can then go into a more kind of sub-acute lung infection that actually resembles tuberculosis it tuberculosis and you can develop a latent infection it can go laden meaning you don for up to 25 years and then you can relapse later on so it serious infectious organism and it bioterror weapon scientists are always trying to come up with like vaccines against and things bearing in mind that it has this potential to to cause serious infection and harm as i said it mostly in areas of south asia cases that we do have here tend to be seen in people who have recently traveled but we had this outbreak here and four people came down with us a four-year-old girl here in texas actually was hospitalized with septic shock and she uh is now actually wheelchair-bound and non-verbal so she lost the ability to speak then there was a case of a five-year-old boy in georgia who developed fatigue and he was hospitalized and then later passed away unfortunately the other two cases were in a 53 year old man from minnesota a 53 year old woman from kansas who actually has passed away she died nine days into her hospital admission so it serious infection and the people who got sick with this they had some serious consequences so come to find out this better homes and gardens room spray it came from india so they think perhaps it was contaminated there and then came over here because nobody who came down with this illness had any history of any recent travel now if you get sick with this and you have underlying medical problems you are more at risk for a severe outcome which the adults who came down with this both 53 year old adults had background medical problems and it interesting how it came here through a contaminated room spray there are a variety of ways in which you can develop an infection from this bacteria through direct contact uh from skin that maybe you have a cut or sore or an abrasion through direct contact with like contaminated soil through ingestion or through inhalation which presumably that is how they came in contact with this either by touching it or inhaling it it challenging infection to treat the organism is notoriously resistant to a lot of anti-infective medications now i wanted to bring this to your attention in case you happen to have a better homes and gardens room spray definitely want to get rid of it they have been recalled and so i wanted to bring it to your attention because i just kind of assume that you know maybe you weren aware of it but also i just find it interesting and how things like this are communicated to us or not communicated to us and i was thinking back to last may when the sunscreen benzene scare broke out all over the media if you don independent lab balashore that set about testing sunscreens for contaminants and they found that benzene was detectable in a variety of sunscreens and this got a lot of media attention and a lot of scare around sunscreens unfortunately and these sunscreens were recalled and at the time i remember the media coverage of it was having people especially on social media saying sunscreens are contaminated with benzene which is a carcinogen the one thing we us from getting skin cancer actually has something that will cause cancer yeah the whole thing the way it unfolded i just felt like it was very nefarious because benzene is a carcinogen but toxicologists reported that the levels that were detected were so so low that it was highly highly unlikely to cause any kind of harm to human health but what it wasn for which benzene was detected benzene was also detected in a ton of other personal care products at the time and later on but she didn coverage it was just the sunscreens that they hyped up and you know caused a lot of uproar about you didn pantene for detectable levels of benzene you didn and conditioner or herbal essence you didn getting recalled i mean you didn that kind of coverage in the media the way they covered the sunscreen contamination likewise old spice was recalled and then hand sanitizers there were actually hand sanitizers for which benzene was detected and those are recalled so we got a lot of different personal care products for which you can find low levels of detectable benzene and toxicologists have come out and said the levels that they are detecting in these products are so trivial so minuscule there is no risk to human health but manufacturers out of an abundance of caution not wanting to get sued are just recalling these products but i just think it never covered the other types of personal care products they just created this fervor this fear around sunscreens yet again and so how does that tie into this burgled area outbreak of the essential oil sprays i think it personally i think there vendetta out there against sunscreens why would you choose to not cover this outbreak which resulted in death and critical illness amongst two people died four people left critically ill i mean one child no longer can speak and his wheelchair bound why would you choose to not cover that alerting people uh to get rid of their walmart essential oil sprays but then instead fear monger around sunscreens why would you not cover the dry shampoo or the or the deodorants that had detectable levels of benzene why would you not cover the fact that toxicologists later came out and found that these that these levels were so low as to not cause any kind of harm to human health and i say this because i create a lot of content around sunscreen and i continue to find it very frustrating to read comments that sunscreens are contaminated with benzene that has become a fixed belief in a lot of people sensationalized media coverage which is not true and people are like well why are these companies recalling them they it being at a more than acceptable low low low level they don there person from these but now people who already are against sunscreen they have another thing in their belt for which they believe is a problem with sunscreen when it those same people will continue to use dry shampoo they will continue to use hand sanitizers and have no problem with it come to find out i mean it fairly commonly found the levels of benzene that you going out and sitting in traffic in your car are like much much much higher than what you would ever come in contact with from sunscreen but that wasn really conveyed to the public in the way initially it was conveyed to them when the val shore people went about doing the testing and identifying this which i just find the whole thing very nefarious so how does that relate then to this burgled area outbreak i just got my mind thinking back to the benzene thing and i just find it interesting how things are communicated to the public certain things are communicated and not and i find that that really really shapes people and sometimes and in many cases people have an idea about something a belief about something and they seek out information specifically to confirm that belief while ignoring everything else and so this is a cloud this everything that i showing you that people who don who are not interested in sunscreen they will laser focus in on the benzene thing and sunscreen ignore everything else about benzene being detectable and all these other products ignore the fact that the benzene has been reported to be at such a low low amount and has never caused any harm to any human health they will ignore the fact that benzene in these products is actually not associated at all with anything sunscreen specific it was found in other things so it a sunscreen specific issue it has nothing to do with like ava benzone oxybenzone octocrylan zinc titanium it independent of the actual sunscreen component piece of of things it kind of low-level contaminant that apparently according to toxicologists and people in the in the industry is like commonplace thing and not harmful to human health to be present at those low levels and people will also ignore the fact that contamination is something that happens in products all the time and it doesn is the specific type of product you know for example spinach gets contaminated with e coli there outbreak they recall the products that are contaminated but you don firm belief that cantaloupe is bad or that spinach is bad and that if you eat these things they digestive illness you realize that it was a contamination like recently i did a real a tick tock reel a little short video um about how sunscreen does not cause cancer and i got a lot of comments well it benzene in it but you don same things about dry shampoo dry conditioner anything like that it already been laser focused that there some kind of problem with sunscreen not only do i find the mainstream media frustrating in terms of how it communicates these things but then you layer on top of that social media and these echo chambers and it just becomes very challenging near impossible to stop the spread of misinformation it is like the worst game of telephone ever did you guys ever play telephone when you were a child where you like whisper something into somebody and they whisper it to the next person and the next person and by the time it gets to the person at the end of the line whatever the original statement was is so miscombobulated that is exactly i feel like that every single day people are not going and looking critically at the facts with the information and they person next to them said who reacted to a headline that wasn full picture and yeah i mean it really really spreads and it becomes very challenging to break down these false fixed beliefs about things and in the personal care realm of things sunscreens body care products i mean it as serious although of course sunscreen is important to human health this can get very serious and other avenues of health in terms of the spread of misinformation and it think kids especially need training and education on now that we don anymore and now that we don uh you know apparently cursive is going away they need to really start developing some kind of curriculum for literacy online and i you know have some of the beginnings of this but how to evaluate information that you get online how to spot bs and how to just pause and say hey i don all the information that i need i going to react to this to you know restrain oneself from reacting to everything because not only is it bad in terms of the spread of misinformation but it on your mental health to consume all of these inflammatory headlines all the time and i like i said i just really think that the way in which these things are conveyed to us it always in a in a haphazard kind of fashion and we never really get closure on things and we moved on to the next headline and many of these false fixed beliefs remain and i think that that is that problem anyways you guys um hopefully this video was informative at any rate at least you know to not be using the better homes and gardens essential oil spray and that thing essential oils they are people who have these beliefs about sunscreen they will put essential oils on a pedestal even if they with a potential bio weapon they the essential oils get a free pass they really do the clean beauty people give essential oils a free pass it doesn matter how many case reports of a toxic photo eruption from an essential oil a burn somebody ingesting them some sort of harmful effect essential oils get a free pass but sunscreen is always going to be always going to be put under this weird microscope people do not approach any other personal care product with this level of scrutiny and skepticism this is really tragic what happened to these people and i hope their families you know i i hope their families get some some monetary serious monetary compensation from better homes and gardens walmart for sure i mean that can you imagine like this is a serious illness and that other thing you know with everything that of lung infection illness fatigue i mean it presents an awful lot like the other thing that not something that as a physician here in the us is necessarily going to be on the top of your differential especially given the current climate with the pandemic somebody coming into the hospital with a lung infection pneumonia you know you other things you know viral infections not this rare thing i mean it be this is the kind of thing that as a medical student you on your differential diagnosis but it like very uh you know it going to be at the forefront but lo and behold it did end up being the cause of these people and ultimately death meanwhile people are still terrified of sunscreen anyways y informative helpful entertaining interesting um if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don i [Music] you	Success
DERMATOLOGIST REACTS TO TIKTOK TANNING NASAL SPRAY @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suFT7ah_2VA	Dr Day	well hey guys we need to talk about the nonsense on tick tock right now i mean there tock but this is dangerous you need to know what your children are being shown on this ridiculous app okay i don if you are aware of this but there been this advertisement or a couple of advertisements going around on tick-tock for this nasal tanning spray some sort of spray that people put up their nose and claim that it gives them a tan yeah they something that you put up your nose instead of having to go through the rigmarole of applying sunless tanner and all that stuff but this is not good it is not a safe thing to use to buy i strongly caution against these and i i spray thing it tyrosine and maybe in some cases the enzyme tyrosinase and allegedly they claiming you know that if you put it up your nose it now milana town i other videos when i was covering mike thurston anyways molana town is an ingredient that is a synthetic version of a hormone that signals to your melanocytes those are the cells in the skin that make pigment it signals to to those cells to make more pigment but this is actually an illegal substance in these types of products so there regulation here and it safe ingredient to just be consuming for the purposes of having a tan the milani chan that people buy online like a lot of bodybuilders buy this i guess you know because they want to have a tan a lot of that stuff it not regulated and you can you can run into some serious negative health effects let alone shooting it up your nose things that you might experience with melanotan include nausea that pretty common actually decrease in appetite spontaneous erections you also can have this like weird thing where you just randomly start yawning and stretching not entirely sure why that happens and melanotan can actually cause some of your freckles moles to darken become abnormal appearing and unfortunately if you had a pigmented skin lesion like a mole that had any inkling of the beginnings of a pre-cancer while ingesting this compound or snorting it up your nose actually could push it over the threshold for you getting getting um skin cancer getting like melanoma for example or you know more serious a more serious change in your mole that would require it to be removed excised you have to have a surgery depending on the size of the mole i mean you down you the monotone melanochan also can elevate your blood pressure and that people don very seriously because it thing that is just there in the background most people don have high blood pressure they don necessarily feel that they have high blood pressure but it thing to be mucking around with and so that is another risk of moana town it can make you flush too flushing is really common with milanitan so these are things that are known side effects of atlanta channel like i said in the mike thurston video it people a lot of people in bodybuilding purchase it from these sites online it not regulated you can have some serious consequences but snorting it up the nose is going to be more i think if it was more potent it bloodstream more rapidly but because melanitan is a synthetic version of the hormone that leads to pigment production it does in fact lead to a pretty deep dark tan but some of these drops also have tyrosine in them there evidence that ingesting consuming injecting snorting inhaling whatever tyrosine leads to pigmentation i just you know there likewise snorting the enzyme tyrosinase i think some of these claim to have is not going to help you get a tan either the problem the main issue i have with these not only are these ingredients potentially harmful they not regulated but here we about something that you spray up your nose and there is a lot more potential for some serious adverse health outcomes when you snort something up your nose that is not regulated i mean i know most of you guys out there are not going to go down this path but it know what the youngins are being fed as far as misinformation on this platform because it is so popular and it reaching so many people as a matter of fact if you put in nasal tanning spray into tick-tock it got like millions of hits of people viewing this stuff so it reaching a large audience it influencing a lot of young people the problem with this nasal spray too is like you can cause some serious damage to the mucosa in your nose you have these little things called celia that are responsible for like moving mucus around i know that pleasant thing to be thinking about but those can be seriously damaged by inhaling stuff through your nose you should never i mean i assume you guys know this but you shouldn things i know i the choir that you shouldn things but again this is getting to a large young vulnerable audience i really can damage the lining of your nose and that can cause problems with clearing mucus you can have uh persistent like post nasal drip this you know mucus plugs and things it can damage your sense of smell some of the ingredients could potentially be caustic too to the nose um you know people who use illicit street drugs that they snort up their nose they can perforate their nasal septum and i would worry that a similar risk could happen with these nasal sprays which we really don know much about what exactly is in them when you buy something like this you know they may advertise it as having i don it but it it too the safety of which we don how okay it is to be putting that up your nose let alone uh your respiratory tract your lungs it could cause some serious damage to your lungs potentially so yeah this is really dangerous and i surprised that these companies are allowed to exist let alone be so aggressively marketing to young people on tick tock yeah i that that these companies are marketing this aggressively but so not only is all of this like jaw dropping oh my god i can promoted to young kids so heavily but there are young women on tick tock showing themselves using this and get this getting in a tanning bed you guys never ever ever get in a tanning bed and these young people on tick tock they are really they claim that the nasal spray is going to even make the tanning bed tan even more dark deep and get them a tan faster this is so dangerous tanning beds they should be illegal honestly and in a lot of countries they are tanning beds are essentially a carcinogen tanning beds are to the skin what cigarettes are to your lungs going in a tanning bed just one time increases your risk for a variety of skin cancers tremendously 20 for melanoma 67 for squamous cell carcinoma and 29 for basal cell carcinoma women who use a tanning bed just once before the age of 30 increase their risk of melanoma which is the most deadly form of skin cancer six times that of those who do not so it promoting to young people in fact the fda actually requires a warning label on tanning beds that they are you know carcinogenic deadly going in a tanning bed not only increases your risk for skin cancer so much but it rapidly ages your skin making it leathery one of the reasons why tanning bed is so deadly i mean tanning there safe tan to be clear tanning is a form of skin injury so going out laying out in the sun and getting a sun tan you basically injuring your skin that tanning response is an injury response it which penetrate the skin really deeply and destroy collagen and that got wrinkling but they also set the stage for skin cancers but with a tanning bed it they get from the dosage that you actually get from the sun and so that is why they tan the skin but they also deliver a mega mega mega mega dose of deadly destructive damage essentially and dna damage they damage the dna in your skin cells so it the uva rays that come from the sun that is why they elevate your skin cancer risks so much because they delivering this mega megadose of uva there beds yeah some people are under the misconception that using a tanning bed will help them with their vitamin d but it vitamin d synthesis in the skin comes from the uvb rays not the uva rays and the uva rays actually compromise your skin vitamin d so yeah that is definitely a myth surrounding the tanning beds and this is something that people don realize young people especially you can actually become addicted to the tanning bed people don tanning is something that you can become addicted to because when you tan the skin releases opioid-like chemicals that you can actually become addicted to that does it feel so good to have a tan well because the skin releases opioid-like compounds about 20 percent of women between the ages of 18 and 30 who use a tanning bed exhibit signs of addiction and there was a nice study showing that uh people who had this tanning addiction they actually go through withdrawal like when they put them in a tanning bed that had fake bulbs in it no no uv just you know fake bulbs they actually went through withdrawal there for addiction with tanning and it is a true thing that is why you know you see people who do not look so great their skin is really really leathery and they just keep having to go back to the tanning bed and so it something that needs more awareness people don actually addictive the sad thing is is that tanning salon employees misinform customers this was actually um demonstrated in a study a while ago that tanning bed employees like i don if it tell the clients young women that going in a tanning bed is actually healthy and of those surveyed 90 of the employees said that indoor tanning was not a health risk for a teenage girl with a pale skin type and it deadly you guys and in my opinion as a dermatologist there should be more regulation around the access to tanning beds by minors in the u.s other countries they them and there is a lot of push for more legislation unfortunately it is difficult to implement this um to police it to make sure that these salons are adhering to it but yeah young people accessing a tanning bed it same as young people smoking cigarettes i mean they are both carcinogens for sure getting in a tanning bed can put you at risk for premature death not to mention injuries you can sustain an enchanting bad including burns damage to the eyes and some people lose consciousness in a tanning bed there are people coming to the er with loss of consciousness from a tanning bed so not only is it unsettling that you have this compound that people are snorting up their nose potentially damaging their nasal membranes their lungs putting themselves at extreme risk for skin cancer by going in these tanning beds but then the people promoting them say some pretty unsettling things this one gal said i ugly so if this is going to take 10 years off my life i don really alarming and unsettling statement to read this gal is obviously going to you know influence many young people and not only does this not only is it scary like that appearance trumps health but it also is unsettling in that this idea that having pale skin is undesirable it u.s for sure i know in many asian countries it here in the us this idea that having a deep dark town is synonymous with health it needs that idea needs to be broken down and a lot of it continues to be perpetuated by these people in the tanning tanning industry i just can that something like this even exists and has somehow flown under the radar of i don potentially very dangerous these these substances to be marketing to young people it i mean we from tick tock like the let jet pen and inject ourselves with filler i mean there are a lot of bogus things on tick tock some things are harmless but you can see like some things really have the potential to cause serious harm to human health on that app and they just it becomes viral and people are easily influenced especially young people so i wanted to make this video bring this to you guys to your attention because you know i know you guys a lot of you all have told me that you don use tik tok which i think is good but young people do if you have young children you know this is the kind of thing that could be shown to them and it can be very dangerous and it just perpetuates misinformation about the health risks around tanning if you want to have a tan just use sunless tanner sunless tanner with dihydroxyacetone is more than safe to put on the skin it is far safer than a uv mediated tan from the sun or from god forbid from a tanning bed i mean you really are doing some serious damage to your skin rapidly accelerating skin aging and putting yourself at risk for skin cancer by going in a tanning bed melanotan is not something that you should be taking because it as a you know supplement that people are buying on these different online sites you can even put yourself at risk for depth from taking that uh or you know all these other side effects i mean just things that the lines that people are willing to go to especially when influenced by social media it is mind-boggling but just use a sunless tanner i mean it laborious and a pain and some of them make you look orange but honestly the milana town does not actually give a very natural looking tan for many people either i don this love affair with the deep dark tan i don unfortunately and i do realize that when you have tan skin from like sunless tanner which i think is more than fine to use it does camouflage things like varicose veins and stuff like that so just use those they they don uh you know worst case scenario you get a contact dermatitis from them much safer than snorting and you know unregulated substance up your nose or taking some pill that you got on line or getting in a tanning bed or worse yet combining all of these extreme measures to to get a tan very dangerous definitely not trying to create an echo chamber here by any means but i agree with me on this one right like please tell me you all agree with me on this that this is not good to be snorting random substances from a tick-tock ad ah i hope this gets shut down i really do i hope it gets shut down these companies are sketchy anyways you guys if you all enjoy these types of videos on the end slate i my more recent videos reacting to some more tick tock shenanigans but if you like this one give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen and subscribe i to you guys tomorrow bye [Music] you	Success
Debunking TIKTOK SKIN CARE RETINOL MISINFORMATION // Dermatologist @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6IEPFVFOTs	Dr Day	well hey guys many of you have tagged me recently and some posts on tick tock about retinols where the creators are giving out some interesting information that i thought i might debunk in today video if you are new here welcome my name is andrea and i am a board-certified dermatologist so the myth that i keep seeing is that retinols are photosensitizing and that is a myth but first of all what is a retinol retinol is actually a family of ingredients it term for a variety of different ingredients that you either apply to the skin or you take by mouth from a prescription and these ingredients include retinol serums that you might buy in the drugstore they include prescription retinoid creams and gels like tretinoin tesaritine and they include medications that you take by mouth like accutane and they have many many benefits for the skin they have anti-aging benefits they can improve collagen synthesis in the deeper layers of the skin remove sun damage smooth out wrinkles and fine lines the the topicals and accutane are acne treatments as well so they ingredients photosensitizing they in the true sense of the word photosensitizing they they actually have been shown and are well established to help your skin resist some of the damage that occurs upon exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun now of course you need to wear sunscreen and protect your skin from the sun retinoid doesn protect you from the sun in that sense but in conjunction with sun protection retinoids can mitigate some of the damage that happens in your skin upon exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun specifically they can inhibit the activation of that enzyme family matrix metallic proteinases that destroy collagen and retinoids can also remove sun damaged skin cells but they don sensitize your skin to the sun or to uv rays from the sun people throw around the term photosensitivity a lot but it important to understand what exactly that means photosensitivity is a type of skin reaction that happens upon exposure to uv rays there are actually two main kind of categories of photosensitivity there and there and so you can develop a photo toxicity to an ingredient that you put on your skin or that is taken by mouth into your body or you can develop a photo allergy to an ingredient that you put on your skin or that is taken up by the body so let break those two down a little bit what is photo toxicity photo toxicity happens as a result of direct cellular and tissue injury upon exposure of the phototoxin to uv rays so it you by a window and uva rays come in through the window gloss and it causes a reaction in the skin that results directly in cell damage and tissue damage phototoxicity can happen in anyone provided they are exposed to said phototoxin and uv it of the two that leads to the reaction phototoxicity develops a few hours after you are exposed to uv phototoxicity can happen because ingredients touch your skin and you are exposed to uv or it can happen because you ingest ingredients that are phototoxic and they localize to the skin or metabolites of them localized to the skin and upon exposure to uv you develop photo toxicity a classic example of a photo toxic eruption is something called phytophotodermatitis it can happen if you get lime juice on your skin it basically from compounds in certain plants that when you go in the sun after those those compounds have touched the skin it causes a blistering rash lots of medications can cause phototoxicity certain antibiotics can cause an exaggerated sunburn when you go out in the sun or when you sit by a window if you are taking them so that phototoxicity let allergy the other type of photosensitivity this is different in that it doesn requires you to become sensitized to the ingredient either that you put on your skin or that you consume by mouth and it involves your immune system whereas phototoxicity does not phototoxicity is just a toxic reaction causing destruction to tissues photo allergy involves your immune system causing a reaction in the skin it called a photo allergy because the uv rays convert the ingredient or metabolite to the allergen meaning if you don not exposed to uv then the ingredient or metabolite is not a problem it rays hit the skin and convert it to the allergen that you have become sensitized to and again it doesn everybody just in those who have become sensitized to the ingredient and there are some ingredients and medications that are common offenders for people becoming sensitized to and subsequently developing a photo allergy so when we thinking about ingredients that come in contact with the skin and you say the word photosensitizing you talking about it as a photo toxin or a photo allergen and guess what retinols are neither of those things there uv induced activation of the drug meaning you put retinoid on and you go out in the sun and it doesn it into an allergen or a toxin we do photo testing of patients who are on oral retinoids like accutane or psoriatin or of patients who are putting retinoids on the skin they have perfectly normal photo testing there toxicity or photo allergy to these ingredients so to be clear retinoids are not photosensitizing so why do we keep hearing that they are and in fact if you read the package insert of tretinoin it speaks to being careful in the song and not using it with other photo sensitizing things so why is that in there in the very beginning when tretinoin was first in use people did think that it caused people to be more sensitive to the sun but in reality what we learned is that as you guys know if you tretinoin or any other form of topical vitamin a when you first start using it it causes a lot of irritation because it starts thinning out the dead stuff on the top of your skin and as it does that you develop irritation and the degree of irritation that you develop can vary from person to person if you have a lot of pre-existing sun damage on your skin it particularly in those areas because it kind of cutting through a lot of noise on the top of your skin and that irritation makes you very sensitive to things that you put on your skin and to environmental exposures and that includes wind cold temperatures and sun but it photosensitized so your skin can be a little bit more sensitive when you go out in the sun or exposed to cold or wind but it has created a toxic effect upon exposure to uv and it allergy so it photosensitivity meaning the threshold amount of uv rays that you have to come in contact with to begin to cause damage to your skin is not changed by the use of topical retinoids so it sounds really technical but it is an important distinction to make and in the beginning when we were first using retinoids um you know that was the idea that yeah maybe they research later has shown that they are not in fact photosensitizing another reason why people will feel more sensitivity when using retinoids is because they thin out the dead layer on the top of the skin that but in doing so it allows for more easy penetration of ingredients that may be irritating and it allows sun uv rays to penetrate the skin in a more even fashion but it doesn your skin a small but important distinction so this brings me to kind of the next issue that i see per idea that i see perpetuated a lot online that that people think now because it is because i think wrongly that it is photosensitizing they also think that they need to wash it off in the morning if you before and then cleansing with water just water the morning after you opening yourself up to photo damage redness and pigmentation water is not going to thoroughly remove your retinol and you don tretinoin or any other type of retinol off the following morning so i some recent posts saying don to only to wash your face in the morning because it retinol and that not true at all you don the way retinols work is they get into the skin they bind to receptors so they get into your skin they bind to receptors to change gene expression so you can it you know it doesn wash up what are you washing off you can occurring and that that outcome of retinoids by the way and washing the face off in the morning it anything washing the face the following morning is going to just lead itself to more irritation because when you wash whether it be with water or a gentle cleanser you do disrupt your moisture barrier and that does lead to more dryness which can worsen the irritation that you experience in the beginning so if anything in the first few weeks it prudent to try to not even wash your face at all including water only when you use retinoid i mean it if you want to do that or not but it can because you just no need to necessarily be washing your face twice a day um and so to wash it first thing in the morning in an effort to remove the tretinoin there no reason to do that it doesn sense you you natural moisture factors that help you handle the irritating side effects of retinoids a lot of people might be confused and think well why is it that we tretinoin on at night than if it photosensitizing the reason is that many forms of topical vitamin a are sensitive themselves to uv and degrade upon uv exposure rendering them ineffective some forms of tretinoin are photosensitive but it they don doesn is why you are told to put it on at night time that being said with innovation of topical vitamin a derivatives many forms are actually stable in the presence of uv and are more than fine to actually use in the morning as a matter of fact a dapolin brand named differin can be used in the daytime it doesn more sensitive and adaptolene in contrast to tretinoin is not photosensitive so you can safely put that on technically during the day so that night and i also wanted to point out you know i always get questions especially you know coming up on spring break which can some of you live in cold climates or you know with summer vacation people always reach out to me and ask hey i on vacation how soon before going you know to the beach or to cancun or whatever should i stop my retinoid and there it gonna cause a photo toxicity um and so there about it that way in fact having the retinoid there while you go on vacation provided you from the sun and you staying out too long well it actually help lessen the overall burden of damage that uv causes to your skin so if anything you know you want to be using it while you are on a beach vacation so to clarify no retinols are not photosensitizing no you don following morning number three the reason you are told to apply retinol at night is because some forms of topical vitamin a are photosensitive but they are not photos they don photosensitive they we tell you to apply them at night and number four you do not need to concern yourself with stopping retinol or retinoid before a like beach vacation they are not gonna they you at risk for a sunburn per se it you going out and spending too much time in the sun that for sun damage so as a reminder when it comes to protecting your skin from the sun you need to wear sunscreen reapply it every two hours while you are outdoors and you need to rely on things like sun protective uh clothing hats umbrellas and just don in the sun all day that your skin so i hope this video was helpful and kind of clarifying some common myths and misconceptions and on the end slate i of some common retinol myths that i debunk so check that out if you are new to using a retinol or prescription you know tretinoin or tisera teen so check that out but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen and subscribe i guys tomorrow bye [Music] you	Success
There is NO SAFE AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL, ACCORDING TO SCIENCE @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMgqljGcl0U	Dr Day	well hey guys in this video we to be talking all about alcohol and no not alcohols and skin care products although i do have a video on that which i interested but we about alcoholic beverages about a year or so ago i made a video discussing how consuming alcohol in excess can have some pretty negative consequences to the health of your skin people who are heavy drinkers have more prominent signs of skin aging deeper wrinkles alcohol depletes the skin of its antioxidant reservoirs so it gets in the way of proper healing and barrier recovery leading to more dryness but you probably heard someone along the way say alcohol in moderation it heart well a few days ago the world heart federation came out with a policy statement saying that there is no amount of alcohol consumption that can be considered good for your heart there no amount of safe alcohol consumption they really felt that it was imperative to speak up about the negative health consequences of consuming alcohol as well as the socioeconomic harms that come with alcohol consumption now their policy statement largely referenced a study that was published in the landsat this study showed that globally alcohol was responsible for 3 million deaths in 2016. it make that there is no such thing as a safe amount of alcohol for your heart i mean basically they amount of alcohol is too much alcohol consumption has been linked with a variety of adverse health effects it is associated with cardiovascular disease coronary disease um stroke atrial fibrillation which is a problem with the rhythm in the heart heart failure cardiomyopathy and hypertensive heart disease it linked with a variety of cancers they going so far as to say that if you adult and you don that seems a little bit intense let me know in the comments what you think about that recommendation i mean is there a reason to start drinking i guess when you really think about it no but they also say that if you are an adult and you do drink to talk to your health care provider about healthier habits which is a little nebulous and vague anyways aside from heart disease cancer and a variety of other health conditions you also cannot ignore the societal harm that comes from alcohol consumption obviously motor vehicle accidents alcohol is responsible for a lot of injuries a lot of time missed from work and it responsible for violence violence in the home domestic violence children whose parents are alcoholics addicted to alcohol they are much more likely to also consume alcohol and excess as an adult they also point out that in studies it has been shown that individuals with of lower socioeconomic status suffer disproportionately more harm from alcohol consumption than those of higher socioeconomic status now to what extent that could be explained by simply less more restricted access to preventative care for example if we talking about high blood pressure which they point out that alcohol increases the risk of hypertensive heart disease with high blood pressure it something that you really realize happens unless you are going to the doctor and it is detected i mean unless you have a home blood pressure monitor and it top of but most people you know are who have high blood pressure unless it picked up in the doctor often blindly unaware and so that goes untreated and well then you are more likely to have adverse effects from alcohol consumption but they also say that one percent of the gdp in high and mid-income countries is spent on alcohol associated costs including to the criminal justice system and lost productivity does anybody else pick up on the irony of me talking about alcohol and motor vehicle accidents and then all of a sudden there engine and drag racing whether you want to admit it or not it cannot be ignored that alcohol has negative health consequences and it also brings about harm to society um you know you lose your inhibitions and you more likely to engage in high risk behaviors when you that put you and others at risk but let me know in the comments do you think that it is a bit of a a stern statement to say that there is no such thing as a safe amount of alcohol for the heart it seems a little bit conflicting though because if you look at areas of the world which are referred to as the blue zones that have a longer lifespan some of these blue zones associated with where the people have a long life uh they longevity some of these areas they regularly are consuming wine um or alcohol as part of their culture so if it is that harmful then how are these people living probably due to other factors in their lifestyle they these areas be eating fruits and vegetables getting exercise managing their stress so it is more you know more than the presence or absence of alcohol as a predictor of their overall health in these people plus it could also be a you know genetic influence but to say that i think it is a little bit strict to say that there is no safe amount of alcohol especially given you know how do you explain these populations that live so long and continue to consume alcohol granted they are not consuming alcohol in excess and there also are some other studies albeit their observational studies that do show some benefit to moderate amounts of alcohol consumption for things like heart disease they they have flaws but you know to say that there is no safe amount for your heart so i really think pattern of consumption matters a lot people who binge drink we already know people who binge drink large amounts of alcohol they we already know that has a lot of harm alcohol it is a toxin and so if you that is too much is it as harmful though to your heart to your overall health if you have a tiny small amount like say with a meal on a daily basis i really think pattern matters i also think type of alcohol matters as well they don this study doesn of alcohol and i believe that matters as well red wine for example has resveratrol which is an antioxidant a flavonoid and is associated with health benefits of course you can get that from eating grapes you don red wine but my point is this study from the landsat it doesn it doesn consumption and it doesn type of alcohol consumed i do find it a little interesting that they mentioned that if you are an adult who healthy and you currently consume alcohol like talk to your doctor about healthier habits i found that incredibly vague um a moderate amount is considered or what is safe or recommended to be okay is two drinks per day for men and one drink or less for women so what constitutes a drink then in the u.s it a 12 ounce beer eight ounces of malt liquor five ounces of wine one and a half ounces of a liquor that a shot when you go out to a restaurant or to a bar there is more of a standardization with which they serve you but again that too can vary from location to location um but at home you know i think all of this goes out the window if you are say having a party or something in your home or you know you bit too much you can easily go over these amounts alcohol removes inhibitions all of them and so how likely are you to restrict something when you are disinhibited and i also think it from person to person depending on your genetics and your race even as a matter of fact many asian people actually many asian asians have a lower risk of alcoholism and it factors one may be cultural and two genetics because many asians have uh mutations in the genes that encode the enzymes that that metabolize alcohol so they don and they get a build-up of one of the intermediary metabolites it acetyl aldehyde and that leads to flushing they turn you know turning red nausea vomiting headache i mean they feel it makes you feel horrible so there incentive there to to drink they have more of an immediate adverse effect whereas others who metabolize alcohol you know better well they don day so there negative association there roughly half of chinese japanese and korean people do have these do have these uh gene mutations in the enzymes that metabolize alcohol and are at risk for this so you know for them the recommendation probably shouldn less um because their you know genetics and what-have-you they don alcohol as well and that build-up intermediary the acetaldehyde it toxic i mean it makes you feel very ill and then there are some people who probably just should not drink at all either because they have an underlying medical condition maybe a history of some sort of heart problem but the other thing that definitely needs to there needs to be more messaging around is how harmful alcohol in any amount honestly can be for people who have mental um psychiatric illness depression anxiety bipolar disorder i honestly think that alcohol this is just my opinion i think alcohol should come with a warning about it because for people with mood disorders it really can be quite quite a dangerous mix not to mention medications they may be taking you know interact with alcohol so i you know alcohol comes with a warning about not drinking during pregnancy uh which i didn i assume people know you don drink alcohol in pregnancy because it will cause you know it can cause quite a bit of fetal harm so yeah there saying is like i think that alcohol should also come with a warning about like how it could actually put you at risk for worsening of an underlying mood disorder i mean for sure and people who have mood disorders they are more likely to turn to alcohol to self-medicate and it actually then worsens their underlying mood disorder and can really put them in a lot of harm not only for developing alcoholism but you know for having their mental health deteriorate in a really really harmful way so i i think that alcohol should kind of come with a warning for that that though then there how our society views alcohol it know i i made the decision a while ago that i was not going to drink alcohol i simply don but honestly i have to say it can be challenging in certain social situations because people almost react negatively to you if you say oh no i don unless you they often ask you are you pregnant if you then it like you better have a documented allergy to it or something or people are just like a lot of times very uncomfortable with that which you know i guess is just some kind of social conditioning and it makes it can be a very tricky thing to navigate there is you know it that there need alcohol to have a good time or that it social gatherings and so you know it fine to have that and to enjoy it or whatever but like if you choose to abstain it can actually be very awkward and you can almost feel like pressured into drinking even if you don so it something that people need to be aware of to not judge other people for you know choosing to drink or not drink you know it behavior to be so worried about what other people are doing all the time you know this world heart federation they propose some ideas about you know restricting access they also suggest restricting ads and you know sponsorship type promotional things around alcohol which i do think is helpful because honestly ads do heavily influence human behavior and seeing an ad for alcohol is definitely something that could trigger somebody to want to drink alcohol yeah i think it interesting on youtube i have seen several videos where the video is sponsored by like a wine subscription service or something and you know i don do think it whenever there um you know we that to you guys uh verbally and then we upload the video to check a box and that always see at the top of the video you paid promotion so you know there portion of the video that an ad done by by the by the youtuber and that know you need to have that but there nothing that clues the person into the fact that there of alcohol um and i think i don that is something that would be helpful to people to know because some people deal with alcoholism they abstain they have intense cravings and i think you know knowing that there was going to be an ad at least for alcohol you know they would click out of the video and that might help them you know almost like a trigger warning so anyways i wanted to share this with you guys because i think it interesting you know it does you know obviously it can translate into skin because as i alcohol in excess it definitely you know can lead to skin problems for sure internally there are a lot more things that alcohol can damage your heart you know obviously your liver can put you at risk for cancer or consuming alcohol in excess and you know our skin is kind of a clue that it probably not the healthiest behavior to be doing too too much i think there needs to be more conversations around what constitutes healthy alcohol consumption i do know that with you know everything over the past two years with a lot of the stay-at-home orders and all the stress i do know that people unfortunately turn to alcohol as a coping strategy i have also noticed over the past i five or six years maybe even worse with the the lockdowns and and everything perhaps as a coping strategy i have seen a lot of kind of glorification of drinking for moms and i think that is a that is a concerning slippery slope that i think people need to be careful of you know women need to be careful of of that if you find that you know you you to cope with the stresses and demands of motherhood um that is a red flag i mean it means that you you pressure too much stress and you turning to a substance that you know definitely is harmful to your heart and your overall health can put you at risk for a lot of adverse health effects anyways you guys i wanted to share this with you all let me know in the comments what you think do you think the world heart federation is being a little bit too premature with saying that there no such thing as a safe amount of alcohol for your heart um or are you in favor of you know being more restrictive with how we view promote consume alcohol as a society anyways you guys i hope you liked this video if so give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen and subscribe i to you guys tomorrow bye [Music] you	Success

MY UNPOPULAR OPINION: SKIN CARE IS NOT FOR FUN @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1pel3GpaNg	Dr Day	well hey guys i have an unpopular possibly controversial opinion that i came to the realization i hold over the past few weeks after some self-reflection and that is i don necessarily intended to be fun you hear it repeated all the time skin care is supposed to be enjoyable it form of self-care it relaxing i disagree you know i hear it repeated over and over again and in fact i even caught myself saying it in a recent video hey skin care is meant to be enjoyable but i don that it is for all people in my opinion skin care isn that you do for font it form of healthcare cleansing is basic hygiene and when we products sunscreen is intended to protect you from the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation that not only lead to the visible signs of skin aging but put you at risk for skin cancers so i don pleasurable or things that you should pursue for leisure i think they are a part of healthcare now of course there is a whole community of people on the internet who love skin care products and that is their hobby they love going and shopping for skin care they love having their skin care routine doing their masks toners it is a form of self-care for those people it is a form of relaxation but the reality is that the case for everybody a lot of people a lot of you guys who watch my channel i don skin care that much you view it as just wanting to take good care of your skin for health purposes you necessarily interested in you know changing things up all the time you not necessarily interested in the latest greatest product or maybe you have a skin condition and you needed some help choosing products that wouldn aggravate that condition and once you find those well you with life and never look back again and i do think there is a large segment of the population who does not give a flying rat to make the statement that skin care is supposed to be fun it relaxing sure it can be but i don think that that i think many people out there view skin care as healthcare similar to brushing your teeth you know there hygiene community out there maybe there is if so let me know because i personally derive a lot of pleasure from brushing and flossing my teeth and i love all different kinds of dental floss whatever i would be all up in that community if it existed but most people they don really view brushing their teeth necessarily as like this hobby form of leisure it out of habit and they recognize the value of it for the health of their gums for not getting cavities and for not having bad breath that kind of an immediate gratification aspect of brushing your teeth and it just a habit most most people are not thinking about their oral care um you know to the level of detail that the internet has become hyper focused on skin care and the right products and the right ingredients i would say for a lot of people out there skin care is not a hobby it just a a basic necessity it hygiene and health care especially when we think those people when they come into the skins care space online seeking out information about what sunscreen you know what ingredients or you know or if any should i be avoiding i think it can be very overwhelming and frankly a bit alienating to come into this space and you know not necessarily derive the joy and pleasure i really think it perpetuated this idea that skin care is supposed to be relaxing and enjoyable but in reality for a lot of people i would say skincare is not only not relaxing it can actually be a source of distress a lot of people have sensitive skin or rosacea and many skin care products elicit a very uncomfortable sensation and that is something that there is a large group of people seeking out information about skincare online who have very sensitive skin and skin care products can be a source of discomfort distress and they relaxing and so i think for those folks in particular the skin care space can be oftentimes a little bit alienating when you don this have this in it does this have that in it without being made to feel like you are like in some kind of camp of fear-mongering ingredients you guys know i do not advocate the clean beauty mentality of fearing this ingredient viewing that ingredient whatever but i never fault anybody who comments in my section in my comment section or ask me a question about certain skin care ingredients because i think genuinely most people just want to keep their skin healthy and they don skin that might irritate it or cause these symptoms that they may have experienced in the past you know as a child growing up with eczema i know firsthand how uncomfortable skin care products can feel the burning and stinging sensation of moisturizers it you know it is a miserable sensation so i think if you before you know to you and your world you may think well of course skincare is this relaxing thing but if you bad experiences with things coming in contact with your skin moisturizers cleansers i mean it really can almost make you very nervous to try out a new product or to you know try things out because you know firsthand that a lot of things are just gonna cause problems for you i don self-care i think it is a form of health care basic hygiene cleansing to remove dirt possibly pollutants you know we know that people who live in urban areas with a lot of pollution they are they ten you know people in those areas they tend to have more stubborn acne in comparison to people who don highly polluted areas so cleansing we have come to learn is even more an important aspect of acne control not only that but for removing oil so you know acne it important part of managing that condition as basic cleansing of course everybody needs to cleanse their skin to remove dirt oil and debris it is a it is a need a lot of people live in a very very dry climate you spend a lot of your time maybe even your occupation is outdoors you cold winter winds harsh sun you know drying climates dirt all sorts of things you know you coming a lot of a lot of times people like that they to the skincare space seeking out products to help with those exposures but not necessarily even because they want this to be a hobby or a source of pleasure they to keep their skin healthy and move on with their lives i think a lot of people exist out there like that and they just you know passing through the skin care space online and i think it can be very almost alienating for those folks to be hearing well skin care is a form of self-care and it pleasurable and it going to be a source of pleasure for all people and that is okay i don that the intention of skin care is pleasure i think it is a form of health care now of course there are tons of products out there on the market that claim all sorts of things like you know helping to ward off the signs of aging and none of them are really you know strictly rooted in evidence necessarily or necessary by any means for human health those are cosmetics and you know skincare it space where in reality it and they but basic skin care and basic skin care routine is actually very important for the health of your skin and that need the components of that will vary with age from person to person and as the skin care market increasingly becomes more and more and more saturated i think that the idea of skin care as healthcare i think it just gets lost in the noise because there are so many superfluous components these days that are not necessary so basic skin care it is a form of health care you of your largest organ system and your skin it is exposed to a lot of things it keeps you protected from the outside world you can be pursuing skin care for healthcare reasons just because you healthy you interested in these elaborate routines you don is a form of relaxation you in and out just like brushing your teeth every morning probably and for that reason you know i think it is a bit of an overstatement to say that skincare is supposed to be relaxing again going back to those people who have things like rosacea eczema skin care can actually be very uncomfortable and so you know we never want products to be that way so you know the hope and some of the videos that i make is to help those individuals navigate the skin care aisle to choose products that are least likely to put them in the house of pain i do think skincare online has gotten to a point where it has become a bit of a echo chamber type community i made a video on this a while ago anytime you have a community online you have to be you know careful it becomes an echo chamber and i don on the internet views skin care as a form of pleasure or as a leisure activity they health reasons to keep their skin healthy and yes skin care products can help to keep your skin healthy sunscreen for sure and basic cleansing is basic hygiene the other reason why i feel as though this whole idea that skin care is supposed to be pleasurable and a form of self-care i think it has become intertwined with the corporatization of self-care and that you know the idea that we can make people feel as though they need all of these things as a form of caring for themselves that they need to spend a lot of money that they need to have these products that they need this and that and the other i really just think that it uh dilutes out the value of a basic skincare routine why i video is i know a lot of you guys watch my channel you probably not even actually watching this video because i have a lot of people who view my content they come here seeking skin care recommendations and once they find what they are looking for they not interested in skincare they either leave or maybe you guys watch my vlogs on the weekend and you like those but a lot of people pass through and that great like my hope is to help people find good skincare products that help them and that they get along well with and a lot of people just end up moving on so i i don necessarily a pleasurable activity for everybody i think it is simply just something that people are looking to get in the habit of to keep them their skin healthy personally i kind of view skincare in the same bucket as i view transportation and cars i i am not a car person you guys i do not care about cars but some people are passionate about cars that hobby they collect cars uh you know they luxury vehicles that i start talking to me about a car and i fall asleep but i i live in a city where we don the most reliable transit public transportation system i need a car to get around my very first video on youtube was me buying my car i have not bought another car since that i just am not into cars but i need one so when i was shopping for a car i wanted to know what was going to be the best value what was going to be a safe car i did care a lot about the components of the car so as to make a rational purchasing decision but i and i have never you know given a thought thereafter about you know what what ferrari is gonna release next year i don i market per se and driving in houston is definitely not a form of self-care uh if you it is uh it back to it you know skin care is kind of the same thing it is a necessity for keeping your skin healthy and you know sunscreen is is necessary cleansing basic hygiene and moisturizers are important for many many people out there with dry skin conditions and as we get wiser the skin is more prone to getting dry irritated that can cause skin problems for sure so this basic skin care it is a form of healthcare hygiene protection from uv rays etc so you know it all need transportation but we all going to be interested in having a fleet of luxury vehicles i think skin care is very much the same way you know within the skincare market skincare products they prohibitive for many many people out there just like you know a lot of cars are cost prohibitive for many people out there while we all need transportation you have to you know realize that not everybody is going to be able to afford an suv or a brand new car transportation is a necessity for daily life for most people depending on where you live you may not even have access to good public transportation so it becomes a need in order to get to work so that you can pay your bills they can buy food to put on the table all of those things transportation is actually a need it is not a hobby for for a lot of people sure it becomes a hobby for some people but that is not the that is not the point of automobiles necessarily is you know for pleasure they are you know their need so for people who are struggling financially but also having skin problems or wanting to take good care of their skin they step into this online space i do think that it can start to feel like well gosh i going to be able to afford the tacho luminous whatever i able to afford this that and the other i that is that what there is out there and the idea you know you certain people vilifying vaseline which is like a dollar works perfectly well is you know a gold standard moisturizing product to be honest and so i feel as though you know vilifying basic skin care over the luxury stuff or making people feel bad because you know that they care of the health of their skin i really do think it is a bit elitist and ignores the fact that financially it it people and of course serums and toners and all these things they necessary but it does kind of create this i don feel like like they don that none of this is is necessary but basic skin care is a form of health care it is something that people need to access for hygiene and for protecting their skin from the sun and i do think a lot of people get upset with me in particular for pointing out ingredients that can be irritating to the skin especially people who love skin care and it know i think they doesn what the point that there is a large population of people out there who really do not care about skincare from the perspective of a hobby or a leisure activity they products that are not going to aggravate their skin so they can move on with their lives people who have rosacea you know they need help finding a sunscreen that is an essential part actually of rosacea care people who have melasma you know they are just looking for what can i do to help my skin well avoiding these ingredients that can cause irritation it because that of information that those people are looking for they looking for an experience they looking for products that you know will protect their skin from the sun namely in the case of melasma or rosacea without aggravating their skin condition i think people getting upset about pointing out ingredients that can be irritating to the skin i think it really misses the point that there is a larger group of people out there seeking skin care information who are not necessarily interested in skin care products from this leisure hobby perspective but rather as a form of health care in a sense and yes of course skin care products their cosmetics it becomes a very blurred line because there are so many products out there that are absolutely not necessary and are not healthcare products they but things like sunscreens and cleansers i mean this is basic skin care and caring for your largest organ it is not necessarily a hobby per se or a cosmetic it really is you know necessary for keeping your skin healthy to to take care of it it doesn have to be elaborate doesn a ton of things and it can change in during certain times of your life you know with with certain you know times of the season you may find that you breakouts from sweat you know what are good ingredients people are coming here looking for that kind of information they here looking to get into the hobby of skin care skincare marketing would have you believe that you changing up your skin care products all the time that you you know that everybody out there gets bored with their skincare routine i don that the majority of people out there do wash their face do they all view it as a form of pleasure no do they get bored of their cleanser no i don skin care is just this leisure activity that is supposed to be pleasurable i think for a lot of people it is you know they hence the popularity years ago the three in one face swatch body wash hair wash products that a lot of people you know kind of vilify but in reality i mean there really wasn those products and so what i at is i don intent of skin care is for pleasure i think for a lot of people it is just a form of taking care of their largest organ and once they find the products they move on it for everybody i think that important to to remember when you skincare reviews if you are a skincare enthusiast a skincare hobbyist you watching reviews people point out ingredients that cause can cause irritation i don get upset by that because some people are you know have certain skin issues they from the product you know is there something in this that can cause irritation of course you know what causes irritation for one person may not cause irritation for another but i think being knowledgeable about common ingredients that are established as common contact allergens i think it very helpful for a lot of people out there who are not interested in skin care as a hobby they excited about you know some intricate package of a cream they just you know want to know like is this going to help my dry skin sure it it moisturizer also will help your dry skin and you know yeah the package isn pretty you know whatever but it does the same thing and for people especially who have skin issues or who just you know are looking to find a product and move on i think that that kind of information is helpful and the idea that like you should be buying the more luxury things or the more you know experiential things i think it silly if you enjoy those things that silly if you enjoy skincare and putting on products and you know you get a lot of joy and pleasure i am not here to reign on that parade but just bear in mind that a lot of people out there are coming here coming to my content not necessarily looking for that so when i point things out it your feelings if you like a certain product that i say yes this isn necessary it those other people out to choose something that is going to be more efficient more cost effective sure a lot of people love skincare and it hobby but a lot of people don but they still need need it they still looking for information to make that that purchase it car you buying it for the purpose of just basic transportation you something that fits your budget and your needs or you are you are one of those people that has a fleet of of ferraris let me know in the comments do you view skincare as you know a source of pleasure enjoyment do you get excited about new product launches or are you somebody who really just you know has a skincare routine out of habit to take care of your skin and you could care less about skin care products and you don because i think i think there are a lot of you in both camps out there i hope this video was helpful if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen and subscribe i guys tomorrow bye [Music]

7 SKIN CARE TREND PREDICTIONS FOR 2022 | Dermatologist @DrDrayzday reacts to Allure	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnAB1P1EYo	Dr Day	well hey guys it in this video i thought it would be fun for me to react to this article i came across an allure predicting 2022 skincare trends the first trend is beauty bars are back okay they talking about how bar soaps are going to be a thing there demand for less packaging a lot more consumers want you know a more eco-friendly way of cleansing and bar soaps have always been you know a good way to do that you don need a body wash or a liquid cleanser i would recommend to those of you out there looking for a bar soap not sponsored but cerave bar soaps are fantastic and if you their essay bar i using a lot this past month and really enjoying i recommend it for those of you with oily acne prone skin you can use it on the face or the body now dove has always had their classic beauty bar they make one that moisturizing it a good option now one thing they say in this little trend section is soap sitting in a moist environment can harness bacteria that can spread to other parts of the body easily this is a bit of a myth yes it is true that you know your bar soap sitting out in a dish or whatever in your shower it will you know you know if you took a swab of it there would be types of bacteria but going back to like the 60s there was studies you know there have been studies looking at well can we inoculate ourselves with our bar soaps is that going to cause you know health adverse health outcomes skin infections and it really doesn mean researchers like purposely inoculated bar soap with things like e coli and they didn were able to contaminate themselves with it and those studies were later repeated so it necessarily need to worry about but if you are worried if you do have reservations then yeah i mean rinsing the bar soap off before you use it is a good idea but don and fear that your bar soap is going to contaminate you that correct soaps to have surfactants and things that are not amenable to bacteria once you start working up the lather you know the bacteria are not going to form a film on your skin they you know their outer cell membranes they lathering the surfactants and then they don going to contaminate yourself from your bar soap number two the at-home cryo boom you know i guys didn always think of liquid nitrogen because that nitrogen is not something that you know should be a trend uh it of skin issues you know it destructive treatment that destroys things like warts pre-skin cancers but whenever i hear cryo on the internet you know somebody asking me about crime thinking liquid nitrogen but anyways here they putting cool objects on your skin in an effort to like reduce puffiness and that certainly can help this article though it says that cold temperatures cause the blood vessels to contract that pores to tighten no i again pores are not doors they don open and close pore size is largely fixed it can be influenced by sun damage you know can dilate the you know make the pores dilate basically by destroying the surrounding supportive framework uh but they that size and you able to shrink them uh necessarily certainly not from putting something cold on your skin and in this particular section of course they orbs to contour your face a sculpting roller to chill out your limbs wow now these types of things they do they they can help reduce puffiness i happen to think to a great reason to have these at your disposal or to use some form of a cool compress is it can definitely help if you deal with rosacea if you experience flushing putting a cool compress on the skin can help halt that flush for you and it also can help if you deal with skin itch uh the cool temperature kind of distracts the itching signals and so if you deal with a lot of you know facial itch for example you may find that it handy to have one of these cooling roller things at your disposal and they can help de-puff the under eye area first thing in the morning i like to use those hydrogel under eye patches to depop the area i find that they cooling and help reduce puffiness for example i have some here that i love to use these skin iceland ones i actually will store these in the refrigerator not because you have to have a skin fridge or any of that but they do kind of help it doesn them cold does help reduce that puffiness yeah i mean they so far here is to promote a cryo pre-activating toning cleanser which is 70 okay i need to see what the heck this is as it washes off the formula transforms into a milky texture okay sounds like a lot of cleansers activating toning ingredients that address the crucial moisture balance of skin this cleanser and toner is so it a cleanser and a toner all in one i here i think they out there and hoping that they response that marketing is it saying stuff to make this 70 cleanser marketable i think that okay the number three trend according to allure is going to be you ready major lip service i guess because they think this is going to be a trend maybe we wearing masks less i don they mouths more i although wearing masks certainly can end up you know causing some irritation around the mouth drying out the lips but um yeah i think that showing off your lips is gonna be a thing of 2022. they go on to say i think people will definitely want to show off their lips at every opportunity now keeping lips healthy and hydrated is an essential starting point i would agree they go on to rave about a hydration rich balm or sav is it to pick a workhorse in my opinion a workhorse when it comes to the lips is petrolatum no other ingredient is as occlusive now the skin on your lips is much different from the skin on the rest of your face it doesn in the way of a protective stratum corneum that irritating stuff out and hydration in so something as occlusive as petrolatum is perfect there you guys know i using you know petrolatum ointments whether it be vaseline cerave healing ointment i cetaphil healing ointment love using those on my lips so that is what i would recommend to keep them hydrated and to reduce irritating things getting into the skin of the lips there are no sebaceous oil glands on the lips and so they dryness and irritation plus you eating you ends up condensing onto the skin of the lips can be very irritating spices saliva is an irritant definitely needs protecting and petrolatum it the best skin protectants dimethicone is also another good skin protectant but you don balm to do that vaseline is actually perfect now the other thing they don really talk about here is sun protection for the lips very important and personally in my experience i do find that many sunscreens are incredibly drying when you try and use them on your lips that is why i like using a dedicated spf lip balm it i science tinted lip balm that used the vanity cream lip spf i those down below in the description box alright they give the analogy and i kind of like this that you and you drink something that appeals to the senses with no nutritional value and shortly thereafter you are still thirsty kind of like drinking soda she says same thing goes for balms loaded with flavor fragrance and menthol i would agree flavor fragrance and menthol they you know they yield a sensory experience but they can end up really drying out and irritating the skin of your lips and then your lips become dry and because they kind of provided some immediate gratification well then you go back to that same irritating lip balm and it that i do suggest just playing petrola but of course it and then they go on to recommend basically stuff that irritating tatcha lip mask what the heck is that sold at sephora in a little pot with fragrance they contradict themselves in this article uh the thick glossy formula gets its restorative powers from japanese peach extracts squalane and the mega hydrating japanese camellia oil but then they don i mean literally two lines above this they caution against fragrance and flavorants and lip balms and then they a fragrance containing lip balm number four oh gosh you guys even more celebrity skincare lines oh gosh i mean i do not i don animosity towards celebrities who want to come out with a skincare line you know like this whole idea i will always see these comments whenever i review a skincare line by anybody with who well-known is that oh they dermatologist they have no place making a skincare line but really do dermatologists have a place making a skincare line the people who have a place making a skincare line honestly are cosmetic chemists i mean they ones who know how to actually put ingredients together so that they spread on the skin and you know do what they supposed to do so i don yes dermatologists we have knowledge about ingredients that can be irritating to the skin and those that you know can lead to problems those that benefit the skin but really when it boils down to it we don formulating skin care products so um i always see that comment but that being said i do find that celebrity skin care lines they are i hate to say cash grab um they kind of are though honestly because skin care it now and you know so now it where you pumping out left and right i think soon this bubble will burst um and people you know consumers will just kind of get burnt out similar to how makeup has been historically you know i think for a while there on youtube makeup was having a moment and brian were pumping out those makeup palettes left and right i think consumers really got fatigued eventually that happen with the celebrity skincare brands rihanna years ago looks like pharrell has one key soul care i know she blend in a bottle that she promising miracles from i don the celebrities like do you realize they are just the face of products that somebody else is creating now i environmental scientist but i don why you would put vegan cruelty-free gluten-free in your sustainability details now cruelty-free and vegan that is you know those are ethical things that people are looking for do you test on animals or not do you do you use animal derived ingredients in your products or not now i but i don parallels environmental sustainability in the cosmetic skin care realm of things you would you know you might assume that less use of animal derived ingredients is more sustainable but it may not be i truly do not know so they put that in there i think that when is gluten free about the environment it celiac disease then you have to avoid ingesting gluten but putting it on your skin you know it that you even have to worry about in that setting so gluten-free skin care is a bit of a weird claim to make anyways let alone to say it don then they go on to say non-comedogenic how is that a sustainability claim i think they just then finally they talk about please recycle glass so it the product comes in a carton that is fsc certified harvested in a responsible matter 100 compostable and made with a minimum of 70 post-consumer material is printed with soy and water-based inks so why didn the sustainability details i don that um yeah i mean being gluten-free is not really about sustainability oh it know what that should be titled which makes it even more suspicious now about the actual sustainability claims that they make it should just be titled our different marketing claims all right number five body care has never been bigger i like that you know i do think for the longest time we have focused too much on facial skin care and a variety of skin issues do you impact the body as many people get into their wiser years they you know become more interested in correcting or improving upon the visible signs of skin aging on other body sites and like why was nobody telling me to either wear sunscreen there or you know to put retinol there things like crepey skin sagging um on the on the body so they go on to talk about how that trend i do think that that is a good you know direction we have a lot of good body care products out there personally i think that most body care products especially moisturizers you often can use them on your face and i love when brands you know i know a lot of people don products but i like it when brands have either a cleanser or a moisturizer that they face and body an example is the laurish posse lipicare wash they call out the cerave essay lotion that and bumpy skin so they mentioned this brand uh topicals their faded mist you guys have been asking me to review this brand so stay tuned i just as of last night ordered all four of their products so i guys and i video um so we can you know carry on the trend of body care but their products um aimed at improving like hyper pigmentation can be used on the body i know a lot of you guys deal with acne breakouts on the body if you have a deeper skin tone those can often heal with dark marks so i for you guys number six on tick tock trusted ingredients are buzzy again i hate that term buzzy don guys have words that you find annoying buzzy is annoying to me what are you a bee i don tock trend maker meme machine and in 2022 skincare time machine wow kudos whoever wrote that sentence some of the popular ingredients that blew up in years past have come full circle once again thanks to content creators and skin influencers these renaissances are bound to happen beauty history always repeats itself but the viral power of tick tock seemed to sped up the return of ingredients like no lord boccuccio [Music] you guys beccuccio i have no problem with this ingredient all right i call it the huchi kuchi bacuchi because of the marketing around it is so incredibly misleading but cucciol is a plant-derived antioxidant stop stop that is where it stops that is where it stops there is where it stops and they go on to continue to perpetuate the same bs bacochial is an ingredient i have loved for a while now and it seemed to be making its way to the mainstream with 23.5 million views on tick tock and here comes the bs the antioxidant which stimulates collagen and cell turnover for smoother brighter skin and if you bakuchiol is a gentle option for exfoliation bs number two it alternative to retinol no it not it antioxidant like niacinamide you know like tea etc it is not a plant-derived alternative to retinol this is so misleading and they keep perpetuating the same bs i and i bacochiol they are sketch okay boccuccio and laboratory studies has been shown to activate some of the same gene pathways and you know gene markers that retinol does but that does not mean that putting it on the skin has the same effects as using a retinol but brands will continue to lie to you that boccuccio is a plant-derived retinol or a plant-based retinol it is not that it is not that at all there there things but cucciol is an antioxidant we don boosts up collagen production in the skin we simply don furthermore another lie they continue to perpetuate that needs to stop is that boccuccio is a pregnancy safe alternative to retinol that somebody needs to crack down on that claim because pregnancy the study is demonstrating that it where the pregnancy data where data coming from it doesn doesn they stop doing that um i bakuchi all nonsense it as an ingredient i it may help you know improve ingredient stability as do other antioxidants and skincare products but let 2022 for the bs the boccuccio is a plant-based retinol it going to we have we have no evidence that boccuccio improves collagen synthesis improves hyperpigmentation it that it um this is simply bs um all right and then they go on to rave about caffeine another antioxidant caffeine does to your skin what it does for your soul okay that is a stretch i what it can do for the skin it can calm down redness temporarily probably through its vasoconstrictive effects i think it suggest that it may help when used in combination with sunscreen to reduce uh the burden of sun damage that occurs probably you know just by acting maybe as an antioxidant and it may help improve the appearance of cellulite temporarily we don entirely how that works maybe you know through its effects on fat metabolism who knows and it also you know there studies showing topically caffeine may help with hair regrowth although that is very very limited but it doesn brands from glomming on to caffeine when used under the eyes it may temporarily improve the look of dark under eye circles and that stops now what caffeine does for me personally on a systemic level is convert me into a human being from a gargoyle so saying caffeine does for your skin what it does for your soul i beg to disagree on that one uh caffeine does more for my soul than it ever could be useful on a skincare product all right so yeah i don the buzz around caffeine i i suppose it like do does everybody need a caffeine serum no i mean it benefits here you know who has been putting caffeine in their products for a long time and not marketing it and you know i think is part of the reason why so many people actually like it even though it um their products do have caffeine in them and i i don energy drink level of caffeine because a few years ago when i tried out all the all those little merit products for you guys and reviewed them i remember feeling like like my face had had been temporarily chilled when i used one of their products that had caffeine and i think it was the caffeine in their products is you know quite quite robust that anecdote using those and no i endorsing lemire what was the other buzzy ingredient niacinamide yay i like niacinamide it it hyperpigmentation the moisture barrier but you have to be careful brands like to pump in more niacinamide than the last brand in line to try and outshine everybody and with that you can get to you know more irritation not necessarily any better in terms of efficacy the studies looking at the benefits of niacinamide they kind of max out they max out at five percent i mean that the highest percentage strength but you and don higher is better it skincare but anyways niacinamide it going to continue to be one you to see everywhere cool i i enjoy nice nice in mind it is helpful for the moisture barrier too you know and reducing oxidative stress it may help with oiliness acne control but for whatever reason some people do find it irritating and so you you probably not excited to hear niacinamide is being so so buzzed about because honestly i think as far as ingredients well i you know it benefit a variety of skin issues i think it you know and now people like it so you inexpensive and it you basically what what that trend translates into all right and then last but not least more aluminum packaging okay this is not something i was aware of uh more aluminum packaging all right what is the deal here ah the never ending discussion around beauty product packaging it products than you think you can read more about our sustainability pledge here but aluminum is a standout when it comes to recyclability brands appear to be taking its values seriously and are under utilizing it more and more going into 22. they then go on to point out some brands that are going to be using aluminum-based packaging this made me kind of laugh i just think it know ironic allure got the scoop earlier this year on dove yeah refillable deodorant in an aluminum pod and the reason this makes me laugh you guys is because i feel like any time i mention antiperspirants on here i have to ward off the comments about people fear-mongering around aluminum-based antiperspirants that they you know people have this false fixed belief that they cause breast cancer alzheimer gimmicky natural deodorant market came from and you know i have a video talking all about how you know natural deodorants they end up oftentimes being ten times more irritating than the aluminum-based antiperspirants that aluminum-based antiperspirants are not you know they problems that people claim they are etc etc and dove you know people are always fearful of aluminum-based antiperspirants dove the dove took it to be like all right not only are we not bending to this bs fear-mongering around aluminum we gonna take it a step further and package our deodorant in aluminum i just think that there was so much demand there from consumers for aluminum free antiperspirants and now there demand for aluminum packaging because according to this it is more sustainable now i like i said i environmental scientist i expert on recycling i do recycle but i not an expert on it so i just don is it really that much more sustainable those of you out there who know more about this than me i know some of you study this in school so let me know in the comments i just think it is a bit ironic how all of these brands caved uh towards the aluminum free fear-mongering and dove continues with their aluminum-based antiperspirants and then packages their product in aluminum i mean and like some people really are fearful of aluminum they won they won aluminum christmas ornament so that being said it sales of these products in this type of packaging will be impacted those are the 2022 skin care trends i don know problem here i don these are really a threat to human health i do think it has this aluminum refillable container not because i think you know that cool thing i just think it given how much fuss people made over the years about aluminum and deodorant and now they encased their deodorant in more aluminum um anyways you guys i hoped this year to make some more videos you know based on these trends on bar soaps for you guys you know kind of reviewing some i may even try out some shampoo bars stay tuned for that i saw garnier has some so i may try out some of those like i said i bought the topical skincare products i but let me know in the comments what trends you foresee coming in the realm of skincare and if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe i bye [Music] you	Success
DID CLINIQUE LIE ABOUT THEIR PRODUCTS? @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG87ZzyuLXg	Dr Day	well hey guys if you are not aware clinique has been in the hot seat this year since june of 2021 they have been in a lawsuit in which the plaintiff alleges false advertising because many of their products claim to be oil free you sunscreens moisturizers and makeup from clinique if you is andrea i dermatologist i am not a lawyer but in today what exactly oil-free means and skin care and beauty products why i think the plaintiff has reason to be upset with the oil-free claim and importantly why do dermatologists suggest choosing oil-free skin care and personal care products in the first place comment below do you use clinique this marketing claim of oil free is not unique or specific to clinique there are thousands and thousands and thousands of brands with products that say oil free that could fall under the same lawsuit what exactly is an oil when you think of oil you olive oil cooking oils maybe if you really into skin care you mineral oil the term oil includes hydrocarbons like petrolatum one of my favorite oils and personal care products triglycerides fatty acids and the term oil refers to a material that is both hydrophobic meaning it hates water as well as oleophilic meaning loves oils and unlike water which is just oxygen and two hydrogens oil is not one compound can be a variety of different compounds within an oil so you might assume that a product that is labeled oil free it doesn and doesn water fearing and oil loving well that not technically true oil free is actually a bit of a confusing and misleading marketing claim because it implies that there are no oils but it actually pretty difficult to formulate a skincare product beauty product personal care product that to the skin that doesn component and many important ingredients in skin care products are oily substances tocopherol acetate or vitamin e it is an oily substance that is added to personal care products as an antioxidant to help with ingredient stability and preservation but you will find tocopherol acetate in products marketed as oil-free including those that came under scrutiny by clinique like they foundation plus concealer and they dramatically different moisturizing gel comment below on if you use either of those i believe the plaintiff is under the impression that oil refi refers to any substance that it is at least partly soluble in a fatty substance and yeah you these products when products are marketed oil free probably one of the most common families sets of ingredients that you going to find in them is something called silicones most commonly that going to be dimethicone i about this in a lot of videos on moisturizers why it why i love it silicones are kind of an oily substance that like oils are insoluble in water but unlike oils they are not oleophilic it difference now some silicones can be made more oil loving by adding the addition of groups called alkyl groups for example alkyl dimethicone is partially oil soluble because it has those modifications added now i understanding of how oils are defined in skin care products is that an oil is anything that is water phobic hydrophobic and oleophilic or oil loving so it silicones like dimethicone they don meet that criteria so they category in and of themselves so why do brands market products as oil-free confusing why do they even start with that well for people who have acne prone skin there has always been this idea that certain oils might aggravate the acne and i later on in the video but that is kind of i believe where the marketing originated to speak to people who have acne prone skin and a lot of dermatologists tell their acne prone patients choose products that are oil free so i can totally understand why the plaintiff is upset here because you know as dermatologists we do frequently recommend oil free skin care products choose oil free we seeking advice on what products you choose and if the patient has oily skin or acne prone skin that is a go-to recommendation so imagine you surprised wherein you leave the dermatologist clinique counter you pick up the dramatically different moisturizing gel and boom there is actually an oil in there even though the front of the box says oil free yeah you would be pissed off because you are doing something that you think is a medical recommend you know that basically from your doctor or dermatologist and you there is actually oil there so why do brands market products as oil free when they actually have oils in them truthfully and many have openly admitted this they bank on the fact that consumers don difference so they use the term oil free basically to market a product that is more favorable or going to be well tolerated likely by somebody who has an oily skin type maybe more acne prone but oil free you know there or oversight it is a marketing claim and i wholeheartedly agree that it is misleading because it puts in the consumer and skin care products is what they need to be avoiding and that down into the details of what exactly the benefit of oil free skin care products and personal care products is going to be for people who have oily skin why did dermatologists advise patients to choose those products so when we think about a moisturizer or product that has oil in it what comes to mind and what is probably our favorite oil and personal care products as dermatologists is going to be the hydrocarbon petrolatum it has been used since 1837 and personal care products contrary to popular belief it is not comedogenic petrolatum is arguably the most important oil in dermatology as an ingredient in moisturizers and moisturizing products because of its ability to reduce trans epidermal water loss that means water leaving the skin there is no ingredient that compares to petrolatum in terms of reduction of trans epidermal water loss it can do it upwards of 99 no other ingredient including silicones can offer that level of reduction of trans epidermal water loss why would that be a good thing well for people who have dry skin conditions like eczema where they have a lot of water being you know lost from the skin contributing to their disease that is a really valuable thing to have in the product to ameliorate those dry skin symptoms it very occlusive hence the reduction in trans epidermal water loss and because of that it facilitates healing and skin barrier repair and is incredibly valuable for healing cuts ulcers etc because it provides a barrier and a seal almost acting like second skin for say you have an abrasion or something so that the new healthy skin cells can migrate in it keeps the underlying defect moist and hydrated allowing for better healing natural autumn can intercalate between cornea sites or skin cells and mimic your skin to alleviate dryness and itch so petrolatum is not a demon ingredient it it it of the biggest myths in the public eye when it comes to skin care ingredients is that petrolatum is poor clogging and will break you out that is not true the reason this myth started is that petrolatum is a petrochemical derived ingredient now in cosmetic products it is highly purified and refined but because it is derived from petrochemicals if you are not using petrolatum that is highly refined there could be some risk of contamination with tar which is comedogenic for sure but in the cosmetic industry the cousin you know cosmetic grade petrolatum is so highly refined and purified that this is not an issue if you live in houston if you would not ever think of jumping in the bayou and drinking that water ew gross now if that was your whole world view of what water is well yeah you would probably be like why are they putting water in my skin care products ew gross yeah i mean they purified clean water they water from the bayou and putting it directly in your skin same holds true when we products that have petrolatum cannot be classified as oil-free well why the heck does that matter why would why would petrolatum be something that a dermatologist would suggest avoiding if it and all this other stuff well truthfully petrolatum it feels very greasy on the skin for people who have very oily skin this is not something they enjoy having it makes the skin look greasier it looks shinier and because petrolatum is so occlusive it actually can slow down the rate of evaporation of sweat and that can make you feel overheated some people have a condition called rosacea and they getting flushing especially if they get overheated so heavy moisturizers can kind of incite that flush and exacerbate their disease and silicones in personal care products they astringent emollients because they have the ability to reduce the stickiness of petrolatum silicones are definitely advantageous over petrolatum for people who have oily acne prone skin because they greasy or heavy on the skin they allow for better evaporation of sweat they have anti-shine properties they you know help your skin feel less greasy overall they is why dermatologists recommend choosing oil-free products for many patients but it becomes a loosey-goosey area too because people out there with dry skin they marketing maybe they dermatologist before and they to have it in their head where i need to avoid oils because they break me out and then they may be avoiding things like petrolatum and their skin care products which actually could end up helping them now what are the downsides of using products with oils in them namely like petrolatum well they can again because they slow down the rate of evaporation of sweat they can make you overheat they can feel greasy on the skin and because they they tend to be a lot heavier some people do develop an irritant contact dermatitis to oilier products that irritant dermatitis looks like acne it irritant folliculitis but it actually because the product is truthfully comedogenic it irritant reaction centered around the follicle so i personally you know i think it and correct in how you communicate what your product is intended to do so customers know and i don able to get away with that and this individual this is not the first lawsuit that this individual has made against a brand uh this individual also had a lawsuit against maybelline and i believe lancome if i can see why the plaintiff is upset here i don mislead customers intentionally i merely think the term oil free has stuck for so long kind of based on how cosmetic manufacturers define oil and silicones being actually technically cilophilic and that market so i kind of get where that originally came about the oil free and because dermatologists started recommending to their oily acne prone patients hey choose products that are labeled oil free as a way to help them navigate that i can see how it stuck and been persistent but rather than use that term which i don is factually correct i think it would be better to replace that with more descriptive language as far as the feel of the product to communicate that for people with oily skin it feel heavy or greasy to communicate things like shine reducing i think that kind of language is much more helpful to consumers versus those products that have petrol autumn you know being more heavily marketed to those individuals who have dry skin and letting them know that this is something that healing and recovery of a damaged skin barrier more so even than dimethicone there vaseline uh for for skin care i mean it very valuable and can have tremendous benefit for treating dry skin conditions as well as healing cuts scrapes reducing chafing etc i mean it is not a double ingredient and it is definitely a myth that it is poor clogging it that it is some kind of you know carcinogenic contaminated product i definitely think it is in the best interest of brands to stop using the terminology oil free and again instead use more descriptive terminology that can help the customer understand that their product is going to be better suited for oilier skin types and i do think that more people

Chrissy Teigen's EYEBROW TRANSPLANT | Dermatologist Reacts @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siQI7cbXg-E	Dr Day	well hey guys chrissy teigen has announced on social media that she had an eyebrow transplant in today i a lot of criticism on social media for sharing this people were saying this is a rich person your eyebrows transplanted she said something along the lines of oh i never wear makeup unless i absolutely have to so this is going to be a lot more convenient and so people were like oh lucky you but there can be a lot of reasons why you might want to have an eyebrow transplant first of all why the heck do we have eyebrows what are they for they function to help keep moisture and sweat out of our eyes they play a vital role in facial expression and facial recognition so much so that there was a study done where they showed people images of famous people either without their eyes or without their eyebrows and people are better able to recognize the celebrities without their eyes than they were without their eyebrows so it just facial recognition and it can have an impact on your self-esteem if you lose your eyebrows now she cited that she had plucked her eyebrows in her younger years cautioned her audience against doing this attributed her eye brow thinning to over plucking now that is something people commonly say oh i plucked my eyebrows and that why they reasons why somebody might lose their eyebrows probably one of the most common reasons cited for loss of eyebrows is actually a burn injury it can be a chemical burn or electrical burn people who smoke crack cocaine frequently will lose their eyebrows due to burn injury you can also lose part of your eyebrows if you have to have surgery corrective surgery in that area stay to remove a skin cancer now one of the many joys of getting wiser okay older is that our eyebrows do thin as part of just not the natural aging process then you can have lots of eyebrows secondary to an underlying condition there called alopecia areata which is an autoimmune hair loss and it can affect the eyebrows you can lose your eyebrows hypothyroidism or low thyroid hormone can lead to thinning of the eyebrows people who have eczema can develop thinning of the lateral portion of the eyebrows and people with that rough and bumpy skin condition keratosis pylaris in some cases it can involve the brows and you can have sparse brows as a result of that dry skin conditions now if you are an overzealous plucker and you pluck your eyebrows it certainly can contribute to change of the eyebrow shape and thinning of the brows changing the direction the way the hairs grow because it traumatizes the hair follicle and then of course there are rare causes of thinning of the eyebrows certain congenital diseases like ectodermal dysplasia and you can also have certain infections that end up presenting with what and if you have to have radiation therapy as part of cancer treatment then that can impact the eyebrows as well honestly she didn much of her background motivation for doing this other than it seemed like she was under the impression that this was somehow going to simplify her life and that she wouldn her brows it right that you could have an eyebrow transplant you may be aware of the fact that people get hair transplants but you can have hair transplanted to other body sites including your eyebrows and your eyelashes how exactly does this happen well you need a really really good plastic surgeon or dermatologist who specializes in hair transplant and has a long-standing track record of doing this because it is quite literally an art what do they do well there are a few ways that they can go about collecting the donor hairs they can collect it from either your scalp or a body side they can do it by taking kind of a strip of the hairs in an excision and then transplanting them to your brows or probably what is that they harvest each of the little individual hairs by kind of making a little circle around the hair and lifting it up and then transplanting it to your brows in order to get it into your brows they make little holes with a hypodermic needle and then very carefully place those donor follicles into into the brow area and this truly is an art not only do you have to harvest hair that a good match in terms of color texture but also you have to take into account the direction the hairs grow the overall brow shape ethnic differences and follicle density in the brow and there are gender differences in terms of follicle density and the overall way in which the hairs grow now if you trauma or a burn it may have damaged and caused scar tissue in which case the follicles are not going to take and so you may need something called a composite graft that that is another approach to doing this but in some cases those end up failing because you don supply as a result of the scarring another option is actually something called a flap where you can take tissue from a neighboring area in this case it most likely the temple area and you can literally position it into the brow area and with that comes its own blood supply so that is another option vital to the success of this procedure is going to be the post-operative care you can area wet for five days after the procedure you antibiotic to prevent infection and you follow up about one week after the procedure to make sure that everything is going along accordingly and you redness around the follicle so that lasts maybe a few days so you will see that you know that can be alarming to patients but it resolves you have to be patient unfortunately initially you get the procedure and you great but then about two weeks after the procedure the transplanted hairs fall out that is normal it is a telogen effluvium it taken from where you entire life say the back of the scalp and be transplanted in a whole new area of the body and so those hairs shed that is expected it around four to five months you will start to get eyebrow growth now when it comes to this procedure one thing that is factored in is the donor hairs where are they coming from commonly the occipital scalp the back of the scalp is an area that is used but there are some issues with that type of hair it doesn eyebrow hair and it grows a lot faster than eyebrows so you have to trim your eyebrows very frequently which i think is interesting because she mentioned or you know kind of alluded to the idea that she was sort of doing this because oh wouldn not have to wear makeup as often but she trimming her eyebrows alternatives include the leg hair actually is a little bit more slow-growing and slightly more similar in terms of texture to brow hair although it depends it varies from person to person you know gender differences ethnic differences and just hair texture but that is another option that has good success also hairs can be uh harvested from the sideburn area i wouldn is a rich person problem if you have ever lost your eyebrows secondary to a medical condition it can really have a negative impact on your self-esteem and you know they have a function to keep stuff out of your eyes they also help keep excessive light out of your eyes so it you not something that is as easy as it sounds like oh big deal you don this little strip of hair there now it definitely has an impact and it important for facial expression conveying emotion and for facial recognition so if you have this don comments that she got make you feel bad about considering getting an eyebrow transplant now if you eyebrows due to an underlying medical condition like hypothyroid or say you have alopecia areata or you have keratosis pylaris those those people who have brow loss secondary to an underlying condition they this why well they still have that underlying condition driving things for example in the case of alopecia areata you at risk for autoimmune attack of the hair follicles including your newly transplanted expensive hair follicles so those folks you know this might not always be the best course unless your disease process is well controlled but i would say those are situations where it option for you alternatives to having transplanted brows or tattooing or microblading but there you actually getting the textural component of the the hairs on there so you know that is an advantage here as well it makes it she makes it seem as though she pretty much had this done for kind of cosmetic convenience reasons and that of aesthetic procedures out there that are not medically necessary but in some cases this type of procedure it really you know is something that can be a transformative for people who have lost their brows due to i know you know trauma burn um and they do they do serve a function how much does it cost it to 10k depending on where you live it to shop around for the best deal on you want somebody who is really really skilled because it is an art transplant you know selecting the donor hairs the donor follicles transplanting them in the right orientation so they look right yeah kudos to the plastic surgeons and hair transplant surgeons out there who do this i think it is really cool and again it can transform somebody due to trauma it see if she shares any kind of update i mean if you are going to put this out there on the internet of course they questions so i wonder if we get some sort of follow-up it interesting to see in four to five months if she if she her eyebrows that to hear her comments on how she handles that i wonder if she it forgotten and who knows but yeah hopefully she does update us just you know out of curiosity to the process but of course she does not have to all right you guys that her announcement of her eyebrow transplant i hope this video is educational informative taught you something about eyebrows and eyebrow transplant on the end slate i put my last celebrity response video if you want to check that out and i some more in the description box if you were at all interested but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen and subscribe i

Kate Middleton's ANTI-AGING SERUM IS BOTOX IN A BOTTLE? | Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QCwe138Bys	Dr Day	well hey guys according to multiple media sources magazines news outlets duchess kate middleton uses a skincare product that is deemed as a botox gel claiming to smooth out wrinkles fine lines and act basically as botox in a bottle she loves it so much apparently she told michelle obama that she needed to use it and she now uses it and i guess loves it i other media outlets claiming that madonna uses this product what the heck is it in today reviewing this popular biotulan supreme skin gel this comes from germany i bought it from the amazonian where everything seems to come from these days all right what exactly is this it facial gel that claims to smooth out wrinkles and fine lines specifically i love the claim on the back of the bottle it says line and wrinkle reducing gel for your demanding facial skin if you have a very expressive face i guess yeah you put a lot of demands on your facial skin i don what does this have in it well it claims that the benefits of this product come from a few ingredients something called acmella oleoresia which is a plant goes by the name jambu in brazil if you guys are from brazil comment below do you ingest this now there this plant called spilanthol which allegedly is what is responsible for the wrinkle smoothing effect it is used medicinally in traditional medicine to treat like toothaches it has anesthetic properties apparently so people like chew on the leaves when they have a toothache there are a couple of papers that you can find on pubmed reviewing the different compounds in the acmella oleorasia it properties it and of course historically it has been used as an anesthetic to treat tooth pain now what about using this ingredient to treat wrinkles well truthfully there not much out there to support the claim that it has a wrinkle smoothing effect there is one small paper done on volunteers where they use a product that contains an extract from acmella o i hope i i apologize if i name jambu so this paper gets volunteers they use the a product kind of similar to this and they do some measurements and find that at the end of two weeks the volunteers have improvement and wrinkle depth but the study doesn actually prove that the um jamboo does anything it just shows that applying a topical moisturizing gel improves wrinkle depth skin care ingredients that act as humectants can pull hydration into the top layers of the skin plumping up skin cells and that can have a wrinkle smoothing effect speaking of pulling hydration into skin cells and into the top layer of the skin this product also has an ingredient called lady grass or imperata cylindrica and this is used a lot in different moisturizing products and compounds from this plant have actually been shown to help draw water into skin cells having a moisturizing effect it ingredient but you will find it in numerous moisturizing products combined with other things like humectants namely sodium hyaluronate the salt of hyaluronic acid which is pretty ubiquitous in moisturizing products and as i said earlier it certainly can improve hydration and the top layer of the skin temporarily smoothing out wrinkles and fine lines just by plumping up skin cells and wouldn this product has sodium hyaluronate as well as another humectant that is ubiquitous in moisturizing products glycerin i a whole video talking about the benefits of glycerin and skin care products and hair care products i will link that video down below in the d box if you are interested in learning about glycerin but yeah i mean it people observe a wrinkle smoothing effect with this product but does that mean it actually acts as botox in a bottle no what is botox botox is neurotoxin that we can inject into the skin the way botox works is basically by blocking the signal from the nerve to the muscle so that the muscle does not contract and that smooths out dynamic wrinkles wrinkles ordinarily form when you move your face around doesn i would say this is the opposite actually this helps improve fine wrinkles that appear at rest but i don believe it effect in order for there to be a botox-like effect you would have to show that at least some ingredient in this whether it be the lady grass or jambu gets into the skin and interferes with that transmission now i doesn does and honestly it seemed very very unlikely so i would not claim that this is botox in a bottle or a botox gel there really just suggests to me that this is a moisturizing product that give a temporary wrinkle smoothing effect so i think it grab on somebody that this is a botox gel really what it is is like a sodium hyaluronate gel which you guys just buy the ordinary hyaluronic acid serum same kind of principle but a lot less money i plunked down 64.99 on amazon for this product and i bad i i have nothing actually negative to say about this other than the misleading marketing um that these media outlets are doing of this kind of claiming that it is a botox gel it humectant rich moisturizing gel that you can apply to damp skin and then apply your moisturizer on over it it does have a wrinkled smoothing effect now when i read about how this products ingredient the um jambu has an anesthetic property i was like i wonder if it a slightly numbing effect no i did not experience that whatsoever it otherwise appears to be safe at least from the studies that we do have but it researched topical family of ingredients the jambu i mean um if anything the blady grass that skin care products and then of course sodium hyaluronate is pretty ubiquitous in skin care products what else does this have in it um phenoxyethanol a preservative which is not deadly clean beauty loves to fear monger unnecessarily around preservatives until somebody gets pseudomonas in the eye and then all of a sudden it um i phenoxyethanol if you were quaking in your boots about it it wonderful sodium hydroxide likely to help with the ph um honestly i have enjoyed using this but it i mean it hyaluronic acid serum it is actually a little bit thicker in consistency in comparison to a serum those tend to be a little more watery but the effect is the same it assuming it quote me on that made in germany those of you from germany comment below do you use this is this really popular in germany i couldn kate middleton singing the praises of it as well as a few other celebrities which makes me kind of i don it there wasn usually reddit has a thread about something now while this product is safe you know low-risk kind of thing to use i would definitely avoid it if you have a composite allergy some of you guys are like what the heck is that but if you have an allergy you know exactly what i composite otherwise known as asteracea is a family of flowering plants the head is actually like multiple little flowers anyways it includes marigold chrysanthemum arnica a ton of uh different plants if you are allergic to that family of plants you have to avoid this because jambu it is in the composite family so if you have an allergy to those plants you would want to avoid this if you have an allergy to it basically when it comes in contact with the skin whether it be direct contact with the plant its pollens or a skin care product that contains extracts from the plant you will develop an uncomfortable rash kudos to bio tulan however for pointing that out in their in their little package insert i search you guys because i just thought it was interesting and almost kind of drives home some of the points i made in this video biotulin is a combination of active ingredients whose direct effects systematically reduce wrinkle depth that is very careful wording there crow lines between the eyebrows and nasolabial folds are visibly smooth okay yeah i mean i would agree uh those if you have those wrinkles at rest fine wrinkles this may visibly improve it again just by that wrinkle smoothing effect from better hydration in the top layer of the skin which you can get from any moisturizer by the way one of the main components of biotulum is acmella oleo racia a precious essence derived from an extract of the acamela oleoresia plant which can provide a significant effect on lifting and firming now that is a stretch if you have saggy skin if you have bags under the eyes this is not going to lift them up and firm them there support that i have used this product while i don bags i i don unnecessarily because i did not notice any kind of drastic wrinkle smoothing effect with this in comparison to just using a plain hyaluronic acid serum all right then they go on to say the efficacy of bio2 len is supported by hyaluron hyaluronic acid also cushions the skin and supports collagenous and elastic fibers it optically skin tightening and smoothing effect is immediately visible exactly it they are even subtly telling you hey this works because it serum they then go on to say effects last for up to nine hours yeah similar to any other moisturizer you going to see an improvement in the look of skin it however now of course botox is not permanent but you guys if you you know it lasts many months not not nine hours all right how to apply it apply to clean skin which is what i did you can put it on the face the neck the neckline you can put it around the eyes i mean there nothing harmful in this unless of course you are allergic to any of its ingredients but those of you with composite allergy would be the ones to definitely avoid then use your usual skin care products to optimize the result apply bio2 lens several times a day okay bio2 len that is code for go through this faster than necessary so you will have to repurchase it again for further information go to www.bio2lin.desk recommended it says do not use if allergic or hypersensitive to composite family to composite plants composites the family of plants anyways so i just thought this was interesting like i said i bought it on amazon it was not inexpensive you can find a hyaluronic acid serum i shout out the ordinary not sponsored by the ordinary because there i almost feel like it dollars i know it and uh i know those of you in europe can get the ordinary as well um this this comes from germany so you know maybe those of you in germany are using this y or just use a moisturizer seriously same types of ingredients now this doesn that is occlusive per se so if you put this on as they advise and you don anything on over it you may find that it actually dries out your skin those humectants they will pull water into the top layers of the skin plumping out skin cells pumping up skin cells but if you don that water is just gonna evaporate may end up drying out your skin more especially if you live in a dry climate that tends to be even more problematic um so there you to layer your skincare products on over it they this as a moisturizer or a standalone product um but i just wanted to point that out about you may find that it just dries out your skin more i find it interesting that kate middleton and michelle obama would use this i mean you believe that this is botox or has botox-like effects if it had botox-like effects i several weeks because i the 64.99 on it i was like i gonna use it up obviously does that look like i have had a wrinkle smoothing effect i did use it this morning but now i it as needed throughout the day which is interesting strategic marketing um so overall i don want to use it if you want to try it and go right ahead uh unless of course you are allergic to composite comment below and if you are allergic to composite i always like hearing from you guys and kind of surveying you all just to get to know you better yeah comment below and if you i don you are using it you getting hosed with the price point because you can just get a hyaluronic acid serum and achieve the same outcome all right y response video to kate middleton and the media claiming that this biotulin is a botox gel uh if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe i

INFLUENCER CLAIMS HER SKIN CARE PROTECTS FROM BLUE LIGHT? | Reacting to VALKYRAE RFLCT @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7gtX84C9VE	Dr Day	well hey guys y the new skincare line reflect from my popular gaming influencer valkyray i hope i think her name is ray my apologies uh the last video game i played looked something like this so not something that i consume on youtube but i realized she influencer anyway she skincare line that is centered around the idea of blue light protection she backlash for claiming that skincare products can protect from blue light obviously i not used any of these products i going to be going through some of the claims the science behind blue light and what it does to the skin and i ingredients in her products i see a lot of criticism against this brand people saying there blue light affects the skin that fact affect your skin however it from the sun what does blue light do to your skin blue light can cause a lot of free radicals in the skin and is also playing a major role in hyperpigmentation so it plays a major role in skin aging in the sense that it modeling discoloration especially if you have a deeper skin tone deeper skin tones tend to be even more affected by these wavelengths of light a lot of people realize they need to protect their skin from the sun because of ultraviolet radiation which is responsible for skin aging as well as skin cancer but we visible light from the sun you know contributes to hyperpigmentation a lot of free radicals in the skin it also lowers the uh skin namely carotenoids and so we that those wavelengths likely play a major role in skin aging as well as well as diseases and hyperpigmentation when we think of the visible light spectrum that eyes it radiation it is visible light that illuminates our world it is emitted from devices and things like that visible light is anywhere from 400 to 700 nanometers it light blue light or hev for high energy visible light is 400 to 500 nanometers and if you look at the visible light spectrum hev or blue light is very close to uva which is ultraviolet radiation so there they and those high energy visible light wavelengths from blue light part of visible light definitely do contribute to free radical formation in the skin and for people with deeper skin tones they cause hyperpigmentation that is even more stubborn actually than the hyperpigmentation caused from the uva the ultraviolet radiation so there there behind the effects of blue light on the skin however this is visible light from the sun blue light from the sun not from your devices the amount of blue light that you are exposed to from computer screens smartphones tablets etc is negligible in comparison to what you exposed to from the sun so being mindful of the amount of sun exposure that you and science-based way to minimize potential damage to the skin from hev as well as ultraviolet radiation which there ages the skin and puts you at risk for skin cancer just to put it in perspective for you guys in terms of how the light emitted from devices compares to what we you would have to sit in front of a screen 30 centimeters away uninterrupted i mean non-stop for a week and that is the equivalent blue light exposure as just one minute out in the sun on a sunny day so worrying about the blue light from your computer screen it jacket to drink a glass of water you definitely need a life jacket if you going to be out in open waters in medicine remember it it focus on the big picture which is sun exposure that is the main source of blue light that problems to the health of your skin long term especially if you have a deeper skin tone you prevent and correct any hyperpigmentation then you do need to be mindful of those wavelengths can skin care products help with that truthfully they may but the devil is in the details now skincare products that have antioxidants in them they may help reduce the amount of free radicals that are generated from exposure to heb as well as uv radiation is there anything that can block hev wavelengths some sunscreens formulated with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide may help to reduce the amount of hev that your skin is exposed to and you know you get the benefit that you going to protect you from uv however it there too it picking up a mineral sunscreen and that being that being the end of story uh it dictate that unfortunately sunscreen doesn typically doesn protection that we are looking to improve upon and you know maybe develop a metric of visible light protection that sunscreens can can tell consumers hey this is how well our product protects you some brands are starting to test the visible light protection of their sunscreens now there that also can help to protect you from hev wavelengths in sunscreens and cosmetics and that is iron oxides again though it presence of iron oxides that helps to protect it formulated overall there has to be black red and yellow iron oxides in the product and the concentration of the iron oxides and then again the formulation overall other inactive ingredients may also help just by making an opaque formulation that protects some to some extent against those wavelengths but again skincare brands manufacturers even sunscreen manufacturers they they blue light protection typically so to be clear in terms of the health of your skin you don light from your devices you need to worry about it though from the sun especially again if you have a deeper skin tone it blue light the hev from the sun does impact the health of our skin not from our devices however the blue light from our devices is not you know completely harmless in our eyes we have something called retinal ganglion cells that are exquisitely exquisitely sensitive to blue light and those retinal ganglion cells they modulate physiologic processes outside of just vision i mean you think about your eyes in terms of seeing in sight but cells in your eyes they do more than just that they signal to your brain to control circadian rhythm melatonin and your sleep cycle so the harmful impact of staring at a computer screen is actually more towards your eye health and potentially your sleep cycle and you guys know from my videos that poor sleep directly relates to poor skin health so you can definitely make the connection there but it skincare product in that case it to be limiting your screen time to reduce your your blue light exposure to your eyes now they do market things like blue light blocking glasses and blue light films that you can put on screens and stuff and some studies suggest those might help but other studies suggest they don research is needed to say for sure if those actually help your eyes staring at a screen can contribute to visual eye strain that can give you a headache neck pain um make you you know find you find that you minimize that is actually again not through skincare products but something called the 20 20 20 rule and that is for every 20 minutes that you are staring at a screen you want to take a break of 20 seconds and during that break you want to look at something that is 20 feet away from you that 20 seconds is the amount of time that it takes for your eyes to relax however if you can stomach waiting 20 seconds any break that you take will help in reducing eye strain however not all blue light is the devil again it dose low doses of blue light are actually helpful for the skin to treat things like acne because at low doses it while staring at a screen can be harmful to the retinal ganglion cells blue light is important for a sleep cycle in general so just completely blocking it out is not a good idea either and many people who don to visible light from the sun they do suffer from something called seasonal affective disorder and blue light you know can help with that and blue light is really important for color discrimination and night vision so it not the it dose all right so if i haven clear to you guys at this point no you don you from your devices that being said what are the products in this line i again i haven think they were newly released like this week and um so i on the products the ingredients looks like there eye gel a lip balm and an eye mask now one thing i will point out that i found a touch misleading and i the individual but they talk about blpf which stands for blue light prevention factor like the lpf or blue light prevention factor what the heck is blpf it spf but for the screen and there statement on the website say that this is like spf but for blue light something to that extent that this blp ftm that is their trademark kind of ingredient it you know maybe a batch of antioxidants or something like that it trademark formulation we don exactly what it is but um i think that a little bit misleading to say it spf because spf is something that tells you how well a product is going to protect you from a burn and it is something that is the product after it is made is tested to determine that there there um you know standardized measurement of blue light protection so that in and of itself is a little bit confusing confusing but what this person is referring to is a batch of ingredients so ingredients you know there ingredients that equals spf so there that equals blue light protection yes some ingredients are known to help with these things but to say it just kind of misrepresents what spf is in the first place it is a measure of the final product you from a sunburn not oh this product has this ingredient or that ingredient i mean it of a sticking point but i do think when you claims like this i do think you need to be careful i think it can mislead consumers into thinking that the product has maybe been tested in the way that a sunscreen would be tested to show protection against uv rays against a sunburn i think it misleads the consumer into kind of thinking that the the product because it has this blpf on on the label blue light prevention factor you know there that name that they came up with for their ingredients so to make that clear um all right so the prices on these products don what is considered reasonable i you know i don eighteen dollars for a cleanser or twenty four dollars for one point seven ounces of a moisturizer that of drugstore prices so i don that they are insanely priced um the eye mask does have lavender oil in it which is fragrance and can cause irritation especially when you putting it to the delicate skin of the eyelids of course any ingredient can cause irritation but i always call out fragrance because it is one of the more common ingredients to cause skin problems for people the cleanser has papaya enzyme and pineapple fruit extract which are fruit sources of fruit enzymes that may offer some exfoliation but they can be irritating so just be mindful of that sounds like it is a foaming gel cleanser and the eye gel has ceramides in it which is helpful for skin barrier recovery reducing dry skin the moisturizer has hyaluronic acid and glycerin in it which are humectants to help with skin hydration and then the lip guard has sunflower seed oil in it something i noticed in looking at this website and you know i spend a lot of time staring at this giving myself eye strain there seems to be a discrepancy between the ingredients that are highlighted for the pro on the on the product page and what the actual ingredients on the the actual listed ingredients for example they call out in the lip guard shea butter but i don listed as an ingredient in the ingredient list and there was another one claimed to have niacinamide and i didn list which niacinamide is a great ingredient it know in theory it can help minimize the free radicals from blue light exposure but yeah i mean niacinamide is also good for calming down redness it health the health of the moisture barrier it website i don newly launched so maybe they make some tweaks but i found it very difficult to see the number of ounces in each product i was able to make out that the moisturizer is 1.7 ounces but i not sure how many ounces of the cleanser that you get for 18 i could kind of make out maybe five but it was really hard to to see the ounces on there and then i you get is it twenty four dollars for one eye mask that seems a little steep and unusual you know i like to do those eye masks for relaxation purposes and typically you get a jar or a package with many of them in there i don if that there masks just one for 24. i mean these are just like points about the website that i found difficult but since this isn that you can go into store and see and touch um you know i i don something to clarify on the website before people go buying this is how how much are you actually getting all right you guys so that i i wish this individual the best of luck again i i don her until you guys started commenting please react to this please react to this so i i never heard of her um i wish for the best of luck with this these products overall they don me as being problematic visible light blue light is a real skin issue does impact everyone lot more about it but it comes from the sun 50 of the radiation emitted from the sun is visible light within that you have this blue light and i mean unless you are glued to a screen 24 7 around the clock there you wearing a life preserver to drink a glass of water it moisturizer a cleanser a lip balm these are things i advocate for all the time they basic skincare routine cleanse the skin of dirt oil sebum but nothing about this these products in this routine you know it the gaming lifestyle per se the main negative consequence of gaming to the health of your skin is that it can impact melatonin release and the sleep cycle disrupting your sleep and that will directly feed into the health of your skin when we sleep our skin barrier repairs we heal we recover inadequate sleep is associated with accelerated onset of the signs of aging more prominent wrinkles and also a host of health problems cardiovascular disease a lot of inflammation in the body elevated levels in something called tnf alpha do not underestimate sleep last video game console i owned and operated the game was a little man jumping over mushrooms so that should tell you something about my gaming history which is probably why i creator you know you only are shown things that you engage with and i have never searched out gaming content so that individual anyways guys that is the review i hope this is what you were looking for when you asked me to respond to this and if you enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe i bye [Music] you	Success
Linda Evangelista BRUTALLY DISFIGURED from COOLSCULPTING | Dermatologist Responds | Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PXfC-Bc4ak	Dr Day	well hey guys in today to be responding to the supermodel linda evangelista been brutally disfigured by a very popular cosmetic procedure if you are new here hi my name is andrea i board certified dermatologist and if you like this style of video i will link many of my celebrity response videos down below in the description box today i took a big step forward writing a wrong that i have suffered and have kept to myself for over five years to my followers who have wondered why i have not been working while my peers careers have been thriving the reason is that i was brutally disfigured by zeltique procedure which did the opposite of what it promised it increased not decreased my fat cells and left me permanently deformed even after undergoing two painful unsuccessful corrective surgeries i have been left as the media has described unrecognizable so she had cool sculpting and has developed something called paradoxical adipose hyperplasia a side effect of coolsculpting what the heck is coolsculpting it cryolipolysis and it is a non-invasive way to reduce fat in localized areas like the abdomen the thighs the flanks cryolipolysis basically involves applying controlled cooling the cold temperatures trigger fat cell death it a really popular procedure consumers love it because first of all it non-invasive it the side effects generally are pretty mild you just have a little bit of discomfort bruising redness that it is very well tolerated in a pretty safe procedure there is a rare side effect called paradoxical adipose hyperplasia painless firm visually noticeable swelling in the treated area that reflects a paradoxical increase in fat cells we don this happens this procedure was approved for fat reduction in the abdomen the flanks and the thighs in 2010 and at that time it was reported that this side effect was pretty rare 0.025 percent but as the procedure has become more popular more and more cases of paradoxical adipose hyperplasia are coming to light more people are developing this and the side effect is actually thought to be a lot more common than originally was reported and the treatment is liposuction to get rid of the of the fat cells but like she said it doesn work out well there are reasons why liposuction can fail and it sounds like she has tried twice to correct her pah or paradox call adipose hyperplasia perhaps the side effect was unrecognized or underreported in the beginning why exactly this occurs we really don there are some interesting hypotheses as to why it might be happening perhaps there are some fat cells that are resistant to cryolipolysis and you are in a in effect kind of doing natural selection by treating these areas another possible mechanism is that through hypoxia or deprivation of oxygen from the treatment you essentially get rebound hypertrophy which means increase in cell size and or rebound hyperplasia which means an increase in cell number fat cell number another theory is that the increased blood flow and somehow the injury at that site is recruiting circulating or resident pre-fat cells or stem cells to the area leading to this paradoxical adipose hyperplasia it may also have something to do with the the settings high vacuum settings maybe put too much stress on the tissue and result in this rebound hyperplasia of fat cells that for whatever reason were resistant to destruction by the cold temperature for whatever reason this side effect is seeming to be more common in men actually than women and there may be an underlying genetic or hereditary component we lot in twins who both undergo the procedure it also be more common in hispanic and latino groups so we more about this side effect as more and more cases are coming about due to the increased demand in a minimally invasive cosmetic procedure for spot fat reduction um what does she say i have developed paradoxical adipose hyperplasia or pah a risk of which i was not made aware before i had the procedure pah has not only destroyed my livelihood it has sent me into a cycle of deep depression profound sadness and the lowest depth of depths of self-loathing in the process i have become a recluse with this lawsuit i am moving forward to rid myself of shame and going public with my story i this way i would like to walk out my door with my head held high despite not looking like myself any longer yeah this is obviously taken a tremendous toll on her mental health her sense of self and her livelihood lost wages she is suing the maker of coolsculpting for 50 million dollars um seeking damages for both emotional distress and lost wages she hasn any money as a model since 2016 as a result of the effects of this procedure i come forward and shared this with her audience because i think it for people especially young people who you know follow celebrities on social media to be aware of the fact that cosmetic procedures while they are generally safe they risk of harm on social media there this illusion that first of all these unrealistic beauty expectations of what people you know think they should look like as a result of all the filters and you know the boom of cosmetic surgery i mentioned this in an earlier video but in 2020 we saw a marked rise in people seeking cosmetic procedures which was kind of you know surprising in the middle of um a pandemic that we were seeing such a demand for cosmetic procedures it was referred to as zoom dysmorphia people basically spending all day looking at themselves on you know an unflattering lighting on zoom calls and then looking at social media stuck in their homes really impacted overall emotional well-being and there was a lot of demand for cosmetic procedures now coolsculpting it is a non-invasive procedure it performed not just by physicians but also in med spas and so it somebody who is qualified to do this procedure and really takes the time to educate you on what to expect and potential side effects i i that no one told her this was a potential side effect while it may have been rare and under reported at the time that she had this when it comes to edu when it comes to counseling any patient regardless of who they are you want to make sure that you tell them of the risks of the procedure it shown actually that many physicians when they which i cringe at that term but it is what it is um sometimes are a bit over over overly cautious because of fear of litigation and so i was not educated she was not told about this potential complication i can remember which medical journal it was i was reading a while ago but you know frequently they will have these ethics cases and i remember there being you know their theoretical cases to work through the ethical issues of things and one of them was in treating you know vip patients and the the issues around being overly cautious you know maybe ordering too many tests out of fear of litigation so all that being said i am kind of surprised that no one mentioned this to her any other rare rare side effects that could occur with this that you might want to know about since this procedure has been approved and is so popular there are case reports of other much rarer side effects frostbite um tissue necrosis but that have tissue necrosis basically just means tissue death of the underlying skin which turn black and not a good thing neuropathy which is basically damage to the nerves that could leave you you know with some motor impairment not a good thing and interestingly enough it has been reported to trigger this autoimmune connective tissue disease called morphia that being said there are many reports of morphia being triggered after procedure or injury so that is a case where it predisposed to morphia and maybe the lipolysis or any procedure that you might have had would have been the tipping point for your disease to begin to manifest um so i that because if you hear about that it not like you know morphia is caused by cool sculpting no but in people who are predispos you know who have people who are going to go on to develop morphia coolsculpting may be the thing that kicks it off and if you have morphia then this would be contraindicated so there definitely are risks serious risks with all cosmetic procedures that could occur and i think it of those because everybody risk to benefit ratio for themselves is going to be different and for many people hearing this potential complication you know they may be okay with it but being informed that is that is the most important thing as a as a patient informed decision making is essential you need to be informed of risks of any procedure make sure you somebody who has the experience to properly educate you on not only what to expect with the procedure but of any potential side effects i talk with you guys a lot about you know kind of the facial aesthetic standards being skewed as a result of social media but also body standards uh you know people you know being unhappy and dissatisfied with their physical body habitus as a result of social media but you have to remember that people who take photographs and post them on social media as part of their career as their work they are either editing the photos or they multiple multiple photos and choosing the best one they are all things that you know i i know there was a trend recently of instagram versus reality where many like influencers were showing their actual body habitus versus posed in her case though the way she looks is how she makes money you know she model this is a really important thing um to her career her livelihood she can complication so that think about is how any potential complication not only will affect the way that you look but your ability to work your livelihood your day-to-day life i can being in the public eye getting this procedure thinking that it is minimally invasive thinking that it career and then have this devastating complication have the media make horrible comments about you not be able to work wow i mean i i can know in the comments below though you guys have you had any cosmetic procedures and developed a complication uh what was the outcome share with us in the comments what happened if you feel comfortable um but i hope you guys enjoyed this video if so give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don subscribe i bye [Music] you	Success
Halle Berry's ANTI AGING KETO DIET? | Dermatologist Response | Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXTrgWalvd4	Dr Day	well hey guys in my last celebrity response video to natalie portman claiming that going vegan gave her great skin y halle berry lifestyle is what is responsible for her good looking skin if you welcome my name is andrea i board-certified dermatologist and if you like celebrity response videos i have several so i below in the description box halle berry is i think 55 and so she she credits her ketogenic lifestyle to having an anti-aging effect look at this you got to talk to us about this so what do you do yeah what do you eat come on i i gotta okay you want me to tell you yes what secrets i swear by the ketogenic diet what is that it it you force your body to do is instead of burning sugar for fuel you start burning healthy fats like avocado coconut oil i following the keto or ketogenic diet very low carb food plan that actually forces your body to burn fat like crazy i also believe it responsible for slowing down my aging process all right what is a ketogenic diet what is she talking about a ketogenic diet is one in which the macronutrient profile is high fat very low carbohydrate and low to moderate protein levels and this way of eating puts you in a ketogenic state a metabolic state you on free fatty acids generated through something called beta oxidation as your primary metabolite for cellular energy so driving all the processes in your body leading to a lower overall level of something called insulin and insulin-like growth factor these are hormones this way of eating in this diet is particularly compelling for those who deal with problems with insulin and insulin resistance like diabetics namely so is it beneficial for the skin honestly there are no robust trials looking at instituting a ketogenic diet for the improvement of any particular skin condition but it is pretty compelling by lowering insulin and insulin-like growth factor you can imagine how being on a ketogenic diet and in a ketogenic metabolic state would improve acne why is that well when you lower insulin and insulin-like growth factor downstream of that you lower total androgen levels androgens those are the male hormones that we all have and they play a role in acne specifically right at the oil gland they lead to an increase in oil production that clogs the pore when you lower insulin and insulin-like growth factor you also increase activity of something called retinoid x receptor and that skin cell turnover within the pore reducing poor clogging and a ketogenic diet and being in a ketogenic state may have some anti-inflammatory effects as well acne is an inflammatory skin condition so given these alterations and hormones and potentially an anti-inflammatory effect it does make sense that people might appreciate an improvement in their acne on a ketogenic diet when in a ketogenic metabolic state and i say that because it takes some time to get there and you can five or six days a week and then eat whatever you want on the other day the keto diet is the most rapidly effective dietary strategy for lowering insulin lowering insulin-like growth factor and lowering androgen so it makes sense that it might help a variety of hormonally driven skin issues i already talked about acne but you also have hidradenitis to puritiva not to mention all the skin complications that come with being insulin resistant and we having diabetes halle berry did or does have diabetes it if you of diabetes type 1 and type 2 type 1 is an autoimmune disease that presents in child early early childhood whereas type 2 is acquired in type 1 your body doesn in type 2 your body becomes resistant to insulin because you pumping out so much of it as a result of dietary and lifestyle choices having diabetes whether it be type 1 or type 2 affects the skin in many many ways diabetes is think of it as a systemic disease with multiple multiple and organ effects on pretty much every organ system in your body including the skin diabetics have very poor wound healing for type 2 diabetics one of one of the signs of insulin resistance on the skin is something called acanthosis [\\xa0__\\xa0] cans it it happens most often on the sides of the neck in the armpits it can happen on your face and you guys have you know asked me about it before so i down below in the description box my video on acanthosis niagara cans if you imagine how improving your insulin levels maybe through being on a ketogenic diet and getting into a ketogenic state and staying there that you might see some improvement in that but again there are no studies showing that hyperinsulinemia and type 2 diabetes also comes with an increased risk or an association with skin tags which are benign little skin growths but they are a lot more common in people who are who have type 2 diabetes 30 of diabetics develop diabetic dermopathy otherwise known as shin spots they start out as red scaly little spots on the shins and then they heal with hyperpigmentation and they stay there they don away it underlying uh poor microvascular health so basically the blood vessels are diseased as a result of having diabetes and you have poor wound healing and they tend to occur on kind of bony areas like the shins and so you know perhaps being on a ketogenic diet in a ketogenic state may help in improving that people with diabetes can develop really large blisters when you complication as a result of your diabetes it get your insulin in shack so you can imagine how those kind of things in the skin might improve diabetics are also at an increased risk for a variety of skin infections fungal infections yeast infections and bacterial skin infections and they already have poor healing so those skin infections can be very complicated and lead to significant morbidity in diabetics granuloma angular a comment below and if you have that there is a generalized form of that it a skin condition where you get these little annular plaques you can have just one but in diabetics there is an association with that disease and getting those little plaques all over the place it generalized granuloma iora and it is seen in association with insulin resistance and diabetes so that another one where you know we can scratch our heads and say hey i wonder if a ketogenic diet might help these people out who are coping with this and have have type 2 diabetes what about an anti-aging effect that she and in terms of the skin i you guys before about how a high glycemic load diet a diet that is rich in processed sugary foods negatively affects the collagen or skin by generating something called advanced glycation end products basically the sugar gloms onto the collagen this process not only damages the collagen and elastin in your skin leading to wrinkles loss of elasticity and snap but it impairs repair the repair processes in the skin that heal damaged collagen and so having a diet that is rich in processed sugary foods the way the food is prepared is another you know indicator of the burden of advanced glycation and products that the foods will lead to when consumed you know as part of your diet now one thing that often goes hand in hand with type 2 diabetes although not always but can and a lot of skin issues as well is obesity many people who are obese develop type 2 diabetes and weight loss can help in reversing that so there is some thought that putting people on a ketogenic diet may help them if they are obese with weight loss because it can be a form of calorie restriction depending on how it executed some people claim that they feel more they achieve satiety on fewer calories following a ketogenic diet so it helps them in weight loss which will help with markers of inflammation and will help with these disease processes weight loss will help with the metabolic complications namely type 2 diabetes and all of these skin issues that i have outlined not to mention it will also help with their cardiovascular health as well now while robust clinical trials on the skin benefits of a ketogenic diet are lacking we do have two fairly recent small studies looking at a ketogenic diet for an inflammatory skin condition psoriasis there was recently a single arm open label study in 37 overweight patients with psoriasis now psoriasis everybody always thinks of as a skin disease but it happens to have skin lesions people with psoriasis can go on to develop diabetes and they also can develop cardiovascular complications and for whatever reason many people with psoriasis have comorbid obesity as part of their disease and we don know if it being obese worsens the psoriasis or having psoriasis makes it harder for you to lose weight more likely to be obese we don patients they were put on a ketogenic weight loss protocol and they had a decrease in something called the psoriasis area severity index it of a measure used in clinical studies of psoriasis to see did did the psoriasis get better or not and it you know there was a statistical difference but whether or not that was due to calor being on a calorie restricted diet or something specific to the keto diet itself we can because when it comes to weight loss it is a it is a thermodynamic process weight loss boils down to either reducing what you put in or increasing what you put out and so this they put these people on a keto diet but they put these people on a calorie deficit so they lost weight and as a result they saw an improvement in their psoriasis then there was another study in 30 patients with psoriasis on a low-calorie keto diet they lost weight and had an improvement in their psoriasis there was a 10 weight loss in that study and they also showed that there was a decrease in inflammatory markers but you can get that by being in a calorie deficit so it you know they don how being in a ketogenic state benefits psoriasis i mean it doesn studies don people will claim it is anti-inflammatory and there that makes sense but we really don have good studies looking at large groups of people to show big drops and inflammatory markers when being on on this diet why like my arguments with the vegan diet that natalie portman made you know keto is is a metabolic state how you get there is a macronutrient profile but you can be eating a certain way is it whole foods or is it the processed junk that you can now buy in the store that is labeled keto now that the keto diet is so popular i mean there that you know and so once you start going down the processed keto foods are you really getting the benefits it a ketogenic state your body you have ketones in the blood and ketones are actually anti-inflammatory they are potent activators of something called a nuclear factor erythroid 2 factor two pathway and this pathway because ketones activate this it leads to an increase in something called glutathione which is a antioxidant in our body in our cells that helps us fight off oxidative stress and reduces inflammation ketones stimulate pathways that lead to more glutathione production another thing about the ketogenic diet is it does allow for broccoli consumption which is rich in sulfurophane sulfurophane activates this pathway as well so you can get some of these benefits by eating broccoli and then ketones are effectively used by that little organelle the powerhouse of the cell the mitochondria so this may lead to a reduction in reactive oxygen species and less overall oxidative stress that would ultimately damage proteins dna in our skin cells and lead to more you know accelerate the rate of aging so the anti-aging claim that she mechanistically it makes sense honestly that it might have some anti-aging effect but again we don clinical studies the ketone beta hydroxybutyrate it can reduce um something called interleukin-1 beta a cytokine that is at the heart of a lot of these inflammatory diseases so that particular ketone is directly associated with reduction in il1 independent of weight so therein you know you you start to have an intriguing compelling argument for the ketogenic diet for having skin benefits but again we don have like actual studies on people that are large enough to draw that kind of conclusion now being on a ketogenic diet and in a ketogenic state it rainbows and butterflies there are some problems that can arise if you you know that initially it can be quite miserable people go through something called the keto flu your it takes time for your body to adapt to this and you can be you know it can be quite taxing on the body as far as the skin when you a keto diet you can develop something called parigo pigmentosa it is uncomfortable it is an itchy scaly rash that you know we don who start a keto diet develop this but that can happen and like i said with the vegan diet it it because of the way this diet is structured you need to supplement uh potassium most keto people on keto diets are taking some kind of electrolyte supplement so you do need to supplement and micronutrient deficiencies can happen if you sports like distance running your performance may suffer on a ketogenic diet all right what about her claims that like her brain fog and all of that got better you know it because she does have a history of diabetes and we don about where she was at in her in her glycemic control you know was she well controlled because honestly if you are a diet if you are out of control you have a high what uh hemoglobin a1c all these things they how you feel for sure uh having having high chronically elevated levels of insulin and and glucose will make you feel like sting so improving that through your diet lowering insulin lowering insulin like growth factor yeah you feel better she claims that it helped her migraines you know i you have migraines go on a keto diet i not a neurologist so i haven the neurology literature there but um i would i would seriously question if it else in her life that was triggering her migraines maybe her sleep got better on a keto diet because you know she feeling better but who knows you guys who knows what exactly is going on so as with any any diet enthusiasts out there touting the benefits of a diet take it with a grain of salt in the case of keto you do need to take it with a grain of salt because uh that your electrolytes here more research it likely would benefit some people namely those you know perhaps with diabetes or other metabolic issues but if you uh is this a diet that is necessary is going to be as beneficial for you well if it ends up stressing the body out too much because of your lifestyle maybe it ends up getting you micronutrient deficiencies well then no the risk in that case would outweigh any potential benefit that where we need more research before we can just go recommending a keto diet when people are like go keto go keto go keto it some people will may benefit from it if executed properly for their health but whether or not it sustainable for the long term that hard to say as well fat does tend to be more satiating so you may feel fuller on fewer calories with this diet because it may be more satiating to you you may end up losing weight and that might not be a good thing for you um so definitely as with any of these diets definitely see your health care provider don youtube who is you know sharing their keto journey or whatever i mean make sure that you talk to your physician see a registered dietitian make sure this is right for you another thing i will point out about this diet especially in the beginning that i never hear people talk about you do have to be very careful if you are on medications because the diet especially when you your body is getting used to it what ends up happening is you lose a lot of water that is why people experience so much weight loss in the first few weeks they glycogen carbohydrate the storage form of carbohydrates it holds water so you lose a lot of water and that shift in fluids in your body can affect the distribution of medications so don just jump on the diet without talking to your doctor because it could potentially impact the volume of distribution of medications that you might need some tweaking following as you transition on this diet all right you guys that what i can tell you about halle berry claims of the ketogenic diet and its anti-aging benefits that she has observed in herself let me know in the comments what is your favorite halle berry movie for me it is monsters ball i love that movie in fact i because i i could watch that movie again anyways i digress i hope you enjoyed this video if so give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don i [Music] you	Success
Natalie Portman says GOING VEGAN GAVE HER GREAT SKIN | My Response | Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_HJY8jq6ew	Dr Day	well hey guys natalie portman recently told harper that going vegan changed her skin in today to this i opinion on what she said and is going vegan the secret to radiant skin and well looking like natalie portman once i became vegan my skin got great are there any potential skin benefits from going vegan well eliminating dairy may help in improving the appearance of acne for some people but honestly the association between dairy and acne it loosey-goosey you guys may recall from my videos on dairy and acne and clear skin diet that there is an association with skim milk consumption and more stubborn acne it that leads to an increase in something called insulin like growth factor one which directly causes more oil production in the skin from the sebaceous follicle and that flares acne in people predisposed to acne there are a number of studies that show this but it doesn board for all people it something with your genetics perhaps that may make you more sensitive to something in the milk we haven figured it out and to be clear it dairy all in all it is skim milk that lies and skim milk seem to skim milk seems to be the culprit aside from skim milk processed sugary foods with a high glycemic load likewise increased insulin like growth factor one that leads to more oil production in the skin and high glycemic load foods also can increase what products high glycemic load foods like processed sugary foods and smoked meats can increase what are called advanced glycation and products in the skin that damage collagen and lead to more prominent wrinkles but to be clear you can quote go vegan and still eat high glycemic load non-animal foods and therefore not see any potential skin benefit or you may eliminate these things and still have acne because it is a complex disease with a lot of underlying factors your own hormones may be playing a role and simply making a diet switch may not make a difference i have to say this article is a little vague too and that she doesn skin problems were before and you know what the change exactly was she doesn detail it she just says got good i her skin before going vegan and you know how how it is better that would have been some nice information does she have is she overall less oily well you know she is getting wiser and with age some of our hormones change and we make less oil so that could be an explanation beyond just the change in her diet another skin benefit of going vegan maybe depending on how you how you build your diet is that you may start eating more whole fruits and vegetables which are rich in fiber fiber has benefits for the gut microbiome and in contrast to the standard american diet and standard western diet which is very low in fiber this dietary change you know it could make a difference for your skin and could reduce total body inflammation there are some studies that show that people who follow a vegan diet and i say that in air quotes for reasons i explain later uh do you have a lower crp c-reactive protein which is a marker of inflammation and so you may you know kind of experience some skin benefits in that sense that you know it only that you are consuming more antioxidants if you are incorporating more fruits and vegetables and these things can help fight off oxidative stress in the skin that damages dna in our skin cells it leads to premature wrinkling and destruction of collagen all those things your skin may be better equipped to handle the destruction that occurs upon exposure to uv rays of course that is not a license to stop wearing sunscreen and just go out in town but consuming more fruits and vegetables can help to increase what minimal erythematous dose of the skin basically the dose of uv that will begin to damage your skin consuming more antioxidant rich fruits and vegetables and whole foods whole plant-based foods can increase that so you are less vulnerable to uv damage again not a license to not a license to get in the tanning bed by any means or to go out and tan your skin it is possible that some skin conditions may improve upon changing your diet to be compliant with the vegan lifestyle depending on how you change that diet but because studies do show that people who uh incorporate a plant-based diet do you have lower levels of what you can expect that if that for you then some inflammatory skin conditions like of course acne which we eczema seborrheic dermatitis you may notice some improvement in these conditions but it when we changing your diet to be compliant with a vegan lifestyle it depends on how you change the diet of course and if you are going to change your diet to be compliant with a vegan lifestyle or go plant-based however you want to label it you do need to be aware of the fact that eliminating animal products from your diet requires you to take a b12 supplement period b12 is a vitamin that you cannot really get in a plant-based diet at all and so it executed properly a vegan diet can put you at risk for certain micronutrient deficiencies some studies do show that vegans have poor poor wound healing from cosmetic procedures laser procedures co2 laser for example people who followed a vegan diet had took longer to recover from co2 laser and if you have a tattoo and you want it removed and you vegan diet it may take you longer and more sessions to get that tattoo off of course these studies are not perfect they limitations but don going on a vegan diet whatever that entails for you is going to is going to lead to crystal clear perfect skin another study showed that people who follow a vegan diet they have more wound diastasis and poor wound healing post procedure there are a number of small studies in the dermatology literature again small and with their own sets of limitations and biases but these small studies do suggest that people who follow a you know a diet compliant with the vegan lifestyle they do have a little bit more of delayed healing from certain procedures possibly due to less than optimal levels of certain micronutrients that you cannot get these micronutrients things like zinc iron which are necessary for good healing it from a diet that is compliant with a vegan lifestyle but it needs to be executed correctly and you need to make sure that you are eating a variety and getting a good variety of whole grains legumes beans beans or legumes leafy greens fruits and vegetables healthy fats etc in your diet and not just relying on a few of your favorite foods in that situation you can easily become deficient in certain micronutrients and it going to feel necessarily the day of it can be a gradual down trending something that your body may kind of get used to but in the setting of a stress an acute stress like say for example you go into the hospital if these micronutrients aren actually could negatively influence your recovery in the hospital um so that that is always a concern that if you follow a diet compliant with the vegan lifestyle you need to be aware of these limitations and make sure that you aren your favorites exclusively or if you have to have a major surgery you you know you may have been trekking along with you know on the low end of say iron levels for a long time not really necessarily feeling but poorly at all but when you put your body through a stressful event like that if you if your micronutrient stores are not teed up so to speak well then that could set you up for problems with healing as has been demonstrated in some of these studies in the dermatology literature she claims she has better looking skin um are vegans healthier as a whole honestly that is a question that to be frank we cannot answer why because no two vegans are alike and lifestyle factors influence health beyond just your diet a lot of the studies that we have showing benefits in terms of consuming a vegan diet show benefits on cardiovascular risk factors things like ldl levels tend to be lower in people who follow a vegan diet so to speak bmi tends to be lower if you look at the literature on studies that examine vegan diets there are a lot of limitations i mean that any diet so you always have to be really critical when people present their impression of what the science says because they will find ways to pick and choose articles that support their narrative but regardless of what diet you are interested in do be aware of the fact that dietary studies have a ton of limitations dietary studies are laden with so many limitations recall bias the studies that we have on people who have been on a vegan diet for most of their life those studies often are first seventh day adventists who these these are religious groups that follow a vegetarian or vegan diet mostly not all of them do but uh the majority of them do but they do their lifestyle is more than their diet they don drugs they don regularly and they take at least in the case of seventh-day adventists they take what called a sabbath basically a day off of work they spend time um in community and these things all independent of diet have been shown to benefit a variety of health parameters probably by lowering stress the problem i have with this and with even many of the study the research studies in the literature is the terminology vegan diet there is no such thing as a vegan diet veganism is a lifestyle choice centered around minimizing as much as possible reliance on animals for you know personal gain if you will to minimize harm to animals and animal cruelty animal exploitation it not about making a food choice because of yourself it food choice to minimize reliance on animal based products so you can you can eat pretty close to a standard american diet as far as packaged foods and junk and be vegan if your motivation is not to yourself you can continue to eat poorly um and you know subsist off of packaged junk is that going to be good for you your health long term no and so i feel frustrated when people make these kinds of statements that going vegan changed their skin or you know dissolve their arthritis or any kind of health claim because first of all we simply don that kind of of claim it anecdote and going vegan i mean is it did those things happen because you stopped buying leather shoes did those things happen because you you know stopped going to a zoo um you know there are a variety of lifestyle choices that vegans make because they feel an intense ethical connection with animals and they motivated to minimize reliance on animal based products so the diet i mean you can you can oreos uh many people consider vegan some don because of palm oil but many people do and they you know you can you can subsist off of that call yourself you know you may be a vegan eating a vegan diet but that is not a diet for health i think we can all agree on that what does natalie portman say she eats i mean she really didn elaborate here at all and of course it becomes the focus of the article because that media outlines do things the celebrity makes one like you know comment to the side before you know it they change your skin i doubt she even really said it like that but anyways she some of my favorite foods are vegetable tacos chips and guac filo dough puff pastries and oat milk cappuccinos this sounds like we can just eat chipotle and starbucks and and look like natalie portman based on what she told us chips and guac yeah i mean somebody who that you know they can just eliminate animal foods in their diet and have all these health benefits but poorly executed diet that is compliant with a vegan lifestyle can actually be harmful to your health so you you need to make sure that you educate yourself on how to ensure that the diet that you are following gets you the micro and macronutrient profile that you need to and you certainly can do that on a vegan diet but you have to be you have to be educated to do that properly and there are a variety of good resources but there are a lot of bad resources actually online on youtube for example i mean all these armchair dietitians that you run into you know they can easily mislead you so be careful um you know i hate when people say do your research because you know you can do your research in a vacuum online and get really poor information a registered dietitian can can be a tremendous asset if you are considering changing to a you know a diet compliant with a vegan lifestyle however that is sustainable to you it may not though be necessarily the healthiest diet depending on how how you execute it so you know whatever this is harper the landsat or anything speaking of which though where i really become frustrated is in these studies or case reports or things where they like vegan diet vegan diet and they do not elaborate on what the people in these studies are eating saying vegan diet is like saying a costco diet i am a member of costco and i only buy things in bulk you guys know i shop elsewhere but say for example you did a study and you called it the costco diet well if you been in costco there are a variety of foods in there that you can choose from and i mean there are fruits vegetables and there are a ton of delicious not so healthy treats that you can buy in bulk and you know you so you could say i putting people on a costco diet that is the same thing as saying we at people who are on a vegan diet you have to define what the people are eating because vegan diet can mean a lot of things whole food plant-based raw vegan uh what they call junk food vegan where you you know you know a lot more processed foods that are convenient and just like it diet is good for your health it accurate to say that an omnivorous diet is bad for your health it is all in what the diet subsists consists of you can have an omnivorous diet that is rich in fruits vegetables whole grains legumes you know all of these healthy things and you know still having some animal-based proteins there evidence that that is harmful to human health and in many cases you could compare that to a diet a vegan diet if you will a diet compliant with the vegan lifestyle that is you know oreos beyond sausages and not much else and well honestly in that case the omnivores are going to fare better so it there of what she said it landsat not the new england journal of medicine the other thing she says is also i don glass of wine and that alone that kind of if that if she was drinking more than that in the past and changed over to a more restricted consumption of alcohol well that of health benefits and a lot of benefits for your skin i have a video which i link down below on how alcohol is damaging to the skin namely excess alcohol consumption binge drinking and even what you might not think is excess alcohol consumption it actually can end up leading to more skin aging accelerated skin aging as well as an onslaught of health impact so simply that statement alone i don not more than a glass of wine that could have made the headlines you know not drinking changed her skin in summary yes it is possible to appreciate some beneficial skin changes when you switch to a diet that is compliant with a vegan lifestyle provided it is executed correctly and so i suggest you educate yourself on what all that entails i do that because that is not my area of expertise alright guys i hope you enjoyed this video

UNREALISTIC BODY STANDARDS| BOTOX & FILLER BAN for under 18| Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii3R9zTHNtc	Dr Day	well hey guys in today to comment on this new act that went into place in the uk the botulinum toxin and cosmetic fillers parentheses children act basically banning fillers botox any kind of injectable in children under the age of 18. so according to the minister for mental health suicide prevention and patient safety nadine doris said the move was to protect children from pressure to achieve truly unrealistic body images this is interesting there has been a huge rise in people of all age groups seeking out cosmetic procedures including filler and botox social media is often to blame seeing unrealistic images of influencers celebrities many of whom have had these procedures many of whom are very open about getting these procedures document them and it creates this desire to have those procedures and to look that way but is it realistic and is it potentially harmful especially when we young impressionable children tens of thousands of teens have undergone some sort of treatment to smooth or plump their features so starting on october 1st it will be illegal for certified injectors to inject someone under the age of 18 with a muscle paralyzer aka like botox neurotoxins which remember paralyzing muscles to smooth out wrinkles that appear with movement and also be illegal for them to do filler you know it so many teens and young people are seeking out this procedure and the thing about cosmetic procedures is there are physicians who do these procedures and there are a lot of these like certified injectors and so so it almost a wild west in a sense if you really want the procedure you somebody who will do it and so it to see that there place to protect minors who you know are very vulnerable now this law of course doesn these injections for medical reasons there are a lot of medical reasons for which somebody might need botox or filler for example botox is used to treat migraines so physicians will still be able to do that botox is also used to treat something called torticollos i mean it has a lot of benefits for a variety of medical conditions so physicians will still be able to do neurotoxin injections or filler injections in somebody 18 years of age or under for medical necessity so that as with any procedure in medicine that would entail having a discussion though of you know treatment options weighing the risks versus benefits and it going to be for cosmetic reasons in those cases but certified injectors are not physicians they maybe took a weekend course on how to do this and because cosmetics you know it not medicine pers it not something that is covered by insurance or your health plans in other countries it that you pay out of pocket for and it a bit of a wild west in terms of the landscape and regulation so i think people 18 years of age and younger i do think they are a vulnerable population given everything that we see on social media for potentially developing poor self-esteem from this i mean it well established that social media is making teens more depressed sad poor self-esteem and there is a rise in what and it media plays a big role in this and young people are really vulnerable to to this kind of these kinds of images i talked about this in another video that i did earlier this year and you guys really seem to enjoy that maybe it that some of you have struggled with i mean it media and not feel like my goodness my forehead doesn know my skin doesn this blemish i have that blemish what you see on social media does not reflect reality everything is highly edited they use these filters which i don that they you wow look how great their skin looks what are they using to get that appearance of their skin how do i get that and maybe they getting fillers and things like that you don this filter so i do think you know young people are really really impressionable now to be clear botox and fillers they are not fda approved for children for cosmetic reasons so botox is fda approved for people 18 years of age and older and filler is approved for people 21 years of age and older aesthetic medicine has always been in this gray area where you have you know kind of budding heads with conflict of interest it a profit mediated aspect there doubt i mean you for aesthetic treatments but it something that benefits patients from an emotional standpoint and you know it it aesthetic medicine but here physicians and health care providers they are under the age of 18 and you go to a physician for example and request us they course there are always going to be cowboys out there as they call them who you know may be willing to but and filler is only fda approved for people 21 years of age and older so while you have the legal ability to consent to filler at the age of 18 a physician who administered filler you know gave you filler at that age would technically be doing it off label so it for both the patient and the provider honestly when it comes to just the overall landscape of aesthetic medicine it is kind of you know a bit of an uh a bit of an unregulated territory in some aspects and that you have people who go to school and become either plastic surgeons or dermatologists who undergo a lot of training they do special fellowships and aesthetic medicine highly highly trained and then you have people who take you know like a one or two week course and are inexperienced so the fact that a younger person could just walk in and to like a med spa or something like that and have these procedures they could potentially not only have you know long-term damage to their emotional well-being from you know getting into this too early but then poor technique they could be scarred i mean there are a lot of potential serious adverse effects some of them temporary that are more likely if you go to someone who is inexperienced or just doesn filler is a very safe thing to to do but there are risks and there are potential complications that you could encounter when going to someone especially who is not experienced if the fact that a young child might have access to this it is concerning you can you know for example some adverse effects of injectables include infection scarring and blindness when when done around around the eye area and while neurotoxins like botox also are super safe and very low risks of complications you can develop complications temporary facial droop that do think we have to seriously take a step back and consider the fact that we don what the long term implications of getting injectables to young are obviously the overarching concern i think with this law is that there are potentially long-term emotional effects body dysmorphia poor self-esteem etc but truthfully we do not know how this might impact how the face ages long-term it could you know potentially have effects getting botox too young too many injections could you potentially cause some muscular atrophy that would cause desir undesirable cosmetic outcomes long term that right away so after october 1st businesses are going to have to verify patient age in the uk i think that is a good thing failure to do so will involve persecution of course where there is a medical need a doctor will still be able to approve treatment but this must be administered by a doctor nurse dentist or pharmacist i mean if you think about it we also regulate minors access to other injectables if you will you can get a tattoo under the age of 18. uh you should not be able to access a tanning bed that legislation there for that kind of legislation in the us to protect minors from skin cancer which if you go on a tanning bed you it elevates your risk dramatically for skin cancer including the deadly melanoma and there is a lot of push here in the states for more legislation to to restrict minors access to tanning beds unfortunately some of it has kind of gone on the back burner as far as the push towards more legislation since the pandemic it the increased popularity of injectables as the love island surge [Music] hi i and i questions i that a show it show but is that something only in the uk let me know in the comments do you guys watch that i thought love island was somewhere people were going to have like black market cosmetic procedures and anyways um the love island surge after learning that more than 41 000 procedures were done on underage patients in the last year the botox and cosmetic fillers the botulinum toxin and cosmetic fillers parentheses children act went into effect let me know in the comments what do you think about minors having access to aesthetic procedures i personally think it can go down a dark path set the person up for long-term negative effects on their emotional health you know instagram they around their algorithms and doing all these tweaks and adding all these silly stickers and things that they want us to tap on and play with and all this stuff it would be really interesting if they did away with filters for a year the filter free year in my opinion i think everyone benefits from restricting the amount of time they spend engaging with social media you can just binge on social media and these apps algorithms platforms they in there i mean especially tick tock and instagram they do not want you leaving the platform they don have to you have to restrict your your amount the amount of time you spend on there not only for your emotional health but you have your life to live you can just be engaged in these platforms non-stop but a lot of people do end up getting sucked into their phone and it leaves them feeling emotionally drained feeling horrible about themselves because you of people with all this stuff and i recommend reading books but seriously read some more books even if you hate reading um you have to ask yourself do you hate reading more than you hate like feeling like your disgusting pile of nothingness which social media can make you feel like that um so read a book honestly it entertaining it will help you sleep better to not be staring at your phone in the evening time um all that blue light is keeping you up which causes more stress more anxiety let me know your thoughts about this in the comments you guys i hear what you guys think i hope you all enjoyed this video if so give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe i bye [Music] you	Success
Jennifer Aniston's NEW CASH GRAB BEAUTY BRAND LolaVie | WILL IT FLOP? | Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wx_d-DCWL1A	Dr Day	well hey guys jennifer aniston is coming out with a beauty brand it launches tomorrow and over on instagram she created an instagram page for the brand it posts and over 10 000 followers already in today my opinion on this brand yes without knowing anything about the products why because when it comes to celebrity skin care it about the practice so i you my thoughts opinions and is she likely to be successful with this brand over the past few years a lot of celebrities have had great success launching skincare brands rihanna for example and more and more celebrities are catching in on this trend of creating a skincare brand or a beauty brand because they realize it can be incredibly lucrative to leverage their influence ariana grande haley bieber harry styles they they brands but not all celebrities have great success with launching a skincare brand many of them fizzle out and end up on the shelves of tj maxx with a big sticker on them sometimes in a cage why do celebrities do this why do they create skin care brands shouldn they be acting singing dancing i mean that well when you have that much influence creating a skincare brand is a way to grow your net worth and that important business strategy that they do this similar to how people invest in real estate when you celebrity or you have a large following investing in starting up a skincare brand is a way to grow your net worth and if you follow the trajectory of successful celebrity skincare brands the end goal is always to sell out to a major corporation for you know x billions of dollars it never to insert yourself into the skin care space the beauty space for the long haul that recognize whenever a celebrity launches a brand the brand is being launched to leverage their celebrity influence to increase their net worth in a unique and different way this is an important business strategy for celebrities in particular because you as an actor singer dancer or whatever for the long term i mean being an actor in hollywood there often is there often is an end date in sight and unfortunately when it comes to women a lot of times that correlates with age so you need to create other ways to grow your net worth beyond just relying on your skills as an actor or dancer singer whatever your celebrity skill is you can that forever not everybody has good success with this way of investing and growing their net worth by starting a skincare brand in my opinion the people who have the best success are those who have a following in their late teens early 20s that age demographic is more impressionable they buy things because they the hip cool girl status of a product that they associate with the celebrity but when your audience gets more mature as you get more mature that likely to work you could say she old too old i mean two eyes uh and i don wisest person although she seems pretty smart and savvy but her audience is wise with age comes wisdom and women in particular are probably her largest demographic of followers fans women in their 40s who in the past watched her on friends were fans of her movies and have continued to love and adore her i to buy into skincare products because they have a celebrity endorsement women in this age they they endorsement and so the products have to have to stand on their own and unfortunately a lot of times when it comes to celebrity skin care brands they copycats of a bazillion other things on the market and they don they r d behind the ingredient selection they usually have very basic formulations oftentimes with fragrance it about the packaging and the branding her audience is too wise they age group that if you have an audience that is you know young late teens early twenties that is the time to swoop in on this kind of skincare investment but that who demographic are going to have success in the skincare market either you do still need to have some degree of credibility and more and more consumers are suspicious doubtful and not buying into celebrity endorsements there was this marketing study that showed that over 50 of online shoppers were influenced not by influencer recommendations not by celebrity endorsements but by user generated content that means actual people real people in the real world who actually buy these products and leave reviews on different sites that starting to have more carry more weight so i think in the future for brands as a whole they should not invest their marketing so heavily on celebrity endorsements or even influencer endorsements although influencer marketing still has a strong place people do buy products a lot based on influencer recommendations but i think if you are a brand or starting a brand in my opinion you also should focus some of your efforts on your customer base and incentivizing them to leave reviews because that is really where people are being even more influenced to buy things is based on actual people people want real reviews and i don you guys but when i if they even more suspicious i would actually rather see a product review page where there are some solid one star reviews where the the the customer is just railing on the product saying why they hated it why it didn product if it looking for because i know that the brand is not is not filtering out and cherry picking what reviews they actually allow to stay up on their brand page anyways in my opinion celebrity endorsements they the wayside and people are just not buying them so if you you know for celebrities to invest in this trajectory of starting a brand to increase your net worth i definitely think that that something that you know whoever is counseling celebrities on i think they need i sure they are but i think they need to caution them that they should partner with someone to lend more credibility to to their product yeah 60 of respondents in this survey said that celebrity endorsements are not real i mean do people actually believe celebrity endorsements content created by actual customers is perceived as being the most authentic so shoppers are looking not only for customer reviews but they looking for customer generated videos and photographs on social media so if you you know brands should incentivize you not only to leave a review an unbiased review but also to post uh you know quick little video clips from your phone whatever that you know isn edited stuff that you see on an influencers instagram feed or anything like that yeah in order for her to be successful with this brand personally i think she should partner up with maybe a dermatologist i partner but maybe a dermatologist should lend more credibility to the brand because customers are looking for that for example jlo when she launched her brand the criticism that she got is like well you of money it and whatnot uh and that you really i mean people were questioning yeah right i mean people were not buying into her endorsement of her own products all right jennifer aniston could she increase the credibility of this brand by partnering with the dermatologist probably but honestly is a dermatologist the best way to increase the credibility of your brand customers may think so that may be the perceived the perception is that partnering with a dermatologist is the best way to increase brand credibility but i would argue not always you know as a dermatologist i know that certain ingredients are great for certain skin issues i can talk about licorice root being good for hyperpigmentation redness it anti-inflammatory but do i you know licorice root you can find in a lot of skin care products but turns out how the licorice root is processed and the parts of the plant that are utilized that actually dictates the overall abundance of certain beneficial compounds that lead to these outcomes of reducing like pigment transfer and giving a skin brightening effect yeah it knowledge the dermatologist is going to possess that oh this part of a plant has the highest concentration of this cosmeceutical ingredient some germs do they spend a lot of time you know trying to research that but what i can partner up with a dermatologist to endorse your product it doesn necessarily mean that it is a credible recommendation either because first and foremost our job is to treat is the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the skin hair nails and mucous membranes not cosmetic formulation so to lend further credibility to your brand i do think having a dermatologist on board is a great strategy because we do have a lot of expertise in skin issues and ingredients that benefit those skin issues but we don cosmetic formulation and ingredient selection especially with the boom of using botanics in skincare products that is an area where products can say hey we ingredient but is it the most quality preparation of that ingredient does it have the components of that botanic extract that are necessary for the skin beneficial outcomes or is it just mostly water even though people love her and adore her being loved and adored doesn make you an authority on on skincare and her following is women who are savvy to this and and are looking for some more credible angle so i think she would behoove her to partner up with a dermatologist or honestly a cosmetic chemist someone that can be the fit more of the face of the brand than just her but ultimately you have to understand not only are the endorsements questionable but starting a skincare brand the goal of starting a skincare brand is not to do good in the world it is to increase your net worth it would you buy a condo out in the suburbs where the majority of of that community our family are our homeowners people move there to buy a home they don there to buy a condo and they move there and then commute in to maybe a metro area where they they commute in for work and it go there for vacation there particular location so you have a difficult time selling it or renting it out or whatever because there condos as opposed to buying a condo at the beach or somewhere where people are coming in on a regular basis to vacation looking to buy that kind of property that where you not you know somewhere out in the suburbs where nobody is buying condos it just doesn it comes to creating a skincare brand you if you your following is part of your market and you have to be very savvy to their wants needs and their their criticisms i saw something on the brand naturally you that kind of implies you ingredient route which is fine you know natural ingredients some of them do pretend benefit for the skin licorice fruit i already mentioned amblica there are a lot of natural ingredients that can have benefit for redness irritation be anti-inflammatory but the devil is in the details when it comes to formulating those products and sourcing the ingredients and i think that it put that on an ingredient label but is the quality of the preparation there speaking of natural i did see one of the three images look like bamboo so maybe there her products this is not her first time around the ferris wheel though when it comes to being in the beauty space in 2012 she bought partial steak in the hair care brand living proof and she was the face of the brand for a while now when the brand sold to um unilever uh she disassociated herself from that she brand um i think it she recently became the chief creative officer of vital proteins collagen peptides which i peptides and skin care products before so she obviously has really you know put a lot of her investment portfolio if you will into beauty um and she i mean living proof is a really popular well-liked brand and i think that the success that she point she has not been the face of the brand and i think that has been a benefit to her and hopefully she will kind of lean into that more moving forward and this will not be perceived by people as a celebrity brand i think that is actually a safer way to go than to be the face of the brand but honestly when these brands are successful so whether it be celebrity brands or new you know influencer launch brands remember it is an investment it is a way to increase the celebrity or influencers net worth and so the end goal in most cases is going to be to sell your brand to someone like estee lauder who now owns the majority of deciem or sell your brand to unilever who now owns paula or to sell you know also owns living proof it is not to be this ongoing beacon of skin hair beauty advice products that people can feel good about using and that brands will lure you in with a lot of ethical promises and then they end up selling out to you these big brands in the end and you really have to question where are they ever sincere speaking of paula that paula is it technically considered cruelty free i don thoughts on that anyways i you know i something sort of relatable about her even though she is a celebrity she celebrity where like if you squint your eyes you can kind of make out the shape of somebody you know in real life and would hang out with that about her i roberts i yeah i mean i i like jennifer aniston a lot and i don because i like what i see of her aka her pr team has done a good job convincing me that she is a good person anyways guys comment below are you a fan of jennifer aniston um i feel like at one time she was a bit of a polarizing celebrity a lot of people just like to rag on her let me know though in the comments and i hope you guys enjoyed this video on the end slate will be my last uh celebrity response video last time celebrities were amusing on skin care so if you want to check that out definitely do so but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe i bye [Music] you	Success
Jessica Chastain says MAKEUP RUINED HER SKIN | Dermatologist responds | Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3Hn-grs3ZI	Dr Day	well hey guys i have another fun celebrity response video for you all today the actress jessica chastain she going to be playing tammy faye baker in an upcoming movie she had to wear a ton of makeup and she news media outlets the the makeup she had to wear caused permanent damage to her skin so i through an insider article interviewing her i giving my response to the statements that she makes about the effect that makeup had on her skin while she was playing this role the title of the article is jessica chastain says the heavy and hot makeup she wore to transform into tammy faye baker did permanent damage to her skin if you don is a famous televangelist known for heavy makeup heavy bronzer and heavy heavy-handed eye makeup especially her eyelashes in order to channel the televangelist who died in 2007 following a decade-long battle with colon cancer chastain covered herself with a dark bronzer and thick foundation characteristic of tammy i think for sure i permanent damage to my skin on this she said listen i eat very pure and i take very good care of my skin and i stay out of the sun and all that stuff but it heavy and when you every day the weight of it on your body it stretches your skin out alright so a lot of you guys dm me you said hey i read this article jessica chastain said makeup permanently damaged her skin i wear makeup every day am i going to cause permanent skin damage no you damage to your skin what are the risks of wearing makeup every single day risk number one you develop a contact dermatitis but that is a risk that comes with putting anything on your skin you can develop a contact dermatitis you can develop an allergy to one of the ingredients and then whenever it comes in contact with the skin you develop a rash and you have to avoid that ingredient the other risk with wearing makeup daily is that for some people with acne makeup can aggravate the acne can you know clog the pores but even when it comes to acne a while ago there was a paper that came out that kind of debunked this idea that people with acne should not wear makeup because a lot of makeup especially in more modern formulations it ingredients that kind of help absorb excess sebum and it helps camouflage the acne which can help with self-esteem issues around you know having to deal with acne and it doesn necessarily be problematic for most people sure some people are going to have issues with heavy makeup especially if you don the day you know you never want to sleep in makeup that is something that definitely can aggravate the acne but no wearing makeup every day it to cause permanent skin damage there are risks with putting anything on your skin namely contact dermatitis but that just with makeup that can happen with your skin care products uh nail polish as it brushes up against your skin you can you know develop eyelid dermatitis hair care products can cause a rash so it wearing makeup every day on your skin it may help protect your skin from photo aging basically from sun damage because all makeup even if it labeled as having sun protection in it all makeup offers a low level of spf a basic foundation gives you know an spf of five and people who apply heavy foundation i mean they some uv protection of course it adequate it at how people are with sunscreen as a whole the general population and their sunscreen use makeup wearers throughout their lifetime probably get better sun protection than the average person who only wears sunscreen when they go to the beach think about it at least putting on some some degree of uv blocking protection on your skin on a daily basis is better than what most people do which is to do nothing the majority of the year and only wear sunscreen when they go to the beach or the pool if anything people who wear makeup every day they may have a little bit of a protective advantage from the damaging uv rays that age our skin and lead to skin cancer of course again i want to reiterate wearing makeup is not a substitute for wearing sunscreen and protecting your skin from the sun you know with sun protective behaviors like avoiding tanning wearing a hat and all those things i talk about my videos but yeah i mean if anything it may actually help you another potential harm that comes with wearing makeup daily is when we if you wear a lot of eye makeup and you tight line your eyes with eyeliner or you wear false eyelashes if you do if you wear that every single day it definitely does put you at risk for dry eyes because it starts to interfere with how the tear filmed and those oils and lubricating factors come into the eye and nourish the eye and it certainly can feed into risk for chronic dry eyes wearing eye makeup and eye cosmetics it factor for dry eyes people who wear contact lenses especially if they don a break from the contact lens put themselves at risk for chronic dry eyes and so it wear eye makeup be mindful of the cosmetics that you lid margin people who type it tightlining listen to me let me just put in my application to go work at mac but people who who tightline the with the eyeliner especially if you single day you eyelashes every single day or the uh lash extensions not only put you at risk for dry eyes but also can put you at risk for styes because it kind of i mean you inside your eyelids that produce oils that help nourish the eye and those can get clogged too just like your skin pores can get clogged and that can cause little basically pimples on the eyelids dies so that kind of heavy duty makeup every day she makes this comment listen i eat very pure and i take very good care of my skin and i stay out of the sun perfect that she stays out of the sun i don know what eating pure means um is that some kind of a it sounds like like a restaurant um i think people are under this idea that if they do all the right things then nothing bad will ever happen to them from a health perspective including their skin that if you have a great diet and you take good care of your skin you have you your skincare routine then you develop a skin problem and that you can develop like i said a contact dermatitis to something at any point there is this idea that if you just like eat the right foods and eat the perfect diet and have the perfect skincare routine then you problems and that on the flip side if you have a skin problem don if i only ate this way and if i only had you know a good skin care routine then i wouldn the longest transformation took seven and a half hours see that is noteworthy in and of itself nobody i would hope at home is doing a makeup routine that takes seven and a half hours so context is key this is a lot of makeup that she had to put on for this role she showed up to set panicky and had hot flashes as a result of the heavy and hot makeup coating her body by the time the cameras started rolling she had no energy left now this is important too heavy heavy makeup cosmetics even heavy skin care products they can the evaporation of sweat off the body that can make you feel very hot and overheated it can make you flush when sweat evaporates off the surface of the skin that is how we cool ourselves down and if if that doesn don sweat off the surface of the skin then you heavy heavy products on the skin can occlude that sweat evaporation and i imagine that is what she people who have the skin condition rosacea as a matter of fact their skin is even more sensitive to this phenomenon and they often find that heavy moisturizers or heavy skin care products heavy makeup makes them feel hot and start flushing so that definitely likely what she is experiencing here and it can leave you feeling exhausted and fatigued people who don become overheated very easily and they actually can experience you know heat injury as a result of not being able to cool the body it can be deadly there are skin conditions in which people are born without functional sweat glands they can unless they take med take appropriate measures to keep their body cool so it disability to not be able to sweat excessive sweating is not only distressing to deal with but on the flip side not being able to sweat is equally is equally harmful to your mental health and to your physical health you can literally overheat and it sounds like she has some degree of that going on here with all the heavy makeup that she had to wear seven and a half hours then she goes on to say it was like going on a long distance flight every day because if it takes seven and a half hours to put on it take at least two hours to get it off that is true it was concerning to me i was worried about my circulation she said um yeah i mean that is a lot of heavy heavy duty makeup to be putting on and then having to take off it is actually quite a bit to to go through is that harmful i mean you wouldn to do that every single day for years and years and years i think in the short term of this movie film i don that it had long lasting damage to her skin that seems unlikely but i imagine she is experiencing a lot of dryness maybe some residual irritation from doing this every single day and she also was wearing it sounds like she also was wearing prosthetics too and prosthetics you can develop an allergy too they have rubber accelerators different compounds in the prosthetic that people can become allergic to so as a matter of fact you know right now there is an emerging allergy to ingredients in shin guards that teenagers use for sport so don just think of contact dermatitis as exclusively a skincare or makeup product in fact you can develop contact dermatitis to a lot of other things in your in your day-to-day life that can cause rashes and problems i think the public their first thought whenever a skin problem develops is that it must be a product that they product can solve it but sometimes it actually something totally different in your environment that you could be coming in contact with when chat stand removed the prosthetics and makeup she said she looked 50 years old and then she goes on to say no i adding but it the eyes of tammy faye premieres in theaters on september 17th here really think about these this article i think it why if you read the article the tone that i get from her in this interview is really that she about how the makeup was a lot to deal with every day it was uncomfortable and it actually was kind of a shocker to her to see herself in that much makeup and how it kind of almost slightly it seems like she suggested it almost kind of messed with how she got into the role a bit she just had to get used to it and get used to this transformation and she she ends the interview by saying it right it a media outlet your job is to get people to read your article and to click on your article you the article jessica chastain on life on set like people are less likely to click on that but if instead you title the article jessica chastain thinks makeup caused permanent damage to her skin that going to get more people interested because a lot of people wear makeup every single day and they god am i permanently damaging my skin they and they the bullet points she plays a new role transforming into the role the heavy and hot makeup did permanent damage that they article and read the entire thing they those headlines you get freaked out so in summary wearing makeup every day no it damage your skin the risks are contact dermatitis and then we eye makeup it does put you at risk for chronic dry eyes especially around the lid margin yes it can aggravate acne but that always going to be the case for everybody if you have rosacea heavy makeup may feel hot and precipitate a flush but at the end of the day wearing makeup on a daily basis it may actually offer you some protection from the damaging rays from the sun and in the long run it may help you out so i hope this video was helpful in going over these points that she made about having to wear all this makeup i can only imagine how exhausting it is to have to sit there and have all that being coated on your body and those prosthetics and then to go out and have all the energy to perform and be under the lights and everything i am fascinated with after transformations for roles actors who undergo physical transformations whether it be that they actually physically transform their body through like some sort of you know diet exercise type thing or they transform their body through prosthetics and makeup like she i just find that i don to watch movies like that where i can recognize the actor i think that that is really fascinating september 17th i list i remember there was this little toy that was popular in the 90s it was like this little squeaky toy i don had them at walmart for a while it was like a little caterpillar and she had these like exaggerated eyelashes and i remember somebody making the comment that it was a tammy faye baker caterpillar i um just looking at the images i hope i hope it all right guys i hope you enjoyed this video if so give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen and subscribe i to you guys tomorrow bye [Music] you	Success
Why JLo doesn't age| Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwIA0jRSdaY	Dr Day	hey guys in today chat with you all about reasons why some people just don skin doesn jlo just turned 52 happy birthday like she of this year she got a lot of criticism online for saying that she fillers um or any cosmetic procedures oh my god this is the best mask that i ever tried it minutes and 10 years i feel like it took 10 years off my face and of course she was saying all this while talking about her new skincare products so people rightfully so were a little skeptical like uh-huh like you really look that good from using skincare products but there are many other factors that go into skin aging i think people are under the impression that getting botox fillers and having cosmetic procedures is really why these people look so good and it more than that as you will hopefully learn in today exposed to throughout our lifetime that contribute to the appearance of wrinkles fine lines all those signs of skin aging the main factor are uv rays from the sun and j low is pretty vocal about the fact that since the age of 22 she sunscreen genetics definitely plays a role in how quickly your skin total body will age and people are like yeah genetics is kind of a cop-out reason [Music] [Applause] [Music] jeans are like a little code or instructional manual everybody has these documents that encode things but within the code there may be a letter here and there that kind of changes things those are referred to as polymorphisms or snips single nucleotide polymorphisms there are a lot of different genes that influence how your skin and total body age melanocortin receptor one it little receptor that sits on the surface of the skin cells that make pigment color in your skin and a hormone binds to that and tells the melanocyte to make pigment that is then transferred to cells nearby and that is that protects you from those uv rays some people have little polymorphisms in that receptor that make it so that their skin doesn protecting them from uv rays through pigment production i you guys about how uv rays that come through window glass they stimulate and upregulate something called matrix metalloproteinases these are enzymes that chew up your collagen and that what contributes to wrinkle formation the genes that encode those you can have little snips or changes from person to person that make it so that long term their skin doesn collagen as readily maybe they responsive or more responsive to uv rays chewing out more collagen things in our environment that contribute to aging of the skin do so largely by generating free radicals oxidative stress that damages proteins in our skin lipids in our skin and the dna in our skin cells and we have different enzymes in our skin that help combat those free radicals some people genes make it so that their enzymes are better perhaps diet plays a major role however i will say this i don but if we found out what her diet is i don it to a tea everybody needs are unique to them and it follow a celebrity know they nutritional needs but we know things that are good for our the health of our skin include healthy fats uh getting enough protein getting enough uh vitamins and minerals vitamin c for building good healthy collagen if you have a balanced diet you nutritive requirements but if you subsist on processed sugary foods that is not going to set you up for healthy skin and no amount of botox fillers is going to change that another reason that she looks so good i am willing to put money on is that she is very active she exercises she said this in interviews have you ever been to one of her concerts she dancing a lot um do you remember when she was a fly girl yeah she decades she for your skin and for the health of your total body improves circulation reduces inflammation in the body and if you are in your 50s a recent study actually came out that people who uh remained active in their 50s had it had a protective effect against the risk of dementia later on in life so just because you get to a certain age don getting old i need to slow down i old to do this i this is one that you cannot change and that is the thickness of your skin some people have thicker skin and that is going to not show as much in terms of photo aging on our body the skin of our neck and the skin around our eyes skin on the back of our hands that skin on the body and that is where aging shows up early and most noticeable for for for everybody aging of the neck around the eyes the backs of the hands but if you have thin skin then you are more likely to show those wrinkles because you have less for the uv rays to chew up and destroy so you going to show those wrinkles more more readily here change and that is if you are pale pale skin especially if you have a lot of freckles your skin is very vulnerable to damage from uv rays probably you know a lot of times due to those mc1r differences and how your skin produces pigment in response to uv rays that you know should otherwise protect you and if you have red hair the type of pigment that your skin makes is actually um not not only is it not as protective but when it is exposed to uv rays it actually more inflammatory so if you have red hair pale skin you have to be super aggressive with protecting your skin from those uv rays chronic exposure to uv rays it leads to breakdown of a collagen and that what then it damages the dna and your skin cells that can set the stage for not only obviously skin cancers but a lot of these other little bumps that come up along the road here may actually lessen the extent or rate at which your skin ages and that is having oily skin may actually be protected oily skin acne there are some studies to suggest that having oilier skin protects you from earlier onset signs of aging and if you have dry skin your skin is a lot more vulnerable to to damage from exogenous factors and subsequent aging and that being said if you have dry skin conditions like eczema you may be more at risk for damage from environmental stressors and subsequent more prominent skin aging so moisturizing is really important to reduce trans epidermal water loss out of the skin and keep your skin healthy and don are an area that a lot of people neglect care of the skin on the hands our hands they all the time that disrupt the moisture barrier irritating things getting in causing inflammation the skin on the back of the hands is super thin vulnerable to damage and then of course with driving you know our the skin on the back of our hands sees so much uv throughout our lifetime that it is some some of the most neglected territory what she she does takes really good care of her skin by you know having a skincare routine it sunscreen piece is essential the moisturizer piece is really helpful because it out of the skin that would otherwise lead to irritation inflammation making more vulnerable and cleansing is another important piece of your skin care routine because throughout the day we are exposed to a lot of environmental pollutants that can generate more of those free radicals on the surface of the skin if you live in a city with a lot of pollution that actually can put you at risk for more severe or earlier onset more extensive or aggravated if you will signs of aging because it generates a lot of oxidative stress in the skin pollution has been shown to be associated with more stubborn inflammatory acne it in association with really severe eczema the last thing that definitely is worth mentioning when we she just turned 52 nobody has asked about this and people don don but something that women do can do that may make a difference is technically not a procedure cosmetic procedure is hormone replacement therapy one of the reasons why women show some of the signs of skin aging more quickly than men is a they have thinner skin and b the loss of estrogen contributes to loss of collagen in the skin that happens around menopause we start you know estrogen levels decline and you really see noticeable more noticeable wrinkles loss of elasticity loss of the supportive framework more skin fragility women who go on hormone replacement therapy they will notice an improvement in the health of their skin more youthful skin nobody that to disclose that but i think it interesting that people just assume it all botox and fillers but to be crystal clear it is very important that you have a in-depth discussion with your doctor about if hrt is right for you because there are many reasons why hrt can be a bad idea in some women so it conversation you have to have with your doctor you know i speculate on what she does in her personal life she anybody anything about her medical history at all but i do want you guys out there to know that if you see a celebrity who is in their you know late 40s 50s 60s and they don of wrinkles don and fillers in women hrt maybe you know they may be on hrt and nobody asking about that but i find it interesting that it media outlets that are so obsessed with like speculating on whether a celebrity has had this procedure or that procedure or whatnot but they speculating on if they happen to take hormone replacement therapy i make these videos not to like give you a primer on how to stay young and never develop a wrinkle rather it these factors in such a way to keep your skin and total body healthy and functioning as long as possible and so hopefully this video clarified to you why it is some celebrities just don much at all um madonna for example is another one who who you know really doesn she of cosmetic procedures done but i to tell you guys i saw her in concert and no amount of botox can give somebody that kind of energy yeah have you ever seen any of these women in concert like botox is not going to make you bust a move like that all right guys that looks so good again i speculate on whether or not she any procedures done or even if she is on hrt that is her business i you know not mine i don of her movies comment below what favorite jlo movie i like uh enough that anyways guys if you like this video give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don subscribe i bye [Music] you	Success
Dermatologist reacts to REDDIT ACCUTANE STARTER PACK | Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZGZaUB7UHo	Dr Day	well hey guys in today to be reacting to this subreddit accutane post the accutane starter pack um i thought i would go through this collage that they put together and give my opinion on if this is good information is it misleading you know there on the internet about accutane especially so let you accutane is a name for the drug isotretinoin which is um for acne and it and it works very well and in many cases can cure acne for a lot of people but it does come with side effects and the first thing that i see on this collage is arguably one of my favorite skincare products vaseline petroleum jelly this is a great recommendation for anybody going on accutane to have to keep with them petroleum jelly and it effectively reduces water loss out of the skin why is this going to be helpful for you if you are going on accutane well accutane is going to dry out your skin quite a bit it incredibly chapped and peeled i see they show an image here of chapped lips as well kind of going alongside that it be nice if they had positioned it next to the vaseline so people kind of made that connection because vaseline is really great for the chapped lips piece of accutane if you are going to go on accutane expect to have dry skin and dry lips why they everyone who they are a they speak to the underlying mechanism of accutane if i don these things happening then the person you know that suggests to me the person not being absorbed properly you know anyways vaseline is a great recommendation not only for the lips but for the skin especially people really develop a lot of dryness on the hands so using vaseline on your hands and then covering them with white cotton gloves i highly recommend doing that before you go to bed at night if you are on accutane it really can help quite a bit with the dry hands all right i tears that is a great recommendation you accutane because accutane reduces the secretions of the sebaceous glands you have a type of sebaceous oil gland in your eyes called the meibomian glands to help keep your eyes lubricated and the accutane is going to affect those and it give you dry eyes so much so that if you wear contact lenses you may not tolerate them accutane actually can affect your vision while you are on it and specifically it affects your night vision you can have decreased night vision this is called nyctalopia it happens because the accutane isotretinoin it competitively inhibits retinol dehydrogenase in the eye that leads to decreased production of rhodopsin and that is why you have slightly uh impaired night vision while you are on it it i always suggest people not drive at night while they you know somebody drive for them for that reason you may also have increased sensitivity to glare and you can have slight changes and perception of colors the other thing that can happen is your mouth is going to get very dry as well inside the mouth you can experience dry mouth so they have this giant jug of water there i think that is what they are getting at with the water um you know having water close by taking frequent sips of water can help minimize the dry mouth symptoms another way to manage the dry mouth is to keep some sugar-free lozenges that you can suck on throughout the day or some sugarless gum to chew on just to stimulate saliva and to moisten the oral mucosa so you know you don much water they do show that big water jug there um and i the dry mouth but i want to clarify in case this is what they getting at that the dry skin you will experience on accutane is not going to be relieved simply by drinking more water that is kind of a common myth oh my skin drinking more water when it comes to the dry skin vaseline like they here that key piece in managing your dry skin not drinking a ton of water in addition to the vaseline though be very mindful of how you are cleansing the skin you don want to be bathing too frequently you may have previously been one of those people who washes your face twice a day accutane may not allow you to do that anymore you may end up only being able to wash your face once a day and for many people i actually suggest while on accutane to just use water to rinse the skin because the skin becomes exquisitely sensitive while on accutane and prone to dryness cleansers no matter how gentle they are will disrupt the moisture barrier even further and that can just be really uncomfortable while you it cleanser many people tolerate those just fine especially for removing makeup i have a video as a side note on skincare products i recommend for people on accutane so i will link that down below in the description box but uh yeah be very careful of over cleansing your face and don skin in general because acne change is going to affect all of your skin not just the skin on your face or you know wherever you have acne it affect the skin all over all right so dry skin dry eyes dry lips the other thing is uh your the mucosa in your nose can become dry you can become more vulnerable to nosebleeds so another piece to this moisturizing aspect of things that i highly suggest is getting yourself a a humidifier especially to run at nighttime this is going to help with the dry skin it if you it will help with the dry mouth at nighttime so definitely invest in that they go a long way as well in addition to being mindful of your bathing practices and some of these other things artificial tears for the dry eyes is a is a must in my opinion and really really helpful let why did that peanut butter there they wanted you to do a peanut butter face mask no i because when you take accutane pills when you when you actually take the pill itself you need to ingest it along with some sort of fatty food peanut butter is commonly suggested because you know it generally speaking and generally well liked but it doesn to be peanut butter i saw some comments on this thread oh i hate peanut butter oh i doesn be any fatty food it could be um avocado it could be um ice cream uh whole fat yogurt it could be um you know really any fatty food will help with the absorption the reason this is so important i there is that if you do not ingest the accutane alongside some sort of fat you will have sub-optimal absorption and this is a reason actually some people fail accutane is because they go along the entire you know course of their treatment taking it either on an empty stomach or you know without any fat they sub-optimal absorption and they never achieve the cumulative dose needed to treat their acne so while it important that you actually ingest the pills with a fatty food to get good absorption your diet overall you want to be careful is not super high in fat for example if you mcdonald fries uh every day and then fried chicken and a lot of fried foods in particular very high fat you have to be careful because accutane does increase your triglycerides that is a very common side effect that is something that we check when we monitor your blood uh while you triglycerides it abnormality while on accutane so if you have that blood abnormality and then on top of that you have a very high fat diet that also can increase your triglycerides the triglycerides can end up getting too high and that can actually be harmful for your pancreas the i-40 pill they have floating in this collage is accutane i guess they just have that their representative it that they have it there because they don um it kind of is right next to the tears like i um it critique for the uh way that the information is conveyed but uh whatever all right and then we have a picture of elta md sunscreen looks like maybe clear or uv clear or uv daily anyways over it they have spf 99999 high spf all right this is a great recommendation to have on the slide because when you are on accutane your skin becomes even more sensitive to the sun and so you definitely need to be protecting your skin from the sun while on accutane i mean you should be doing that anyway but if you typically has never had a sunburn before you may find that your skin burns a lot more easily so definitely definitely protect your skin from the sun wear broad-spectrum sunscreen to all sun exposed surfaces you guys know from my videos though that sunscreen is not a shield of armor so i would also like to see added to this maybe a sun protective hat upf uh clothing like what i wearing here uh just for additional measure sunscreen is not a shield of armor and it difficult to keep up with it all over the body so the behavior of sun protective clothing and sunscreen plus avoiding uh being outdoors too long and the other thing i would love to see on here is a picture of a tanning booth with a big x through it uh some people still engage in indoor tanning very very dangerous regardless of if you are on accutane or not but definitely do not get in one of those things i mean don those things at all um but definitely don it could be quite quite horrific for you and your skin do not get in one another thing they could put on here with an x through it is um you know a waxing kit because you don you removal it will cause erosions it will pull off your skin that sounds really terrifying but it will pull off some of the top layer of your skin because remember accutane is changing the top dead layer of your skin as well it vulnerable to stripping with the wax and you can develop sores and while you on accutane your healing the skin healing is a little bit altered and you can develop scarring so no waxing while on accutane so we covered the fat we covered the dry skin the other thing i here is a few forms of birth control we have a condom we have an intrauterine device otherwise known as an iud and we have what looks like a pack of birth control pills and then underneath that we have i pledge what is i pledge and why do they have all this birth control there i pledge is something that was instated in the us by the government in 2006 as a way to reduce fetal exposure to accutane why well accutane otherwise known as isotretinoin i interchangeably here sorry if it confusing is a teratogen and what that means is that it will cause birth defects in a fetus if you become pregnant not it can cause birth defects it will cause birth defects severe life-threatening birth defects and as a way to minimize fetal exposure to isotretinoin basically making sure that anybody who can get pregnant will not get pregnant while they accutane the government and stated this um monitoring basically of any physician or healthcare provider pharmacy or patient distributing or receiving a accutane prescription this is a governmental regulation of the distribution of isotretinoin basically a way to reduce in theory the fetal exposure to accutane what does it entail it involved for women of childbearing age basically any female who can get pregnant because you have to go in monthly and you have to prove that you are not pregnant with a pregnancy test so you have to prove that you pregnant once a month and you have to verify that you are using not one but two forms of birth control and abstinence is one form of birth control that is allowed now i want to make it crystal clear that while isotretinoin accutane does cause will cause birth defects if you get pregnant while you not mean that it is going to screw up the chances that you get pregnant and have a healthy child in the future accutane isotretinoin stays in your system for approximately 30 days so after you stop taking isotretinoin you need to continue birth control not you know abstinence birth control whatever you cannot get pregnant for another two months roughly and then after that you system it because isotretinoin accutane is regulated so heavily as a way to minimize fetal exposure to this drug but there are other types of systemic vitamin a like isotretinoin that we prescribe for other conditions that stay in your system for years and years and years and you cannot get pregnant for years and years and years if ever again um that are not regulated like this it really hard to say actually to what extent the ipledge program has been successful at reducing um fetal exposure to isotretinoin i pledge as a huge barrier actually for a lot of people getting their medication and you know i to what extent it fetal exposure to the drug seems it but uh it really makes it hard actually for a lot of people of childbearing potential age to get the drug and it ends up being a barrier and it also scares people away from the drug there around accutane especially on the internet so i or this is the first thing i encountered from this thread i getting any like fear-mongering from this they know reasonable information here okay so we covered that then we this person here clenching their back with what you know the red kind of suggesting back pain yes back pain is actually a pretty common uh reported symptom it permanent back pain and muscle aches are really common in accutane we don entirely why this happens the back pain may be due to the cells and the joints becoming more sensitive to as a result of accutane honestly we don explanation for why people report this and it people who engage regularly in vigorous activity runners basketball players um you know anybody working out is more likely to to have this symptom and it can be pretty uncomfortable and leave you feeling overall very fatigued too fatigue you know fatigue muscle aches joint pain back pain in particular are common side effects but they and it health of your bones uh i questions too as a side note does accutane uh cause or put you at risk for osteoporosis it does not now vitamin a supplements hypervitaminosis a taking too much vitamin a can cause osteoporosis another oral vitamin a form not accutane but etretonate which goes by the name psoriatine it has actually been reported to be an association with osteoporosis but accutane itself isotretinoin uh no does not impact uh bone bone density all right and then the final thing i guys about is a quote in quotes it says can i really not drink on this i can can you not drink alcohol and i think they put this on here because it sounds like at least from the comments on this thread that this is something people commonly post to this thread a question that is commonly posted and so rather than answering it they just put the question there all right what is the answer can you drink alcohol while you are on accutane while you are on isotretinoin it is not a good idea to drink excessively on any medication especially accutane or isotretinoin why will isotretinoin in most medications they are metabolized in your liver and alcohol interferes with that metabolism and so you can have impaired metabolism of any medications that you consume alcohol in excess if you have a glass of wine here and there that would not give me that would not cause me to worry about your health or anything like that but if you binge drink if you drink excessively if you drink on a regular basis like daily then we territory where it could potentially be harmful the other reason to avoid alcohol is that it dries out your mouth even more and that that too can contribute to the dry mouth symptoms so that reason to avoid alcohol and then alcohol is actually gets in the way of healing and recovery so ultimately you know it may end up having an effect on your ultimate end results although that kind of speculative we don long-term data on people who consumed alcohol and moderation while on accu-chain because yeah i mean we don studies like that um and then the other thing about accutane is the liver enzymes in the beginning go up a little bit um those are called transaminases they they increase a little bit they increase in the first few weeks of starting accutane and then they actually come back down while you medication so it in those enzymes but if you were drinking a lot and you know have that that bump in the liver enzymes that could be a period of time in particular where you to liver potential liver damage so i always tell people yeah lay off the alcohol while you medication mostly because i about metabolism of the drug any binge drinking but if somebody comes in they of wine at this wedding the other week and i not supposed to drink i fine you avoiding saying alcohol in moderation because i have come to appreciate the fact that everyone moderation is variable is their own and for me moderation i don but to me moderation is a glass of wine uh one to two nights a week but for other people it glasses of wine every day and i don think that moderate drinking that that considerable drinking may be okay in your non-accutane life but while you on the medication that much could affect your liver it could affect the metabolism of this drug but i do think it alcohol while you had a glass of wine here there don lose sleep over that you know i know people get very anxious about things like this you know there medication that we frequently prescribe in dermatology called methotrexate a lot of people have to be on that you know accutane is only you know four to six months that you can seem like a lifetime especially when you older four to six months is like you know oh wait is it time for lunch yet yeah i mean it goes by fast but other medications like methotrexate as i was mentioning people have to be on for a long long long period of time to control their disease and that medication definitely can impact your liver health and we tell people to avoid in consuming alcohol in excess but even that medication uh i you know if a patient comes in they want to have a glass of wine on my anniversary is that okay yeah it uh just don don don thing then it can get dangerous so always have the conversation with your doctor about what you doctor about going on this medication or having your child go on this medication definitely make sure you have all of your questions answered your physician health care provider should be enthusiastic about providing you as much education as possible but some things we unless you ask you know any concern that you have we main things to to be mindful of but if you have a worry in the back of your mind about something ask because it better to be informed and what can end up happening unfortunately and happens a lot is that people don to their provider to their doctor and they go on these websites they find some of this misinformation they get scared about it maybe they intimidated to actually ask their doctor so they just stop taking the medication and then of course it fails because you didn to so don these questions um and you know get answers especially if you read something on the internet like i pleased by this collage overall because they true common side effects things to be aware of but they not you know putting out misinformation so good on this reddit sub forum for this overall i really you know i because i have seen some really you know scary type posts that make people fearful yeah historically accutane has gone horrific press it and does cure acne for many people and the reason that untreated acne will go on to scar and that will affect you for your life emotionally it really has a huge impact speaking of mental health i recently did a video addressing a misconception about retinol and depression i talk about accutane and the association with depression i know that is something that people are really worried about how is it going to impact my mental health i talk about common misconceptions in that video make sure you check that out it will be on the next slide but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don i [Music] you	Success
Ashton Kutcher & Mila Kunis NOT BATHING MUCH? | My response | Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9sZKwbyVn8	Dr Day	hey guys today i have a fun reaction video for you all ashton kutcher and mila kunis recently went on armchair expert with dak shepard podcast and they revealed some rather interesting tidbits about their philosophy around bathing how often they bathe how they bathe their children so i podcast for you all i response talk about how often should you be bathing is what they crazy or does it make sense you just waited perfectly into a pre-existing argument between monica and i we fighting for a month now i told her to stop washing her body with soap i said tits slits and that not me and then i had soles and holes soles and holes but you do not you should not be getting rid of all the natural oil on your skin with a bar of soap every day so that he that they should stop using bar soap that it gets rid of the natural oils soap really is only necessary to the visibly soiled areas and it helpful in the armpits the groin anywhere we have skin on skin contact and he use soap you know it excess sebum aka body oils cosmetics but as it does that it some of your natural lipid barrier and that is what leads to dryness more water loss out of the skin so it kind of a delicate balance and he absolutely right soap certainly does disrupt the natural moisture barrier and i always tell people you only need to use soap to areas that are visibly soiled or in the skin folds under the breast if you have you know abdominal folds anywhere we have skin on skin contact but that i do you guys wash your whole body water i don okay good that wash pits and tits and and holes and so i wash the slits i wash my slits in my tits i wash my armpits in my crotch daily and nothing else ever you don so they to do that they only use water to their body and then in the folds is where they use soap and that if you think about it what are you washing away with soap on your arms and legs unless there or you that needs to be washed off then yeah it makes sense to then use soap but all you removing your natural lipids using water alone to areas outside of the skin folds is more than enough to remove you know whatever debris pollutants bacteria that may have settled on the skin water will actually get rid of it and if you think about it when you the shower you have the water beating down on your skin that skin cells and helping to slough off that debris you don a surfactant aka a soap or a body wash to do that for you and if you use body wash or soap really all it some of your natural lipid barrier and in the long run what that ends up doing is it creates an environment on the surface of the skin where you have an impaired skin barrier and your skin you with pathogenic bacteria especially if you have a condition like eczema where you naturally have an impaired moisture barrier then you is really unnecessary in many cases can be very disruptive to good skin health of course soap has a role in the situation where you have visibly soiled skin many people who work outdoors they are exposed to a lot of dust dirt pollutants mud is part of their occupation you in those cases but i mila kunis and ashton kutcher that is not their lifestyle the majority of people spend their day indoors um and you know have an office job or whatnot you you pathogens dirt whatnot and the soap thing you just making unilever coin that is it all right let and look at him let a lever 2000. there we go delivers every time textbook soap nothing else nothing else that can in the minority here of washing my whole body in the shower i can like she people believe that they need to use body wash to the entire to all body surfaces why well because marketing has persuaded us that that do our modern lifestyle just does not necessitate using body wash or soap to the extent that most people are using it i wash or soap except in the armpits the groin area anywhere that soiled and people are like oh you must smell but really the reason for body odor is sweat left on the skin that gets broken down by bacteria sweat is water soluble it will rinse off of the skin in the shower body wash isn help you out in terms of reducing body odor it just deposits perfume on the skin that may mask body odor but also can cause irritation for the skin and it simultaneously strips away at the moisture barrier so it fight against body odor so weird who taught you to not wash i didn child so i didn anyway when i had children i also didn wasn newborns ever we only did because it was part of the nighttime routine we could care less about their cleanliness we just put them in there as like pavlovian but then as soon as we didn we haven like six years that don daily at all um you really only need for for a newborn or a baby you really only need a damp washcloth to wipe away visibly soiled visibly soiled areas babies get dirty so i understand why parents introduce bathing but if you have a young child who has eczema bathing can actually end up being a major contributing factor to the flares of their eczema if you you bubble bath i mean people make this culture around bath time as this relaxing thing and it if you have a baby with eczema it really can aggravate their skin to spend a lot of time soaking in water exposed to surfactants from things like bubble bath baby wash and when i say surfactants those are the things in body washes and soaps and cleansers that are intended to remove dirt but also strip away at your moisture barrier and for young children there for those but for young children who have eczema it can be incredibly harmful actually and aggravate their disease tremendously now as children get a little older school-aged they only need to bathe like once or twice a week technically that being said children do get dirty and then more bathing is needed so it it depends on your child i would say children should be playing outside as part of a healthy lifestyle rolling around getting dirty so they going to need a bath but unfortunately modern lifestyles a lot of kids are sedentary indoors which is not good uh do they really need to be bathing as frequently no now once your children get into puberty as part of puberty you start making more oils as the hormones change the hormone profiles change then your sebaceous oil gland starts making oil and at that point you do need to start bathing on a daily basis but you don need to actually use body wash again that we no here dirt on them clean them yeah otherwise there point i mean i will say when i work out i have a tendency to throw some water on my face after a workout just to get all the salts and the whatever i wash twice a day yeah you gotta wash your face i don much just been talking about the body from the neck down but the face is a different story uh he mentions that he splashes water on his face after a workout so that said earlier sweat is water-soluble it will rinse off the surface of the skin and i could be wrong that he doesn makeup maybe he does but if presuming he doesn then water alone is more than enough now i sunscreen can be a little challenging to remove with just water alone especially the water resistant types so in my opinion anybody from the age of puberty onward should wash their face daily and ideally with a gentle cleanser to remove cosmetics if you use them to remove sunscreen which you need to be using to help with removing buildup of sebum the oils on the skin that for people with acne prone skin that can actually really contribute to the acne and to help in facilitating removal of pollutants from the face the face is some of the most exposed territory of your skin and it pollutants and unfortunately modern lifestyle we now have to factor in our exposure to pollutants which do drive a lot of skin aging as well as there polluted environment being associated with more severe eczema more severe acne so watching the face is one method to hopefully remove some of that pollutant although to what extent washing with a cleanser actually achieves that is really difficult to say cleansers really aren um but it is that is sort of the hope that you at least reduce the burden of of pollutants on the skin by washing the face i so i recommend everybody wash their face at least once a day now many people like to wash their face twice a day i say it whether or not you wash your face once a day or twice a day for many people especially those people who have rosacea or eczema washing the face twice a day is actually too much ends up contributing to symptoms of sensitivity burning stinging dryness and it can just be over drying to the skin and for people with acne that actually can end up aggravating their acne but on the flip side for many people especially people who make a lot of oil watching the face twice a day feels better it removes the excess oil that would otherwise contribute to shine so it person you have to figure out am i going to wash my face once a day or twice a day here a day is more than enough but if you find that you feel oily greasy you look shiny and you acne then you may want to bump to twice a day what you you need to do five ten years from now as we get wiser our skin makes less oil the need to to cleanse goes down i don don jax that wants you to she won just do an experiment all i is like a 30-day trial where we don put the soap on the face or the rest of the body pit splits until it and just see what the hydration level is of the skin the moisture level let everything levels totally totally fair experiment what is your hypothesis day that use a gentle cleanser on my face daily i the majority of the time i never use body wash i mean you guys have seen my empties videos at this point there are no body washes for the most part the only time i use a body wash is to help in removing water resistant sunscreen the majority of the time i wear long sleeves and long pants when i outside as a method of sun protection and to also help reduce exposure to things that bite mosquitoes so i like to wear long sleeves and long pants all the time but in the summer it can be miserably hot and i tend to wear shorts and to help with the sun exposure i wear sunscreen on my legs so i do end up employing a body wash to help in removing that but that is that is really the only reason that i use body wash x that will happen she skin no dry skin which we call um no ashiness on her legs or arms when she scratches you won is the thing that i think that skin and you can just see the scratches well hold on when your legs are super moisturized which we don all right okay so it yeah what they wash you know as i said earlier it strips away the natural lipid barrier that leads to more water loss out of the skin that contributes to dryness and subsequent sensation of itch and scrub and that behavior and then scratching further impairs the moisture barrier you lose more water out of the skin it potential risk with using so much body wash to our skin which we about is that it can actually alter your skin microbiome then the organisms that naturally live on your skin they are really helpful to the health of your skin they to keeping you protected from the outside world and over cleansing using surfactants that strip away at the lipid barrier can start to potentially disrupt that and contribute to problems we stages of learning about this but it is there is some thought that all this use of skin care products including soaps and body washes is actually ending up being too disruptive to our skin a request it do for oily skin i have very oily skin and i break it down you have oily skin because you and your body oil out to re-moisturize what you stripping off every twice a day now that i don the kind of kind of misconception that using products can make you oilier and if you actually look at the physiology of the sebaceous gland there not as though there is a sensor within the sebaceous oil gland to uh using products or not using products or cleansers oil production is governed by a few things your genetics some people genetically have oilier skin earlier in the podcast they didn it but she mentioned how she had acne as a teenager too she has oilier skin as part of her genetics maybe larger oil glands and the other thing that contributes to contributes to oiliness is hormones hormonal fluctuations that puberty is when you want to start bathing more regularly to remove excess sebum excess oil left on the skin it can contribute to acne flares and therefore cleansing is is beneficial but it products are going to make you oilier now if you cleansing what that does is it strips away at the moisture barrier that leads to more dryness it rate of oil production because again oil production is governed by hormones genetics but what i think ends up happening is that because the skin barrier is kind of dry as the oil spreads out on the skin it looks shinier because you don that hydrated base to kind of buoy things up so it scatters light in such a way that makes you look greasier and shinier i agree with tax on this one yeah twice a day with two different types of cleansers me too yeah yes and i feel bad for you guys it this terrible treadmill of pressure to this and that you time to just let the skin be itself for 30 and see where we you that skin care companies have marketed traditionally so heavily to women that we just roped into the belief that we need to be using all these products for a long time skincare companies they could only grasp the male audience by marketing products that were like three in one you know for convenience sake men were not being told that they needed to use all these products but that is actually changing quite a bit and as you see like target has a whole massive men this stuff all these different cleansers and potions and lotions and whatnot and the end result of that is that men are catching up to women in terms of rates of allergic contact dermatitis to skin care products because they really have to start questioning why are we using so much soap it because of marketing it true need to and once upon a time using soap was helpful because we spent all our time outdoors exposed to dirt and pathogens but that case anymore for our modern lifestyle and therefore you really need to be more critical of your soap and cleanser use now why use it in the armpits the groins and skin folds the reason is that those areas there lot more moisture that is trapped and actually the microbiome is a little different in those areas and because of that you to have colonization with different types of bacteria that can break down your sweat and contribute to body odor skin has never looked better than what it looked during covid when you weren putting makeup on every day oh i you woke up a natural beauty every day that radiant whatever do you talk about this with k bells does she not wash her face no she does she watches her face but she doesn all right guys so how often should you be bathing it honestly varies a lot from person to person and from age to age babies they don you only want to bathe them when they visibly soiled young children school-aged children maybe a couple of times a week but again it of activity what they they they bathe them uh once you hit puberty your hormones change you start making more oil then you need to bathe at least every other day and that something that you throughout adulthood but once you get into your 50s and beyond what ends up happening is that again the hormones change and we make less oil so the need to bathe goes down and the elderly population actually the skin barrier is has fewer moisturizing factors and is a lot more prone to dryness and irritation so when you get into your much wiser years older adulthood there is definitely a drastically decreased need to be bathing now when it comes to incorporating body wash and soap into this routine throughout your lifetime you really only need to be using it to visibly soiled areas and the skin folds and of course that person to person depending on your occupation what you did that day the face however you do need to incorporate a gentle cleanser you can wash your face once a day or twice a day again that governed by you on your own personal journey you need to use a gentle cleanser to remove sunscreen which everybody should be wearing and also makeup if you wear makeup and remember the face has a high density of those sebaceous oil glands and excess oil left on the surface of the skin that can contribute to acne breakouts so there is definitely a role for cleansing the face with a gentle cleanser it example if you wear sunscreen every day and you find that it works out just fine for you you have zero skin problems to just splash water on your face then keep doing that fewer products fewer problems so if you can minimize the number of products that you use in your skincare routine then by all means if you can get away with just splashing your face with water to cleanse and you problems then why change it if you wear makeup you do need to wash your face with a cleanser to remove that now one thing i didn on that is important is hand washing you can hands uh hand hygiene is critical for reducing transmission of pathogens colds flus we touch things all the time and then we touch our face and you need to wash your hands to basically cut down on the transmission of cold and flu viruses other viruses that we worried about and when it comes to washing your hands it amount of time that you spend uh rubbing the cleanser soap on your hands getting all surfaces rubbed that actually the type of soap that matters so choose a gentle hand soap i tell everyone to just sing the alphabet in their head that is a sufficient amount of time to be rubbing your hands together to clean them make sure you get around the nails that is really really important to be doing to reduce the transmission of pathogens i hands a lot because they talking about bathing we don and bathing together i mean hand hygiene is kind of its own separate thing that we do anytime you know we touch something we very important to you to wash your hands let me know in the comments is there some other celebrity that you all want me to respond to as far as what kind of skin care information they are putting out there i really enjoy doing these you guys seem to enjoy them and if you like them on the next slide will be my last reaction video but if you enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen and subscribe i guys tomorrow bye [Music] you	Success
Tiktoker claims RETINOL WORSENS DEPRESSION? | Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZsaZfX1as	Dr Day	well hey guys today i reacting to a tick tocker who claims that topical retinols can worsen depression i tock sharing with you my thoughts on it and i on do topical retinols worsen depression and what about the oral retinoid accutane or isotretinoin and its association with depression retinol is a depressant so my psychiatrist and i were going through my medication list and she was like oh how long have you been using retinol and i said oh since i was a teenager i used to have really bad acne and she said well actually that can make depression worse you on here telling you that it for anti-aging properties and smoothing out your skin and for acne and stuff but they don tell you that this includes over-the-counter retinols so fyi psa heard from a psychiatrist this individual has expressed concern that applying tretinoin which is a retinoid to the skin might worsen their depression there is some misunderstanding here there is no association between applying retinoids to the skin and worsening of any mental health outcome whether it be depression anxiety tretinoin which is what this individual is using is retinoic acid and rhaenylic acid is actually naturally present in our bodies and applying it to the skin actually does not impact the levels in our blood including acutely and when using it long term the percutaneous absorption into the body is minuscule but what important to know is that acne is a disease that at baseline regardless of what is being done for it has a high associated risk of mental health issues a higher risk of depression a higher risk of anxiety it is a skin condition that has a high comorbid mental health burden that really needs to be addressed [Music] the possible induction of depressive symptoms while on isotretinoin was initially noted in 1983 after anecdotal reports of worsening depression while on isotretinoin in 1998 the us fda issued a warning on isotretinoin aka accutane of possible depressive symptoms psychosis and thoughts of taking one however two large population based studies one done in 2000 and one done in 2003 showed no association with worsening of depressive symptoms or increased risk of taking one a meta-analysis which looks at all of the available studies on an association between accutane and depression showed no association in fact in that study not only was there not an increased risk of depression but actually their depressive symptoms improved while on accutane aka isotretinoin remember you guys acne is a disease that has a high comorbid risk of depression anxiety and other mental health problems another study similarly supports this idea and that nuance said depression was no different between individuals being treated for their acne with isotretinoin versus individuals being treated for their acne with an oral antibiotic another study extrapolated data from end stage cancer patients being treated with isotretinoin at a very high dose actually three milligrams per kilogram per day and they felt that perhaps those higher doses were more risky and we doses that high to treat acne ever we use doses in their age between 0.5 to 1 milligram per kilogram some smaller studies do report an increase in depressive symptoms in the first few months of starting accutane but if you guys know anything about accutane which is isotretinoin then you know that it takes some time to start working and actually the acne can get a little bit worse in the beginning before it gets better and so if you are a individual who is at increased risk for depression at baseline you probably already have depression going into the study and then we worsen your acne in the first few months yeah your symptoms are likely to get worse in the beginning what do we know about the risk of depressive symptoms and isotretinoin people who have acne are at an increased risk for having depressive symptoms it is a depressing disease to cope with there is a higher comorbidity of depression as well as anxiety it to take the acne seriously and to treat it not only to prevent scarring but to impact how serious it can be on one overall quality of life and their mental health large studies show no associated risk with taking isotretinoin and worsening depression in fact studies show that the depressive symptoms actually lessen because of accutane having acne puts you at increased risk of depression and anything that worsens the acne can worsen your overall quality of life and feed into more depressive symptoms and because isotretinoin sometimes temporarily worsens the acne a bit and it takes some time for it to start working it makes sense that in some cases depressive symptoms may worsen in the beginning so what that tells us is that first of all acne patients need to be screened from the get-go for mental health disorders and symptoms and their mental health needs to take priority as part of the treatment of their disease treating them as a whole not just treating pimples it them as a patient as a whole and mental health is a serious aspect of this disease but i think it something that needs more exposure more talk around it because the public still doesn a disease let alone realize the serious comorbid association with worsening depression with depression and potentially taking one own life that is how serious acne can be and so it really does need to be taken seriously in the case of topical retinoids there is no risk of worsening depressive symptoms with topical retinoids whether it be the prescription kind or the stuff that you get over the counter and anti-wrinkle cream so i know a lot of you guys use retinoids for other reasons you don creams are going to worsen your depressive symptoms but if you have acne it you are at increased risk for these mental health issues and the treatments are likely guilty by association because there actually cause depression or depressive symptoms or worsen depression or depressive symptoms the natural history of the disease is linked to depressive symptoms when the acne gets worse the quality of life gets worse and the individual therefore you have more depressive symptoms because we take the mental health piece so seriously we screen patients from the get-go for these mental health symptoms and we follow them very closely especially in the early months of starting them on isotretinoin aka accutane because in some cases the acne itself can get a little bit worse in the beginning and so we want to be very careful that their mental health needs are being met during this fragile time while the acne may be getting a little bit worse or taking some time to clear up if you think about it a lot of people delay going to see a health care provider or a dermatologist they put it off until things get really unbearable and so you can imagine that if somebody is being started on accutane it likely that they went to the dermatologist after their very first one or two pimples they struggling possibly in silence with their disease for a long time before finally seeking help and therefore they may be already so far into the depths of their depressive symptoms that even more reason to get that addressed from the get-go because a lot of times people are struggling in silence the stigma around mental health it we especially teenagers who are the largest population that copes with acne and is you know going to be on these medications teenagers are even more reserved about expressing their emotions they and they handle on their emotions and expressing that and so if you parent with a teenager with acne i hope this video allays your fears that the medications are harmful and going to cause mental health problems and instead i hope this video illustrates to you that it is very possible that there is some potential struggles with mental health that should be acknowledged from the get-go it really frustrates me that the media continues to sensationalize the association between isotretinoin accutane and depressive symptoms rather than talk about and shed light on the fact that there is the the true association is between acne and depressive symptoms that what we need to focus on addressing the mental health needs of people with acne when isotretinoin was discovered and first came out it completely revolutionized how we were able to treat acne we now have a medication that can effectively cure acne in many patients and not only that prevent scarring it also has a variety of other amazing benefits to treat a variety of other diseases but we obviously always think about it first and foremost as an acne medication so the fact that the media continues to sensationalize and over emphasize this association between depressive symptoms and isotretinoin but fail to bring to the everyone attention the fact that hey it acne that has an association with depression and mental health not the medications they are guilty by association they actually can help lower the depressive symptoms and prevent scarring that would otherwise go on to seriously negatively impact these individuals quality of life curious about how the stay-at-home orders and the pandemic may have negatively impacted your self-image on the next slide i of me talking about this very topic so check it out if you haven if you guys like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don i [Music] you	Success
Toxic' forever chemicals (PFAS) in makeup: is this the new paraben? | Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THmSg7vWH-Q	Dr Day	hey guys in today be responding to the media frenzy around pfas in cosmetics everyone over on tick tock has been freaking out over this and many of you have tagged me in their post asking me to comment on it what are pfos phos stands for polyfluoroalkyl substances these are a class of chemicals that are added to a variety of consumer products like nonstick cookware and water repellent clothing pfos are also added to cosmetics because they help improve spreadability as well as durability of cosmetic products a study published in environmental science and technology letters set out to test the presence of pfos in cosmetic products from the us and canada they purchased 231 different cosmetic products from the us and canada from a variety of retailers including target sephora ulta and shoppers drug mart and they tested these for the presence of fluorine fluorine is thought to be like a surrogate marker i guess of phos three quarters of waterproof mascaras tested contained high fluorine levels and two-thirds of foundations in liquid lipsticks also contained high fluorine and then more than half of the eye and lip products they tested had high fluorine they noted that different categories of makeup tended to have higher concentrations of fluorine those products that were advertised as like wear resistant are long lasting tended to have higher amounts of fluorine things like liquid lipsticks and certain foundations they then analyzed a subset of 29 of those for actual pfos and they found that all of the products had at least four pfos remember this is a large class of chemicals there are a variety of different ones why are people so freaked out about this well they are concerned for potential health effects from exposure to pfas in cosmetics the cdc points to studies which suggest a possible association although not causation association between exposure to pfas and certain adverse health effects namely elevated cholesterol an increased risk of testicular and kidney cancer changes in liver enzymes and a decreased vaccine response in children as well as an increased risk of pre-eclampsia or high blood pressure in pregnant women it hear things like increased risk of kidney cancer but it a step back there enough data to know for sure if at all that exposure to phos especially in cosmetics is it all harmful to human health not all of these studies involve the same groups the same routes of exposure many of them were done using animal models with very very high levels of pfos which is not at all what would be found in cosmetic products not to mention the fact that we have no reason to believe that these are absorbed through the skin now many people point to concerns that since a lot of these products are going to be used around the eyes or on the mouth that because in those areas you have the mucosal membranes the thin moist membranes where you to absorb things that that you could make that argument about really any ingredient in lipsticks or mascaras so you can presence of pfos in cosmetic products is necessarily bad i am very doubtful that these are even absorbed whatsoever into the skin pfoss are very durable they do not degrade and many people are concerned that if they are absorbed into the body they heard of them referred to as forever chemicals but we really don that these actually cause human disease or any adverse effect i have yet to read a study or a report of people who start using waterproof mascara suddenly developing testicular cancer or kidney cancer so it sure if at all that exposure to pfas is causing harm to human health especially in the minute quantities present in cosmetic products where you might you know worry more is that these can contaminate our drinking water and potentially you could consume them through contaminated drinking water to high levels that would be more worrisome but what you in a waterproof mascara in a liquid lipstick is very very very negligible amounts it doesn likely that this is the threat that people on tiktok are making it out to seem scientists tested more than 200 concealers foundations eye and eyebrow products and lip products and found high levels of a cancer-causing chemical in more than half of them waterproof mascara was the worst offender with 82 percent of products that scientists tested having this chemical the scientist in charge of the study said that when this chemical gets into your body it doesn everything else it just gets in and stays there there 2018 very similar to this that measured the amounts of pfos in cosmetic products in denmark and they concluded that the amounts present are very negligible and unlikely to be pose a risk to consumers also the way that they measured pfos with the fluorine assay it wasn product but rather contamination or perhaps it came from the plastic cartons i think it this study was done by a group called the green science policy institute this appears to be a non-profit organization it research center it is a non-profit and they are very tightly linked with policy making and that is their motivation so i would i would look at that with some level of skepticism you you really have to wonder what their motivations are to me this really has the undertones of green clean beauty and a push for a lobbying push for policies to control ingredients it puts out these sensationalized headlines of toxic chemicals let alone tick-tock people going to tick-tock you know pushing this and saying sort of the same thing it spread in a viral manner which is really one of the scariest things in my opinion about social media i mentioned this earlier about the whole echo chamber thing where you can take a tagline and just keep repeating it over and over again as a way to evoke fear in people but we at the information here at all and as far as i can see from what i have been able to find we really don these compounds actually cause human disease let alone in the negligible quantities that they are present in cosmetic products things like mascaras longwear lipsticks and and your foundations so in my opinion i would not throw out my makeup although you guys know i don wear makeup but i would not throw out my makeup because of these this article because of all of this hype i would continue to use the same things i don harmful to human health now you could also make the argument that these could potentially be harmful to the environment again in cosmetic products it trace amounts and so you know limiting your consumption of products in my opinion is always a good idea to minimize an environmental footprint this is where the clean beauty movement can really get you if you swoop in and say we don our products that are harmful to the environment and that you know cause kidney cancer or whatever they make sensationalized claims like that and they likewise could harm the environment you know so it really critical of when you are faced with these sensational headlines about toxic ingredients a lot of it comes from a lobbying group i before about how i don environmental working group how they misrepresent science and this is very much along the same lines the way that this has blown up and has been you know sensationalized on social media this will feed into the free labeling that is a way basically to market products to you it is not a way to keep you safe or healthy let alone protect the environment because remember if you want to protect the environment you don and so just be careful because i predict that we tons of clean beauty products being pumped out that say pfos free pfos free and you know people you know ditching all their current products for pfos this comes in waves with you know whatever the the ingredient du jour is it used to be parabens those are losing traction now it to be pfas you actually can measure blood levels of phos of some of these phos and the cdc has actually been monitoring uh blood levels since 1999 and believe it or not the national pfas levels have dropped over time between 1999 and 2014 to what extent if any were getting exposed from lipstick it seems unlikely it really seems unlikely let me know in the comments what you guys think about this but speaking of parabens on the next slide i can watch if you haven about what i think about parabens and skin care products so definitely check that out if you haven about parabens but if you like this

Wayne Goss SLEEPING IN SUNSCREEN? My response | Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-xsM7pY0f8	Dr Day	hey guys wayne goss put out a video the other day of his nighttime skincare routine and in the video he shared that for the past 21 days he bed wearing sunscreen you all asked me to react to that so i video today and sharing with you guys what i think about his pm routine and going to bed with sunscreen hello so today is another video and it night time and i have washed my face so i want to share with you my nighttime routine which has slightly changed recently i filmed videos in advance so i doing this now for 21 days 22 days i want to share with you what i why i i also want to point out i negative reactions from this but it is my choice okay because a lot of people say you do not need to do this i want to so when i wake up in the morning i one of these people that jump in the shower i do not like to shower in the morning when i wake up i have a coffee i sit at my computer and i wake up and i can be there for an hour or two before i do anything else i like to have a shower in the evening so i go to bed nice and clean then i wake up and clean anyway i hate showering in the morning it last thing i want to do i just want to sit down have a coffee yeah i it is a good idea to do your bathing in the evening time at night time before you go to bed to remove dust dirt potentially pollutants that have settled on the surface of the skin from environmental exposures throughout the day the reason this is helpful is that when you sleep there are a variety of regenerative regenerative processes that go on in the skin to heal damaged collagen if you you know dirt dust what have you on the surface of the skin that free radicals that can be generated it just better to go to bed with a clean slate and if you have acne prone skin that can end up irritating the skin around the pore and leading to more acne breakouts if you that can definitely lead to a flare of the eczema not to mention bathing in the evening can help you relax and go to sleep better quality sleep equals better healing of the skin better overall skin in general and it got me thinking because during the day i just apply sunscreen and that i computer there front of me and i from the computer in blue light but also from the window and for an hour or two a day easy before i wash my face and put some sunscreen on so if you to uv rays from the sun while we rays are the rays that can come through window glass 75 of the uva that you while you in through the window glass and contributes to not only skin aging destruction of collagen but also can damage the dna within your skin cells and is thought to play a role in melanoma it you have about 25 the uva exposure that you would if you were just outside so that actually is quite a bit of uva exposure now of course there on how far away from the window you are a lot of people have curtains drawn and you know it to be more negligible in that situation but generally speaking while you you get about 25 the uva exposure that you get while you you also have uv exposure if you have fluorescent or halogen light bulbs they can emit both uvb actually the burning rays and uva so i thought what about if i fly sunscreen at night so let me go through my routine with you so what i is i use two pumps of dramatica um all that dramatica and i just dot this on my face now i like to apply this first obviously now i put a bit on the nose i stay away from here everywhere else is so i looked up dramatica it sounds like it where they have um their own dispensing of prescription topicals things like tretinoin hydroquinone topical hybrimectone well i what is in his formula but if it is tread knowing he mentioned not putting it around the nose and i do think that know i do recommend that because the creases around the nose tretinoin can settle in there and cause a lot of irritation that being said i his formula even has tretinoin but i that it does but it may have something else in it um and he the reason to put tretinoin on at night time is because it does actually degrade on exposure to uva rays which you are exposed to throughout the day it depends on the formulation of the tretinoin tretinoin and microspheres like what is actually a pretty stable a lot more stable than just traditional tretinoin studies show that after about 24 hours of exposure to uva tretinoin 69 of the tretinoin will actually degrade so that is why we tell people to put it on at night time and it through window glass that are responsible for degrading tretinoin specifically 420 nanometers so the the raise that he being exposed to while he a window glass this could impact tretinoin but puts it on at night time so it that you have to continue to worry about and definitely now do you need to wear sunscreen when you go to bed after you put tretinoin on to protect it in case you know you happen to wake up roll over and boom all of a sudden you in front of a window no i mean that that is not necessary we don patients to do that we don it on at nighttime wear sunscreen during the day when they were working on tretinoin in the early days doing the lab studies they got these great results in acne patients with tretinoin and then they went to repeat the experiments and what had happened is that they had left the tretinoin sitting out on the laboratory bench and the uva rays that come in through window glass ended up degrading the treadmill one they couldn results so that historical tidbit for you so then i apply a tiny touch of moisturizer now i cell revitalizing salt revitalize day moisturizer so i apply just a small amount and i apply this because i like the benefits of it and i they sponsored in this video but i just wanted to show you what i do that moisturizer that he which is fine to and i do to bed so i apply quite a lot and i pretty much know now how much to apply but i do tend to blur on the side of excess and i apply this all over and then i blend it in and i for a few days blending this in and it goes all over my beard which looks just i mean it see sunscreen bulkaki lovely but we blend it in and eventually it will become part of the skin i go over my eyelids with them shut and blend it down onto one is i just tend to get a little bit of a towel and clean the beard area off but it does blend in as you can see now the benefits i is first of all i negative breakouts the reason so it looks like it mineral sunscreen i but the bottle kind of looked like an ulta md sunscreen but i cleaned it therefore there for me to break out with this i a chemical sunscreen this time i use a chemical one some bury my skin others don let is not a hot look so basically that so of course by the time i woke up in the morning there of that sunscreen would have dissipated and i won of protection but i getting protection absolutely so putting the sunscreen on at night like he um obviously not 100 of it is still going to be on and protecting him fully the following morning which he says clearly here you know of course i know it not gonna you know hold up a hundred percent but he left behind and that to apply in the morning after he his coffee the benefit here is that he already has some sunscreen on the skin and the reason this is so important is that it hard to apply enough sunscreen to get adequate coverage of all surface areas and people skip areas it comfortable to actually apply the recommended amount and therefore that is that is one of the main reasons why we tell people they need to reapply yes it and you sweat it off and what have you but he lying down in bed presumably i don know if he what have you but of course some of it off but not as much as if he were out sweating regardless he have some still on the skin and putting on another layer he step ahead of the curve so the recommendation for reapplying and for reapplying while you is simply to make up for the fact that it the skin the first time and you areas so the reapplication gets you better protection that shown objectively in studies that when patients reapply sunscreen especially if they reapply early on they burn and they sustain sun damage remember your skin it sheet it sulci and it painted a textured wall with just one coat you areas that are still exposed the same holds true with your skin so by going to bed with one layer on and then the following day after he his coffee when he applies his first layer of the day he board so he ahead of the curve it have to be perfect but it you know it than just starting out um so we for me it because kind of using prescription drink products they for people who use them a while they can be pretty irritating and using that much sunscreen which is a lot um means my skin is very very soft in the morning because i amount of product and i just feel like i good because i morning yeah this is a great point um sunscreens you know there misconception that sunscreens aren moisturizing sure they as like the perfect end-all be-all moisturizer but truthfully they are quite good at reducing water loss out of the skin at night when we sleep and our skin is going about these regenerative processes we end up losing more water out of the skin it trans epidermal water loss and that is why we often wake up with drier skin by applying something as occlusive as sunscreen to the face provided you tolerate it and it great way actually to reduce water loss out of the skin you know sunscreens there are either lotions or creams for the most part and lotions and creams that the active ingredient is the sunscreen ingredient in this case i it but it might be a chemical filter but the inactive ingredients are what constitute the vehicle and the vehicle at its heart is a moisturizer a lotion or a cream and so you of reducing water loss out of the skin which is ideal at night time when you water out of the skin as your skin is going about re healing and so he he basically sounds like you know he benefit from going to bed with a really occlusive moisturizer on especially since he you know prescription grade topicals which can be irritating many prescription topicals again i tretinoin in it but i they increase skin cell turnover that ultimately can lead to more water loss out of the skin that dryness and peeling in the beginning it can make your skin more sensitive to things coming in contact with it this is a great way to address that we always tell people to go to bed with a moisturizer on this is what he moisturizer on and it just happens to have sunscreen ingredients in it there doing that and now i feel like i myself as best i can from computer race from the sun because i skincare with prescriptions so the computer and computer screens are laptops devices they emit uh blue light they don and sunscreen some sunscreens can offer some some protection against the blue uh blue light that is emitted from devices but it really that are uh tinted with iron oxides that offer that kind of protection it doesn like he here it tinted sunscreen on it they rub off and stain things i mean that would mess up your sheets quite a bit um anyways so just to clarify that regular sunscreen they don protect against blue light unless there are they have iron oxides which are going to be found in tinted formulas and it simply having the iron oxides and being tinted it formulated overall that that offers that visible light protection it you know concentration of the iron oxides which manufacturers don disclose to you and it has to have you know a mixture of them plus the other ingredients in the formula overall end up dictating to what extent the product protects you from the rays that come out of the screen the blue light the visible light so just to clarify that is that is different from the uva rays that come in through the window glass his sunscreen will protect offer some offer protection against those uva rays that he by the window but not really the the um computer screen and just to clarify blue light does cause free radicals in the skin that can contribute to aging it responsible for flaring hyperpigmentation but the blue light emitted from laptops and devices it of blue light that you need to worry about comes from the sun visible light that you see with your eyes contains blue light and that is largely what plays a big role in generating free radicals as well as aggravating hyperpigmentation so to remind you the sun not only pumps out uvb and uva but it also pumps out visible light and blue light within the visible light range is what can also damage your skin and sunscreens with iron oxides may offer some protection against the blue light piece of that products so i might as well invest it in using some sunscreen at night and the other benefit is skin is really soft in the morning because it that you know 22 days now not a single irritant not a single breakout nothing at all for me it going to continue doing absolutely anyway let me know your thoughts on this anyway maybe you do the same thing i love to know because we all here you don true but i do the day and i a good few hours so let me know your thoughts thanks for watching i soon bye the concern many people have with going to bed with sunscreen on is that it but you can make that argument for any moisturizer that you put on your face it moisturizer to make sure that the skin is clean which he has done he and washed his face before applying it on because if you have any cosmetics makeup dirt pollutants left behind on the skin and then you put something occlusive on trapping that dirt up against the pore can lead to a lot of irritation and that can you know cause flares of acne for some people now for people with acne prone skin another option that is quite good at reducing water loss out of the skin but isn know a sunscreen that is labeled oil-free those typically have silicones in them that allow for a more lightweight feel or more lightweight consistency and tend to be more friendly and people with acne prone breakout prone skin is it necessary to go to bed with sunscreen on absolutely not do you need to go to bed with sunscreen on if you vulnerable to degradation upon exposure to uva no you don day and are you know right up against a window but i sincerely doubt people are doing that you know draw the curtain in that case because if you are just sleeping that way it imagine anyways having an occlusive moisturizer including sunscreen on the skin helps reduce water loss out of the skin and ultimately that can help you tolerate topicals like tretinoin better with less irritation the other advantage to going to bed with sunscreen on is that when you wake up in the morning and you do apply your first layer of the day you already have a few of the ingredients on the surface of the skin now as you sleep some of the sunscreen is going to rub off but it to rub off entirely it when you wake up the following morning you have no active sunscreen left behind on the skin you do still have some so the advantage here of going to bed with sunscreen on is that the following day when you apply your first layer of the day you already ahead of the curve in terms of the quantity on the surface of the skin that is needed to actually achieve the stated spf on the bottle most people grossly under apply sunscreen it to apply enough the first time to actually achieve the spf that on the bottle so by reapplying you get more volume on the skin and that ultimately covers more surface area more of those grooves and crevices and ultimately gets you closer to the spf that you are looking for it that he starts the day having his coffee by a window and he is getting quite a bit of uva exposure sitting close to a window uva damages the dna and our skin cells and that is what is partially responsible for melanoma it also activates matrix metalloproteinase enzymes that chew up collagen in the skin to what extent is the sunscreen going to remain on the skin after a full night of sleep he active sunscreen still left behind on the skin again it influenced by how he sleeps if he stomach sleeper if he tosses and turns around a lot you guys know i sleep flat on my back i pillow so i really don much at all at night time and i think it would still be you know quite a bit can still be left behind on the skin and that curve it you still apply sunscreen the following morning so to say why not just wait until the morning well it gets you ahead of the curve as far as the volume that you have on your skin to reach that spf that you desire what is stated on the on the bottle an spf 50 water resistant sunscreen applied to the forehead after six hours of inactivity meaning no sweating or working out or anything just standing perfectly still after six hours that spf 50 still holds up so to say that nothing you know it going to be completely worn off that is a myth a misconception he still will he still will have sunscreen on the reason we tell you to reapply sunscreen is not because it you know wears off after an hour but because it rubs off you sweat it off and you don enough to begin with that is the reason for the reapplication recommendation we also recommend that you wear sunscreen while you are indoors because to remember uva rays do contribute substantially not only to skin aging but to melanoma risk i actually end up using sunscreen a fair amount at night time as a body moisturizer and i find that it works quite well specifically i have often used this bondi sans spf 50 this is a chemical sunscreen very moisturizing it claims to offer 72 hours of hydration and i can attest to that my skin does feel very soft after i wear this the reason i often will wear sunscreens on the body as a nighttime body moisturizer is just because i timely manner and you know i find that they work quite well i don pm moisturizer but as i an option what he makes sense it benefits to doing this for sure which he can attest to he notices that he has softer smoother skin in the morning less irritation from the topicals so i hope that made sense to you guys um nothing in this routine seems unreasonable to me and i think he explained everything very clearly and i hope this answered your questions about do we need to wear sunscreen at night time no but there are benefits to doing it if you choose to on the next slide there video for you guys to watch if you haven another youtubers skin care recommendations and unlike this video those recommendations some of them were pretty hazardous so definitely check that out but if you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don i bye [Music]

My response TO MIKE THURSTON'S TANNING & SKIN CARE TIPS| Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV0ON3lucqo	Dr Day	well hey guys in today to be reacting to a video by the youtuber mike thurston how to get the best natural tan i going to be going through the video and i common myths and misconceptions about tanning if you guys are new here welcome my name is andrea i dermatologist and i to my youtube channel and hit the thumbs up it really helps my videos out a lot all right this video has over 666 000 views so that is a lot of eyes on this video and i think the youtuber has over a million subscribers all right guys welcome to today not gonna lie never thought i day where i this but it people are asking me how i go this colour so i some of the tips and things which i do in order to get myself nice and tan so we leg hair removal action going on right about now the only place in my body which i do actually have hair is my legs they do get pretty hairy so once every six weeks i get rid of the hair once upon a time i did shave my legs with a razor all right presumably he hair for two reasons first of all body hair does actually block some uv uh radiation although not enough but it not only is it removing the hair that absorbs some uv but it also exfoliates the skin which is going to give a more level playing field for ultraviolet rays to penetrate into the skin and presumably he wants a town but you guys know from my videos that those uv rays from the sun they really do a lot of damage in the skin including when you are getting tan they damage the dna and the skin cells and create all kinds of inflammation setting the stage for skin cancers later on in life as well as visible signs of photo aging but let keep going it was quite possibly one of the most uncomfortable things i ever experienced afterwards particularly around the groin region it was itching like mad so from that point onwards i never shaved my leg with a razor it beat hair removal uh he he uses veet which is a chemical depilatory as opposed to shaving there way to remove body hair but you can get ingrown hairs with shaving as he described but chemical depilatories they are an alternative basically they just disrupt the um the proteins in the hair and make the hair kind of just melt off you do want to follow the instructions very carefully however as they can cause chemical burns on the skin and he so i would caution you against using a chemical depilatory right before sun exposure because they can make your skin even more vulnerable to uv rays but it those things which i do first of all to get more sun to actually hit the legs second of all because when you basis and adding sun cream your legs just look really really greasy and the hair just grabs onto all that grease and thirdly this is obviously for what i do for a living it actually exposes all the cuts in your legs okay what working so hard on my legs if you can see them because there fur covering them up so he know that makes sense to remove the body here so you can see more right so this process is called the exfoliation process where you to be removing the dead skin from your body ideally do this one to two days before you are exposing yourself to the sun so again exfoliating the skin similar to shaving it level the playing field and just allow for the uv rays to focus into the skin even more intensely which you guys know is not a good thing but that is what he is attempting to achieve here by exfoliating away some of the dead layer plus it sounds like he before his last day on vacation so he exposure and as a result of that he declamation of those damaged skin cells from all that sun exposure the skin is probably starting to peel a little bit and so he exfoliating away that peeling skin which actually leaves the skin even more vulnerable exfoliating exfoliating skin cells mechanically like this it can it can cause a lot of irritation wipe out those keratinocytes and on that last day i get a really good tan once again right sun cream absolutely crucial when you exposing yourself to the sun the way i do it is start the holiday i so anywhere between 20 and 30 and i apply it all over all right the spots which get me the most shoulders chest nose face particularly if you chest so good that he is wearing some sunscreen uh sounds like and he some areas are obviously going to be more prone to burning but your whole body is exposed out there especially here in this setting on the beach starting with an spf of 20 to 30 you guys know from my videos unfortunately the way people put sunscreen on it really hard to put enough on that you ever actually get to that spf so starting with an spf of 20 or 30 it more likely that he spf of you know at best maybe 10. um and i don applying it to these you know areas that he thinks are going to be the most vulnerable kind of the gwyneth paltrow method of sunscreen application i sure let you can have more of your chest exposed because a lot of times gonna be coming from above so make sure you apply generously i probably do it about once every three four hours that indicates that he at least reapplies which is great most people don and you definitely need to be reapplying sunscreen while you are outside because it rubs off and the other reason to reapply is not as i said it enough on to begin with so by reapplying you actually end up getting more surface area coverage simply by the act of reapplying um but one thing i want to point out he mentions that the rays come from above and you know that obviously makes sense the sun is above you but you also have to bear in mind that these uv rays they are reflected and scattered off of surfaces like sand for example so it not just what is coming from above you have to be mindful of what is underneath you that is why having shade plus sunscreen that multi-pronged approach that is why it first day i don long i kind of just again gradually ease myself into it near the end of the holiday i feel like i can get away with being in the sun a lot more usually there might be a bit of reddening occurring on the first or second day so if you do notice any parts of your body going red get out the sun immediately it doesn get your whole body out of the sun but just get those areas covered up and this is something which i days after sun exposure that the obvious manifestations of tanning are at their peak so he um thinks that he has kind of been building up to that but really it a process that takes some time tanning is basically a marker of sun damage um you know it acceptable it it underscores that you have below the surface of the skin a lot of dna damage uh inflammatory cytokines and what he describing here the redness that is uvb mediated erythema or redness basically skin cells they get so much dna see the dna in the skin cells absorbs those uv rays and it creates mutations and to help you out those skin cells basically commit suicide it there that in an effort to clean it up unfortunately the sun immunosuppressive so it lowers the ability of your immune system to come in and correct some of that damage so that redness that he that is definitely an indication of some pretty heavy hitting uh uv damage he says to get out of the sun right away but he shows himself going under that umbrella yes it is a good idea to seek shade but unfortunately like i said earlier getting under an umbrella when you the beach is not enough because the rays are going to be reflected from the sand uh it looked like he was on a white towel and white beach chairs those are going to reflect a lot of rays too so my recommendation if you do begin to have redness of the skin related to sun exposure get out of the sun right away and don get out go inside uh because basically your skin it for help and it when it there all right he somewhere sunny i wear sun protection all right even near the end of the holiday when my skin is more adapted to the sun i still wear it because even if you go brown you all right it sunscreen i hope he wears it to more than just the nose because that all he upper chest is really all he himself put where he putting it on but it is a misconception that the tan protects you from further uv damage it doesn offers actually about an spf of three to the skin and the reason for that is that tanning is basically a form of skin injury and in response to that the skin gets thickened over time that can leave your skin looking very leathery so it tan protects you from the sun it really doesn offers a very low spf of three just by creating that thickening but you see it a lot of people fall for that if they they then they are they are out of harm and that is a big misconception when it comes to sun exposure people laying out on the beach and they get there especially people who are able to town not everybody can get a town like this some people will burn right away um but many people such as this individual can in fact get a deep town and they may think that because they can town that they damage but it they can town and they are motivated to stay out so long they end up getting an onslaught of uv mediated dna mutations into the skin immunosuppression a huge cytokine storm not to mention up regulation a matrix metalloproteinases those are the enzymes that chew up collagen and ultimately lead to skin wrinkling so getting simply being outside sunbathing and tanning you you are basically just exposing yourself to mega megadoses of a carcinogen which is uv burning doesn to skin damage right i much sunlight okay i i do not want to get skin cancer and i also do not want to look like a wrinkly he protection sunscreen is not a shield of armor whatsoever it outdoors too long in fact that is a likely reason why in the early days when sunscreen first came out people ended up staying out in the sun much too long and as a result later on down the road as those people aged and got into their 40s and 50s they started developing skin cancers and that is part of why skin cancer rates have gone up i big believer in the oils the facts are zeros and so i bit messy once you apply the oil you just cover it in oil and you up good that he doesn tanning oils i other videos before um tanning oils first of all there old school practice of using baby oil or mineral oil all over and basically that can get you a lot more sun exposure because it kind of focuses the uv rays a little bit more intensely and if you somebody who burns easily that can fry you to a crisp it actually can get you such a intense burn that you end up in the emergency room but for people who tan easily it will again make the tanning more intense but the intensity it it a beneficial thing for you or for your skin it an indicator of destruction down below whenever you have that tanning so the oils they intensify that now there baby oil there a tiny amount of sun protection in them and a tiny amount of spf they what those allow for is a little bit of protection against the burning rays so that people who tend to burn but can tan those types of products encourage those people to stay out way too long and because they aren easily because they have that little bit of spf on but then they got the oil aspect that focusing those uva rays i mean they those types of products really put the consumer in a position where they are getting a lot of uv exposure but he doesn and we or this section of the video is called the aftermath okay so how can you maintain the town of as long as possible the tan which has been achieved overseas now obviously the crucial thing you need to do is moisturize keep yourself moisturized you don your skin to go dry so moisturizing and staying hydrated is going to be very important now i moisturize like once a day entire body just use this one to be honest so that is a good general skin care tip to moisturize daily after sun exposure your moisture barrier is impaired you going to lose a lot more water out of the skin you to dryness and irritation plus after such a skin injury the skin is going to peel decimate you have a lot of shedding and the way to baby that is to wear a moisturizer but better than that is to not put yourself in that setting where you are exposing yourself to so much uv damage that you then have all these sequela of dryness irritation peeling not to mention the dna damage and inflammatory onslaught and collagen destruction that you can with your eyes what is existing and lurking down below anyways oh god oh god now when it comes to sunbeds i would be very cautious with using them i i haven but during the winter months or when i where i just simply have not been exposed to sunlight for months i will go on them but yeah never ever get in a tanning bed they are the equivalent of smoking cigarettes for your skin tanning beds use uva those are the rays that just chew up your collagen and lead to wrinkling but going in a tanning bed even one time can increase your risk for melanoma the deadliest type of skin cancer by 20 just one trip to the tanning bed not to mention it increases your risk of the other types of skin cancer squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell in a two week period and only for eight minutes no more than that you have to be very very careful with them and especially if you have fair skin probably just best you stay away from them yes best that you stay away from them and the eight minute thing it doesn for a few seconds is too too much very very dangerous to go in a tanning bed even one time it doesn and it doesn either if you are a deeper skin tone do not go in a tanning bed because you know those uva rays they penetrating super deep it doesn anything to do with your skin tone it largest organ system when it comes to tanning injections believe it or not i of taking tanning injections do not take them stay far far away from them okay the nhs has issued a statement anyone currently using milanitan should stop doing so immediately for their own safety the drug has not been safe yeah um he injections melanotan um that that i would definitely agree with it doesn um these but they are potentially very very dangerous uh milana town is um something that is sold like on the black market on you know from on the internet you can find it and you inject it into yourself basically they mimic hormones that lead to that bind to the melanocytes and lead to pigment production so you get more pigmentation and you get a tan but these um products they medication alpha melanotide which is regulated but these that you can buy online without a prescription they you know these products they are frequently adulterated with other things that can make you very sick and unfortunately also they transparent with the dosing it found that the concentrations the amount of the active ingredient in these varies a lot so you could be getting a very high amount what are the risks of taking melanotan well it can obviously make you down it can cause darkening and discoloration of freckles and unfortunately a potential risk of taking this is that it actually could make you develop melanomas or just worsen what because basically you cells and if you have cells in your skin that already have some of the beginning dna mutations and things for forming a skin cancer you pushing the gas pedal towards skin cancer formation not only that though melanochan can have some pretty serious side effects it can make you really really sick really nauseous throw up especially when you don you dosage is even if they tell you what it is the product that you bought it doesn necessarily mean that that is what is in there and for man it can cause priapism which is a prolonged and painful erection you typically have to go to the emergency room for you know seek medical attention for it is not pleasant you know you can have erectile dysfunction as a result so i would discourage anyone from ever obtaining these and using them it can be very very dangerous um and they can often be adulterated with things that could harm you so stay away from them and then obviously genetics is going to determine how brown you will actually go right some people just aren to go brown they just don know yeah i mean that basis of the fitzpatrick photo type uh that you know we ask people about their tendency to burn versus tan uh you know fitzpatrick photo type one is people by definition typically have red hair super pale skin light colored eyes they will burn they will not tan and if you are that phototype you are at even more risk of skin cancers but that doesn that if you are a medium skin tone or a deeper skin tone that your skin is not going to be damaged by uv rays just because you tan easily tanning remember it injury so you don as readily or even maybe at all some people don but that doesn are not damaging your skin still i get a lot of people asking me mike how on earth do you stay brown all year round doesn english you live in england how would you do it and i tell them well half of the time i two to three week period of being in england i and it i like to be in warm places i don to be cold so i go to the sunny places when i i my skin is exposed to the sun so i going to be brown and then usually when i come home the tan will fade but once it gets to the point really fading you know i then again somewhere warm so the tan is kind of being maintained all year round you know this year already i barcelona i beat the greece portugal the list goes on so he gets a lot of uv exposure year round um and so cumulative doses of uv throughout your lifetime are ultimately what contribute to skin cancer it says intermittent exposures though that intermittent intense exposures that are thought to be most harmful but also cumulatively overall does make a difference so our day-to-day exposures like even if you live somewhere that those small amounts over time do accumulate and lead to kind of your lifetime burden of damage but then those intermittent intense exposures are really what lead to certain types of skin cancers but it sounds like i don the footage that he he spends a lot of time getting intense sun exposure as opposed to intermittent intense exposure so even more risky and risky for not only skin cancers but photo aging down the road and the thing is in london it does actually get warm every now and then it does get sunny because i don nine-to-five job i choose their own hours which i work if it i soaking up the sun and making the most of those rare sunny days in england so if you yeah i mean you know just because uv rays are harmful to the skin and cause a lot of damage as i free radicals and dna mutations it doesn cannot enjoy the outdoors you just need to do so responsibly and make sure you wear a hat some protective clothing so you definitely can enjoy the outdoors it healthy to do so you know it your mood and you know there are other associations positive associations with sun exposure but that doesn annihilate your skin uh so protect it and still you can you can protect your skin and still enjoy the outdoors responsibly i sound like a um i sound like a whiskey commercial please enjoy alcohol responsibly um it mean these are common you know most people think this um but you are exposing your skin to a lot of damaging rays when you get this much sun exposure and you are actively seeking a tan through sun exposure there is no such thing as a safe natural town he says here how to get the best natural tam but there such thing as a safe natural town um from the sun is you know basically when you when you have a tan from the sun it is an indicator of skin injury and a lot of uv damage dna mutations inflammatory mediators free radicals species matrix metallic protein aces i mean the list goes on and on and so there no such thing as a safe natural suntan even deadlier than a natural sun town is a tanning bed tan so that is even worse than a sun tan you know from the sun but probably if you if you want to have a tan the best thing to do is just use dihydroxyacetone sunless tanner it doesn damaging your skin structures permanently increasing your risk of skin cancer and aging the skin yeah they smell funny and they can be a little irritating but much safer way to have that tan appearance of the skin if that is what you and you know i wish that people didn necessarily view tanning as this health indicator because it but i do appreciate that in certain things like bodybuilding which sounds like that is what this guy does it the part part and parcel of that um sport to have a town so that muscles are you know more noticeable um and what not go in a spray tan booth get a spray tan definitely safer for you so yeah this was kind of a fun video to do you guys um i toy was doing these here and there you know i throw people under the bus and this video is definitely not meant to you know be negative against this individual just meant to highlight the fact that these are just common misconceptions about uv exposure and can be very damaging to get that much sun exposure people don it so i hope this was helpful to you guys and comment below and if you enjoy this type of video is there another video out there that you think i should react to comment below if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen and subscribe i guys tomorrow bye [Music] you	Success
Octocrylene SUNSCREEN SAFETY questioned by \"Scientists\" | My response | Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDWLBT3lNt8	Dr Day	hey guys sunscreen is on The Chopping Block yet again this time it ingredient octoin which the public has now become fearful of thanks to widespread media coverage of this ingredient in today be dismantling the many misleading statements that are being made about octoin earlier this year a nonprofit group published a paper benzo fenon accumulates overtime from degradation of octoin in commercial sunscreen products the authors of this paper have been heavily interviewed on a variety of different news and media outlets and they statements about benzophenone and octone and the overall safety of sunscreens check the description box I put all of my references but the majority of the points and counter points that I from a response to this paper in the journal in which it was published um from an author cerber so I will put that reference down below as well you could read the paper yourself what is octoin Octan is a UV filter that absorbs UVB which are the Rays from the Sun that burn your skin and it also absorbs some short UVA wavelengths as well now it present in sunscreens to protect you from a sunburn but it various cosmetic products to protect the ingredients in that product from degradation from UV rays what is benzophenone benzophenone is a compound that is approved in Europe as a flavoring and fragrance enhancer and a perfuming agent the nonprofit group hereticus environmental Labs went out got a bunch of sunscreens and tested them for benzophenone and they found that sunscreens that had the chemical filter octalin tested positive for benzophenone this group makes it seem as though benzophenone should never ever ever be detected in a cosmetic or sunscreen product but it surprising actually that they do detect benzophenone in the sunscreens why well when it comes to the synthesis of substance there are always going to be byproducts in manufacturing substances have to undergo a purification process but it is impossible to get a 100% pure substance from these purification processes there some lowlevel of byproduct remaining and for this reason the manufacturers of raw materials have set into place threshold allowable concentrations of these byproducts and they determine these threshold concentrations after rigorous review of all available safety data on the byproducts it is willy-nilly determined and so yes there is a lowlevel allowable amount of byproduct that can be present in products it has been determined to be safe and of no harm to human health and this is something that undergoes continual revision scrutiny Etc so it not just some oops byproduct that is present they only Zone in on California Proposition 65 which is a legislation that applies largely to the state of California the California Proposition 65 is not the gold standard of toxicologic safety and product manufacturing and there is no mention of these other legislative bodies the European regulatory authorities which by the way Europe typically is a lot stricter when it comes to personal care product ingredient safety and what is allowed and not allowed the second incredibly misleading statement from this group is that there is high percutaneous absorption of benzophenone meaning basically if you come in contact with it on the skin it into the body they say upwards of 70% absorption that 70% number is coming from looking at absorption of benzophenone in acetone acetone is a potent penetration enhancer meaning it help helps to drive in the benzophenone acetone does this by dissolving the little intracellular Bridges between skin cells and the top layer of the skin allowing for enhanced penetration last I checked there was no sunscreen out there made in acetone I mean comment below are you putting your sunscreen on and following it up with a vigorous coating of nail polish remover no the other absorption studies look at rees applied under maximal use under occlusion and by under occlusion we talking about like under a bandage and we know that that really drives penetration in who is putting maximal amounts of sunscreen on and wrapping themselves up in Saran wrap that is not a real world condition these are things that the authors of this paper are not conveying in their in their paper or to the public it make a similar argument and tell you guys that there is an ingredient there is a compound in skinc care products a compound that has the potential to cause spasm of your larynx and then if it gets down into your lungs which can happen it can cause lung dysfunction and then subsequent brain hypoxia this deadly deadly ingredient is just so dangerous potentially this is how they this you can drown in water but is that going to happen from putting water on your skin no it the root of exposure these are factors in toxicology that you need to weigh in on and they this and they public here by saying that 70% absorption of benzophenone from sunscreen very misleading not to mention the benzophenone that they detected is at at the threshold allowable amount which is incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly low at this point I you this video and hopefully are happily putting sunscreen on but many of you are still concerned you if it don thresholds I coming in contact with my skin because it paper would have you believe that it is dangerous and that it toxic but the truth is it European food and Safety Authority has deemed benzophenone as not g genotoxic or harmful there are long-term studies in rodents of the carcinogenic effects of benzophenone after oral delivery giving it to them by mouth at high levels suggesting possible uh carcinogenic effects on the liver the kidneys and the hematopoetic system those are really extreme laboratory conditions where you giving high amounts of benzophenone by mouth to ER rodent in actual dermal absorption studies actually putting it on the skin there is no evidence of cancer not to mention the absorption of octoin which they assumption that it octoin that is contributing to the detection of benzophenone octoin is absorbed and incredibly low levels dermally it dead layer of the skin the stratum corium this group also makes some pretty misleading statements about the endocrine disrupting effects of octoin and benzophenone but what they fail to distinguish is endocrine activity from endocrine disruption many things that we are exposed to in our environment our day-to-day life affect our endocrine activity shift work nutrients I mean things that you come in contact with can have an endocrinologic effect detecting endocrine activity of a substance in a single test is by no means an indication that the ingredient or the compound is an endocrine disrupter the contrary you have to have a lot of data both in vitro and in Vivo and by that I mean in like cells in a dish Plus in actual La lab animal models and human studies to say that something truly is an endocrine disruptor all sunscreen filters in Europe are approved by authorities under maximum use concentrations and y know from my videos that nobody uses sunscreen in real life at maximum use concentrations regardless all the filters in Europe are approved under maximal use concentrations and as part of that approval process they weigh in these endocrinologic safety studies and again having a single endocrinologic act activity or effect in one test does not equate to endocrine disrupting but this group seriously misleads the media and the public in their statements that benzophenone octoin are endocrine disruptors they into account the entire package of safety and toxicologic data but rather they Zone in on a few studies to support their conclusions I don can actually call himself Scientist by cherry-picking to this extent and then going out into the media and making really really polarizing scary statements like if it gets on the skin it can not only trigger rashes inflammation hypers sensitivity but also liver cancer or lymphoma are you serious are you serious who is getting liver cancer from Banana Boat who who you have to ask yourself these things you cannot just rely on on these inflammatory News interviews I mean who is getting liver cancer from Banana Boat sunscreen no one no one this is a false statement it is a false statement this should be this should be illegal honestly it really should so is octoin safe yes more than safe the greatest risk of putting octoin on your skin is that you can develop an allergy to it and if you have an allergy to octoin well then you have to avoid it in summary octarine is more than safe and this concern that it degrades to benzophenone there is a threshold safe amount of benzophenone that can be present in products as a byproduct of raw material manufacturing and that concentration has been heavily vetted and scrutinized it willy-nilly okay we of thing not to mention benzophenone is unlikely to actually get into your skin let alone it enic or an endocrine disruptor these are all misleading statements the media is really also to blame for sure because they put out these sensationalized headlines I mean you would think that sunscreen was going to give you cancer based on these headlines but benzophenone is not even a carcinogen and let alone octoin you know unless you large large large amounts of benzophenone you unless you in sunscreen 24/7 wrapping yourself up in Saran Wrap you dangerous absorption you absorption of benzophenone it yeah I mean I can somebody would call them a scientist and make these kind of statements given what we know about how these compounds interact from a toxicologic perspective and not to mention these ingredients have been used in sunscreens for a long time with no evidence of any harm to human health there is some kind of Vendetta out there from these nonprofit groups to do away with sunscreens I don understand why um and I don the you know research that they are so hellbent on conducting in such a piss poor fashion to promote this narrative to do away with sunscreens sunscreen is a very important piece of protecting your skin from UV exposure from UV damage those Rays can can and do cause skin cancer as well as damage the skin and compromise the health of your skin long term of course sunscreen is not a shield of armor you need to practice other Sun protective behaviors wearing a broadbrim hat not staying out too long during Peak exposure times being mindful of your sun exposure overall it bigger picture practice for protecting your skin just like you wouldn a car and only rely on your seat Bel to protect you you would be following traffic laws presumably stopping at stop signs looking both ways maybe you have an airbag your tires work I mean you wouldn seat Bel on and a flat tire I would hope same thing with sun protection you want a full package of safety to
