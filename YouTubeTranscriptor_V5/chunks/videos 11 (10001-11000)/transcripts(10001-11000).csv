Is natural sugar from fruit just as ÂbadÂ as added sugar?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yg5_SmLCps	Dr Pal	so if that someone maybe with nafld you to not eat an orange yeah i think that natural fruits are fine including like fake fruits like grapes i call grapes fake yeah there are certain fruits that have uh that are high in sugar um you know mangoes of figs oh my god they enriched in fructose figs are probably something that we should voice oh dates yes you know mangoes are high apples and um pears plums they tend to be fairly high like around 910 grams i think oranges are around six grams bananas are fairly high glycemic and uh they have a fair amount of fructose but it eight grams i think what we show notes is we together a table of yeah i have a great table typical sizes because i this is actually used to me i would have guessed fruits would have a little bit more but it no it you know 3 grams and nine to 10 grams max and most fruits are around four to six grams some fruits have much less sugar like kiwi like berries strawberries blueberries they should be encouraged to eat those and we actually did a study uh where we gave what we gave people a low sugar diet where they was low in refined sugar low in high fructose corn syrup um and uh but we uh one group got of natural fruit and the other group we restricted that too so it was either a low fructose diet that was low fructose in all aspects the other was low sugar low fructose but you actually was sort of a modest total fructose intake and when we did that we found equivalent improvement in metabolic syndrome um and so the the presence of natural fruit did not block the ability of the of the low sugar diet to to reduce um or to improve metabolic syndrome so the takeaway here is don drink it and don think this is a difficult thing for people to differentiate right so added sugar is when a food has sucrose or high fructose corn syrup are typically the most common agents that are added right and it to the food so if you have if you go out and get a jar of pasta sauce it they added sugar to it they yes that from the tomatoes that go into making that it sucrose or high fructose corn syrup to make it taste sweeter and remember that the intestine does act as a shield for up to like five or four to six grams of fructose so if you eat four or five grams of fructose in a fruit the intestine is going to protect you in addition the intestine you have fiber in a natural fruit and that slows the absorption so the concentration of fructose that gets to the liver is lower so there about dry versus not dry so if you take um dried apples so if you if you if you take the equivalent of apple chips versus apples but you take equal amounts of the actual calories so it know obviously one is a lot bigger because it in it what metabolize that yeah the trouble with dried fruit is it it fructose but a lot of the good things are are removed so that sort of like candy this podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine nursing or other professional health care services including the giving of medical advice no doctor-patient relationship is formed the use of this information and the materials linked to this podcast is at the user podcast is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice diagnosis or treatment users should not disregard or delay in obtaining medical advice from any medical condition they have and they should seek the assistance of their health care professionals for any such conditions finally i take conflicts of interest very seriously for all of my disclosures and the companies i invest in or advise please visit peteratiammd.com forward slash about where i keep an up-to-date and active list of such companies [Music]	Success

What If You Only Ate Once A Day For 30 Days?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVppzWCG4qw	Dr Pal	hello health champions what would happen if you only ate one meal a day for 30 days just once a day for 30 days well a lot of people would probably say that they would get hungry but what we want to understand is more about the changes and the behavior the physiology of change that can assist us in making these changes so hunger is just a sensation and it mostly based on habits that whatever habits you have whatever behavior you engage in habitually creates a conditioned expectation your body is led to believe that things are going to happen a certain way and your body adapts by making changes at the cellular level because it can increase and decrease physical tissues it can make metabolic changes it can increase or decrease up regulate or down regulate enzymes hormones mitochondria energy production and you even make neurological changes your body constantly makes new synapses and breaks down old synapses that you don nervous system and your behavior and it lays down physical pathways that are different if your behavior and your environment changes the biggest obstacle for most people to change is that they think they are the way they are i hear that all the time that am and my dad was the same way and it runs in my family and that we but it doesn eating six times a day it learn to eat six times a day and if you eat three times or once a day it because you learned to eat that way and your body started expecting it so what we really want to get into is to understand change is change really difficult and i want to make the argument that it is not hard it is inevitable it be is constant change you time already so how come then you say that i look like the same person when i get up in the morning and i look in the mirror i see the same person that i saw yesterday or last week or last year and it person i see next week well here same person looking back at you because you are 90 new cells since last year the person you 90 of those cells are different old cells break down and you have to make new ones so if they look the same it you made more of the same the other way you want to think about this is that your nervous system is processing billions of bits of information every second it receives information it processes information and it issues commands it signals it orchestrates the body and in doing that it moment of every day you are changing your body is reacting to the things you eat and your thoughts and the air pressure and to gravity and to things happening around you and if it looks like you are the same it it recreated the same thing the way the body changes is called adaptation and i love to observe these everyday things and really sort of think about them and be in awe of how incredible the body is so one example is when i mountain trail and i have a heart rate monitor and i look at the heart rate and i on the flat and then as soon as it starts going up even a couple of degrees my heart rate goes up isn incredible there my body that knows that the conditions are changing and we more oxygen delivery more blood flow to cope so automatically i don about it i don body knows how to do that it just blows me away i these things then if you do things on a regular basis now the body gets so good at it that it anticipates you don up on the incline it observes and as soon as you get even close your heart rate goes up a little bit just in anticipation just to be ready if you do this and your body gets better at it then you start creating long term changes so now we days to months so one example is playing the guitar i love playing the guitar but the first time you pick it up or if you haven time you pick it up it really hurts it feels like your fingers are bleeding after just a few minutes but if you keep it up then after a few days or a couple of weeks just any amount of regular playing then your body puts down calluses changes the skin and it only changes it on one hand where you need it how smart is that if you go to the gym and if you put some tension on a muscle the body senses hey i use more strength in the future so it sends more protein to incorporate into more muscle fibers so it can get better it called muscle hypertrophy and the opposite is true as well because if you and you don muscles now the body says why should i put precious protein resources into building tissue that there so that working on your endurance now your body increases your blood distribution capacity it will make more blood capillaries it will increase your red blood cells to increase oxygen delivery it will up regulate enzymes involved in energy production it will increase the number of mitochondria so you can make more energy and use more oxygen there that the body improves to make you better at whatever you do and if you normally live at sea level but then you go for a couple of weeks maybe a vacation in the mountains now at altitude there is less oxygen in the air if there senses that it says i more red blood cells i need to increase my oxygen carrying capacity so i can keep delivering the same amount of oxygen even though there is less of it so your kidneys make hormone called epo or erythropoietin to make more red blood cells how smart is that bone is another interesting example because if you load up bone if you do weight-bearing exercise under the influence of gravity you and reinforce the bones whereas if you go out into space for any length of time then the body says well what do i need all these bones for because there gravity and nasa says that astronauts will lose one percent bone mass per month in weightlessness that times faster than a deconditioned elderly person and another adaptation is insulin resistance we talk a lot about metabolic health and insulin resistance on this channel because it related to weight loss and diabetes and so forth so if you have chronically high insulin your cells start to resist those high levels of insulin and the cells become insulin resistant and all of these are changes that you of that you can see changing day to day and if you were to eat once a day for 30 days then your body would make similar changes relevant to your metabolic function but if we only eat once a day one meal a day where are we gonna get the energy that the time that you have to eat breakfast to give you energy up until lunch you have to eat small frequent meals to keep your blood sugar up otherwise you become hypoglycemic and your energy tax well that doesn because the people who try eating one meal a day they actually find that they survive and they feel better so here how it actually works that you eat the food but that food that you just ate does not become energy right away there you glucose in the mouth you start absorbing just a tiny little trickle but the vast majority 98 or so of the food you ate is gonna become energy hours later so the way it works is the food that you just ate becomes a signal it tells the body hey we have some resources coming in you don hold on so tightly to the stores from before so the body starts breaking down some glycogen for blood glucose it starts breaking down some fat for energy so that we have some energy while this food is being processed and then in the next couple of hours you break down the food and after a few hours some of that food is used up as energy and a lot of it becomes stored as fat and carbohydrate those are the two primary storage forms of energy in the body protein can become energy but the body under normal conditions will spare the protein because it other things but now that we have stored the fat and the carbohydrate the whole idea would be to use up some fat and carbohydrate but what happens is we burn carbohydrate first especially if we eat many meals a day and especially if we eat high carb then we we first primarily and i that and why is the body going to burn the carbohydrate first why is it going to have a tendency to do that and there the first is that the body is very poor at storing carbohydrate the vast majority of energy stores in the body is going to be fat it storage form if you the obese side you might store about point four percent as carbohydrate if you carbohydrate but almost all your energy stores are going to be fat the other reason the body will burn carbs first is that high glucose levels are dangerous not short term not for hours or a few days or even weeks but if it goes on for years or decades that called diabetes and diabetes is the number one cause of blindness kidney failure neuropathy joint destruction heart disease high blood pressure all of those things are associated with high glucose so the body is going to do the best it can to bring this glucose down anytime it gets high and there ways that the body can reduce that glucose one is that it can burn it that first second it can try to store it but we already said that the carbohydrate stores fill up very quickly the body is very limited in the ability to store carbohydrate and the third thing it can do is to store fat so now we storing fat and carbohydrate but mostly burning the carbohydrate so how would we ever get in to burning the fat we have to eat less carbohydrate and or eat less often it powerful to eat less often so if you eat once a day one meal a day you go 20 24 hours without food your body has to get into burning that fat because it will burn through some of that carbohydrate and then it will switch it will transition to have a tendency to burn more and more fat the longer you go and now that i said all that i want you to listen very very carefully because these are not absolutes we want to think in tendencies and percentages rather than absolutes because the body always uses a mix of carbohydrate and fat always but the mix is different it carb or primarily fat and here want to think about it that depending on where you are on the insulin resistance on your metabolic health then you red side if you are a high carb diabetic person or if you metabolically healthy low carb person you you and you probably going to burn about 95 fat when you get into the fat burning zone because you to use fat primarily again you shifting your metabolic pathways but if you why don carbs why do you burn thirty to fifty percent fat because some of these carbs that we talked about they get converted into fat there transition of glucose becoming fat fat cannot become glucose it street one-way trip but glucose is always being transitioned being converted into fat and the more glucose we have and the more carbs you eat the more of that conversion is going to happen so portion of your energy is always going to be coming from fat even if you eat zero fat but who would not be a good candidate to eat one meal a day well if you are too thin if you are emaciated if you are scrawny if you have a really hard time putting on weight then you i don for very long i do it a couple of times a week because of convenience and i feel good doing that i don problem but if i eat one meal a day for a couple of weeks then i start losing too much weight it maintain that so if you you shouldn if you are pregnant or breastfeeding you are eating for two and that best time to experiment your body as you well know is crazy enough with everything going on so that you want to make changes if you are a small child or a growing child or teenager then that also is not the best time to make far reaching changes anything else well it would be any kind of condition if you have a digestive disorder if you have anything else going on where you feel you need more if your body isn those kind of changes just use your common sense so if you fit any of these does that mean you have to eat six times a day no i would recommend that you for most people you can safely eat two to three times a day in a six to eight hour period and if you eat good solid foods with a good mix of meat vegetables and fat then you nutrients to fill you up and sustain you so now that you understand the physiology of change and you know that you can do this what if you eat once a day for 30 days you will probably get some hunger and some discomfort and if you are a carb addict if you eating six times a day you might have more discomfort if you healthy you might have very slight discomfort but the key to understand here is that it adapts physiologically very very quickly so we your body will be on track with your new habits and what you find then is you actually have less hunger because now you taught your body to burn fat you taught your body to use the reserves more efficiently and they often say that it takes 21 days to change a habit and i don i think it you go 30 days then you plus a little bit of extra which means that you have probably created a new habit you have rewired your nervous system this is what your body expects now and it becomes easier and easier to maintain it one of the most important changes you will probably see is a change in blood glucose and insulin they will both have a tendency to drop and they are related to something called syndrome x or metabolic syndrome and that of degenerative disease chronic degenerative disease like type 2 diabetes high blood pressure cardiovascular disease stroke they all part of metabolic syndrome and if you eat once a day for 30 days you will start healing your metabolism you start teaching your body better metabolic habits you will learn how to start using some of those stores and you will be dramatically reducing your risk of chronic degenerative disease a lot of people will also start losing weight some people with the most stubborn weight may not see this immediately but 80 90 percent of people will probably have a significant weight loss and then we get into some of the quality of life you will find that it savings if you a day it doesn can also increase the quality of your food you have time to create a gourmet meal every day basically because you only going to eat once you can take the time to do that you metabolic health is improving now you start burning some fat stores your energy becomes more stable you not dependent on topping off your blood sugar every couple of hours your mood improves your energy is much more stable and because of this you also find that you have more freedom because your life no longer revolves around a feeding schedule you don your entire life around where am i going to find food if you get to food you eat if you don anyway so let day for 30 days then what well it kind of depends on where you are what were your aspirations what did you hope to accomplish by doing this if you around with some other things but if you still have some ways to go then you keep it up you do another 30 days and another 30 days and so forth and there changing it up a little bit but by now you adapted it meal a day however if your weight is very stubborn or if your blood glucose or if you really stubborn it won now what can break that plateau is to add some longer fasts so if you are used to eating one meal a day if you but you then it day entirely and by the time you wake up the next morning you least 36 hours and then if you make it to lunch you have 42 hours so doing these little bit longer fasts can typically break those plateaus and get you much deeper into that fat burning so let one or more 30 day periods with this and now you have reached a good weight or a good blood glucose or you reversed your type 2 diabetes or your cholesterol values then what is you start playing around with it so now for some people they fine eating one meal a day like i said for myself i have a hard time maintaining my ideal weight i get too skinny so i like to increase and i eat two or three times a day in a six to eight hour period so this is going to be different for different people just play around with it and see what works for you and then from time to time you watch this video again because every time you and say i am the way i am you scratch that thought and you remind yourself that i am the way i recreate myself moment to moment change is inevitable change is easy if you change it to something that you be if you enjoyed this video you going to love that one and if you truly want

A simple tip to stop sugar/sweet cravings | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9x869P2bOQ	Dr Pal	the main reason for sugar Cravings is your bad bacteria in the gut let me explain my case your own bad bacteria in your gut love sugar and it will make you crave for sweets whenever it is hungry the trick is whenever your bad bacteria is craving for sweets you have to give him something like a spy which satisfies their hunger under the same time destroys them the Spy which is going to play along with the bad bacteria initially or our fruits with a low glycemic index like pears apples oranges and all berries like strawberry raspberry and blackberry similar to Baton and tiger and Yash raw spy Universe Berry can be included as well they provide the sugar just enough for the bad bacteria to satisfy their hunger at the same time provide lots of fiber to promote the good bacteria thereby decreasing the bad bacterial content so choose fruits each and every time you crave for sweets bad bacteria loves my friends around okuma it looks like a sweet stall with different variety of sweets stacked in an orderly fashion that bacteria can choose 100 grams in all sweets	Success
Prolonged Fasting Not Needed 4 Fat Loss, Longevity, Study Finds	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sdd5vKoEX2A	Dr Pal	when it comes to fasting how long do you need to fast to induce levels of autophagy support longevity and decrease inflammation well it recently published study in 25 individuals found that just 30 days of Ramadan fasting that is fasting for 17 to 19 hours per day led to significant improvements in levels of autophagy and I think this is the most important finding of the study an increase in a tumor suppressor protein known as p53 we about that today and changes in cellular senescence we know that age cells become senescent they release this senescence Associated secretory phenotype which recruit other cells to become sort of malevolent and release inflammatory biomarkers so what this study found is just 30 days one month and it 17 to 19 hours of fasting led to all these significant improvements that support longevity metabolic health and aging so let think the study is quite fasting the title here is the effect of prolonged intermittent fasting on autophagy inflammasome and senescent Gene Expressions an exploratory study in human young males so investigators in Germany say in conclusion we demonstrate an apparently healthy males who engage in a one-month Ramadan fasting that prolonged intermittent fasting May induce autophagy reducing inflammatory cytokine known as tnf Alpha and reduced senescent markers prolonged if upregulates the expression of nlrp3 and look in One beta but not this inflammasome ASC element and also our study exhibits Dynamic changes in autophagy inflammation and how senescence expression at time Point Manner and how these genes might play a role in the expression of other Pathways they say further studies are warranted to understand how intermittent fasting influences these genes and how every Gene affects every other but since our study was conducted in normal healthy adults future cohort studies are needed to elucidate how intermittent fasting affects overall lifespan and the incidence of diseases in all sorts of different people essentially what these investigators did is they looked at different inflammasome and autophagy related biomarkers one week before the fasting protocol two weeks after the fasting protocol started at the end of the fasting that is the 30-day fasting protocol and one week after fasting ended and as you can see on this image this is figure six here you see autophagy significantly increases throughout the month you also see levels of the inflammasome the inflammasome is basically an inflammatory Hub that when activated will release nuclear Factor Kappa beta and interleukin-6 and all the bad inflammatory cytokines so you see favorable changes within this inflammasome Hub and a decrease in the nlrp3 which is the activator of this inflammasome Hub over time and also you see a decrease overall in senescence Associated signaling molecules now I know senescence is kind of a big word I sort of defined it earlier but essentially senescent cells are aged they should apoptos and die but they don cells is when they accumulate they recruit other normal cells to behave like senescent cells and so if you can Purge these cells with exercise or potentially intermittent fasting you can expect to age more gracefully so let get into p53 I think this is quite fascinating this is the tumor suppressor protein known as p53 and I want to share with you why this is so important because it helps repair DNA damage that might initiate the onset of a tumor or formation of cancer but before we do as always friends I just want to thank you for being here as always I for your comments your likes your shares if you share this as a text message with a friend so that they can get access to this Cutting Edge information and help to modify their lifestyle start to make intermittent fasting and lifestyle not just something that they do once a year now if you accelerate your fast we berberine fasting accelerator over at myoscience this is a great tool to help kick start your fast remember time point zero of fasting is after your last meal so if you want to accelerate the metabolic physiology that that is linked with fasting try taking the berberine fasting Excel generator two to three capsules around dinner time or shortly after your last meal you can test this with a keto meter it will increase your ketones it starts to kick start your fast and it might also help curb those evening food cravings for cookies ice creams and sweets that can derail your body composition goals and your metabolic Health you can save over at myoscience.com that myoxciend.com myoscience.com check out the berberine fasting accelerator use the code podcast to save so what big deal about this tumor suppressor protein p53 well we know that cancer is the second leading cause of preventable death we know that close to 600 000 people die from cancer every year and when a study finds that fasting just Ramadan fasting not doing anything extensive or aggressive 17 to 19 hours fasting for just 30 days can significantly increase the genetic expression that will increase p53 so we know p53 is a stress response transcription factor that can induce cell cycle arrest by activating p53 it can lead to several cellular changes such as DNA repair prevention of senescence and apoptosis contributing to reduce arthrogenic risk and the total number of atherogenic particles as well so it also plays a role in metabolic health and LDL oxidation so as you can see with figure 5 you see a significant increase in p53 at time point three which was just after 30 days of the intermittent fasting protocol again 17 to 19 hours per day of no food feeding between a six and seven hour window so I think that is the most exciting because we know that cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of mortality we know that p53 is involved in lipoprotein metabolism in the formation of metabolic health and also helping to prevent DNA damage and this is particularly important for people who have an occupation that is linked potentially with increased rates of DNA damage shift workers people who work the graveyard shift people who are X-ray or Radiology techs or doctors and things like that and even flight attendants with ionizing radiation fasting could be a nice way to mitigate the potential risks of your occupation now for a lot of people myself included I enhancing autophagy we know autophagy has tissue specific benefits particularly in the liver in the brain decreasing the formation of protein adducts in the brain and fat in the liver well there regular intermittent fasting increases autophagy initiation proteins and so that three you see the messenger RNA expression of what there related genes atg one atg2 atg5 and what you see here is after 30 days of regular intermittent fasting remember this is not a seven day fast a 14 day fast this is just something that is attainable for most people not eating for 17 hours a day is achievable for a lot of you well guess what there is a more than two-fold expression in the autophagy initiation proteins and the autophagy inhibitor protein as well which is known as the ulk one and so again we see it from both sides the inhibition of autophagy is reduced and the enhancement of autophagy is expressed just with consistent intermittent fasting and I think that the take home here because people are like well I want to enhance autophagy so therefore I need to fast for two weeks or I need to do a five day fast well not according to the literature in this study again this was a unique study there study in June of 2019 that found when people do a 16-8 fast pair with exercise there was a significant increase in the messenger RNA that enhanced autophagy and now we have this study as well so we have several studies that confirm this and I will mention that people who regularly exercise generally have a greater increase in fasting Associated autophagy initiation proteins like hg5 so if you from your regular intermittent fast whether it what what have you if you also exercise you will induce these autophagy Associated initiation proteins more readily one study looked at a 36 hour fast in sedentary overweight people versus fit healthy people and after just 36 hours there was a significant increase in the autophagy initiation proteins in the fit people compared to the sedentary people so remember fasting is good intermittent fasting is clearly healthy as we can see from these this study but also exercise helps complement this you know like in the movie Forrest Gump you know fasting and exercise are like you know peas and carrots they work synergistically they work together so I think this is really important again in conclusion if you want to support autophagy the pathways linked with longevity you don five day fast and and be very aggressive with that we know that if your body fat is quite low when you do these long duration fasts the expense link with that could be catabolism of lean mass and lean mass loss as we in the last several weeks is actually linked with increased risk for cardiovascular disease some people who lose weight quickly actually have an increase in cardiovascular disease because of loss of lean tissue so I think this is exciting I think you think it what you think in the comments and I would love to hear from you so and also I below so please share this article with your friends who are you know curious about preventing cancer heart disease or metabolic health and improving their body composition we future episode down the road thanks for tuning in bye now	Success

How to lose belly fat NATURALLY without complex dieting | DAWN - DUSK method to BURN fat	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaWkHQMNNZg	Dr Pal	hello guys this is uh dr palin manikam in this video we are going to talk about why many people can though core would cause mass destruction it increased the mass of an individual person by increasing the belly size if you take a picture from space it looks like as if the earth is pregnant and sun is throwing a baby shiver by saying congratulations you my friend sarah no kumar is like thank god the virus is gone there is no big problem i said the bigger problem is the size of your belly it looks as if it is a ticking time bomb ready to be exploded in three minutes the only problem is to defuse the bomb we cannot throw just the belly portion alone into the well we need to throw the whole body how do you know that you are like my friend sarah nakamura i want you guys to be a tailor for few seconds take an inch tape measure around the belly button if the size is more than 80 centimeters for women and more than 90 centimeters in men congratulations this video is tailor made for you so the inch tape should be around the belly button and not at the place where your pants on it is above it please make sure that you do this the first thing in the morning do not have any clothes on and most importantly do not inhere like this please exhale nobody is taking you for a police interview please be honest to yourself don involve your mom if your mom is like my mom she what you have one zero two centimeters you thin there wrong put it as 92 centimeters if you meet any of these criteria you need to take the action right now you cannot postpone things abdominal obesity increases the risk of heart disease diabetes stroke and more importantly if you get covered the risk of complications is even higher as i mentioned before obesity can also cause cancer and cancer will kill you so please take that action right no please do not postpone things this is not like our final exams where we can postpone things till the last minute at least in the exam we could write something to fill up the paper in the last minute if you get a heart attack that is your last minute no time to do push-ups at that time because your heart is doing push-ups at that time to decrease the belly fat you need to understand how belly fat is formed i have explained this in detail on my previous two videos i have mentioned that link in the description in short there are only two ways to get belly fat number one if you eat more than what you should most of the times if you eat yummy you will get a tummy as i have mentioned before i was obese before there were two reasons for it mainly my mom and my wife my mom was like my wife is like the second reason for belly fat is if you eat food at the wrong time i asked my friend sarah kumar what time do you eat he is like i will eat whenever my heart tells me to am i a btv symbol jesse justin situation so to decrease belly fat you need to control any of the two factors the first factor of eating more than what you should is very difficult to control right away it requires a lot of willpower but the second factor is easy to be focused upon regarding the time that you are eating why this is important because similar to us where we sleep at night and then gets recharged and then wake up in the morning all our hormones do the same thing as well they have a particular sleep period they have a particular wake-up period for example growth hormone which is a repair hormone which increases the growth of the body not the horizontal growth the vertical growth of the body is secreted only at night insulin which is a hormone which decreases fat and builds up the body is secreted during the day when there is sunlight and when people are active growth hormone is like batman who repairs the city of gotham at night insulin is like a superman who flies from one side to other during the day when there is sunlight insulin is secreted by pancreas and it is the most important hormone when you eat glucose or carbohydrate rich foods to convert the glucose molecules to energy you need insulin to be at its hundred percent quality whenever the load is heavy especially after an indian get together but think about it insulin is very tired after being worked out during the day and after sunset it is going to take some rest but most of the indian get-togethers happen only after sunset and when you eat something after sunset it is like making the insulin up you are asking insulin to wake up like the anjali movie indranjali insulin is like a government employee who works from 8 00 am to 5 p.m if you make it work like an i.t employee you will not get the best out of it you will find all these emails which says please find attachments but there attachments not only insulin usually all eating hormones dies down after sunset and the quality goes down significantly if we wake them up it length pant at a 50 discount of low quality and after washing this full pan becomes half pant so if you eat a gulab jamun after sunset initially the insulin will be like that but in due course of time it will try to cut corners and will digest only half of the gulab jamun and the remaining half it will park in your belly after a while there will be no space in the belly to store the fat so fat will migrate into heart liver and brain causing heart attack imagine the gulab jamun that you ate travel all the way from the belly into the blood vessels of your heart blocking the circulation completely the gulab jamun that you ate looks very good right now but on the here is what you should do first you need to understand what is your eating pattern and the timing of your eating so please take a notepad maybe in your phone and write down the first bite or drink that you are taking in the day for example if you wake up around like 7 a.m and drinks a coffee at 7 30 a.m then 7 30 a.m will be your first bite anything other than water is considered as first bite preferable to avoid black coffee as well if you absolutely like black coffee that anything other than water like adding lemon in the water adding vodka in the water all that is considered as first bite similarly towards the end of the day when you have your last bite or drink that will be considered as the end of your eating period for example if your last drink is around like 8 p.m let then 8 p.m will be considered as your last end of the eating period so from 8 a.m to 8 p.m would be a 12 hour eating period more importantly you should time the eating period with sunrise and sunset your eating period cannot go beyond 12 hours if you want the best results it is best to stick to an eating period of eight hours between the sunrise and sunset so what i do is i eat my first drink or bite at around like 7 a.m in the morning where the sun rises and then finish my dinner around like 5 30 6 p.m where the sun sets eating period will be like a pt period where the time runs very fast but the fasting period will test your patience like the history period after sunset similar to the world war that we learned in history class there will be a war called battle of food that runs in your mind between gulab jamun and water choose water or else you will become a history but if you keep eating gulab jamun even after sunsets insulin will be loyal to you like kattappa you might think that knee and uddamalia or gulab jamun in piracy insulin but instead of killing the gulab jamun the insulin might kill you as i have mentioned many times before being aware of the problem is the first step towards any solution so please document your eating period starting from your first bite to last bite and please write down in the comment section regarding the exact timing for example you wake up at 9 00 a.m and have your first drink around like 9 30 please write down 9 30 a.m and let you drink a glass of milk at 10 pm before you go to bed right 10 p.m so your eating period is between 9 30 a.m and 10 p.m and i want that in the comment section so that i can reply to each and every one of you to see how you can decrease this eating period to promote belly fat loss in future videos we will talk about solutions to tackle this problem but first of all you should know that there is a problem [Music]

TIPS for a SECRET method for weight loss ( long term )	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXKAE1zwhYA	Dr Pal	hello guys this is dr palani manikam in the previous video we talked about this time restricted eating like eating your dinner before sunset i was completely surprised that 90 of the comments the average time period was around 10 p.m i was thinking around like 8 30 or 9 but 10 p.m that no wonder india is the next diabetic capital of the world after seeing my video my friend sarah nakamura called me and say day pal your method is too long da i saw a video on youtube it says how to lose belly fat in three days by holding your breath like this three days ago don bypass anything you will end up getting a bypass surgery [Music] hearty congratulations to everybody who reviewed their eating period and wrote down the exact number of hours of eating period in the comment section that is the first step in this long journey being aware of the problem i started like that as well in this video i going to discuss about the practical problems that i faced when i started adopting this technique as you all know i was weighing 200 pounds before i was obese when i started to incorporate this lifestyle i moved my dinner time from 9 pm to 8 pm that small change look as if i thing in my life everything surrounding me looked like food to me if somebody says good morning it sounded like food morning to me if i see an aloe vera juice it sounded like aloo parotta so the first main problem that i had was i started feeling like hunger after moving this dinner time earlier the main problem was i was confusing thirst with hunger there is just a fine line between thirst and hunger if you choose food over water this thin line will become a thick line on your waist you should stand on the side of thirst and tell hunger that in the courthouse my mom used to say before eating don will not be able to eat properly the exact same concept can be applied here as well during the first two weeks i woke up in the middle of the night with hunger like failing i started drinking water and i went to sleep right back actually the sleep quality eventually got better the only major problem was because i was drinking so much water i was urinating more often i have to wake up in the middle of the night one or two times to use the bathroom but it got better eventually as well once my body got used to it my friend sarah no kumar is like i can use the bathroom that often i don time da abra usain bolt the second mistake i did was i thought i will be hungry in the middle of the night so i used to have a very heavy dinner as my last meal to a point that there even a single rice will be spilled over the ants in my house migrated to my neighbor we don the night as a matter of fact usually we have been eating more than what we need if you move the heavy dinner to breakfast and lunch and have a light dinner so that you will have a better outcome we are not camel that we need to store the food for the night as a matter of fact we have more food in the body too that will cover the entire lifespan of a camel my friend sarah no kumar is like what happens if a kid wakes up in the middle of the night hungry i was like this concept applies to all ages and wait a minute you don all and he was like and the call and they ain lock the front door before we go to sleep it is better to lock the refrigerator as well my friend sarah nakumar key on the top of a treadmill so that even if he wakes up in the middle of the night that is the last place that he will go the biggest problem is we cannot do this ourselves we need to change the mindset of the family and community surrounding us for example for indian culture we always had late dinner around like 8 p.m or 9 p.m usually at 5 p.m or 6 p.m my mom used to give me snakes snacks [Music] the fat from all the snacks that i had is coil around like snakes inside my belly even when i changed it was very difficult for my wife to come on board with this concept because she used to eat chips and soda in the middle of the night and wake up in the morning with abdominal bloating and check her pregnancy test and tells me that it is negative again so it will take time please take time to educate your friends family members so that everybody is on board this is the real investment that you are doing for any investment you need to have a family decision only then the outcome will be good if you invest on your health i can guarantee you that your long term outcome will be excellent the fourth problem is after changing the mindset of your immediate family members then you need to change the community mindset because most of our indian get-togethers happen only after sunset even if you decide not to eat anything during the get-together they will tempt you with so many varieties under the sun sorry under the moon in all these parties the main goal is to impress the guest with all the varieties possible they think that more the varieties the more impressed the guests are they don impressed their heart is getting compressed and they are getting depressed don the problem is you cannot say no to these get togethers even if you ask them to move the function a little bit earlier they will be like orna let us after korean so what i do is before going to these get togethers i eat my dinner at home so that i will not be hungry over there and i do is i will take my lunch box with me and pack all the varieties as much as possible so that i can eat it the next day my friend sarah no kumar brings a big different box it looks like a leaning tower of pisa and he fills all the floors with chicken leg pizza another main problem is the work hours sometimes we work late in the hospital and when we come back home around like 10 11 pm we are so hungry that we don care about the time we start eating right away so later i decided to plan for the day as a family instead of asking what are we going to eat for dinner we decided to ask when are we going to eat our dinner if i expect to come home late the next day i used to pack my lunch and dinner in the morning and then take it along with me to the hospital and if i the dinner right in the hospital my friend saran kumar is like day pal if i pack my dinner in the morning it gets so cold in the evening for dinner i was like please get an insulator lunch box if not insulin will put you inside the box the most common question that i get from my patients when i explain this to them is that what if i have acidity i had acidity as well can you imagine a gastroenterologist having acidity that is what we call job guarantee it took six weeks for me to reset and then i did not have any problem at all imagine you are making a big lifestyle change it is a shock to your body it going to take some time to reset your body is saying a pretty shock item my stomach has burnt so many times all these years on seeing people having flat stomach for six weeks it doesn anymore the other question that i get asked is what if i worker you know many patients work from 7 p.m to 7 a.m the exact same concept works for you as well as soon as you finish your shift you start eating you go to bed and then you wake up around like 3 30 4 and try to eat again to stick to this 8 hour 2 10 hour or 12 hour window from sunrise to sunset and i guarantee you that you will not feel hungry overnight when you are working i was asking my friend saram nakamura out of smoking drinking and eating late at night which are you going to stop he is like i going to stop your friendship insulin and and some of my friends ask me day pal if the sun sets before 4 pm in certain countries what will you do even if you are in the moon you have to eat before sunset the other question is can this concept be applied for breastfeeding mothers that is a common misconception that breastfeeding moms require more calories than needed that is not true they just require 300 more calories per day than the normal requirement they don lot my wife was like when she was pregnant used to tell me okay i used to do a podcast session with a baby bum i would be like time restricted feeding should not eat more than 7 p.m and my wife is like ice cream and i want no matter belly fat has to be taken seriously especially for indians because body mass index will not tell you anything at all normal body mass index is 24.9 for indians it has come down to body mass index of 23. even if you look thin if your weight circumference is more than 80 centimeters for women and more than 90 centimeters in men you are slowly creeping towards obesity your body is like your salary and your belly is like your debt if your debt is more than the salary all the loaners like hypertension diabetes heart disease will come and look out for you unfortunately you cannot even hide because your belly will get you caught my friend sarah no kumar is like day pal life is very short i the life to the flesh by eating whatever i want i was like you can eat but god will wash his hands off see everybody is going to die one day or the other the point is not to prolong your life with this technique it is just that whatever life we have we can live the life to the fullest without visiting hospitals without taking any medication so that the quality of life is much much better even if it is a short life especially if you have young kids it is absolutely important whether you like it or not to live until they turn 18 it is your damn responsibility i cannot see one more gofundme page with people raising funds for those kids who have been left behind again i repeat if your waist circumference is more than 90 centimeters in men more than 80 centimeters in women it is absolutely important to take action right now if you don purity so after seeing this video if you decide to change i want to know why i want to know the reason behind your change please write down in the comment section why do you want to change stay tuned for future videos on how to tackle this belly fat one belly at a time it is absolutely important [Music] you	Success
5 steps to get STARTED with intermittent fasting for weight loss | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wQrjPlgc0	Dr Pal	hello guys this is a doctor palin panmanika in this video we talk about how anyone can follow time restricted feeding it is a golden method and more importantly a free method of weight loss i by step where you can start how you can start and how you can accelerate your weight loss no matter what stage or you went so it is a five step learning process i myself struggle with discipline with step number three let dive deep into it so in our channel i have posted success stories of patients these patients i have not even seen them before all they did was they watch my youtube video and follow this simple and effective method and they lost close to 20 to 30 pounds which is absolutely amazing it is such a simple safe and an effective method why does this method work because we are taking our body to a state where it is ideally supposed to be based on our god nithyananda state that is a different state so let when you wake up your insulin wakes up along with you reaches the peak around 2 3 p.m in the afternoon and dies down after sunset and when you start eating along with the insulin cycle and if you stop eating after sunset miracles will happen including your weight loss so insulin is like a bank which is open from 8 am to 6 pm you can deposit food only during this time if you try to deposit food in any other time it doesn checking account it gets deposited into your fat account for which diabetes might be the interest which you might not be interested in so once insulin goes to sleep the night worker the night shift worker growth hormone comes in and repairs all the damages that you have done throughout the day and makes insulin get well rester and insulin is back again in the morning with a fresh vigor to treat you accordingly growth hormone is telling to incident in the null indiana lager in new york so this is like tuning your car your car once was driving at 100 kilometers per hour but now it is not even going beyond 60 kilometers an hour it needs some rest you need to find the unit you need to take care of it so my friend sarah kumar doesn looks like karagata karan and he always tunes to the frequency in the fm station proportional to his weight initially it was 98.3 now it is one zero five point eight it is radio mirchi sema wait muchi so what is the biggest advantage of this method that you really don on the food content initially while you are setting up your eating window if you eat healthy food the outcome is going to be faster and better but if you eat unhealthy food at least your hormones will forgive you because you are giving time to rest overnight so that they can be fresh for you in the day even though the hormones know that you are going to beat it up to the maximum during day time your hormones forgive you like a jesus and during night time your hormones act as ramana vijaya gana kulupu in tamil napudia the main reason this method works is it is much much easier compared to all the other methods of weight loss it might be even better if you open youtube there are thousands of videos how to lose your belly fat in three minutes three seconds three months one video is saying if you eat this one drink your belly will become like puja hectare the matter puja another video is saying look at this drink your belly will shrink any nope the best method is my friend sarah nakamura group photo he shrinks his belly waits for the flash to be gone and then he releases it to an extent that the belt strap goes to the next hole so who should not follow this method anybody from eight six years to sixty years can follow this method i label this as chennai cells method if you go to the chennai cell which is a huge departmental store in chennai you get dresses for everybody from six to sixty years old is exactly the same method everybody can adopt it since i said chennai sales method my wife is asking for adi talabadi discount during the fasting window so if you look at it the time difference between sunset and sunrise is usually around 12 hours which is a very very minimum and a reasonable fasting window it doesn effort on anybody including pregnant women and children only when you extend the fast to more than 16 hours then there might be some kind of issues but usually this is a very simple and effective method if you can start with a 12 hour fasting window so my wife when she was pregnant she used to have this concept of time restricted ordering she orders ice cream late at night when i said no she was like emotional blackmailing me that you are torturing the papa i said i don become a peeper even patients with diabetes can follow this method safely and effectively under a monitored setting there is a popular misconception that if you fat your blood sugar levels will go down which is absolutely not true because your body has all the compensatory mechanisms including glucose from the liver to pitch in if absolutely needed my uncle who was a diabetic was always concerned about whether his sugar levels are low he was so much concerned that he was keeping his diabetic medications in an adayah on the bourbon sweet box so i tell you five steps to follow this simple method step one you need to determine your eating window as soon as you wake up when you bite either it could be a coffee or it is a breakfast you have to look at your watch and note down the time then you have to figure out your last bite just before going to bed what is your last bite so you need to calculate the difference for example if you have a coffee with milk or sugar in the morning at 7 00 a.m that is your first bite let milk before going to bed at 10 pm then that is your last bite the difference between 7 a.m and 10 p.m is going to be close to 15 hours and that is your eating window so my friend saranac has tough time in calculating this eating window because he says that i drink a milk right before going to bed and i wake up hungry two hours after and i have to eat the chocolate how do i calculate my eating window i said the only window that will work for you is to install a window right next to your belly and then open it after you eat so common question i get is is it okay to have coffee ideally speaking to follow this method it has to be nothing other than water but if it is helping you to create a habit black coffee and green tea is okay but it cannot be with sugar or cream or any other added ingredient one of my patients asked me is it okay to taste the food because she is cooking food for her husband the problem is even though it is a tiny teeny ingredient it is more than enough to trigger the hormonal cascade because your hormones are so powerful so the answer is ideally no so an easier solution is to ask your husband to cook the food and when he taste it he will definitely realize that fasting is a better option so step two is you need to stick to a eating window of minimum of 12 hours let your eating window is 15 hours you need to decrease that to minimum of 12 hours let hours to start with you still have room to decrease to 30 minutes less to start with and you can slowly do this to a maximum of eight hour eating window pay attention to this you need to decrease your eating window and not your fasting window one of my patient actually decreased 30 minutes not in his body clock but on the wall clock step 3 consistency more than the duration of the eating window consistency of the eating window is the key if you can do 12 hours of eating window every day for 30 days that is much better than doing eight hour eating window for three days we want you to be like rahul dravid for consistency and not rishabh pant and step four which is the most important advantage of this method is you don have to focus too much on the content of the foot to start with once it becomes a habit you will notice that you are losing weight at that point of time you yourself will get motivated to focus on the healthy portion of the eating window so as soon as i said that my friend saranac started eating one chicken biryani at sunrise one chicken biryani between sunrise and sunset and another chicken biryani and sunset he ate so much you can biryani that there is not even a single hand left in the community to wake us up in the morning so you can go overboard like this you have to be a little bit reasonable but you don to focus too much on the quality of the foot initially until this becomes a habit so next one is step five the most important step because this is where your patience will come to play you need patience for this method to work out rome was not built in a day neither was your belly fat it was a long effort that you have put so far it will take the same amount of effort to get the belly fat reduced it depends upon how much intense that you are i can guarantee you that your belly fat will reduce based on the amount of effort you put in the more effort you put in by decreasing your eating window the more outcome that you will see i guarantee you this it is like a bank you just get the interest for the amount of money that you put in you cannot expect interest for other people kingfisher airline so you can fly to london so some patients might get the outcome within three weeks some patients might take three months the key thing is consistency and i guarantee you this will work and throughout this five steps the other most common question that i get is is it okay to take medications usually yes but discuss with your physician because sometimes medications has to be taken along with the food one of my patients asked me is it okay to take syrup during the fasting window i said as long as there is no sugar it is totally okay he said except for sugar everything else is added to this syrup it syrup so how will you feel in the first two to three weeks very very miserable you will feel dizzy you will feel hungry you will not be yourself you will be like chantham yodhika you will hate me to the core to a point that you will say that if i get dr pal in my hand i will break out his pulp hang in there it is going to take some time if you are noticing some changes it is actually good that your body is responding to this method but you should be absolutely happy that this method is going to work key thing is consistency bite the bullet get the six weeks across and once it becomes a habit it is going to be super easy the problem is these habits have been built up for a long time for example when i grew up my mom used to give a big glass of milk before going to bed maybe that is why i became dr paul now so when you the body your body is going into a shock which will take some time to recover on its own to the new streamline process which is how it is supposed to be the biggest tip that i can give you is have a water bottle in handy take that damn water bottle wherever you go to the restroom to the kitchen to the operating room i don method will work if you follow this daily for three months without even a single break on a single day if that doesn from dr

stroke and heart disease this video is mainly for people whose body mass index is more than 25 and if you are an indian forget about the body mass index and measure your base circumference i have shown in this video how to measure your waist circumference if you are a man and if the waist circumference is more than 90 centimeters and if you are a woman and if the waist circumference is more than 80 centimeters then this is a video for you to have a simple tip that you can start doing from today [Music] during covert 19 times it was not the people who worked hard at home it who worked so hard not to pop out because of the increasing size i kinds of diet like vegan diet low carb diet polio diet paleo diet what you eat matters but more importantly when you eat matters as well you know one of my friends says that hey pal i and i eat it what you to focus on two windows one is eating window and the other one is fasting window eating windows a time difference between your first bite or drink when you wake up in the morning and the last bite or drink before you go to bed fasting window is your overnight fasting so anything other than water is not considered fasting for example you drink your coffee at 7am in the morning and if your last bite during your dinner is around like 8pm then the eating window is between 7am and 8pm which is 13 hours and your fasting window would be 11 hours so the last bite does not limit only to your dinner you know any late night snacks or ice cream before you go to bed the cookie that you steal from your kid before go to bed all those considers last bite anything besides water is considered as last bite so what i want you to do is to create a 12 hour eating window for example your first bite or drink is at 8 a.m you can have your last bite or drink at 8 pm and nothing after that just water so that you have an eating window from 8 a.m to 8 p.m and then a fasting window from 8 pm to 8 am so there hour fasting window if you can decrease your 12 hour eating window to like 10 hours or even 8 hours kudos to you but at least start with 12 hour eating window and then you window overnight if you do that what will happen is during the fasting window your body will work so hard to repair all the damages and the abuses that you have done to your body in the morning if our body actually lodges a complaint to the police station regarding the abuse that we are doing to it we would be locked in jail forever personally this is the most important and serious form of domestic abuse nobody is ever talking about so what happens during the 12 hour overnight fasting window is we are not feeding regularly so the cells will be starving for sugar eventually and then it has to work harder to extract energy from fat that is the first step of weight loss so with this method we are also taking an advantage of the hormonal fluctuation that happens during the 24 hour period we call that as a circadian rhythm certain hormones get secreted at certain times in general as soon as the sun sets when the light goes down the building hormones in the body goes down as well and the repair hormones goes up so if you keep on feeding the body after the sun sets the hormone secreted might be ineffective and also of poor quality so there is a reason why fasting has been a part of rituals in most of the religions you know my mom is very religious and she fast all the time she thinks that the more she fast the more rigorous she is she can impress the god so that she can get blessings from the god actually god is working inside the body when she is starving so that she can repair her own cells to prevent cancers to prevent future diseases when facebook asked you to share the picture that you took last year as a memory the picture really looks as it is a distant remote memory of us so the problem is with our busy lifestyle and easy availability of food it is very difficult to maintain this fasting window we keep feeding ourselves we eat like four times a day six times a day even like eight times a day it is almost similar to the mom who keeps feeding the already obese kid and then she tells me that yes this 18 fasting window concept is being backed by science as well so what researchers did was they took two groups of mice and they gave the exact same food the only difference is the first group of mice they can eat whenever they want to throughout the day in the second group of mice they have to stick to it eight hour or 12 hour window so in four weeks what happened was the mice which was eating throughout the day multiple times turned out to be obese started having high blood pressure turned out to have heart disease but the mice who was eating in a specific eating window turned out to be much healthier in the five-week period so i this because this is a such a simple step that you can do you don have to be creative all you have to do is to stick to a consistent eating window schedule um this is not involving any diet at least to start with you can eat whatever you want and then stick to this particular window and once you get into that mode then we can talk more about eating healthy in between that window my friend was like pal i know all this this is intermittent fasting right when i eat at 8 p.m i only eat at 10 pm after that die that is not intermittent fasting that is intermittently fasting when you start this new routine of sticking to a eating window you are going to be hungry when you are fasting overnight just give it one week time your body will get used to it so call for action the first step i want you to do is to look into your lifestyle and then see what is your current eating window remember the first bite or drink when you wake up in the morning and then the last bite or drink before you go to bed this will include the popcorn that you are eating during a late night movie or if you have an argument with your wife and to calm you down you a late night snack or an ice cream son but anyways besides water everything else is considered as the last bite and you need to calculate the time difference accordingly second let like 14 hours for example you drink at 7 a.m and your last bite is around like 9 p.m then you have a 14 hour eating window then your next step is to decrease to a 12 hour window if you window please decrease it to 10 hour eating window and remember this takes time so you have to at least allow six weeks to notice some changes in your body so one of my patient was like dr pal i nothing is happening i was like did you have the same question when you are gaining weight did the weight gained over two weeks or two months or two years so it is going to take some time as i said before you don too much about what you are eating in between this eating window to start with but if you eat healthy the advantages are much more so at least to start with stick to this eating window and then don eating at this time so while we were busy socially distancing ourselves for the last year our belly button started socially distancing from us so it is high time that we bring it back closer to us don closer love your belly button the belly will love you more so in the comment section please write your waste circumference or body mass index and your current eating window period what time do you start eating and what time do you stop eating and i will reply to that comment so that we both can agree to a specific eating window period so that you can stick to it so every lifestyle change is successful when you have a person to be accountable for i will be the person for you so once we finalize the eating period for you in that comment you keep me posted by replying to that comment every week to see whether you are able to stick to that specific eating period in future videos we are going to see more tips and tricks to make this process efficient but the bottom line is to maintain that eating window and the fasting window as comfortable as possible remember if your belly is slim like a jelly then your life will be jolly illati life kali i hope you take this very seriously even if one person changes his lifestyle and gets benefit out of this intervention i will see you in the next video bye	Success
How to eat BIRYANI healthily ? | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Z6ty4gHhrA	Dr Pal	hello guys this is uh Dr palna parmanikam in this video we talk about how everybody Biryani can be actually dangerous to your liver and can sometimes even cause liver cancer we we can eat Biryani in a very healthy way let [Music] my friends are saying me and my friends are truly treated Biryani as an emotion until I started seeing few patients in which the liver was completely shut down so what is the relationship between Biryani and liver I flavor artificial ingredient that they add in the Biryani that is entirely different story I regular restaurant made Biryani or even homemade Biryani to further understand this you need to understand what are the ingredients of a regular Biryani yes it usually contains basmati rice oil cashews vegetables chicken yogurt mint leaves and other spices the main culprit here is the rice and oil too much of basmati rice is not nice and the more you put oil the less your oil will be let me explain why let plate of of chicken biryani in a restaurant the amount of rice even in the smallest plate would be easily two to three cups because most of the restaurants are trying to cut the cost down by putting more rice than the chicken so one cup of cooked basmati rice will come around 200 calories so if you calculate for two to three cups it easily 500 calories approximately if you are in an Indian Restaurant buffet forget about it we will refill our plate 15 times for the 15 dollars that we have paid so if you calculate other ingredients minimum two tablespoons of oil 240 calories 2 chicken leg peas 400 calories one egg 70 calories if you calculate for some kind of side dish it is 300 calories approximately a total of 1500 calories at the restaurant even in the most conservative way if you are doing Bangladesh but Biryani at home it will be a real CW see contest cooked with calories Contours I am not even going to talk about mutton Biryani because mutton has more calories than chicken if you keep eating mutton you cannot put your collar button few people say I Biryani paneer has even more calories one small cube of paneer has 40 calories and if you stop with just one paneer your mom will say you paid so much for the Biryani eat more paneer my friends turns into a vegetarian during productasi month usually his belly looks like a big circle but during paratasi month it looks like a cube because his favorite dish is paneer Cube Biryani usually a person needs 2 000 calories on an average to maintain his weight with all the calculations that we did it be easily 1500 calories with just one plate of Biryani if you for lunch then you cannot have anything for breakfast or anything for dinner essentially you should fast throughout the day when you eat more than what your body needs your body starts to store fat around your liver your intestines and that is the start of the belly fat Saga my friends argue so what I eat only once in a while nothing is going to happen but the problem is once in a while is happening so frequently for each and every food jalebi has once in a while Kolkata has once in a while and all our religious festivals have some kind of food once in a while if you look at it the real once in a while is actually fasting I waist circumference is more than 100 centimeters in men and more than 90 centimeters in women you are once in a while is gone it your body is saying cut down don more but if we ignore that the fat gets deposited not around the liver but gets deposited inside the liver causing Scar Tissue called fatty liver but my friend is like after having one plate of chicken biryani he is done when is the main course coming days so if we ignore the sign of belly fat the more we eat the more fat gets deposited in the liver most scar tissue forms in the liver fatty liver progresses and slowly the liver function declines almost 100 percent of the liver will be completely damaged in a span of eight to ten years the final end-stage liver disease is called cirrhosis and more importantly this can even cause liver cancer liver is not like your mom who can put up with all your atrocities liver is like your lover it will break up if you take it for granted unfortunately the whole disease progression is completely silent you will not know about this at all the only actual treatment is to prevent fat being deposited in the liver but once if it is deposited preventing from further progression our liver is like Titanic hero Jack even when it is drowning it will not show any signs of problems at all we are like the heroine Rose sleeping nicely on the life jacket and when we wake up the liver is completely gone and no matter how much we cry Jack come back there is a boat liver is not going to come back to know whether you have a fatty liver you don fancy investigations like ultrasound or CT scan all you need is an inch tape if your inch tape is measuring around the belly button for 100 centimeters in men and 90 centimeters in women congratulations you have fatty liver please don to diagnose fatty liver use that money to donate to our aishwaryam trust in madurai this is a 24 7 nursing home who takes care of hospice patients neurological patients who cannot even walk taking care of their food shelter nursing and medical expenses 24 7 for free please consider donating to our trust please check out the link in the description option for more information with all this I have told you eating Biryani at night is even bad because the main hormone which is necessary to break down the Biryani is insular and that is sleeping after Sunset and if you eat Biryani at night you without its knowledge I eating Biryani is bad but eating Biryani in this way is bad so here are my suggestions number one no matter how good the Biryani is no Biryani after 7 PM no Biryani after Sunset even if you have to eat Biryani pack up and then eat the Biryani the next day when the Sun is bright and shiny so if you have Biryani at lunch and if you have good night sleep the Sleep hormones will help you digest the Biryani very well this video is being sponsored by an Australian company called Bond charge they make the best blue light filter glasses to prevent the blue light entering your retainer disturbing your sleep this is especially important for people who are watching their phone just before going to bed so check them out in the description my friends asking can we eat Biryani after putting this Blue Light Glass I said hey this is a blue light filter glass lot not belly fat filter glass and number two if you a restaurant and ordering a Biryani just order one plate for the family of four and share it remember you the restaurant just for the taste of it and not for the amount of it number three if you are like me and you are hating the entire Biryani in one minute remember the amount of calories you just took and you need to calculate accordingly either by fasting or decreasing your amount of oral intake for the next couple of days to compensate for the extra calories number four very strictly no fried onions regular onions is okay but no fried onions it just adds up to the calories number five if you add cashews not more than five cashews remember five cashews will give 150 calories cashews will not only cost you cash but also calories number six if you home once serving should be 1 cup of cooked rice to a minimal oil as much as possible to decrease the calorie intake to around 600 calories per whole Biryani meal number seven please don Biryani don you cannot live without it it is an over hyped dish it is just a dish you can definitely have it but in limited quantities it similar to how films are screening smoking and drinking are injurious to health they should also script eating large amounts of Biryani is injurious to health as well why don rice for all your Heroes Your Heroes Have dietitians and personal trainers who can take care of their health who will take care of my subscribers who keeps thinking that Biryani is an emotion and staff singing patala patala song while eating Biryani I really want to know how frequent you eat Biryani in a week please write down in the comment section foreign [Music]	Success

YOUNG pts are DYING due to OBESITY - what is your waist circumference? | Dr. Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ffq6qr5WGGI	Dr Pal	hello this is dr. pol maple Manickam everybody to boost up the immunity and I can easily say eat papaya garlic ginger citrus fruits and spinach but I want you guys to understand that nothing will help that much as long as you are not taking care of the underlying problem when I say underlying it is literally underlying lying under your chest which is your abdominal fat after lockdown many people can that is a big problem and that is what we are going to talk about today and one of my patient who was infected with corona is right now when I see you fighting for his life he is only 40 years old he drink he doesn that we think it is very difficult to take him off of the ventilator it says obesity his body mass index is 31 and his waist circumference is 95 centimeters you know that bit multiple reports that patients were overweight or obese they don not only Khurana you know obesity can cause diabetes heart disease stroke and even death you know we get all these water forward saying that a person died at a very young age and all what we do is say rest in peace and he might have been stressed at work and we move on yes stress is a factor as well but more than that the main factor is abdominal obesity especially for Asians in particular Indians you know obesity decreases the body immunity no matter how much Nilla member keironb Rasim vitamin c you take as long as you filling a bucket with water when there is a big hole at the bottom it is a huge problem for Indians especially because we abdominal obesity it is a manufacturing defect and we can you know we might not look that big but all the fat goes straight up into the abdomen if little kids are playing hide and seek be beneath your belly then that party if you could use your belly as a dining table for your plate that is even a bigger problem okay how do you know whether you it is based on two numbers one is your waist circumference and the other one is your body mass index and I show you how we are going to calculate this all you need is self inch tape under weighing scale for measuring the waist circumference you need the inch tape measure all the way around your body at the level of your belly button and when you do this make sure that you are not holding your breath like this this is not for shaadi.com make sure that you exhale and check the number on the tape right after you exhale so when you do this three things have to be checked number one take your shirt off and measure right at the level of the belly button and number two make sure that the tape is not twister make sure it is straight and not too tight and most importantly number three don your breath this is not a competition this is for yourself so to make it simple I will tell you the numbers in centimeters more than 90 centimeters in mail and more than 80 centimeters in female it is considered as obesity so if you are a male measuring more than 90 centimeters or a female more than 80 centimeters congratulations you have passed that test you are obese you don have to go to the second step for those unfortunate people who fail the first step you can attempt the second test for this you will need your height and weight and type in those numbers in the body mass index calculator mentioned below in the description and if the final number is more than 23 congratulations even though you have failed the first test you have passed the second test hard work always pays for those really really unfortunate people who have failed both the two tests please stop the video right now and forward this video to 50 people right away so that you don so if you look at the numbers carefully the numbers are lower for Asians in particular Indians compared to other races you know for other races the normal body mass index is twenty four point nine for us it is 23 and way circumference for men the normal for other races is one zero two centimeters and for us it is 90 centimeters as I said it is all manufacturing defect I think it is related to some bad karma that we did in our previous life that might also be the reason why ms dhoni was involved in that heartbreaking run up in the World Cup semi-final take me as a living example you know even though my body mass index was only 23 my waist circumference was hundred centimeters I fulfilled the promise that I made to my mom that I will get hundred in each and every field so I lost close to twenty kilos and then decreased the waist circumference from 100 to 87 so when I was 100 I always had flu infections all the time which was compromising the quality of life significantly but when I lost all those excess fat I never had any infection so far in the last one to two years knock on wood and I strongly believe that that fat loss will improve immunity for everyone so instead of sati challenge or dalgona coffee challenge I proposed a unique challenge hashtag waste challenge take two minutes of your time take a measuring tape measure your waist circumference take a weighing scale measure your weight and also your height calculate your body mass index and write down three numbers in the comment section your waist circumference your body mass index and your weight current weight and I will reply to each and every one of you and will tell you what should be your target weight my heart goes out to the family who creates a GoFundMe page with a picture of two little kids because the husband is dead you know if you have young kids and if you don know it is my opinion it is nothing short of being criminal obesity kills you slowly it is equal to cigarette smoking I am busy I don I not an answer get your priorities straight if that is your answer don have a family if you have young kids it is your responsibility to be around for them until they become 18 years of age and very upset about this because exact same thing happened to my family friend and if I can change at least one person least save one family from a disaster I you in every step of the way so that you and your family can have a long-term good quality of life please take this hashtag waste challenge seriously and if you are obese we will work together to bring your weight back to normal so you can build up your immunity you can fight off any disease or any Korona do this not for you but for your family	Success
How to TIME intermittent fasting for max results?- ft. Dr. Julie Shatzel (My doctor) - Part 1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4MJubmc1KE	Dr Pal	hello guys i glad to introduce a special guest to us uh it spent most of her life on this time restricted feeding and done so much research on her she has published a book as well on the top of it she is my doctor so thank you thank you so much julie for coming to the show and educating the audience pal dr powell so great to be here and i you thank you thank you when i say i was your patient i want to tell the audience that as you know i was obese before i was weighing like 200 pounds and the main reason that i was able to bring it down to 155 was because of uh julie and thank you again for doing this and she motivated me to spread this concept of time restricted feeding everywhere and if given an option to her she will stream this in cnn every day so so dr powell i was gonna say the dramatic change you made was really dramatic because i don recognized you when we were at one of the medical conferences right absolutely absolutely actually there funny story you know i used to wear a swim shorts at my friend was 200 pounds i jumped into the water and the shorts torn apart and my friend used to say that even now that you know i still have that shorts as some as a memory of that visit your memento but um you know we talked about this when i was the first first visit with you and you said that you will lose weight and not only wait your whole outlook to life will differ yes i mean it is it to me it is the only weight loss method that will work permanently because if you think about it any other form of weight loss diet composition change those are always temporary i mean we can go back decades and we can see that that sort of weight loss always finds itself back on the body you look at one year data two-year data five years by five years it of people have gained their weight back using those old style the traditional methods so this time restricted eating concept it discovered in the animal models like in the 1990s you know i mean to me that it is new it is new because most of the old traditional methods has been like 1950s 60s and people have written books about it right right so this is it call it a bypass pathway i call it a secret bypass pathway and it was discovered by researchers looking at circadian rhythms so they weren to find a shortcut on how to burn fat or how to make people lose weight more easily they were looking at how the body intrinsically or naturally functions what is driving the timing mechanism in the body and that but we always think of it as just day and night it activity and nighttime activity we awake during the day we sleep at night that is a circadian rhythm but eating and fasting is also a circadian rhythm in fact it such a strong circadian rhythm that you are actually burdening the body when you eat outside of your circadian rhythm it so you could be eating kale and carrots at 10 pm but your body is not accepting the nutrient in fact it toxin instead of benefiting yourself that nutrients and the body metabolize fat and utilize nutrients is very different between day and night because of our own intrinsic circadian rhythm wow wow so you know the secret bypass when you said that i i think it we can put it this way that if you follow this method you will make sure that you will never get a bypass surgery for your heart exactly secret bypass to bypass your bypass surgery so um you know it jury that you mentioned that you know even kale like healthy vegetable like kale if you eat at 10 pm it might turn as an ice cream affecting your body because your body shut down right right right so it like i i talk about it like to my patients and you you i may have shared this story with you but it like cinderella at the ball she has her carriage her um her gown and she has all of her footmen up until midnight but after midnight she turned to mice and her carriage has turned into a pumpkin so that circadian rhythm if you that rhythm has switched over to its nighttime mode all of that food just changes in the body like you said it becomes more of a burden it longer of benefit so similar to the cinderella there popular tamil movie a indian movie where the comedian doesn to see anything after 6 p.m so i tell my audience that to be exactly like counter money that like you know don don and that make because the next question i your audience has is well what time what time is cinderella like what time is midnight for my body because clearly it well in the animal studies so the original study from the 1990s and and you may have talked about the study too dr paul because i know i know you they took two groups of mice and they were identical twins i mean exactly genetically the same but one group was fed on time restricted eating and the other group was fed on a just leisurely eating whenever they wanted so basically a pantry that only opened 24 hours a day versus one that opened on time restricted eating eight hours a day and after four months the rats that were only given food for the time restricted eating window they were healthy they were protected they did not gain weight even on a fatty diet so the animal study used an eight-hour eating window but for humans we have discovered that it doesn you can try to get done with dinner before seven you should be in a tre window that should be enough to begin this accelerated metabolism process so i don indian culture is exactly the opposite of western culture over here because we start dinner usually around like eight nine pm and the five six pm is where we love this concept called snacks my mom actually feeds me with snacks coffee and tea around 5 6 p.m and then the dinner is usually 8 9 p.m throughout my life and this concept when you told me it was like an eye opener for me and i was like you know whether it not but it really did and that wanted to promote this concept to everybody so that we can save the swim shots for everybody [Laughter] well you know that most people face i think dr powell is that most people have more of their eating and the majority of their calories that come in after four or five p.m in fact for most americans they dr panda is behind all of this all of this animal and human research um it it all of these statistics and they did discover that most people taken more than 50 to 60 of their calories after 5 p.m so that universal probably around the world no wonder most of us are suffering with a swimming suit size that we don right exactly especially i don no no absolutely true absolutely true and you know in the previous video when i was just introducing this concept of timeless defeating i was completely surprised by the not completely surprised but i was expecting this that 90 percent of the comments were that my dinner time was like 10 p.m and 11 p.m wow well i think it our busy lifestyle as well yeah so that that who work long hours and and then don eat until later in the evening um i talk about the different personalities of the different styles of eating in my book if you don can show my books absolutely absolutely yeah there you go time restricted eating and look inside the lifestyle julie shouts out perfect yeah this is available on amazon yes um yeah if you buy this you don have to buy anything else from any other food store at least not after like seven o exactly and when you buy this order from amazon don [Laughter] [Music]	Success
TIMING the fasting to REVERSE diabetes? ft. Dr. Julie Shatzel (my doctor) - Part 2 | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfmgxWJRoP8	Dr Pal	everyone faces the same challenges and i i separate everyone into categories so there right away like like you dr pal i call you i would call you a virtuoso you in that category of you demand that change for yourself and so you will put everything into place to make that change happen but many other people are obligated i call them the obligated eaters so they have to eat when someone else is eating otherwise they they time or the children visitors time and then there who are compassionate eaters so people who have to eat because they feel emotionally drawn to the food in the evening that calm down but what the different times of eating is that what we have found in looking at many many people trying to adopt time-restricted eating some who successful and some who successful is that the people who have the most difficult time adapting to not eating late at night are likely having mild hypoglycemic events your blood sugar may not be dropping into the the low range of very very low like you know 60s or below but their sugar is beginning to slowly drop a little bit so it drives the nervous system to need to eat something right because you get you start to feel a little bit uncomfortable so that fasting interval is important but getting to the fasting interval and adhering to it means eating the better or the right kind of food during the day enough fiber enough vegetables that you don go later into the evening 9 p.m 10 p.m when you longer fast so initially when we start this at least when i started this with you you said that don were eating initially and then just focus on the timing period initially and we can modify what you eating later um i think that worked for me because i don many things at the same time right so if you and you and you don don tremors then you could probably implement just as you said but if you run into these obstacles where for example a family who their ability to fast after seven is going to be very difficult because they late time of when the body imprinted to eat that hormones and digestive system is set for 10 pm so you seven so the body symptoms of almost like withdrawal from that usual habitual eating time so that obstacle then just try to incorporate a little bit more during the day so the key is shifting food not saying i now and i didn lunch and now let me begin my fast so you experience any of the problems or the obstacles of trying to begin that short evening fast so when you say shifting food is let say you have a heavy dinner don heavy dinner save the 50 of dinner to breakfast or lunch maybe yeah it have a heavy lunch have a bigger breakfast we did begin by as you said just having people ignore the food aspect of it so if you beginning you can eat what you like to eat during the day and try to have a bigger lunch and a bigger breakfast and then try to shift the majority of the calories away from that last meal right so that place to begin and then as people are beginning to shift their evening time meal up then gradually we will look at composition a little bit a little bit to help them not feel the side effect of the short evening fast but if you don feel any side effects from it you don have to worry about that you can just begin your fast right right so most common question that i got was people with night shift if they night shift how does this work what do you usually tell that to your patients well it depends on what night shift they patients i look specifically at when their night shift is because we have true night shift like nurses who work 7 p.m to 7 a.m and then we have swing shift workers that may work from you know something like 9 or 10 p.m until only 2 or 3 a.m so night shift and swing shift different hours but during the night now i do have someone who is a swing shift worker and she has been able to reduce her fasting blood sugar so she normalize her blood sugars just by using time-restricted eating but how she does this is she is done by 7 pm regardless of if she has to go to work at 9 00 pm and work until 3 in the morning so she continues her fast even while at work that would be the ideal for someone who working swing shift is to treat it as it pattern so you still want to try to do as much fasting as you can during that nighttime cycle so you can just think about it when everyone system should still be sleeping right when everyone that be awake up and eating now you may be sleeping because you right you the afternoon you least let your digestive system let that be awake yes so as soon as you get up go ahead and eat something or when you get home go ahead and eat something if the if the sun is out because remember circadian is day and night so if the sun is out it system make sure that it wants to during the day and then at night time when it everything shut off your digestive system is sleeping so the best you can align your eating pattern to the day and your fasting pattern to the night even while on a swing shift or a night shift that serves your your health the best it serves your organs the best so i when i started right so i was really concerned that what if i become hungry at night uh will i be able to work properly i i um later on it eventually went away but what do you suggest to your patients well certainly for you dr powell i know you it walking around the hospital so i can even imagine how hard that was when you were beginning that fasting cycle you know to begin with but in the beginning for certain the first two weeks are the most challenging maybe a little brain fog a little fatigue maybe some indigestion your body adapting but just as you noticed it gradually goes away until to the point where probably three to four weeks later your body is different when it fast and then at two months again it even more different and then at three months it longer you do it the more you advance you go from white belt to brown belt to yellow belt and then black belt so your body is different when you begin versus when you so you feel fewer and fewer side effects to the point where you feel good when you i right i i feel like at this point of time i now i so it me to advance as well so you know one most important thing that you mentioned was you said your patient actually was able to decrease the glucose levels and reverse the diabetes almost is that right experience in those patients well how they begin is they are doing just like everyone else is doing they beginning to move that last meal of the evening move it up by one hour just start there and as you gradually begin to move it you sugar start to come down so as you move the evening meal check your morning fasting blood sugar and see how that adjusts and i think you surprised it always begins to it always begins to lower and move that meal up and you don have to change composition that surprising thing you changing what you and that here is that you know it all of the researchers say that so everyone at dr panda what you eat it and that really absorb because it when someone says you know when you travel at the speed of light time changes you know and that you how do you fathom that that difficult it and so when people first hear about time-restricted eating they may sort of think that it recommendation but it power behind it once you begin consistency you can begin to look fantastic like you dr powell i think you might be the only person that said that but that [Laughter] you right i think when you said the consistency so the problem the next problem that i faced was even if i was okay and i want to follow this my friend calls me on a saturday night for a potluck [Laughter] i just go with the pot but there is no luck because i don after 7 pm so peer pressure right that one of the main thing and what do you advise to your patients in that aspect that have a woman who works with me and she is what i call she because she is always having people over there her house they anniversary a birthday so when it hits seven o she takes her glass of wine and she dumps it out and she fills it with water and she walks around as if she wine no one thinks she cocktail i think that difficult to do with food dr powell but i to walk around with your plate of food and so you know what i have done before is um i take like like an indian food like two pieces of it and i don i just talk to all these people with the exact same tool throughout the night and there thing in the indian culture that you know they would uh put everything down to entertain the guest the guest is like more than the god in terms of hospitality wise so they will provide everything what they can to please the guest so that they have a good time but it is very hard for me to explain that that please don anything to please me well the solution would be two plates two plates exactly four right two plates and you know i i want to tell about this mutual patient that we had so you know that patient had diabetes and that patient had fatty liver as well um so the endocrinologist sent it to me for the fatty liver and then i sent it to you because i know that both me and the endocrine is not going to do anything for that patient and you can do a lot for that patient so why don about you know fatty liver on that mutual patient as well right so the diagnosis of fatty liver is is done first and that you as a gastroenterologist specialist right dr paul and we look at the blood tests so when we see that the blood tests for the liver are elevated that an indication but ultrasound is another indication because sometimes we don see it on the on the liver tests but of course you can tell by the waist circumference too you can pretty much judge that so fatty liver of course is really concerning because that the liver organ itself detoxifies the blood and it cleans the blood so if you have fat on your liver it bundled with layers and layers of oil and grease preventing it from doing its job it to clean the dishes with a dirty sponge so getting rid of fat on the liver is what the body wants to do first and what we who do calorie restriction diets do not lose fat on the root on the liver very well in fact it places that the body will go to to clean but it restricted eating it seems to target fat on the liver it wounds to allow the body to get to where it wants to clean the most so it dirtiest part is in the back of the refrigerator and it nobody ever wants to clean that because you can difference right you just close the door and your house if you just clean the outside of the house you get much more aesthetic appreciation right so the liver is always ignored when we do a regular standard diet except with time-restricted eating it allows the liver to just take the layers off so initially with this type of protocol you won you won because all the work is being done at the organ level the liver itself is cleaning it process and the liver has all these nooks and crannies to it little tiny canals and channels and when they filled with fat your body has to take those little pipe cleaners you know that we use to clean small straws it taking pipe cleaners to clean the liver but that off eventually it doesn but the its meaning is huge it profound when you can take fat off the liver the impression for your body is huge the blood is cleaned your metabolism starts to go up so the case with this patient was we just began by studying her eating pattern and she was eating until 11 11 o at night regularly because she worked during the day and all her stress was during the day then we gradually started to move her dinner time back now she got to eight o and even though that considered relatively late circadian-wise to see liver ultrasound changes blood test changes and weight loss so for your viewers that are eating very late the the most optimal message from this is that if you even shift by one or two hours you difference on the health of your organs wow wow now that that patient was an eye opera for me as well i can clearly see that the numbers of the liver enzymes were completely trending down to almost normal so it was an eye opener as well but the most important thing is consistency isn this on a weekday and then get away with weekend right right because if you think about it the first thing many people say at least the ones that i meet the first thing they say when they learn about time-restricted eating simple concept they to themselves oh i already do that i i do that i o but they only eighty percent of the time twenty percent of the time they and if you it doesn because this circadian cycle has memory to it and so it requires repetition and it requires adherence on a consistent basis now for someone who legacy effect for example someone who been using this for many weeks already they do get a maybe a one day pass so one day where they eat late at a gathering that two days or three days you right exactly right yeah yeah so you do have you do build up it how at work if you work a certain number of days you can gather a vacation day right it certain number of days before you won have a dramatic consequence from falling out of that eating time it like one week and expect the muscles to build up it is not there i go i stopped so it has to be persistent and consistent and as you said even after doing like two or three months or even more than that then you might take like one day of vacation yes but not an extreme vacation just a very local vacation you can all right so so the um that maybe that that is the only thing i thought it was difficult for me initially to adopt because of the lifestyle change but eventually when i worked when i tried to change the lifestyle for my family for my friends around then it was a little bit easier for me yes i think that if you can have a community supporting you it always works better in fact the most successful people who i have coached doing this method have been couples a married couple where both are motivated to use time-affected eating that is the that the most optimal scenario but if you have one spouse and another spouse that wants to eat at a different time then it becomes more difficult because you have someone eating late and someone eating early right absolutely and my wife says that you know circadian rhythm will work the other way around as well if she because she eats late at night at 2 a.m then after you know looking at my change she changed as well so yeah so i think uh i think i think people have to notice that change and unfortunately it some time it is not going to happen overnight at least in my case it took like six to eight weeks at least to notice something right right so so i see metabolism as it kind of stays steady and most people expect that it to rise like a slope but really what we then it rises quickly stays steady and then it just does another quick rise so it almost like it plateaus until you continue and be persistent and then it moves up to the next level wow wow this is so fascinating and i sure that we everything within this one session and uh so audience please you know if you have access to amazon please order that book and then see uh julie has clearly explained in basic simple steps that everybody can understand because how to incorporate this time restricted eating initially when you are coming to know about this and um i uh she will be happy to come over again on our channel to explain more about it even if she doesn because i explained that in front of you all but we work together and we have so many mutual patients we love this concept and we would want to share this concept to everybody and thank you thank you so much this has been a wonderful session julie thank you dr powell thank you thank you [Music]	Success

A simple TIP for better SLEEP | Blue light damage | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyTN1obUxPc	Dr Pal	hello guys this is Dr P manikam in this video we actually your phone can cause increase belly fat and actually cause heart attack hear me out until the end I going to give you a tiny little lifestyle change that you can do this will cause a big impact in your life if not it will have a big impact in your life in the previous video we talked about how you can use the sun to decrease your belly fat in this video we are going to see how you can use your sleep to decrease belly fat basically I money to buy these expensive supplements for weight loss and everything I use naturally available Sun Moon sleep water to lose belly fat my mom used to tell me if you keep eating and sleeping I am going to tell you that if you sleep like kumbag garan you can actually reduce your belly fat but please don an adult should sleep around 7 hours of sleep when I say 7 hours it should be seven good continuous hours any disturbance during the sleep will affect the quality of your sleep it could be your kids it could be your wife or it could be your one good friend who calls you in the middle of the night my friend sarak Kumar calls me and saysa Shar chandraa after his call I be like Shar Chandra alert and awake all night long so in this video we to see if you don continuous good quality sleep you will get 7 in of belly fat let [Music] how combining sleep and belly fat is a hormone called cortisol sleep decreases the cortisol hormone it is an extremely important hormone it a flight hormone it gives you so much energy that whenever there is a stressor it either fights with the stressor or makes you run away from the stressor basically when cortisol is secreted it gives you all the energy to fight the stressor like doing a karate if it cannot handle it it will give you energy to do man karate so that you can run away from it like a deer so if you disturb C and make it secrete unnecessarily your body will not know what to do with this all this energy when there is no stressor to fight or flight all this energy will convert into belly fat thinking that you will need this energy in future I cortisol has Indian genes because it always saves energy for your future but does not spend anything at the present moment so the lower your cortisol lower your belly fat the simplest way not to disturb cortisol to be secreted unnecessarily is to follow its CC Ian Rhythm follow its sleep wake cycle when it is sleeping you don cortisol wakes up when you wake up gives you all this energy and sleeps in the evening and dies down by midnight if you wake up cortisol after it sleeps it will say cortisol is like your phone it wakes up fully charged in the morning keeps you notified with this WhatsApp Medical University Facebook medical school and dies down at midnight my friend sarak Kumar sends me a WhatsApp message at midnight saying that so if you don will not disturb you cortisol is like my in-laws family if I don they don them unnecessarily they will feed me so much that instead of my wife I will come out as 6 months pregnant so if your waist circumference is more than 80 cm in women and more than 90 cm in men it is absolutely important that you follow the Circadian rhythm of cortisol you go to bed early with cortisol and you wake up early with cortisol cortisol is not your cousins who come home for a vacation so you can chitchat all night long cortisol is like your baby you need to nurture it slowly and if it wakes up you need to sing lalabi to make it sleep again if not it will sing lalabi to you the number one reason that people are not getting good quality sleep these days is scrolling down your phone just before you go to sleep and I will tell you why to have a good quality sleep you need a hormone called melatonin the more the Melatonin the better you sleep melatonin secreted when you are surrounded in dark environment the more darker it is the more the number of melatonin the better the sleep you get now you know why our favorite part of the max class is when the teacher has to switch off the lights for his PowerPoint presentation I Sir our ancestors slept at Sunset and woke up at sunrise because they didn have any light so they have tons of melatonin in their body so sleeping was not a problem at all when we started started using artificial light after Sunset all these electronic devices LED lights starts to emit something called blue light and this blue wavelength decreases the Melatonin hormone decreases the Sleep Quality increases the cortisol and hence the problem any device that we use emit lights with different colors at different wavelength like blue yellow red like M ch ch but the most dangerous light is the blue light after Sunset because it decreases the Melatonin level the most and the most important problem is the number one source for blue light is all the phones that we have right in our hand my friend Saro Kumar is like hey P what are you talking about I don that is coming out of my phone even my wallpaper is white and my ringtone is very happy and not Blu though this is called Blue Light it will not look like blue it will just look like this white light that is emitting from the phone it just that it has a blue wavelength decreasing the Melatonin after sensor the blue light is so prominent that your phone will say now blue light is not a bad light it is actually a good light sunlight has so much blue light the concept of blue light is to make you alert and be awake that is what you need during the day and you don even tal rajin would have said in one movie that Su unfortunately T did not contest in the election if he would have maybe he might have won the sun I guarantee you that most of us including me definitely look at our phone before going to bed this is particular particularly bad when you in a WhatsApp group about your actor flopped movie especially before going to bed the fight gets intense and you are waiting for your friend to reply something and all you see is the friend is typing and the more you wait for his typing the more the Melatonin is typing its resignation letter to leave your body so what happens now you keep staring at the iPhone for his reply the blue light goes into your retina decreases the Melatonin increases the cortisol levels and you cortisol causing you a problem after waking up cortisol will be like day Sunday K Wang Sunday K Wang nobody will be there it stores all the energy into belly fat all this started with that stupid message in the WhatsApp group now you can officially change the name of the group into to one of the other reason that our ancestors slept so well was because they received notification through a Pan notification from WhatsApp Facebook Tik Tok Instagram and even your kid our ancestors getting exposed to Blue Light was once in the Blue Moon and now even even in no moon day we are exposed to Blue Light so the more you scroll your phone before the bed the blue light goes into your retina decreases the Melatonin decreases the quality of sleep increases the cortisol increases the belly fat increases your cholesterol levels in your heart causes heart attack and that attack so there are three categories of patients in which this concept is absolutely important number one people who cannot fall asleep at all number two people can fall as sleep but they cannot maintain the Sleep Number Three now you might be having a good sleep but you keep expose yourself to the blue light the Balaton and recepto go down and eventually you will fall into the first or the second category so now we can discuss what you can do to avoid this from happening so number one you need to stay away from your phone 2 hours before going to bed 2 hours is so too long okay 1 Hour 1 hour okay at least half an hour number two is you can follow the sleep wake cycle of cortisol cortisol sleeps around 10 or 11:00 p.m. you could also sleep along that the same time period and wake up along with cortisol in the morning and follow this daily on a routine basis for example if you decide to sleep around 10: p.m. you create an alarm or a reminder in your phone to keep the phone away half an hour before at 9:30 p.m. remember the more you scroll it increases your cholesterol the heart takes a heavy toll the third thing that you can do is to actually apply blue filters to your phone and I will show you how I have an iPhone I in iPhone you could also do it in Android and any other platform as well so in your iPhone go to settings and type in color filter and choose color filters and in that option turn it on Once you turn it on it gives multiple options like gray scale red green filter what you need is color tint if you click this it becomes so warm that actually it is red in color the more red it is the better it is because it decreases the Melatonin the least the more warmer it is the better for you for your sleep but if you unfortunately we cannot do much we need to find an alternative solution one good solution is to get a blue light filter glasses it is worth your investment please research on that it is going to help you a lot down the road my friend SAR proudly told me that after wearing the blue light filter glass all the movies are coming closer when you look closer it is actually the 3D glass that he stole from my dear K chatan 3D movie 20 years ago I can guarantee you that whichever category of patients that you belong to this method is going to definitely promote the quality of your sleep decrease the cortisol level decrease the belly fat with this method combined with the time restricted feeding I can guarantee you that your belly fat is going to come down I was explaining this to my friends s Kumar I said they play to your strength play along with your circadian rhythm you will have beautiful benefits he was like they please share that playlist with me I was like what are you talking about the Circadian rythm playlist so in summary I want you to be like chin tambi gam if people don who that is I the movie link he a role that he has played in a movie called chinat tambi he will not be able to see anything after 6 p.m. I want you to be like that you cannot see anything so if you cannot see anything you will not eat anything as well if you are forced to participate in any functions or get together wear your blue light filter glass and say super I curious to know from you guys when do you go to bed and when is the last time that you actually look at your phone I want to know the time difference for example you go to bed at 10: p.m. and you look at your phone at 9:55 then the time difference is 5 minutes write down in the comment section when you go to bed and what is the time difference again try to follow the Circadian rhythm of cortisol go to bed around 10: p.m. wake up in the morning when cortisol wakes up if you keep allowing your cortisol to secrete unnecessarily your soul will rest in peace and you are solely responsible for that stay safe get vaccinated don 7:00 p.m. one belly at a time it is absolutely important I next video bye-bye [Music]	Success
How ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS cause BELLY FAT ? | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QtRpJtQ7vU	Dr Pal	hello guys this is uh dr paliner manikal in our channel we have been talking about reducing belly fat and the first and foremost step is to eat between sunrise to sunset as much as possible so we have talked about this at length in the previous video close to 1 million people have seen that video because everybody has this problem if you can stick to this concept religiously daily on a consistent basis you will not need any other method at all but if you are stuck and if you results all these small steps that we going to discuss in the future series of videos it your results faster so it arranged marriage astrology has to match first only then education money whether the bridegroom has hair or not all these helps but most important thing is the astrology in this video we talk about the one most important thing you should avoid completely during the eating period let so we rings or cool drinks whatever you can call bottom line is the sugary drinks when i first came to united states they asked me do you want to drink soda i like i will not drink any alcohol because the only soda i know is the soda that you mix in alcohol then only realize that in this country coke pepsi and fanta is called a soda body soda now i soda malki or what um when i grew up my favorite cool drink is fanta little did i know that it people drink soda more than the taste because of the availability convenience it is everywhere vending machines grocery store even an icu patient waiting room day that was the main reason that the patient is in icu in the first place right they will replace the glucose bottle with the cool ring bottle this cool drink bottle company the motto was grab and go right it is grabbing one person person to grab the other person it is like lord yama drinking the soda and then saying miranda so let drinks are actually killing you right so when you drink the soda or a cool drink within 20 minutes of drinking this because of the high sugar content it stimulates your pancreas to secrete this hormone called insulin you guys know about insulin based on the previous video so insulin converts all the sugar into energy thinking that you to work out or doing some kind of activity to spend this energy but unfortunately it doesn you soda all this extra energy gets converted into fat deposited in your belly thinking that you will need that in future i feel so bad for this hormone called insulin it is thinking that we be using this energy in future industries let me explain to you how this works like let requires 2000 calories to maintain the normal body weight out of this 2000 calories 200 grams is the only allowance for carbohydrates or sugar so with our carbohydrate-rich diet especially in south india including our dosa italy pongal rice roti dal all will give you carbohydrates actually on an average you will be taking normally 200 grams easily so we don accommodate for extra sugar or extra carbohydrates because those excess calories will be converted into belly fat especially for south indians did you guys know that one can of coke gives you 40 grams of sugar in that particular instance your body is telling the cool rings that hey stay away from me i don have enough space for you but the coke is telling the body that hey that i will travel along with you like as if traveling in an unreserved compartment and the unreserved compartment is right here when you really want to decrease belly fat the first thing that you need to do is to avoid carbs as much as possible i carbs like italy dosa dal or unhealthy they are healthy but in limited quantities so limiting those foods can be difficult initially because we have been born and brought up with these foods it is completely okay but you have to avoid any kind of extra additional sugary drinks at least my audience should completely avoid coke pepsi or fanta my friend saran kumar is like i only drink thumbs up duh so it is not a problem he drink thumbs up his belly is also up in all these advertisements at least mountain dew has at least some truth to it because the hero climbs up all these mountains and then drinks mountain dew at the end of the strenuous exercise my friend saran kumar is like only if you drink a cool drink at the end of a big meal it sounds like a well-rounded meal ra i told him that that is why you are well-rounded he was like i don only drink diet soda that is even worse diet soda is the biggest misnomer in my life it has nothing to do with diet it is exactly similar to my patient whose name is roky swami where all the organs are damaged i am very impressed by the marketing technique of these companies by introducing the word diet in this soda bottle but it is 10 times more worse than the regular soda these diet sodas are so tasty because of the artificial sweeteners and this is more harmful than actual regular sugar so hear me out here so when you drink regular soda the sugar molecules stimulate the insulin insulin digest the sugar molecules it has something to do but when you drink diet soda the artificial sweeteners tricks your brain that that is actually sugar molecules when there is nothing and it stimulates the insulin regardless so if you keep doing this insulin will be dancing like a dancing rose in your body ready to fight and you keep on fooling insulin and one point of time when the actual fighter kabilan comes to box the dancing rose insulin will die down this is what we call as insulin resistance there are a lot of insulin in your body but it is good for nothing artificial sweeteners are like the kids who ring the neighbor they open and the neighbors will be standing clueless like the insulin insulin is actually a very very good hormone very effective hormone it prevents you from heart attack it prevents you from stroke but what happens in insulin resistance is you have so much amount of insulin but poor quality insulin that is why it is absolutely important to stop this behavior so there have been multiple research that shows that compared to the regular soda people who are drinking diet soda are at increased risk of depression heart disease and stroke that doesn drink is good it causes metabolic syndrome in addition to metabolic syndrome it also causes kidney stones my friend saran kumar is like day you are jealous that i will get a kidney diamond stone they kidney is not a blouse that you do embroidery with stones duh if you serious about decreasing belly fat i want you to do three things number one stop soda number two stop cool drinks number three stop cold drinks right so you might think that all these cool drinks are actually cooling down the body it is actually raising up the heat inside your body by causing so much inflammation my friend sarah kumar is like thank god i listen to you here after i will not mix soda in my alcohol i will just use only water it is almost mind boggling that in our indian culture smoking and drinking alcohol is considered as a big taboo but drinking cool drinks is actually a cool thing to do so when i say cool drinks it is not only the carbonated beverages like coke pepsi fanta miranda thumbs up it is also these pocketed boxed fruit juices like fruity with excess sugar as well if you want to drink something just drink water if you want to have some flavor fresh fruit juices are the way to go in my opinion drinking cool drinks should be considered as a big taboo when the bride asks the bridegroom do you smoke do you drink alcohol he should also ask do you drink cool drinks so these days there are so much heart attacks between 35 to 45 years of age and it all boils down to this insulin resistance and the number one problem for this is not paying attention to all these small small things that we could easily avoid so after hearing this my friend sarah nakamura is like i bottle of coke every month and drink it and then replace that with water inside the coke bottle so that i will have the satisfaction of drinking coke but actually drinking water so things to be done number one we usually have tendency to drink soda or cool drink after a heavy meal that is the worst time to actually drink so please do not drink soda or cool drink after a heavy meal actually do not drink soda or cool drink ever and number two please don under this misconception of diet soda that is good for nothing number three is if you function or any other function if they are offering you a soda or cool drink please opt for water this is one simple step that you can easily do to improve your health and number four you be the change you change other person you know you don them when they come to your home you don function you know we need to change as a community and we should avoid all these carbonated drinks and sugary drinks including fruit juices like fruity i very curious to know two questions number one how many sugary drinks are you drinking every week number two can you stop this habit and if not what is the main reason please write down in the comment section all these soda companies are like we are refreshing the world we are making a difference actually they are refreshing the population and making a difference in the population count so don into your phone 30 minutes before you go to bed don one belly at a time it is absolutely important i will see you in the next video bye	Success
OILS - How much should we use ? I ft. Sri Sakthi ( Dietician) | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUI9gRUikyk	Dr Pal	hello guys this is uh dr pallabanikam previous video we talked about time restricted feeding how to fast for at least 12 hours and now to achieve your maximum reduction in your weight loss we need to focus on the eating period as well what you do in eating period is more important than what you have done in your max period during your school days okay so to achieve maximum reduction in weight loss you need to focus on the calories and you need to focus on what you the first step in this is to talk to a nutritionist about how to decrease the calorie intake as i repeatedly told you in the past that weight loss only 20 percent is physical activity 80 is just mainly diet so i have the pleasure to invite a special guest today her name is sri shakti ramanadan she works as a dietitian in chicago she disease patients in preventing heart disease as well so let the show oh hi sri sathy hi how are you hello hi dr pal how are you good good good thank you for your time thank you for joining the show yes it super super sounds good all right so as you know in our audience we have been like talking about time restricted feeding fasting for at least 12 hours and we achieve maximum weight reduction through the simple technique and to maximize the results out of this we are trying to see how to focus on the calorie intake during the eating period so i can guarantee you that all my audience are already following this fasting method so they are going to eat only for 12 hours at least that so in that in that 12 hours we were going to talk about um oil intake in this session and we have future sessions about different topics with you as well so mainly in our cooking the calories most of the calories are coming from you know carbs proteins and fats and most of them sometimes fats can provide more calories than what we actually need and the most important criteria for the calorie content from fat is oils so why don you tell us how oils play an important role in the fat loss okay yes that told them how to do the fasting period so while we are eating um there are you know calories come from carbohydrates protein and fat and 30 of our calories should come from fat today we and oil only forms part of your fat intake okay so for example if um if you are on a 1500 calorie diet typically that would be a good starting point for south asians for our body type uh aim for something around 1500 calories but if you want it to be more precise you can get tailored but if you look at 1500 calories 30 of your calories should come from fat intake that will be about 50 grams of fat and what does 50 grams mean right so 50 grams for example a teaspoon of fat or oil is 5 grams already so this is a teaspoon and this is a tablespoon oh my god the teaspoon is five grams already yes the teaspoon is five grams the teaspoon is five grams already so let me show this show it this way so this is a teaspoon and this is a tablespoon so and out of the 50 50 grams yeah this is like it so what we have at home you go and check actually get a teaspoon measure which says teaspoon and tablespoon on it only then you okay okay okay i think my spoon is definitely bigger than these two okay yeah so you i don school belongs to but at least for the audience please make sure that you do use a teaspoon yes correct so teaspoon should be used for measuring all of your oil especially the person who has to use a teaspoon so measuring is the first important thing and out of this 50 grams of total fat that we have 25 grams should come from cooking oil and today we will focus on what should we do with this 25 grams of cooking oil which is basically 5 teaspoons of oil per day your patients that you use five teaspoons of oil per day for one person in the family exactly so if if you there are four people in the family use no more than four teaspoons of oil so then when that dish is completed finished between all of the four of them each of them got one teaspoon and you would have several other dishes so if you have five dishes that day and you then you teaspoons of oil per day per person okay okay okay so one day let tikka masala so you do that at home you have four people in your home you have you have four teaspoons yes you start your cooking or with four teaspoons of oil you use four teaspoons of oil per dish it sounds very less because usually for chicken tikka masala you would use a quarter cup right because you just pour it we are used to pouring oil so i am going to say the first starting point is use a measuring device and um in a day we are allowed five teaspoons of oil per person and this is for a person on a 1500 calorie diet so yeah because we have to give room for all the other fat sources like milk dairy cheese meat uh bread baked goods right and there are healthy fats as well you know avocado avocado has fat content yes avocado has fat too so you have to allot the other 25 grams for everything else and then 25 grams just for your oil intake got it so just as a starting point for one dish you can have one teaspoon per person so i have seen my i well i usually like pour at least half of the bottle right we do anymore because we don yeah yeah and then you just and when you pour it it looks good usually when we pour it out it a half a cup ends up in the kadai or so yes you have to pay attention use a measuring device so but the key thing is if they decrease the oil intake will there be a compromise in the taste that is the most important question yes so there will be a slight compromise but um that get used to and then when it becomes a habit you won you can have two cheat days per month so if you have to have biryani or chicken 65 uh then go for it and on that cheat day that allot yourself cheat days that way you have something to enjoy um there will be a taste difference but if you natural flavors they i still remember my my mom used to put dosa right dosa on the uh and she uses easily three tablespoons on one dosa easily exactly i good that you bought up dosa that idli or steamed items like dhokla um because if you have used up your five teaspoons of oil over a meal yeah so then there is no side dish you cannot have any side dishes dosa you could just eat those directly yes you have to eat so that recommend using um you know whatever pan you cast iron or a non-stick use minimal oil or sometimes you are if you make thicker dosas you might not even need oil that you know when you make thin dosas you need the oil so uh yes so that this is exactly what you know i want people to think of so if you want to you know first first would be focus on oils fats then carbohydrates and then your protein right right so uh on the top of it you know when i was obese i used to have three dosas and then on the side dish i used to have like a small pudi like a powder and pour oil in between the powder as well there you go so all of that so you probably exceeding your oil limit for the whole day you within a meal and a one gram of oil contains nine calories so we all of that detail but limiting to the five teaspoons of oil per person per day really gets uh you know your fat intake under control somewhat of course there more parts to the fat yes which will have to focus yes but perfect at least the starting point is you know please focus on the oil intake that you guys are using on a daily basis and that may be a huge eye opener for many people and then coming to the second question okay so now we know that we need to limit the oil intake um so if that is the case which oil that we should use okay especially for indian cooking because uh that high heat cooking yes good so always uh the first the quantity matter so we spoke about that second the quality so what type of oil are we going to use we for indian cooking to do the tadka or the vagar or the thalipu i hope i said it in a few different languages or the tempering so to say to do that we need at least 325 degrees fahrenheit that certain oils will be able to meet that temperature and it temperature oils can start to smoke and when they smoke they disintegrate and it what are safe oils to use we want to use oils that are that when heated above 350 degrees fahrenheit they do not disintegrate or start smoking so what are those oils most oils fit that range so our common oils that we use sesame seed oil mustard oil um and some fancy oils like avocado oil olive oil the refined olive oil is the one that has the higher smoke point the virgin olive oil is really very it has more impurities it refined and therefore it has a lower smoke point so you have to keep olive oil the refined one to use for cooking and then the virgin olive oil to extra virgin olive oil to use for salad dressings just to pour on top so people who eat salad no i don salad yes that but for indian cooking um the the oil the metallic for our the or the vagar or the chunk or the tang the oil the oil that fits that will be um you know our usual oils that you can look up the list anything above 350 degrees fahrenheit and for frying you need over 400 degrees fahrenheit so frying should be limited to only once in two weeks so if you want to have deep fried food enjoy it once in two weeks and um all the other times you know try to stay within the oils now the second important thing after smoke point for indian cooking it is you want to pick oils that have more mono unsaturated and polyunsaturated fats in them versus the saturated fat because saturated fat research shows that it can increase your ldl cholesterol or the bad cholesterol it can elevate your triglycerides it can cause increased weight gain all of this leads to heart disease diabetes so you want to pick oils that are made up mostly of monos or polyunsaturated fats what are these oils let me just give you a quick list of those oils olive oil avocado oil sesame oil mustard oil peanut oil saffola oil sunflower oil yeah yes sunflower these are all monos and polyunsaturated so they are the better oils but five teaspoons so even though they we can use a lot exactly so that and then the bad ones or the ones that you should try to limit are going to be the butter ghee coconut oil palm oil so you want to always look at indian snacks what are they made of because palm oil frying in palm oil has a higher shelf life you want to make sure so these are the oils that have more saturated fat and then the third category is the one that i say no do not use which will be vegetable shortening like dalda vanaspati or animal fat like lard or um reusing oil because you oil so so that this these will be the avoid so three categories for you for oils one i would call it the good bad and the ugly oils so the good oils are the ones with a lot of monos and pallies which is sunflower safflower sesame mustard olive all of that uh canola oil as well the the bad oil will be the ghee so when i say bad it it but it limited and then the third one is going to be um absolutely avoided because they have trans fats and uh they have um free radicals in them once you know reusing oil is not good my friends aren just loves one ghee dosa every day okay so there again so that comes back to you so out of the five teaspoons we we can allot one teaspoon for coconut oil and ghee so a lot of people watching this video are going to be mad they how can you say coconut oil is bad because uh people who are doing like a keto or a paleo diet they take a lot of fat intake but it might leave you with high cholesterol levels that this series i wanted to talk about facts first and um and look into other things so definitely you do have an allowance for ghee butter and coconut oil but that allowance is one teaspoon and how did i come up with this one teaspoon the aha or the american heart association they have recommended only seven to ten percent of their calories come from saturated fat so therefore when i do my calculation that boils down to about a teaspoon saturated fats yes rich in saturated fat and one teaspoon so if he if your friend sarvana kumar wants to have a ghee dosa one ghee dosa but one teaspoon one teaspoon of oil not a tablespoon and then uh he can enjoy it so uh that that bad and ugly fats nice nice nice super sounds good so um so right now if we focus more on the oil intake and the based on what you have said looks like we cannot have deep fried foods more than once every two weeks correct that is a big i that yeah yeah like you know the uh [Music] fried chicken so chicken 65 or chicken fish fry all of this counts as fried food and fresh food alone it that we buy from the indian stores yes and you have to be very careful read the label if it buy it it so sometimes people say i made my own snacks at home it point is okay if it you can at least have it once in two weeks but what are you doing with the oil that you used is your mom using it back in your dosa again so there reused oil you cannot use oil that been heated once that stop frying things because they don then they they don oil so yeah that citing this is just a joke but this actually happened you know my friends i don you know i abdominal pain and i was like dude what happened did you eat anything else and i didn the only thing is i have been using this oil for the last like four days yeah yeah because they reheating oil is not good but that makes a point that you don oil up front as well you could just use very limited quantities and then keep on using it on a daily basis yes yes that is right you can use the air so what are other options you could bake you can have baked chips and you can have air fried chips as well so these are some substitutes so you using a little bit of oil you won the full crunch but it crispy right right so i think we have to compromise a little bit to achieve weight loss and i think this is a compromise that we can easily achieve and easily do to achieve our goal anyways thank you thank you so much for talking about the oil and patch what is your take home message to people let me just summarize some few points for my audience so the take home message for today is oil is a type of fat and we need to limit our oil intake and aim for five teaspoons of oil per day per person and measure the oil start measuring your oil then you you second to the quantity comes the quality try to use more of the monos and polyunsaturated fats and therefore you calories this is one way of reducing your calories and then we other parts later sounds good so most importantly avoid palm oil as much as possible especially the indian snack which says palm oil try to avoid as much as yes yes palm oil also indian snacks use dalda and vanaspati as well so avoid those that have been fried in uh vegetable shortening okay okay so let wants to you know somebody is really addicted to palm oil or something like that then you need to compensate in your other calorie intake so that at least you don calorie intake and that is why people gain weight eventually exactly yeah so this oil the calories coming from oil and fat is only one part it only makes up 30 of your calories the others you can focus so if you do want to have fried foods once in two weeks uh you compensate maybe i won that day i more so there are all different ways you can compensate and still enjoy the little things yes absolutely absolutely yes yes yes okay perfect thank you thank you so much uh sri shakti we will bring you back again for wonderful tips and advices for us and thank you so much you	Success
Â Weight loss surgeries work ? Â - ft. Dr. Praveen Raj (Bariatric Surgeon) | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdnhQSEXK70	Dr Pal	hello guys this is uh dr palanipanika i in our channel today uh he is the president of obesity surgery association of india he is an international acceleration uh international federation of excellence on the top of it he the gem hospitals the famous hospitals in coimbatore um and more than that he is my best friend close friend i like with him forever and he the main reason that i situation okay so let previn raj he is the obesity surgeon in india um so you know just for our channel uh audiences like you know we both studied uh medicine together in ph.d and um you know we have chatted uh a long lot a lot of time together the problem is we chat during the class so that the professor will actually catch us right away and uh on the top of it he has been like my mentor advisor and most often than not we have bunk classes together as well and then if i tell him he tease me for that but anyways the main reason for bringing him on the channel is that you know we our channel and he is the obesity uh surgeon i mean laparoscopic bariatric surgeon back home in coimbatore uh india and i thought it would be a fantastic discussion to bring him on board and then talk about what is the exact obesity prevalence what does he do and uh just to reassure you guys that what i am saying is right as well um okay so first let start with this so how many patients uh with you know morbid obesity that you see in a daily basis in your clinic just to see what is the prevalence of obesity in india okay pal i think i think i think the great great topic at the great times because i think people have actually started realizing the importance of obesity after covert actually came and there was mortality when it was started to be higher with the obese people so that looking at obesity as a disease so with regard to the prevalence and i think because in gem being a gastro center we see obese people want people coming for obesity treatment by itself and keep people coming for other diseases also who do not come for weight reduction but however come for other problems i think the over the years when it was believed that obesity was a disease of the affluent countries or the developed countries and i think now now the developing or even many underdeveloped countries are catching up in obesity in a very big way and the numbers in india is getting huge and huge i mean not just post coverage sedentary lifestyle at home but even trying to cover the numbers where we high just to give an understanding i did a study in schools it was called a childhood obesity prevention and schools program where i noted about 16 obesity in kids in india this this was a study in coimbatore and with adults if you really ask me one in four one in four are easily above the bmis of 30. so roughly about 25 percent of incidence is what we see again people coming for weight loss and non-weight loss and putting everything together together right so i think the one and four here in united states what i is it uh southern states and northern states or in there as you know with the united states everything is like two two times right either it is right left uh obese then either they are like so health conscious that they are like so lean if not they are like morbidly obese and in my practice at least one in uh two patients come with any problem with any gi problems um so it has been an ongoing issue as well so let me ask you this um so i have been in my channel i talking about you know please reduce the belly fat please reduce the belly fat and i don to me anymore so why don uh that what is the risk of having a belly back okay i think uh i pal wonderful and interesting but i think to make it simple for the namesake i don it actually yes so the next thing i haven seen the videos actually so coming coming coming on to the point about reduction of belly fat generally we believe disease is a disease when it is going to cause some trouble so for us diabetes is the disease cardiac issue is a disease ulcer is a disease but we don obesity as a disease and no obesity people think it is it is a sign of prosperity even but then obesity is a disease and no more than cobalt i mean after kovale realized the amount of the death percentage the highest biggest big number one morbidity to actually cause covert mortality was obesity because obesity is a disease by itself in fact it is a precursor of most of the diseases that we think is disease which is diabetes hypertension dyslipidemia menses issues pcod sleep apnea that you have knee pains back pains certain cancers are also predisposed by obesity like colon cancers and prostate cancers and breast cancers so treating obesity is not to look good but actually live so you don sugars and say my sugar i mean it is okay i your doctor and drink because you know tomorrow there could be ulcers in your legs your leg could be taken off same with obesity you can just become nobody in any day in fact most of the people who snore in the trains that you see are actually suffering from breathing difficulties there that they could die in their sleep in fact most obese people if they die in their sleep we we think he had a heart attack when he was sleeping no he actually died of a sleep apnea which is because of obesity so the disease by itself so to losing is to live so here right you know in what i see here is like the patients are like apple obesity type right they it i have been like reassuring or re-emphasizing the point that for indian ethnicity i think the problem is the fat is getting deposited in the belly don absolutely absolutely see i would actually compare the western the indians if you actually see the us guys they bottom it although central obesity is now catching up in a big way even in the united states the fat is more generalized so being obese means just not fat there is a lot of fat outside and they are also muscular because they eat a lot of meats but in india i wouldn but in the asian side the obesity is more central if you see the women it is more in the waste you see in the men it is more in the abdomen if you actually look at their legs you see that big punch coming for uh forward this central obesity is much more dangerous than uh generalized obesity take it from me anybody you see that having a huge abdominal fat just go and ask them are they having diabetes or hypertension nine out of ten they will have one of which because the central obesity is directly linked to metabolic disease which is diabetes hypertension or cholesterol so that is the dangerous aspect of it central adiposity is the belly fat that we central so basically the fat is inside the abdomen it actually touch the abdomen you will see the abdomen is very tight the fat is internal is internal around the intestines in the liver in the misentry so this internal fat gets swollen that increases the abdominal pressure that pushes the abdomen outside so you can actually touch the abdomen you feel like you so this is the dangerous aspect of it you remember you know like when i was obese i used to have this big chicken biryani and kanishka restaurant in coimbatore i know wherever there was unlimited meals you unlimited meals i know there was so much of a place for these unlimited meals so i think you were the ones you leading it so yes so you know so i think we even without our knowledge that has been like slowly creeping in so let realizes that okay you know what he is obese he has tried so many things and he patient walks up to your clinic and then what do you usually tell them in the first place how do you manage okay first the first of all i mean uh guys are watching this video what you need to understand is whenever you look at somebody obese in a cinema theater or in a mall or in a wedding first the normal mindset would be um that is what we tend to think and also we also think this is the first thought that comes to our mind because we always have been told to think somebody is obese means eats a lot first of all that is a misnomer let break the myth maybe we in the next couple of minutes but when i see a patient with obese as i told you it patients may not be eating more it could be many times you that you could see in your uh uh experience there are some people who eat a lot who don do any exercise but will be like thin there are people who eat right do their best possible but will be obese as such so first of all when i see a patient who differentiate is it hyperphagic obesity or metabolic obesity hyperphagic obesity means easy eating and actually is that responsible for his weight or no is he eating all right is there a poor metabolism that because the treatment will differ same bmi same age but if it is hyperphagic the treatment will be different but if it is metabolic the treatment would be different so this is the first thing we try to understand before we even further get into the treatment of it but but how do you how do you differentiate it based on the uh the eating habits you just ask them yes so basically we have certain questions where we try to look at or the simplest thing would be what is a food recall we tend to sit down because basically before i see the patient my dietician my bariatric coordinator sits with the patient this helps them understand where are the weakness areas are there so this could be starting from their eating patterns are they hyperphagic or many times polyphagic hyperphagic means volume eating polyphagic means frequent intake of high caloric foods or whether you normally eating so this is number one that could have psychological diseases by night eating they sleep they eating chocolate heads in the night they will not eat during the day but the night because they could be working in call centers they could be stressful work night eating could be there then we need to understand the psychological aspects are really stress are they depressed are they going through any personalization because stress makes them eat more so stress management is going to be very important then are they having any physical abnormalities like joint pains or back pains is it restricting their work etc because you cannot tell somebody osteoarthritis start doing exercises walking to with then comes understanding of the diseases like diabetes hypertension etc so with this story in the mind now we will tend to understand what is his actual pain bmi so the number doesn their problem you cannot just see a bmi of 40 and say this is going to be a treatment with this understanding then we start trailing the treatment if let say they eating well that is the problem you just need to counsel them sit down with them and make them understand you need to start reworking on your diet so the diet aspects have to be corrected first before even we start looking at anything but on the other end patient is eating a moderate eater not really high caloricator doing their best possible they have joint tissues there is a metabolic issue they have diabetes hypertension then we need to start getting them medical you cannot keep again telling them do diet do diet go for because we everybody go i mean these obese people get hundreds of advice from everywhere everybody in the wedding everybody in the mall comes and gives them advice [Laughter] so see basically that is what we need to understand before we even recommend a treatment you cannot just blindly go back and say come here the free advice please do not give there are doctors to actually help them so this is something we need to look at [Laughter] so okay so if a patient okay you have decided that his eating pattern is the reason for his obesity right and usually by the time he comes to you he will be like you know i i tried this keto diet i tried this paleo diet uh prime restriction something like that right um do you do surgery on them right away or you give them an option to try again under supervision and why not do so if not why not do surgery right away okay see first of all if they are uh see surgery is for somebody who wants to lose weight and is unable to lose weight it is not uh it not something for so somebody inaudible tried everything but who through the same thing maybe he getting the right results maybe he having medical issues meaning he reaching out for a surgery yes we can start considering a surgery but he like doctor so he then even if he even if he shouldn because he all they need to win a surgery the sense they they need i mean it is like they need to be so motivated that they need to win the winner surgery if they look it as a shortcut because tomorrow he also struggle i we don somebody who wants to lose that who trying or whatever reasons right you know i see these patients with you know uh weight of like 150 kilos 175 kilos and then i said you know why don gastric bypass and they already had doctor i was like how come you had this gastric bypass surgery and then you still have like 150 kilos right because the the behavior the mind style mindset the lifestyle has not changed so no matter what surgery he has he the same lifestyle and then just get you know fat again so unfortunately so not a great example as you say you have a wrong patient you have a wrong research that is what i said laziness absolutely absolutely um so you know nowadays people are actually choosing obesity surgery as an ls cesarean section date you know sometimes you know they change oh i want friday morning eight o on thursday evening five p.m obesity surgery [Laughter] people have unrealistic expectations sometimes i think it is in fact as a doctor i always say in a patient with surgery is not my responsibility my duty is to educate you make you understand what it is now you choose what is it right for you come and get it done in fact doctors we shouldn should be advising them educate them let them go sit down with their family take a call and come back in fact so now what has happened is after so many years of practice 90 of our patients who actually come come properly educated who knows that they are the candidate in fact i saw one since morning i patients every everybody had come pre-motivated for the surgery patients just walking in telling a surgery going and thinking about it has actually gone down because literature is there everywhere now they exactly know when to come and when not to come our duties only become like not doing it on a bad page if i see a bad patient i tell them you change this and come back under three months let take a call so that is that is how things have changed so you have a protocol you know to follow before uh committing to the surgery very true see again if you choose a wrong patient the sufferer is not going to be only him but also you because one you will have because post surgery see surgery is not like an end it is a starting point of a new phase so this requires a committed lifestyle from the patient support by the family and the multi-disciplinary team from rn who will work along with the patient so if you have a bad patient the whole family will struggle our team will also struggle at the end of the day at the end of the day why we lose weight to improve the quality of life let for example he at the same time we are forcing him weight loss might be happening but he will not be happy guy for that let him eat happily and die happily we can just leave it off instead of bringing it in and all of us struggle so choosing the right patient is something very very important in our practice in fact many of the training programs this is what i teach our fellow colleagues also just because the patient is coming and asking for sorry please do not do you will have a nightmare so tell me you have been talking about the right patient in your mind what is the right patient right patient is one who realizes that he needs to lose weight and is doing his best possible see the best is completely subjective the best possible to his capacities i mean you cannot expect to be 100 but at least 75 80 percent who wants to lose and is understanding weight loss is just not to look good but to live a longer and a healthier life this is the right patient for you because he get out of this pain now you need to help him and you constantly keep telling him do this do this he might actually get into depression because yeah you what you it holding here when that breaking point is there because many times what happens is the family members keep them pushing pushing pushing pushing and nothing really happens diet they would have tried they would have tried walking they would have tried palliative i mean whatever thing that they pray nothing really happens at one point they get fed up they throw everything they become depressed and they start eating too much then they they stop taking advices they stop realizing it start fighting with everybody if you go into this phase then that even more dangerous it why i said do not give free advice you do not know which stage they are in so if they are already in that face that pushes them into depression because it is not that they do not want but they could not could not right right so surgery is not a bad thing you know sometimes people think that oh you know surgery obesity surgery i know i able to reduce it but sometimes no matter what we do sometimes we just cannot reduce it so so um the other patient population is when they have medical problems right like you know you said i snoring what are the other medical problems that people can think about obesity surgery okay so i think one of the uh there are two or three conditions that important more than obesity that we consider when we offer a bariatric surgery is one uncontrolled diabetes i think in the indian subcontinent india is uh coming there although not great thing to be the world leader in diabetes see having diabetes is not a wrong thing but having an uncontrolled diabetes a bad thing because many patients think having an average i medications regularly in a sugar controller can matrix my question was whether it control because they following whether the sugars are in control so uncontrolled diabetes is one indication for bariatric because post bariatric diabetes can be even reversed back to normal the second aspect that we commonly see today for bariatric is pcod or menstrual irregularities in the young girls or they married having an infertility that is related to pcod or obesity that second very common condition that we recent times that patients are actually coming for bariatric so post bariatric their infertility actually goes down most of them can get pregnant normally the third important the life threatening condition why we operate is obstructive sleep apnea they have severe snoring at night their oxygen levels go down carbon dioxide starts going up they have a poor sleep and they wake up in the morning they have daytime sleepiness many of them could who into accidents the quality of sleep is gone the quality of life itself is gone so getting them treated from obstructive sleep happening is a third important condition that we offer bariatric and lastly with regard to joint tissues like lower back pain or knee knee issues they go to the ortho position or the position changes the knee but the obesity is not changed and the knee pain tends to continue full on itself so that another reason see that right now you have arthritis you go to the orthopedic surgeon the best treatment is to go back to you to get the bariatric surgery done rather than knee replacement because if not the new knee is going to have the same problem again absolutely good okay so now uh so let you have identified the right candidate so what kind of surgeries that you offer and you do and then can you just briefly say what it is exactly in layman terms i mean in my [Laughter] well you are you are now the experts expert for everything starting from covered to either export but at least with regard to medicine so basically everyone has solution bariatric surgery is a treat treatment aimed at weight reduction and its related co-morbidities again the coma i just mentioned so the surgeries are done primarily in the stomach and the intestines or both there are many types depending on the patient condition we choose the right thing to the right patient the intent is to modify the intestinal hormonal profile so that their metabolism or thermal aeroplatin because most of the obesity is not linked to just hypereating hyperphagic eating but because of a poor metabolic capacity so because of this hormonal changes that we cause in the intestines the metabolic rate or the metabolism tends to get improved and it is because of this improved metabolism all diseases connected to metabolism tends to improve the obesity diabetes hypertension and cholesterol dimension and more importantly after surgery you may not be able to eat beyond the point every time your capacity will be restricted so the aim is not to make you eat less but not to uh eat you i mean make you eat more at any point of time on an overall scale throughout the day you will eat 80 to 90 of the past but then you cannot overeat even if you want to eat so that otherwise the whole thing tends to get broken so this is the primary phenomenon of bariatric surgery so that is why as i repeatedly said this is primarily for somebody who able to lose weight we improve the metabolism by changing the hormonal profile you know we read about gastric bypass surgery we read about sleeve gastrectomy all these are different kinds of surgeries but in in simple terms so either ways you are going to cut down the size of the stomach either by approximating on itself or just connecting to a different angle is it right absolutely absolutely so that is the way it is done but physiologically there are different mechanisms but in simple terms yes we cut a portion of the stomach or we cut a small pouch and then bypass it to the intestines in that there are certain other varieties depending on whether they are more obese less diabetic or less diabetic more i mean more diabetic sobs or the combination of both we tailor it there are different combinations of this that can be done so i have seen so many patients because you know people follow up with gastroenterology after the gastric bypass surgery right so i can tell you that so many patients who had heartburn problems uh abdominal bloating problems you know invent diabetes as you said gastroparesis when the stomach is not contracting properly all those disappear in most of the patients that i can actually vouch for it um so i would say like 90 of the time actually people do get i mean like a night and day difference after the surgery sometimes isn can you share a patient experience that you cannot forget where they have a life changing experience after they made a decision one patient honestly you know the main reason i took a bariatric surgery itself was the change of life that we were able to give in literally every patient because every patient have a story of their own every single patient because uh when they see in fact so if they are choosing that and coming the pain that they are going through is big many times even the family members do not understand the pain in fact fifty percent of uh the female patient that i actually have a have have a conversation and the husband will look at them so surprisingly because husband would always be telling her to you lazy you everybody has a story but starting from for example one of these patients i mean i remember such it about 10 years back who was suffering from pcod was having continuous bleeding every day for the last two years and the hemoglobin is almost about eight nine because she was having pcod continuous bleeding every day see i have seen a lot of pcod patients they normally don come with so much of breeding they come with lesser bleeding they come with diabetes etc but this was a little different which every day imagine a young unmarried girl having a bleeding every day is such a nightmare for her the only reason she came to beretra doctor if you my gynecologist told me only bariatric surgery is going to help i was like i have seen bariatrics work but i have not seen bariatrics working for people like so much of bleeding stopping completely i actually did not have give her any confidence see i sure about so much of bleeding let take a call let you confidence it telling so i months post bariatric she came back and said doctor after two years i normal menses after two years she wasn that greatly obese but imagine that i mean we might look at it differently imagine a female she was actually working as a manager in a bank so which means she was a working woman herself so i think i think that is one story just comes to me story is the regard to post-marriage infertility for many years i think there years of infertility went around everywhere he television channels finally we did a bariatric one and a half years later she conceived normally and finally had a baby i think so these are all stories sometimes makes you give so much of confidence thinking yeah you are on the right track you things for your patients so that is what is driving us on no absolutely absolutely you know the joy that you see after surgery i don unmatched in any field right you know i can talk a lot about belly fat and everything but actually you surgery and post surgical intervention that is a separate feeling by the way to the audience we always had this debate between me and him during the medical college that i always say medicine is better and he always says surgery is better and then finally i to him that you know bariatric surgery actually works you know normally the patients a lot of them have this fear when they come for surgery i tell them see this is like a cesarean section yes you for the surgery but when you out there will be pleasure when you walk out of the hospital it similar to that although yes you might fear about having a surgery but the outcomes are going to be enjoyable outcomes are going to be pleasurable so that is what you need to look out for absolutely absolutely so let me just put these things in perspective right so we are not saying that you know every obese patient should go into bariatric surgery that is not the idea so the idea is you try your best that is the key thing you know even if you go to praveen and you know he you would have not given the best uh effort that you put in so what do you tell your patients i mean my channel audience what do you say if they are trying to lose weight what is your recommendation in general yeah the first point is realize you need to lose weight first of all understand what is the weight is because many of them do not know what their weight is only so check your weight check your bmi uh motivate yourself that you have to lose your weight it is not impossible but it is difficult start initiatives so that may be yes if you can reach out to the right specialist don shortcut centers go to a right specialist it could be a fitness trainer it could be a dietitian or it could be doctors like us we would take you through the scientific methods of it and in the scientific methods of it yes depending on your weighing scale your mood again we cannot do magic without your support your so we need to work together yes at the right times we would ensure what things need to be done maybe it or maybe medical management or endoscopic therapies or maybe even a bariatric surgery because it ladder pattern but the end of the day the realization to lose weight is the most important thing you know absolutely absolutely so um i so i a good discussion um the key point that i wanted to convey is that you know we try as much as possible with all the techniques you know time restricted feeding that i channel just one of the methods you can try whatever method that you want but whatever works for you is the best method for weight loss but let the worst case scenario you do all these things and maximum measures you cannot lose weight you don miserable life we have like fantastic surgeons like dr previn raj all over the world to offer this bariatric surgery again it right patient and i next covert pandemic soon hopefully hopefully not right yeah i i mean so let me just close this by uh close this session by asking you this um you you know snoring pc overs and diabetes right there are like so much untoward uh complication that we might not even think about we just briefed about cancer since your center is a pancreatic cancer excellence i mean pancreatic cancer center of excellence i want you to touch briefly about how obesity causes pancreatic cancer okay see with regard to obesity it represents of fat in your body and this fat can have a chronic low-grade inflammation and when this chronic low-grade inflammation can actually produce tumorogenic factors which can potentially lead to development of not just pancreatic pancreas means kanaya it cancer of course obesity is not the only reason for development of pancreatic cancer but obesity is one of the important predisposing factors for development of pancreatic cancer yes there are other things like genetic issues alcoholic issues except many times unknown issues also so just presence of extra fat in your body itself is not good fat is good see it is not that fat is a bad thing fat in moderate amounts in your body is always right but when fat goes beyond excess see muscles cannot grow beyond an excess your bone cannot go beyond an excess your water cannot grow beyond dinner but fat goes beyond an excess then that gets into a phase of inflammation and this inflammation can predispose to metabolic diseases and cancer and that is why obesity is one of the predisposing factors like pancreatic cancer at the abdomen breast cancers for women prostate cancer in men and colon cancers in both men and women obesity has definitely a link to play again it doesn weight i mean in a thin patient these cancers are not going to come it so yes it can still come but this is one of the important predisposing factors so that is why as i again said obesity is just not about looking good it to live the vlogger live longer live longer and you know whatever life that we have we have to make sure the quality of life is good uh as well you know i might die in a couple of years so i want to make sure that whatever quality of life i have i don hospital i don medications i don that is the main reason it has to be a behavioral lifestyle change but anyways thank you thank you so much for all your time i know you are a very busy surgeon at least that people but again you know my audience please check out dr praveen just google it he has written so many articles he president of so many associations but the only thing i know that he was the president of our cultural club when i was in the college just a trivial fact we had two two classes of dancers tier one dances is him and his other colleagues and the tier two dancers is me [Laughter] but anyway so good to talk to you again i channel for future updates as well again thank you so much thanks so much for your time thank you thank you thank you wonderful see you see you bye	Success

GUT BACTERIA - How to USE this to lose weight? | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjUsX6acMko	Dr Pal	hello guys this is uh dr paul never manikam you have tried so many things to lose weight but you still can lose weight you might not be the problem your gut might be the bacteria in your gut might be the culprit and that is why i here to say don dive deep into it [Music] so since my time restricted feeding video i that i lost 10 kilograms of my weight i lost 5 kilos of my belly fat i lost 2 kilos of my disappointment i that you guys were able to make the change because it has been three to four months so it has become a habit now and you don that much so since we have nailed down this concept of time restricted feeding all the other steps that we are going to discuss in this channel is about further measures on top of this time restrictive feeding bottom line my friend sarah no kumar keeps complaining that day i have done everything possible i am not able to lose weight and he eating chicken biryani in the middle of the night that too right in front of me if you done everything possible to decrease weight including cutting your hair reducing your head weight and losing out your mind and still you cannot lose weight then problem might not be you it might be your gut bacteria the human intestine has 100 trillion microorganisms like bacteria fungi viruses these are all complex interconnected species together we call this as gut bacteria or gut microbiome out of this hundred trillion microbes some have good bacteria and some are bad bacteria and obviously we need good bacteria to be more in our small intestine for the overall health for example imagine our body as a water theme park an intestines or the complex inter-tunneled water slides through which all the good and bad bacteria are sliding every day and having the time of their life we want the good bacteria to take the water slide back go up to the start and then start doing the tunneling thing again but the bad bacteria has to be kicked out every body has a unique composition of bacteria and it on multiple factors including what you eat how you eat when you eat whether you sleep exercise or watch netflix it is almost similar to marriage you know the spouse that you get is based on your likes dislikes comments and the common facebook groups that you share if it was my mom she will take me to the astrologer and ask him what is the good bacteria for palm so what does this gut bacteria do they do so many things including regulating the immunity but the most important thing that they do is to help us digest the food particles which we cannot digest with the enzymes given by god my friend saruna kumar is asking can this digest the stones in the rash and rice i said given a chance this will digest you itself so for example when you eat dosa the enzymes provided by the god is being secreted by salivary glands stomach pancreas and liver and all these enzymes digest almost like 95 of the dosa but the remaining five person is out of syllabus to the body so all those out of syllabus questions will be answered by this gut bacteria i think my wife needs this because she keeps on saying i can digest all your so-called jokes she will need this so when they are digesting these foods they provide you additional calories as well so when you calories you need to account for those uncounted calories as well that might be the reason that you might not be losing weight so basically we are doing the math wrong when we are hitting a plateau we should get our math right to get into the weight loss valley and start the journey my friend saranna kumar was like daynara platyu valley a princility you are mounting up my pressure mounting up so to prove this let me tell you uh first research experiment i was involved in when i first came to united states we took like 50 patients with obesity and gave them like low calorie diet and physical activity and exercise for 12 weeks three months so after three months like 20 people did not lose weight at all but reminding 30 did notice some kind of weight changes so we took the stool specimen of the people who did not lose weight and looked under the microscope and then see what kind of gut bacteria that they have i was given the job of collecting the stool specimen in this research study because i was the most junior most person i still remember this very distinctly because 10 years ago when i came in my mom was like telling all the relatives that my son pal is doing amazing things so many seeing so many people and seeing so many things and i was collecting stools visible the most interesting part of the study is that the bacteria that is seen on these people who did not lose weight was significantly different from the bacteria in the people that actually lost weight that is why we thought about probably the gut bacteria plays a role in weight loss as well so this study proves that despite your maximum effort of diet control and exercise some patient population might not lose weight because of their gut bacteria because their gut bacteria is not just bad it is evil this might not be the 99.99 percentage bacteria that harpic kills this might be the remaining 0.1 percent so that brings us to the next question how do we know what kind of bacteria we have in the small intestine and whether we know how much good bacteria we have that is a million dollar question research is in progress in 10 years from now i can guarantee you that every individual will have their own unique composition of bacteria and people will be like which bacteria you have so once we figure this out eventually i have an idea i bisilimatrimony.com where all the bacteria from all the different communities can upload their picture and the tagline is marry me if you have guts though we still don individual species of bacteria whether it is good or bad we do know that a certain category of good bacteria in certain category of bad bacteria and we our stool specimens as well if we are interested so thank you ombre for sponsoring this video ombre is a company that could actually tell you what kind of good bacteria and bad bacteria that you have in your stool what they do is they send a kit like this to your home and then it has a stool specimen collection kit as well it has all the instructions of how you can do this and once you are done they are going to give you a detailed prescription of what kind of good bacteria and bad bacteria you have and what you can do to improve that by based on probiotic supplementation so due to the fact that you might be eating lunch or eating dinner i took the liberty to skip the process of how to collect the school sample you could order these ombre test kits this is available here in america and canada and the link is in the description yes this is a sponsored video but i have used this test before on few of my patients in the past as well and you know that the sponsored amount will go to our ishwarium trust in madurai and you should contribute as well if you think that you this video that brings us to the next question that how we can make sure that we have good bacteria in the small intestine it is all about lifestyle it is not something that happens overnight it is not like something like a pill that i can give to you so you your bad bacteria all disappears and it gets populated with good bacteria within five days it is a long term lifestyle change it takes at least six months to one year instead of focusing on what you can eat to promote the good bacteria the easiest thing is to do is to what to avoid to promote the good bacteria so not only weight loss this gut bacteria research is extrapolated into multiple fields including autism any mental health disorders including immunity dysregulation every aspect of the body will boil down to this gut bacteria it is going to be a huge thing 10 years from now and i can see that on the preliminary research device the first thing that you should avoid is avoid processed or ultra processed food what i mean by that is avoid anything that comes in a packet or in a box which is processed from its natural form i want you to look into the ingredients and if that food contains any of these following number one high fructose corn syrup number two mono sodium glutamate msg number three artificial flavor number four artificial sweeteners number five artificial color anything artificial is not good for you because your intelligence might be artificial as well eventually so it is like you good bacteria but with all these ingestion your small intestinal bacteria becomes artificial to further explain this i am an indian i came here to united states 10 years ago this is almost like my body is indian but i have a fake american accent like hey what oh my god you something get out of here whatever i do i will never get this american exit or it might be the other way around having a fake tamil accent like mean actually sunday movie from netflix so after avoiding all these processed food the second thing that you can avoid is non-vegetarian i know you are going to close the channel right away i told this to my friend saran kumar he was like instead of not eating non-veg it is better to starve and i said that is a good idea as well so he a pure non-vegetarian to a point that he avoids non separately and avoids vegetarian separately he doesn anything that is stationary he always eats that flies that runs that swims it has been shown in multiple studies that plant-based diet improves the gut bacteria significantly to a point that it helps in weight loss it decreases the risk of heart attacks and also it increases your immunity animal-based diet is considered to be non-inferior to plant-based diet but no study have shown that animal diet is actually superior to plant-based diet if you burn the processed food and non-vegetarian food your gut bacteria will take care of burning the calories not eating non-vegetarian is like a very difficult task for me as well so i started slowly by eating just one non-vegetarian meal per week so there are 21 meals per week three times a day seven days a week so 21 meals so you can start with just focusing on one meal per week of having non-vegetarian and then see whether you can decrease the frequency as much as possible so having good bacteria in your gut is not a short-term disneyland movie lasting for hour and a half it is like the indian tamil tv series like pandian stores which has episodes after episodes at least the good bacteria journey will end party in stores will not so call for action is two things number one i want you to review your daily food intake and then see whether you are taking any of this on a daily basis number one any cake or any bakery products number two biscuits number three any snacks savory snacks number four microwave ready meals number five bread number six breakfast cereals these are just examples but you can look into your daily food intake and then see what is what are the other items that i might have missed and you can list down in the comment section so you will understand all these are processed especially when it comes in a box or package content because they need to add some preservative to extend the lifespan of that ingredient number two my friend saran kumar is doing a protest for the fact that i ask him not to eat non-vegetarian food i can guarantee you that any kind of protest he does he will never do fasting protest i wanted to ask you whether it is reasonable to ask your family members and friends to have or limit one meal per week to non-vegetarian meal what do you think about it i from you uh stay safe get vaccinated all this is for the project one belly at a time it is absolutely important as usual just an update from our isurium trust is that we have few more family members joined in our community we are expanding from a 50-bit hospital to a another 50-bit hospital right next to each other in villa cheri madurai if you want to contribute please do so the link is in the description and we can make this world better together i will see you in the next video bye	Success

How to Lose STUBBORN belly fat ? - Episode 1 | #Losebellywithdrpal challenge | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWF9vI2sJPc	Dr Pal	hello guys this is Dr pal manik in the previous video I have mentioned that my goal is to decrease my body fat percentage from 28 to 17 and my decrease my belly fat waste circumference by April 2023 after making that video I was like then I looked at my previous favorite t-shirt that I had which said I love Goa and it which is small in size the shoulder size is small but the belly size is XXL so then it really hit me hard that if I don together and if I end up getting heart attack or diabetes down the road this mistake is unforgivable so I came up with a detailed plan that is what I discuss in this video Let into [Music] it so the first thing that you should understand is what is skinny fat as you guys all know I was obese before please check out my previous video about calorie restrictions and time restricted feeding that I did that is how I decrease my weight but not the belly fat after seeing the thumbnail of the video people were like whether this guy lost weight or lost hair so my we circum confence was 102 cm before it came down to 91 CM with time restricted feeding but it is not moving an inch after because I so I have done all kinds of techniques including holding the breath like this but when I breathe out my belly pops out as if my body is blowing out a bubble gum so what I actually need is called body fat recomposition and that is what we video so the kind of obesity what I having is called apples shaped obesity where the fat is getting deposited in the belly there is another kind of obesity called pearshaped obesity where it is deposited in the lower abdomen and thighs apples shaped obesity is much much harmful than the pear-shaped obesity they say an apple a day keeps the doctor away if you have apples shaped obesity the doctor should be in your bedroom so what is the solution to this the treatment is you lose fat and build muscle how do we do that as you know fat is because of excess calories so you have to decrease the calorie intake muscle needs more calories so building muscle will need protein Rich calories so let me explain this by using me as an example so let requirement is 1,900 calories using my basil metabolic rate calculator the link will be in the description and based on that if I have to lose fat I need to go a little bit less than my required calories let calories then I will lose fat slowly so then to build muscle I need to make sure that among the 1,700 calories I need at least 30% of protein intake so let the math 30% of 1700 calories comes around 500 calories 1 g of protein gives you 4 calories so if you divide 500 by 4 you will need at least 125 g of protein per day very proud of my Max so if I take 30% protein the remaining 70% will be a split between carbohydrates and fats I have prefer to be on 40% carbs and 30% fat plus 30% protein as we discussed my friend SAR Kumar was like if I have to get this mixed can I mix Arabic dish with a kotu B called Arabic kotu I was like if you keep on eating like this I funeral for the song Arabic so there muscle building it not only needs protein it also needs some kind of stimulation you need to do some kind of resistance training like weightlifting or body weight training protein along with resistance training will build muscle protein alone will will not do anything my friend SAR Kumar is like I exercising my mind every day on social media will I get a sixpack all he gets is a six-pack in his chin so to achieve my goal it is very simple I need to decrease my calories and make sure that within the calories I eat adequate amount of protein and I at least do three times a week of resistance training by weightlifting so after seeing my goal my friend sarak Kumar went to the gym I saw him post workout he was walking like pushpa ALU Arjun SRI song so all this will take time so take it very slowly don your doctor as well for me my body fat is 28% to decrease to 177% it is going to take at least one year of my plan why do I want to do this why do I want to go through all this pain because I know that the outcome is excellent once I reach my goal My Sleep Quality will be better my basil metabolic rate is increased so that I feel active throughout the day I will not feel drowsy as I afternoon and also I don about these constant calorie intake every day because muscles burn more calories than anything and more importantly this is an investment that I increases the chances of me being alive for them until they turn 18 years of age the secondary reason I really want to do this is because my four-year-old son Arjun thinks that his mom has delivered two sons and he looks at my belly and thinks that I baby to play with him so many people are asking why now because I am 38 years of age as age advances the likelihood of building muscle goes down you have to put more than twice the amount of efforts when you go beyond 40 to build muscle I it is definitely possible you just have to put in a lot more effort so for me at this time it is a relatively easier option to put this work now rather than waiting to turn 40 and then work on it so before 40 you can Bend It Like Beckham but after 40 you not only have to Bend It Like Beckham but also have to bend it like his father so my friend SAR is asking what are you going to do with all this are you going to live 100 years it is not a point of living up to 100 years even if we live up to 10 years we shouldn all about quality of life since I gave my word to you guys in the last video my friend s has been forwarding this video to all his friends and relatives with the caption so here is my plan for the next 1 year I years old my Weist circumference is 91 cm and I weigh only 70 kilos or 155 lb so for the body fat recomposition I need to start with my first step of calculating basil metabolic rate everybody has their own basil metabolic rate you can calculate that with simple variables you could drop that in the equation given in the description below so for me it comes around 1,900 calories as we talked about before we need to do fat loss first by decreasing the calorie restriction so I 1700 calories so the second step is out of the 1,700 calories I need to determine my macros macros means protein fat and carbohydrates I have decided that I protein and 25% fat it will differ based on your goals and fitness levels as well but this can be done easily by tracking down any kind of app My Fitness Pal e healthify me there are so many apps available again a word of caution My Fitness Pal is not my app at all so I have done this multiple times before but the problem is while you are very disciplined your mom will come and say that can you eat this muru just for me and your wife will come and say that can you eat this panaram just for me and they would have applied 30% reservation in your stomach for snacks already please hold that petition for one year so the third step which is the most important step is I need to plan the diet well in advance for example tomorrow is Monday then you plan your diet on Sunday evening regarding your breakfast lunch and dinner what you are going to eat and you prepopulate that in this app so that at least you will have an idea so I have in mind for the next week so let see that together so let the macros portion first in my fitness pal if you look into it you could clearly see the number of macros based on the calorie 1700 I for now so that will give me 30% as 128 g of protein so I am planning for my day tomorrow so if you look at on the top it says tomorrow and if you look at breakfast I have included eggs milk sugar snacks as dates around like 10:00 a.m. some broccoli some lentil Dal all this adds up to 474 calories for breakfast and for lunch it heavy 752 uh which means I know I have tofu walaka pu Al CH broccoli avocado remember only like half of it because avocado was Heavy in calories and for dinner I have shrimp Masala Roti uh fruit kiwi and whenever you are including shrimp or any kind of Masala you should also add olive oil to it or oil calories to it so that you don forget the number of calories so if I do that that I have 1727 calories which is slightly above 1,700 but I will still take it and if you look at my total intake for the day protein is 135 carbs is 174 slightly above fat is 59 remember this is just an anticipated dietary chart if I can stick to it it is well and good if I go above and beyond it is okay as well I strict on it initially uh because I need to get on regimen first my friend s Kumar is asking does spitting saliva count as decreasing the calories I said yes only if you look up and spit so once you figure out the dietry chart the fourth step is to how to incorporate strength training in your routine so I have went to gym I have hired a personal trainer I spent so much money on it already personal trainers love me because I sign up and I just don all um so I don again so whatever that works out for you please look for basic exercises like you know push-ups something to deal with resistance training and strength training and I at least 3 days a week let us talk about it in detail in the next video so remember all your goals have to be realistic I cannot shoot for like 5 days a week and I know that I will not be able to do it given my busy Hospital schedule but 3 days a week if I can push I can definitely do it in a week so I asked my friend SAR Kumar to listen to motivation songs during workout in gym he is dosing off in gym because he listening to Il Raja Melody songs at 5:00 a.m. in the morning it sounds a lot isn to calculate my calories I need to lift weights and do resistance training that is why it takes time but it can be definitely doable all you need is to plan well in advance I week so I regarding what day I if if you see somebody in the car trying to lift weights that might be me so again start very slowly you don to do all the steps that I discussed whatever works for you start very slowly it is going to take some time until you get in cruise control you need to figure out all the factors in this equation and trust me if you are at it it will all fall in the same track just the fact that I have to make a weekly video to update you regarding my progress makes me more accountable listen to yourself and then see what will make you more accountable maybe replying as a comment to this video or sending me an email regarding your progress or whatever works for you you have to have an accountability factor and also the reason why you are doing this we can do this together if you are still not motivated I government to implement a fat tax rate if your body fat percentage is more than 25% I more tax on your income tax so remember whatever you do you need to enjoy the process you can push yourselves you have to push yourself to an extent but you don find that fine line because if you don find that it is not sustainable so it is going to take some time initially it is going to be very difficult but I can guarantee you that if you do this daily for at least 4 weeks all this will fall in place so don thing is don do not even look into your weighing scale for 3 months because nothing is going to happen after 3 months you will definitely see results visibly so the fact that I uh I can tell you my difficulties during the week what are the stuff that I doing what are the uh challenges that I let weekly videos will be grouped under a playlist called weekly progress and I want you to join that as well so people who have joined the loose fat with Dr pal challenge this is the homework for you you need to do the first two steps what is your calculated basil metabolic rate using the equation given in the description number two you need to go 200 calories less to start with and then start jotting down regarding what you are eating every day I have linked my my previous video explaining this in detail in the description link as well and regarding the third step of anticipating your dietary chart the day before I will leave it up to you if you you can do it the same thing will go with your fourth step of weight training as well again take it very slow you have to push yourself but to a very fine line you need to enjoy the process time restricted F the most important thing is throughout this process I will be maintaining the Tim restricted feeding as well sticking to my eating window and I would highly recommend you to do that as well I know that you can do this I know that I can do this with the help of you some people want it happen some people wish it happen some people make it happen I want our subscribers to the last category of people who can make it happen we can do this together I video bye-bye	Success
WHEN to BREAK-FAST for maximum weight loss? #losebellywithdrpal | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWXl76QOybY	Dr Pal	hello guys this is uh dr palani parmanikam the biggest question on time restricted feeding is whether we can skip breakfast or when should we eat breakfast you know people say that eat breakfast like a king my friend sarah is like eating breakfast like a king lunch like king of kings and for dinner he eats on behalf of the entire kingdom by himself so to understand whether this court eat breakfast like a king is actually true we need to understand how our hormones work let it [Music] see the most common question that i get is whether i can skip breakfast but nobody is asking whether i can skip dinner because we have tuned to our lifestyle in such a way that dinner has been the most important meal and i think that is the main reason for obesity and all health related problems if we can skip that i can guarantee you that i will not have a job see with all these technical advances we shouldn where we came from two billion years ago so long ago that nobody even knows how long ago we were just a single celled organism called mitochondria we were all otta rosa so what we did at that time this single cell mitochondria we were at the bottom of the ocean we were having a nice snap when the sun comes up we came up with the help of the sunlight we were able to see our food like plant debris and we ate nicely we were lecturing along the surface of the water as if we were in hawaii and when sun sets down we went back down we had a good night up again in the morning when the sun came up as well this is what has been going on two billion years ago so then we evolved slowly one cell became two cell two cell became four cell four cell became eighteen such a sixteen cell that became into a whole human body but we still stuck to the same concept of when the sun rises we also woke up and when the sun sets down we also sit down the problem is that now we are a complete human body which means that we are changing the norm of life we are active only after the sun sets down look at all these late night clubs all the dining restaurants open mainly for dinner the problem is during the dinner time we turn all the artificial lights on we have a heavy meal as if it is a poor medical festival ministry of food with all these changes we are evolving into a different species instead of growing vertically we are growing horizontally and people are calling god as water the problem is whenever we eat the stomach secretes acid to digest the food in addition to the food digestion the acid is actually damaging the lining of the stomach we call it this mucosa ten percent of the stomach lining is damaged with each meal because it is an acid remember acid being poured on your face it is going to irritate somehow that ten percent of the damage has to be repaired so you need to give some time for the body to repair for the stomach lining it takes five hours similar to that small intestine large intestine your liver pancreas all needs time to rest after having a heavy meal our body is like vadiveli my family total damage please yeah i some time to repair yeah so our creator is very very smart he is actually helping us in the repair process by giving us a hormone called melatonin when the sun sets down melatonin increases and this is the start of the repair process of all the damage that we have done during the day melatonin is trying to sing the ile raja song making us sleep very peacefully but when we eat food we are trying to make our stomach into a chola hotel during that repair time at night if you start eating your hormones gets confused and you actually waking up the hormones to make it work without their concern this is the actual hashtag me too moment so timing of our food should correlate with the melatonin secretion in the body in our body melatonin secretes around the time of sunset around like 5 to 6 pm it slowly peaks at 10 11 pm and dies down slowly at 6 7 am when you are trying to wake up and it lingers around for one to two hours after you wake up as well melatonin is completely gone out of your body one hour after you wake up during the circadian rhythm of melatonin if you force your body to work by giving its food it will protest by not completing the digestion process it is actually following communism protest we should also follow communism if you are completely satisfied with two at least the other italy should go to the other person vijay delek so when the sun is up melatonin goes down completely disappears out of the body it takes rest and when the sun sets around 6 pm 7 pm in the evening melatonin slowly comes to rise and this is what we call as a circadian rhythm of sunlight and melatonin and the most interesting concept is if you look at the digestive hormones peak of the circadian rhythm it follows the sunlight as well like a beautiful bell-shaped cup it slowly starts in the morning peaks up at like around noon or 2 p.m and then slowly dies down so if we can follow the same method it would be amazing so this will answer your question when you should eat the breakfast you should eat your first bite after melatonin is completely gone out of your body which is one hour after you wake up let 30 a.m you should not have your first bite until 7 30 a.m mainly the coffee i think our decline started with people who invented bed coffee so as soon as you wake up from bed if you drink coffee melatonin will be so much angry on you is that how dare you can wake me up while i it is like evicting muthu rajini using sarath babu melatone and it so the answer is very very simple you just follow the bell-shaped curve of your digestive hormones so you should not have your first bite at least one hour after you wake up and then have a light breakfast because your digestive hormones are slowly peeking up and you can have a heavy lunch and then when your hormones die down you could have a light dinner as early as possible so instead of the coat eat breakfast like a king i remember raj kiran who indian tamil actor who eating heavy meals i this quote so eat breakfast like a cinema heroine eat lunch like raj kiran eat dinner like raj kiran because if raj kiran eats everything heroin will not get anything so the other question i always get is whether we can skip breakfast skipping breakfast is not a very good idea there is multiple research show that skipping breakfast might be associated with some kind of cardiac disease so skipping breakfast is not a very good idea but you can extend the fasting period as much as possible and you can have a very light breakfast following the circadian rhythm of our digestive hormones my friend sarah nakamura is like i ate three dosa four italy five chapati and one pongal with sambar as you suggested a very light breakfast he whole concept of this time restricted feeling is you shouldn you should push yourself a little bit but you should not feel miserable so it is okay to take break first keep it as light as possible and you can focus all your energy on lunch my friend sarah is like what is life without a second show movie a midnight biryani and a parotta with salna at 2 am he doesn that parota at 2 am is the actual end title card for his life movie i very curious to know when is your first bite after you wake up is it one hour after or is it one second after please write down in the comment section so as mentioned before i on my weekly progress uh fat loss journey and if you think that you have gotten some benefit out of this video please consider donating to ishwarium trust the link is below this is a trust to help hospice care patients back in madurai so please follow future

Shane Warne heart attack - Lessons to be learned | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbyRV0ssIsQ	Dr Pal	i that shane one has passed away due to possible heart attack he greatest of all time every cricket lover would have imitated his leg spinning bowling action at least once and he has definitely created significant changes and he is a inspiration to most of us and may his soul rest in peace so we don know is he was found unresponsive in the house and we are expecting possibly it could be a massive heart attack but i making this quick video about this issue because media is taking this news in a wrong way they are projecting as of shane want enrolled in a heavy weight loss program and because he exerted too much he had heart attack and he died before it gets spiraled out i want to dive deep into it and make sure that all the myths are busted so it is true that shane one himself has tweeted 10 days ago that no time to get into shape target is july and he was so excited to get back into the same shape what he was in when he was actually playing so people are thinking that because he exerted himself during this workout he had a heart attack i it is absolutely not true completely so let legendary cricket players saurav ganguly muttayam or litharan and shane want all had heart attacks at a different level of severity and unfortunately shane one passed away both sauro ganguly and muthyam oligaran did survive a heart attack and by placing a small stent in the heart see the karma denominator for all these three players is they were fit while they were playing but after they retired they did put on a little bit of a belly fat in some cases it might be a little bit too much in addition the stress that they were in while playing is not a factor to ignore because stress increases cortisol levels and cortisol is the single most important hormone that will make you develop belly fat thinking that you will need this fat in future and in addition to all this unfortunately shame one also has a history of alcohol use in the past alcohol use has been shown to deposit belly fat very easily compared to a patient who don talked about the exact same topic a year ago when saurabh ganguly developed a heart attack that belly fat is absolutely important if your waist circumference is more than 100 centimeters in men there are increased risk of heart disease and also sudden cardiac death as well i want to bring up five important points as we can use the situation to create awareness because shane warner is near and dear to all of us again it is with the full disclaimer that i exactly don but in general these are the five points that we should work on if our waist circumference is more than 100 centimeters especially in men number one alcohol use and excess calories by overeating these are the two main factors for belly fat accumulation and if you meet the criteria including women if your waist circumference is more than 90 centimeters you need to stop these two right away and number two is the most important point weight training and weight lifting is absolutely important over exertion is not the reason for heart attack in most of the cases in very rare situations where there is a condition called hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy where they are genetically born with an abstracted ventricular output where the blood flow is blocked in that situation over exertion might be a reason but that is extremely rare it is not common and that is not the reason for many of the deaths that we are seeing and number three the most important point is research have shown that steroids have been used in a shorter period of time to promote you know bulkiners and making sure that they are fit in a short span of time which has significant deleterious effect on the body including causing heart attacks you know and all these artificial supplements we don contains especially steroids can cause untoward side effects that we don know what can happen so please don take me wrong that i took steroids i don he did i people who are taking steroids should have as a wake-up call that steroids are not indicated at all please please stop taking it for bodybuilding if you are thinking about long-term change and the fourth point is don results aim for long-term lifestyle change this will not come down in one to two months it is going to take some time based on the amount of inches of fat that you have in your belly and number five even to build muscle you can follow this time restrictor feeding technique at least a minimum of 10 hour eating window is more than adequate and if you want to train try to focus on training around two to three pm where your insulin sensitivity is so high that the muscle build up might be much easier again a huge humble request to you is that please please do this homework wake up the first thing in the morning check your weight circumference if it is more than 90 centimeters in men and if it is more than 80 centimeters in women around the belly button you have some work to do it is time to get fit there are so many uncontrollable factors but it is time to be on top of the factors that we can control you	Success
5 steps to get GOOD gut bacteria for weight loss | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXh2-eEuI_s	Dr Pal	hello guys this is uh dr palani pramanikam we have talked about gut bacteria in the past but i don we understand the importance of how good the gut bacteria should be gut bacteria can be like cutter pass it can serve well to us like baahubalis but at the same time it can kill as well if you don that with the research i that i involved in gut bacteria is the cornerstone for everything it has been linked to autism obesity it might be even linked to suresh right now not being picked up in ipl on the other hand if we have good bacteria in our small intestine it has been proven to improve our immunity so that we can be ready for cover 22. in this video we talk about how to get good bacteria in the small intestine i after listening to this video your bad bacteria in your small intestine will be like listening to samut rakhani movie and change to good bacteria so let me tell you an interesting story i did a colonoscopy on a patient for colitis which is an inflammation of the colon the treatment for colitis in some cases can be stool transplant so this patient was a very lean 50 kilogram patient we transplanted stool from a healthy obese patient who was 150 kilograms so we transferred the stool from the obese patient who was healthy to the lean patient who had colitis and the inflammation of the colon was completely gone but after one year this 50 kilogram lean patient turned out to be 100 kilogram without changing any dietary factors this created significant research opportunities in this field that why did this happen this is likely related to gut bacteria that we transfer it is causing so many other issues which we don be bad based on the type of bacteria that has been transferred my friend saran kumar is like if i have to get good bacteria how much should i pay yuda he had changed dr pal into paypal account unfortunately good bacteria is not like the medicine seed that you can buy it with money the only way that you can get good bacteria is based on what you eat yes you are what you eat food is the medicine which is the old saying which is absolutely true but nowadays people are taking medicine as food they ingredient in sambar if we keep on doing this instead of karavapalay and kotham ali we will do aspirin and dolo 650. see the relationship between diet and gut bacteria starts when you are born multiple research studies are showing that babies who are born by c-section and they are formula fed they are at increased risk of obesity and diabetes down the road compared to babies who have been delivered vaginally through natural route and they are breastfed when they are coming through vaginal delivery they are exposed to all the bacterial colonization which is promoting good bacteria in their gut there have also been some research that if there is bad bacteria in the small intestine it has been linked to mental health problems and autism in young kids my friend saranvar kumar who was born by c-section now wants to go back to the mom normal delivery s so there are trillions of microbes in our small intestine we don the individual characteristic of this microbial organism but we know that as a group we good bacteria and bad bacteria to identify this there are some technical kits available like ombre this is a stool testing you submit the stool sample to the lab they will look into it and then find out what category of bacteria that you have they will give you a report if your bad bacterial category is more than the good bacteria you can follow the five step that is included in this video to promote the good bacteria which is going to be a life-changing behavior for you i have used this test for a few of my patients to find the imbalance that they have and it has actually helped them to understand the importance of the gut bacteria so now we know how important the good bacteria is i will tell you five steps to improve your good bacteria in your gut number one fiber fiber fiber everybody should take at least 25 grams of fiber per day fruits and vegetables has lots of fiber one apple has four grams of fiber but the problem is we don you should include at least one fruit or one serving of vegetables in every meal how many of us just eat dosai and sambar for breakfast for a long time including me my favorite breakfast is dosai and sambar and even for that i will tell my amma sambar number two please include fermented foods like italy curd more columbia make sure that it is fermented and one serving at least per day you know my friend savannah kumar is like no matter how the invention has been nobody can beat our palayasor i will completely agree with him because he has tried everything west east north south including pizza so number three is avoid processed food processing is a process where you add ingredients to increase the shelf life of the product my friend saran kumar allows processed food especially if it has crossed the expiration date because you can fight with the owner and buy it at a half rate for example if a bowl of beans lasts for only one day you could add sugar or salt preservative or trans fats to increase the shelf life almost to one year and this is a completely unhealthy process so how do you know whether it is processed as a general rule there are two things that you should look at number one if it is white it might not be good this is true for 95 percent of the time and number two if the food comes in a box or completely covered or frozen or ready to eat 95 percent of the time it is processed as well examples include bread cereals ketchup anything that comes up in boxes like boxed juices boxed drinks except for milk and curd 95 percent of the time if you see anything white it is not right when it comes to food if it is white it doesn actually help us rest in peace also before you eat anything look at the ingredients if any of the ingredients contains this word artificial please do not take it my friend sarah nakumar after listening to this is not buying any product with any name on it even iso certification so the fourth step is try to be a vegetarian as much as possible because vegetarian food has lots of fiber and your bacteria will love it you will develop good bacteria in your small intestine more than non-vegetarian diet because that diet doesn fiber at all most of us don at the vegetarian side of a buffet or a get-together if you eat vegetable you are being seen as untouchable so i love non-vegetarian but i have limited myself consciously to one meal a week because there are 21 meals a week three meals a day 21 meals a week if you can limit yourself to one meal a week of non-vegetarian your bacteria will love you we should tell to our bad bacteria so the fifth step is do not take any antibiotics unless if it is absolutely needed antibiotics not known to destroy the good bacteria in small intestine but the problem is in india people are eating antibiotics like as if it is an eclipse candy when i was in india i had some fever i went to the pharmacy store i asked for tylenol or paracetamol that guy was like if you take this paracetamol your fever will continue for three days if you take this amoxicillin antibiotic your fever will be gone in one day and he is telling me if you want a good doctor you let me know i will refer you to one so in addition to these five steps two little steps that will also help to promote good bacteria is stress avoidance it has been shown that stress completely eradicates the good bacteria in your small intestine stress panic number two is hygiene hypothesis when i was a kid i used to play cricket play football i was exposed to all the bad bacteria and good bacteria which diversified my small intestinal gut flora but now even if we have a small dirt in our kit we are like applying sanitizer right away to a point that the sanitizer bottle gets empty our parents made us play whatever we want because they had so much trust in surf xl and ham soap i really don don really want you to develop these five steps in your kit because i want smiling faces to make this world a better place and not faces admitted in the hospital let me know in the comment section regarding which of these five steps is easier to adopt or is it practically possible to follow all these five steps on a long term basis please let me know this video is being sponsored by ombre company which has a kit which will test your gut bacteria again if you think that if you have gotten at least one information out of this video please consider donation to our patients at aishwaryam trust in madurai this is a trust that we are developing for hospice comfort care patients neurological

Simple step to PREVENT Diabetes | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpX_P1wJlRI	Dr Pal	hello guys this is uh dr pannapanmanika in this video we what is causing diabetes how we have been treating it wrong and at the end of the video i reverse the diabetes let into it [Music] so india is becoming the world capital of diabetes 1 in 11 patients from india have diabetes kerala is the diabetic capital of india with one in five people are having diabetes with tamil nadu and bangalore catching up so basically diabetes means your insulin is not working there are two kinds of diabetes type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes type 1 is something that you are born with congenital genetic basically you are born without insulin we can do anything about it except that we can have to give you external artificial insulin to sustain life so type 1 diabetes is genetic it is almost like a sid sri ram song no matter what song you give it to him he sing like type 1 diabetes so it is better to give a song that matches him so insulin in type 2 diabetes was good to start with you guys had enough insulin but we started beating it up by eating at the wrong time eating the wrong food to a point that it is not working anymore so type 2 diabetes is like a shruti hasan song initially she started very well but she sang wrong song at the wrong time and then now she is not singing at all so in this video i type 2 diabetes which is the most common one basically you have insulin but it is good for nothing so diabetes was once called a rich man disease because we are adopting a rich man increasingly common while we were watching cricket in an ipl final my friend salam nakumar was talking about scores to his friends ave 150 even 200 update later i came to realize that they are talking about their sugar score my friend saram nakumar one by large margin with eight diseases in hand so to understand how to reverse diabetes you need to understand how insulin works so the major organs in our body our brain heart kidneys every organ is made up of cells and these cells need energy and that energy is being given by insulin insulin gives energy to these cells and these cells are active and it starts working and that and that energy is obtained from the food that we eat when we eat food it goes into the stomach the stomach acid splits into three parts carbs proteins and fat and it gets absorbed into the blood carbs proteins and fats are like the three tamil changams cheras cholas and pantias we want them to work together like a kingdom so that our body work at its best but with our eating habits and lifestyle changes all we get is irritable casein i keep repeating this we or what we eat our small intestine is made up of good and bad bacteria if your good bacteria is more than the bad bacteria you are definitely at a lower risk of getting any kind of diseases like diabetes and that my practice i used to test patients regarding their composition of good and bad bacteria in the small intestine so this video is being sponsored by ombre which is a kit that we can use at home to determine what kind of composition that we have in our small intestine if your bad bacteria is more than the good bacteria we can potentially target the treatment accordingly there is a video that i put out in the past regarding how to get good bacteria in the gut please check out that as well and there is a discount for the coupon for ombre test kit in the description below all your donations will go to aishwaryam trust in madurai so out of the three main things carbs proteins and fats carbs are the one is being acted upon by insulin when carbs enter the blood insulin takes the carbs gives that energy to the cells in brain heart kidneys lungs all over the body and if the cells are hungry it will take the carb and make use of it for its daily activities but the problem here is these cells are never hungry because we keep feeding them so these cells don need extra energy so it keeps rejecting the sugar that is insulin is trying to give it to the cell so it is like in one side allow insulin pours low by giving sugar to the cell and cell says i don need it and it keeps rejecting it and insulin becomes kadal bharath and goes 99999 don such a good lower that it is still loyal to the cells so it is converting the excess sugar into fat thinking that this cell might need more energy down the road but that never happens so this is similar to how in a wedding we store all the gifts vessels and bathrooms and thinking that this will be useful later but never get used and passed on to the next generation it thing both vessel and diabetes so when this keeps happening the sugar gets built up and gets converted into fat because the cells are not using it and it is slowly getting accumulated in your belly when you have belly fat that is the first sign of disaster but we think that having a belly fat is a sign of prosperity when i was obese my mom used to say padanda doctor mother my mom has to frame the six year mbbs curriculum she will save five years of mbbs training and one year of eating more food to become like a doctor so when your belly fat keeps on increasing your sugar level in the blood keeps increasing as well and that is the first sign that you are having sweet blood which is a sign of diabetes the first sign of sweet blood is that you will be urinating more often usually urinate two to three times a day but once you having sweet blood you might urinate eight to ten times a day so before the invention of glucose testing in the blood doctors used to diagnose diabetes by drinking the urine to see how sweet it is i medicine now now i know why my dad used to scold me at least drink the urine of the first rank holder even at that time i drank the first rank holder bottle because that is the pre-stage of urine so when you have sweet blood it starts to damage your internal organs it starts with your kidneys eyes skin lungs and finally your heart and even your sweet heart cannot help you so if you have listened to the story carefully when you hear the statement that a 45 year old patient with diabetes died of a heart attack where was the problem so god gave us good cells and good insulin to start with we made it worse with these two issues number one our cells did not require that much energy because we are not exerting that much energy number two we keep on feeding us so that our cells had abundance of energy which it doesn have to exert so we don these two problems at all but we keep giving more insulin what does this insulin does takes the extra sugar goes to the cell and the cell says i am done i don converts into fat makes our belly even bigger so then what happens after a point of time the current insulin dose doesn the dosage of insulin which will make you even bigger the whole point is absolutely wrong so what should be the treatment it should be combining those two points number one you make the cells exert more by doing more physical activity or increase your basal metabolic rate by building muscles number two decrease the amount of food intake so that you will decrease the amount of sugar that is entering into the blood and that can be easily done by fasting my friend saran kumar is asking if i follow this combo deal will i get a large coke as a complimentary i said this is not a combo deal this is by diabetes get heart attack free so the first option of making the cells exert more doesn our environment is not conducive for that at this time so we need to slowly build this up and eventually it will help you as well but the easier option is to decrease the amount of calorie and carbon take and that can be done by fasting so remember diabetes is mainly diet related and the treatment is mainly diet and not insulin insulin is just a band-aid but unfortunately many patients are focused on medication like insulin and forget about the diet completely my uncle is like give me one more gulab jamun i will increase the dosage of insulin tonight so how does fasting help fasting decreases the amount of food coming and decreases the amount of calories insulin doesn eventually the body is forced to make use of the energy stored all the fat will dissipate slowly and eventually all the cells will become hungry again and the insulin will actually work by providing energy to the cells and the love will get into a marriage insulin actually follows the protocol that our taliban has sang in muthu movie [Music] so the same mechanism is happening after weight loss surgeries you know after weight loss surgery people lose like 50 kilos and all their diabetes is gone all their blood pressure is gone because of the same mechanism that i just explained that the calorie content is decreased and all the cells are hungry again the same mechanism can be reproduced with the simple fasting technique i emphasizing the point again that insulin is just a band-aid it does not reverse diabetes food intake is the one that is going to reverse your diabetes so taking insulin is like spraying a perfume without taking a bath in the center of the friend so before insulin was discovered in 1921 actually scientists used starvation as a method to treat diabetes you know people are so concerned that if you diabetic patients will go into low blood glucose levels which is absolutely not true because when you fast the normalization of blood glucose levels actually happens at a better rate so shivangi dawnless intermittent fasting and glucose level low glucose high glucose tequila maintain one so if you combine this fasting method with our circadian rhythm method that we have been explaining this in our channel this is a golden combo i can guarantee you that your diabetes will be reversed i shared so many success stories in the social media that this method actually works if you or any of your friends are diagnosed with borderline diabetes or a new onset diabetes talk to your doctor and follow my previous youtube video about how to start intermittent fasting safely this can be absolutely done as usual if you think you got anything out of this video please consider donation to ishwarium trust in the link that is mentioned below this is a trust that we use for hospice patients for comfort care who have exhausted their options both medically and also financially please join me in helping them out so please let me know in the comment section if you or any of your friend who has been diagnosed with diabetes can adopt this false fasting method or not what are the challenges that you are expecting please let me know so remember one belly at a time it is absolutely important i	Success
WHAT to eat during eating window to keep yourself full? - ft. Ms. Varsha (Dietician) | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPshiZT0nkI	Dr Pal	hello guys this is uh doctor pal napolmanikim uh in our channel we have been talking about time restricted feeding and i know all our subscribers are not eating after 7 p.m so i absolutely love it but the main question that i to avoid hunger pain at night what should i eat during this eating window so the reason that i have not been answering those questions is i am not a certified nutritionist i want to bring somebody uh in the channel too so that they can tell us their experience so that we can get it from the experts and then follow the protocol accordingly and then we can take it from there so we have a wonderful guest today uh her name is miss varsha she masters in clinical nutrition and i couldn this more than her let me have her on the session [Music] hi how are you i thank you for joining no problems that nice basha is a masters in clinical nutrition so it from the regular dietation that we actually see so there nutritionist and dietitian [Laughter] a master that i did my eog for three years so totally it the field of nutrition that it youtube channel [Laughter] to speak about it because you doctor you [Laughter] all right so um so the main question that all my audience and subscribers have is including my patients that okay you know you anything after 7 p.m just water it easy for you to sit in the chair and then say after 7 pm but what will you tell my stomach when it is asking for food i let me just tell you what i got an email that oh hey pal um who was who pain if my stomach is hurting will you come and comfort it you agreement um so to answer that email i brought you in so so what should we do uh let the night time right so night time dinner meal we are focusing on okay what are the options we can choose from a south indian uh dinner options uh to make our stomach full and then making sure that everything is uh we don the hungarian uh not only south indian because you are your expertise is in south india that in so why it okay so i think your audience is also southern most of them are your demos also south indians right right see firstly before starting the time restricted you know feeding what i would suggest is if they want to get started before that they can plan the meals that they two meals after parang or if it be three meals during the feeding window what they can do is they can plan it out based on um you know what their house you don anything fancy for example now if uh if it be a south indian i would suggest that you can include a balanced you know meals in your plate so what we mean by balance is you include carbohydrates protein and fat the problem is that we don you know protein or carbohydrates or fat we we think everything is like dal is protein for instance so dal is not protein dal is more of carbohydrates and more great you know they they suspect you because they during their entire childhood and they that you know dal is full of protein and when you mix it with rice it becomes a complete meal i think that us have been taught [Music] by doesn has only moderate amount in fat it has a lot of carbs that is the first myth that i would like to dispel so once you get a clear idea as to what is it that you it is easy for you to plan your meals as well so you dinner time let for now i mean just for uh uh our continuation of what i have been recommending um so dinner any meal should have protein carbs and fat that is what is balanced diet right yes um so if you follow this balance diet on a daily basis our bank balance might be gone because healthy foods are getting exposed yeah to give you an example like if you those up for dinner you your dinner by six o i i mean you non-calorie uh drinks which is nothing but hot water in a black coffee and a black tea correct so this will definitely you know keep you full and you won something or you won when you you made it important but i want to emphasize that so you said that the more the protein in the diet will make you feel full for a longer time that very very important point right so what happens is protein actually helps to you know keep you full and also when someone is looking at losing fat it helps you to lose fat how i been getting now there called thermic effect of okay so it needs about 30 percent of energy to expel when compared to carbohydrates and fat [Music] burn it off but um it comes to burn of protein 30 percent of the energy gets you know uh it gets used when you looking at body fat so that is why when you when even when you open the social media page or wherever you go people always keep emphasizing on protein protein protein right but the layman is again very misinformed about protein i mean i think that is something we can speak about later they think that you know in a kidney problem you know what happens when i start taking whey protein i think there lot of misinformation when it comes to protein i think i think i think in this context we can um also uh remove the myth that interpret you so protein doesn damage by itself everybody needs protein at least 0.8 grams per kilo so for example you know i weigh like 70 kilos so i need at least like 60 grams to maintain a normal body regardless of weight loss or whatever it is um so that is why we are emphasizing on including protein in every meal because don vegetarian diet the protein content is not that much lower it again like i said you like a lot of vegetarians who come forward and tell me that you know i am including protein my diet where that is when you sprout it that protein circuits called um because you know your body or you very healthy for you chana is very healthy for you so what we tell them is okay just sprout it [Music] was sprouted examples um yeah channa so it can be the white chenna it can be the black channa it can be uh the sprouted the green uh green gram dal that can also be sprouted uh rajma cannot be sprouted it it will you know go spoiled uh when you try to you know sprout it i i would suggest so what i did in my um office is that you know we try to you know give it in the lab and see how much protein actually each one has and then we were shocked that actually soy has a lot more protein than even though soya chunks has a lot more protein you know even something that we we read or we so tell me one more about the sprouted means in the overnight i mean you immerse that in water for 24 hours or 12 hours is there a duration no it depends on the so the other thing is you know here in us everybody men if they want to create something healthy they are very lazy including me to cook by ourselves so it has to be always i said to all my audiences that any lifestyle change is sustainable only if you like it you enjoy it and you shouldn you shouldn something very great so in the mind there that looks like it to do isn it it [Laughter] but yeah so that should remember to do it then you okay sounds good so talking about the increasing the protein content of your options for dinner so that you can extend the hunger pain avoid the hunger pain so we talked about the balance right carbohydrate protein and fatty dinner so we talked about protein options you know research says that low carb at dinner time helps you promote sleep at night uh and the high fiber so in the rendma one day it statement so most of the carb food have high fiber right so usually what i tell my patients is fiber is known to keep you full as well so this is what i tell my patient is that okay you know what eat high fiber low carb and high protein food and they talk to a dietician so i tell you what either blanket statement okay where someone is looking at losing weight of course yeah it just said research has pointed out that low carb works high protein diet also works in it but particularly now both actually works what is the principle behind it is calorie deficit deficit even if you have carb at night it really doesn restricted feeding obviously you stay back [Music] but it someone to have carbs at night right absolutely so yes so tell me some examples of high fiber food doesn can be lower high cup that can be easily included for a dinner option for some like for your bachelor just take cucumber cut it have it with some salt and with some chicken [Laughter] very easy option is you have cucumbers vegetables water content is so much and fiber also you know beautiful and and also the sprouts sprouts okay so after that you just eat like that is it no no no so some some like to you know eat it like a salad someone like to have it like a sub cheese so for example chana masala it can be a sprouted chana masala um who needs more protein you can have an egg dosa in your [Music] um so after the water comes out uh like you discard the water and the remaining like you know very thick curd is called hung curd so that has a lot of protein and good amount of fat like good source of fat so that can also be something that you can have when you have hunger you extremely full like super cool so let me tell you from a clinical standpoint so you know people come to me for fatty liver and all those things and we say that you know what time restricted feeding known there has been shown to enjoyable fatty livers all your symptoms um i can importance of a dietitian or a nutritionist like you who plays a very very important role more than the doctor in terms of the in terms of english i just prescribe medicines we know what is the complications but somebody has to drill down exactly what they and then changing the content of the food so i running a program your program is called optimal nutritional yeah yeah it called optimal nutrition protocol so what we do is what we do is evidence-based nutrition programs so when i say evidence exactly like you know we work with doctors we work with people who are an expert in their field when we require them and we always take a blood test before we get started for a client or program our immunity we always take a blood test and if we notice any sort of red flag we always point them to a doctor and tell them listen you need to go get it fixed ask the doctor for a proper you know treatment and then come back to us but you also need a physician you a physician we are not a so the teamwork yeah so i think healthcare industry is very very important and i honestly feel everybody should look at it as an investment more than thinking that doctors even you already have people googling the symptoms and coming and telling you i think i have this right in my office i have a small caption it says you know if you come on googling and we i think i so you know um my patients as well who got benefit from you you were resistant in chennai and you do work remotely as well um but but i just i i really want to go down drill down on this uh dinner time thing because that is where everybody at least in here in us they have a heavy meal um because of a lifestyle have changed accordingly as well so coming back to the conversation of protein carbohydrates and fat so you gave us some options of how to increase the protein content how to increase the fiber content so you can keep you full yeah um so the other problem is um it non-vegetarian so let me just quickly touch on that okay so research says that red meat uh has been shown to increase the risk of pre-cancer resolutions at least in the colon part so we i i colonoscopy for every patient and i can tell you that we see so much colon cancers here in united states and not in india the reason is we don much amount of red meat in india but there who seeing lots of colon cancer now because beef because it so there is something to it so i always encourage my patients not to eat red meat i non-vegetarian now you need to enjoy life as well um but i will usually what i say is like three meals a day seven days a week 21 meals a week so limit yourself to like one meal or two meal a week if you all come if you cannot completely go to uh vegetarian so and the money recrea i always recommend them to choose fish like a white meat what do you recommend so um there is a pattern that i have seen with myself when i and with my clients as well for protein so generally what happens is again there is no enough research this is based on observation um when we include a lot of protein uh when you again that my theory okay i still haven my logical theory my mind says that pasha could be tef again atomic effect doesn and fiber is absolutely important for your normal bowel movement absolutely so it so um what i have observed is any kind of knowledge when i start taking i uh you know vegetarian my birth but when i start taking language that done like in a quarter of three days four days probably i sick then boys and then everyone drink enough water and i do all the right things again so when you you should be extremely careful and aware as to how much water you vegetables you is important very very important um you know observation that i have done or we have seen over the you know past few years in our you know clinic is that men don to women and there are developments of kidney stones maybe because we drink other water but uh um yeah so there is bacteria present in the urine at the park i know that they don water and i also see an increase in uric acid um so these are very you know glaring observations that we have done so what what happens you load up on is like you that whenever you take protein content of anything in particular non-veg please make sure that you drink lots of water yeah yeah absolutely lots of water and also watch what you sure all of your plates have some amount of fiber like it it doesn anything fancy it can be not a kind of like you know your avaraka your portland yeah so so the mindset of a lot of individuals is that i should eat broccoli for me to lose weight oh is that even the kind of vegetables that you want to eat and we can have the same avocado vendeca brinjal everything that is local here so we also advocate locally grown vegetables i didn superfood consistently they don spend money on spinach as well if you can include broccoli it go overboard on that i think gold is cheaper than broccoli is that right oh my god maybe i mean locally grown now it is not it is equally same same cost as a other vegetable but there is no point in paying more than other vegetables for a broccoli this is absolutely ridiculous you have an apple product now you feel so good about it [Laughter] it coming back to the plate of the denim so you have used that protein you said fiber you have to include vegetables or fruits other than the fiber content level and i gut bacteria so i um last one is fat fat when the number loader regular for example night when they learn when i grew up so night only those [Laughter] so now i realize that one spoon of olive oil whatever oil is 120 calories um so what do you what do you tell your uh patients regarding the oil use okay so so for everybody has like a limit envelope fat portion of the uh but if you see invariably at least a minimum of 45 to 50 grams of fat for a day you need that much at least for your proper hormone functions to happen so for one dosa so how we do is one tablespoon no no no one tablespoon is for one meal one meal exactly that that is the point that is important exaggerating it i like crispy i mean i think everybody likes crispy dosas okay so the crispy dosa is almost equal to a fried chicken you have to use it only on and as needed tonight it right right yeah right it to the i mean it it it is not a daily food foreign you need to be much more mindful of course yeah but people are like but when i go to restaurants more like you know my time and you know that joyful experience so let for let me explain a very important context that i usually tell me all my patients so i restaurant i restrain from something that you enjoy so restaurant the render reason wonder one day you mingle with friends and family and number two is you enjoy the food so you need to decide and make a conscious decision of enjoying time with the friends and family is more important than the actual food content and you can actually enjoy the food once a week or something like that have like if you want to cut down based on your individual requirement situation 11 day you can still go to a restaurant but you could also choose quick and healthy options like what you on the oil and everything so so again it comes back to the same discussion that lifestyle change has to be sustainable you should not force yourself to do anything more than what you can right right um and another interesting thing that we do for our clients is when when they tell us that you know they a restaurant what we do is you can tell us where you we uh food that you can choose from you know from that particular restaurant and we also give instructions that will also help so you have tried it all restaurants no no i haven the same kind of menu basically everything has like you know paneer butter masala they want to make it as tasty as possible so you come back exactly of course so yeah so we never asked them to choose those kind of you know food but we asked them if you believe they blush oil oh my god yes yes yes yes absolutely okay so we tell them ask them to avoid it it they because they want their food to be tasty correct okay what does you would say you will say have to decrease the oil or whatever you will ask them to choose like a high fiber uh so what i would suggest is if you to a restaurant where you know you not like for example sangeeta okay okay if i one and i know my protein options are extremely limited it funny yes i asked them to finish their protein at home and go to the restaurant then your choices are also much more mindful because you that hungry you know you protein it actually keeps you full then you choose your carb options there they or butter or whichever and you ask them to limit as much as possible now that is one option second is you either finish your carbohydrates your portion of carbs in wherever you if you skeptical like if it funny and you say no i don have it come back home and finish your protein there are people who do protein shakes yeah so he asked him to come back home and have the shake off delicious and then you know go for your meal it we use okay don seven people what if there is a dinner at eight pm uh so we say that okay you eat your dinner at home and then so that your the conception of calories is very minimal um so in my restaurant one day are again to my audience it not for dinner so don time so we whatever you want or uh the peak time the insurance peak is at 3 pm so 3 p.m one morning insulin will love you compared to like 9 pm yeah so this is what even i i love having my dinner by seven i love to wrap it up by seven because i feel very sleepy by nine ish ten ish because i started waking up at five a.m so i find this routine to be perfect this this was my school routine it right you know once we started growing up i don it has to get messed up um i think it was a wonderful dish let me just summarize everything russia okay so number one is we any meal we have we need to have a balanced diet which which will include protein carbs and fat so in our method of time restricted feeding we generally don we are restricting the time already um so to avoid hunger pain at night uh to keep you full so we talked about increasing your protein content increasing your fiber and washing a wonderful option uh including your vegetarian or non-vegetarian and more importantly drink water water water that the main thing um anything else that you would like to add for the uh for this uh dinner options or any concept okay um and another thing i would like to suggest is when you know you to get into this time restricted period always you know uh do a meal prep before you get started good very very important because when you do meal prep half of the problem is solved you already know what you so you don my penis up no i don and then they get confused and then your mind will be like any question i think i think you know everybody should be like uh gajini surya you should have okay dinner chicken biryani [Laughter] lunch and another important factor is don cook when you or you know when you decide what you want to eat you know when when we do that we make a lot of you know wrong choices where we listen to our mind than you know our stomach what it wants because at the end of the day we let or you that you plan it don start um immediately but at least plan and then start so i think that is something you can do secondly keep it extremely simple do not do it crazy or you know fancy up until um you know just don simple if you are a person who is south indian you love your rice have that portion of rice have or if you you know if you eggs your non-vegetarian but you prefer eggs over vegetarian and king abdullah boil eggs to we is okay in limited quantities exactly right and and also um the safest crop to eat for the gut absolutely the problem is i think i think we overboard that is the problem so that the problem because it has lots of calories they wanted to have lots of calories so we rice it um super sounds good so it was a wonderful wonderful discussion we will bring you back for future discussion this is amazing so people who really want to proceed further with washer you know look up optimal nutrition protocol and we will have that in the description as well but anyways thank you so much rasha for your time and just love talking to you and we thank you	Success
What to EAT after fasting? #ramadan I How fasting can prevent cancer? | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDx3x4rOnaY	Dr Pal	hello guys this is our doctor manikam in this video we fasting during religious festivals my friend sarah nakamura is like day pal i completely on april 1. i was like what april fool going to completely fast on april 1 because on april 2nd it is ramzan i getting ready for biryani i said hey it this video going to see how fasting is going to make us live longer and feasting after fasting is not good let dive deep into it [Music] i asked my friend sarah nakamura when is ramzan he was like day pal you asked me not to eat after sunrise and before sunset and we are doing the exact opposite thing during ramzan i know you are anti-muslim you are anti-indian you are an atheist national day so see fasting has been a constant theme for all religions including hindus christians and muslims because fasting is good the problem is feasting after fasting i beliefs i make this fasting even more healthier and get double blessings one god blessings and two is hormonal blessings yeah see the problem is when you feast after fasting late at night you are disturbing the circadian rhythm of the hormones it is like disturbing a sage in deep meditation you will not get blessings you will get only cursing so there is a reason that every religion has fasting as a method of worship because fasting is good some people think that the more severe the fastest they will live longer god doesn that much time to go individually in general what he does is if you fast longer he enhances the concept called autophagy so that you can clean your body yourself see our cells get damaged every day autophagy is a natural mechanism through which the cells digest the damage components of the cells and clean it up autophagy literally means self-eating self-destruction so that all the damaged cells can die and the new cells which is forming can be healthier see if autophagy doesn these damage part of the cells starts multiplying by dancing to the tunes rakita rakita song in vena nada katuna and starts forming cancer cells when the damaged cells multiply it is the precursor for cancer cells the perfect analogy is your brush head if when your bristles on the brush head is damaged you need to replace it right if not it will become like my friend sarah nakuma difficult to differentiate whether this is a bathroom brush or a toothbrush so the main hormone that is an enemy to autophagy is insulin insulin is an anabolic hormone it is a building hormone it keeps on building cells no matter how the cells are damaged insulin is a perfect example of keeping the building strong but the basement is very weak so in short when insulin is there autophagy will not happen but shear autophagy might happen cells will be like people sitting on each other and the cells will be completely damaged before even reaching the destination so this is what i have been mentioning in my channel all along is that we need to give rest to insulin so that autophagy can happen so please do not eat anything after sunset or before sunrise so that this repair can happen i told to one of my patients that if you eat after sunset autophagy will not happen and you can form cancer he rhyming so all gods know that we will not follow this normal rule of physiology and that is why every religion is promoting fasting in my opinion so in fasting you give rest to your body so there is no insulin because there is no food so autophagy can happen for a long time all your damage part of the cells gets cleaned up and you get a new healthy cell every time you fast the most important point to remember is insulin doesn think it is anti-bjp because it doesn like switch bharath so it when you fast you get what you wish for it is the other way around when you fast you become healthy to pursue whatever you wish for the kidney camera the credit camera see regardless of whatever religion we are i think the main problem is when we break the fast we are good at fasting but when we break the fast we think that we deserve all the amount of food that we are eating because we have put in all the hard work the hard work of eating is much more than the hard work of fasting so we think that since we have fasted for a long time we need to eat a lot more so that we can replenish the energy so we eat lots of sugary and unhealthy foods so if you eat more than what you need the excess calories get stored as belly fat i have a friend called shameem during my college days all his goal was to eat one biryani before sunrise during ramzan and one biryani after sunset i told him that day quantity doesn matter quality of the food matters he says they homemade biryani very high quality so no matter whichever religion you follow most of the times breaking the fast happens only after sunset remember the sleep wake cycle of insulin insulin wakes up at sunrise and peaks around 2 30 pm and then settles down during sunset so when we are fasting during daytime insulin will be so proud of us hey pal you didn all and so proud of you little does it know that a big storm is coming we are like very very insulin like his parents like we worship it during day time and we beat it up after 6 p.m see the concept i can be applied to any religion but because ramzan is coming next month i want to focus on ramzan for now usually during ramzan they eat two meals a day the meals are called suhar and iftar sugar happens pre-dawn early in the morning before sunrise and if that happens after sunset and during this fasting hours they cannot even drink water it is one of the strictest religious beliefs that i very very impressed and there are lots of fasting benefits with this approach so i have a lot of muslim friends so if something is wrong please forgive me i just making this video to explain about the concept of the sleepwake cycle of insulin so in addition to all the benefits of fasting i really want you to enjoy the benefits and do not counteract with eating unhealthy habits so i going to tell you four points number one sugar the first meal of the day try to have it as close to sunrise as possible for example if sun rises around 6 30 you can have it around between 5 to 5 30 try to delay it as much as possible within the religious beliefs so that you don disturb the sleep wake cycle as much as possible because insulin is slowly rising when the sun is rising so you can enjoy the advantage of the autophagy and repair hormone face a little bit longer and point number two the food that you eat as the first meal of the day is absolutely important it is going to give you energy for the rest of the day and also make sure that you eat healthy options that i since we can drink water during the day fruits rich in high water content is an absolute must for example pineapple mangoes plums which is high water content will keep you hydrated throughout the fasting period when i said this to my friend sarah nakamura he was like instead of eating fruits why not we can eat ice cubes right so it can stay for a long time every idea with this question it is absolutely clear that his brain is evaporated so second is you will need food to keep you full two things that can keep you full is protein and fiber protein you can get from egg milk cheese yogurt and fiber you can get it from grains whole wheat bread brown rice all those that is rich in fiber fiber fiber fiber that will keep you full i can guarantee you that your fasting will be healthy for the digestive system fiber is like our favorite chocolate during childhood we don tasting it throughout the day that will keep us full as exact same analogy see but the major problem is our food is rich in carbohydrates carbohydrates gets digested very easily that you will feel hungry again your body will be like our bodybuilder so the third point is iftar when you break the fast try to have your dinner as close to sunset as possible for example if the sun sets around 6 30 p.m try to have your iftar around 6 30 or 7 pm if possible the biggest mistake i have seen in my friend while they are breaking the fast they have snacks first like bajji bonda samosa and then they prepare for dinner late at night this is the biggest mistake that we could easily avoid so try to have the full bone dinner around 6 30 or 7 p.m when the sun sets and you don night people have this habit of drinking milk before going to bed it is an absolute no-no please do not disturb your insulin unnecessarily and more importantly don or sweets because remember whenever you eat sweets it going to wake up it is sleeping already so don and sweets as much as possible when you are in the fasting phase eating face looks much greener but when you come to the eating phase nobody is eating green the reason i is it is very very easy to put on belly fat after such kind of extended fasting period and it is absolutely difficult to take it off after the festival is over so please please be cautious and try to eat healthy when you are breaking the fast and also when you first meal of the day so let me give you an example if i am following fasting this is what i will do as the first meal of the day pre-dawn for protein i will take milk egg or protein smoothie for fiber i will take vegetables or oats kanji which has lots of fiber and for water content i will take a fresh fruit and also two to three dates i careful on dates because even though dates have rich fiber content it is rich in sugar as well so we need to be very very cautious and take just very limited quantities of dates and one big glass of water to keep me hydrated throughout the day so when i break the fast after sunset what i will do is for protein i will take grilled chicken or grilled fish if you are a non-vegetarian or if you are vegetarian you could use vegan sources of protein as well but the key thing is it has to be grilled and not fried and for fiber it is okay to eat rice and roti but very very limited quantities i would prefer brown rice and will prefer roti because the fiber content is slightly high and also a fresh fruit and for dessert instead of sweets i will still stick with one glass of milk with chia seeds which has lots of fiber as well the bottom line is you will have to have low carb high protein and high fiber diet for vegetarians yogurt is a wonderful source of protein so greek yogurt or a hunger curd so regular yogurt will not have that much amount of protein so you have to choose between these two options so that you can increase your protein content if you are followed my channel closely i have never asked you to like my channel or subscribe my channel all i am asking is if you think that you got anything out of this video i would consider a little amount of donation to aishwaryam trust where we take care of hospice patients where they cannot even walk they cannot even go to the bathroom by themselves we provide 24 server nursing services by employing full-time nursing staff and physicians i hope this was helpful i wish you a very very happy and healthy ramzan and please don the biryani okay we will eat together at 3 p.m where the insulin sensitivity is high after you finish the ramzan festival okay again i wish you a very very happy and healthy ramzan one belly at a time it is absolutely important i [Music]	Success
How SLEEP helps you to lose weight?| 12 sleeping tips | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTaxQTv1lA	Dr Pal	hello guys this is our doctor pauline manikam in this video we talk about how sleep is actually helping you to lose weight when i said this to my friend sarah nakuma he was like out of every other approach that you have said this is the best approach now you are talking yay matani i can even sleep after sunrise to sunset let me know what do i do sleep is a very very simple thing that we are underestimating how useful it is to help us lose weight let [Music] so we are going to talk about 12 different tips to make you sleep better so you can lose weight faster and i also going to tell you what i do it is easy for me to say just do this do that but i tips of how i do this you can follow if you we should do is to stop all the blue light we only know about yellow light and white light this blue light comes from all the devices electronic devices like tvs laptops monitors phone all these are emitting this blue light wavelength radiation what this does is this blue light goes deep into your eyes stimulate your receptors in the back of the retina and creates a atmosphere that is telling your body that it is wide awake but you are doing the exact opposite of making the body to go to sleep your body is completely confused your body is like a shark so it is absolutely important to stop all the blue lights at least one hour before you go to bed so trust me it is very easy to say but it is very very difficult to follow so what i do is i create a reminder on my phone around like 9 00 pm if my bedtime is around 10 pm one hour before i was into this so much that i turned off the read receipts in whatsapp so nobody can see the blue tick mark so i have done a detailed video on this before the videos in the description explaining about the harmful effects of blue light and sleep i lying to you if i say that it was very very easy it was very very tough for the first week i had so much anxiety i went into withdrawals and tremors almost as if i was an alcohol withdrawal i call this as a phone with drawable symptoms and people working in night shift please take this seriously the blue light is affecting your sleep and it is in turn affecting your whole body so please try to use blue light filter glasses that is available all over the world one of our fans from australia has a company called blue blocks who is specializing in these blue light filter glasses it looks like this it has an orange tint in it so that you know it decreases the blue light significantly please watch my previous video as well there are some other tips how to decrease the exposure of this blue light if you are interested in these glasses you could check the link in the description they have given you a 20 off if you are interested i use blue light filter glasses all the time i have a prescription blue light filter glasses but if you don prescription it is a simple purchase so number two please try to go to bed at the same time every day including weekends for example you know if my bedtime is around 10 pm i try to wind down slowly at 9 00 pm and 10 pm plus or minus 15 minutes would be the bedtime regardless of whether it is a weekday or a weekend so that any ipl matches except for rcb because i know that it similar to the same bedtime you have to develop a similar bedtime rituals for example in my case once you wind down at 9 00 pm research says that reading a book or taking a deep breath and doing breathing exercise for 15 minutes help you promote sleep my friend sarah kumar is trying to follow this ritual by taking a deep breath just before going to bed he took the breath so deep that the kuruma smell from kitchen spoil his sleep and also spoil his overnight fasting so practically speaking what i do is once i wind down at 9 00 pm i know i start brushing my teeth brush the teeth of my kids read books to them turn the lights off with a night lamp on and then i sleep before my kids go to sleep my older son arjun keeps asking me hey what happened with ravana why does he have 10 heads i said one head is not enough to bang on the wall when the kids are disturbing his sleep and the third point is use your bed mainly for sleep don your laptop don bed and especially don for those of you who are working from home and you netflix and amazon prime on the bed go to your office put a bed in your office bay and sleep and don like work and number four is things to avoid the most important thing is caffeine no coffee after three pm the half-life of caffeine in the body is close to six hours so after six hours fifty percent of the effects of caffeine is still inside the body stimulating your system so no coffee or caffeine after three pm milk is okay tea is preferably avoided but strictly no alcohol see all i am saying is we should do some practical sacrifices which doesn for example for me i grew up drinking coffee right at 6 00 pm especially dipping milk biki next to heaven but i in heaven coffee and tea is being served only in the morning and not in the evening it was very difficult for me initially for the first few weeks so the fifth point is what can you eat to make you sleep better tryptophan tryptophan is a chemical that is being released after eating certain amounts of food and that will promote sleep by increasing the melatonin secretion foods rich in triprofan include a whole glass of milk and nuts mainly almonds and pistachios but the problem is our mom we will sleep nicely after eating tryptophan rich foods but our mom will be like in the doctor so what do i do i drink a whole glass of milk around 6 to 7 p.m just right at the time of dinner and also take some nuts like pistachios cashews also and sometimes almonds the sixth important point is dinner should be at least three hours before going to sleep and that re-emphasizes the concept of eating at sunset so let 10 pm you should have your dinner around 7 pm it is absolutely important because it takes at least 3 hours to digest the food at least 50 percent for example if you eat the food around 9 p.m and go to bed at 10 pm the food doesn digested completely it stays inside the stomach which makes your hormones active overnight and all your hormones will be very sluggish my friend savannah kumar is like just because of this reason i going to eat chicken biryani around 10 pm so that all the chicken biryani will be in my tummy as long as possible so that i can make the maximum advantage he night he beer everything will digest properly the seventh point is the room temperature where you sleep research have shown that if the temperature is low if you make your room cooler around 20 degrees celsius or 68 degree fahrenheit the sleep is better but when the weather is close to 35 degrees celsius outside and close to 100 degree fahrenheit here in sacramento if you decrease your temperature to 60 degrees fahrenheit or 20 degrees celsius if you see your electricity bill next month you will never get sleep again so there are few tricks that you could do to lower your room temperature please open your windows as soon as the outside temperature cools down and number two please use a ceiling fan or a tower fan and the trick is you could use a ice or a cold water just be in front of the fan so that it can blow cold air around the room the simple trick that has worked for me is to take contrasting showers research have shown that if you take one minute of hot shower followed by one minute of cold shower that decreases your body temperature promoting sleep throughout the night the colorway not my friend saran kumar is like day i cannot take bathra i use only perfume then the perfume that will work for you is chloroform the eighth tip is exercise some kind of exercise even walking is considered to be promoting sleep at night one of my patients is asking me hi dr pal i walk during sleep will that be considered as an exercise day you are not a china product rather two-in-one multi-purpose either you walk or you sleep and the ninth tip is very important for married people because you should not have any stressful conversation in the last one hour while you are winding down because any kind of stress increases the cortisol secretion cortisol increases your adrenaline hormones which will make you alert and will not make you sleep and this is the main reason that my wife doesn before she goes to bed and i don to her at all for the whole day we only talk in insta reels and the tenth tip is is actually a request that do not take any sleeping medications until you check all these boxes off taking a sleeping pill is not a good thing to do and i can guarantee you that if you can focus on these steps you will not need any sleeping pill at all my friend sarah nakumar is asking how about reading a book i said it is absolutely good he reads and he is confused and he he out and the 11th tip is do not have any light in the room shut down all the lights a simple tip is to switch from your regular bulbs to led bugs because it doesn heat and you need to make sure that the light is almost zero in your room so you could use a sleeping mask the blue blocks company has a very good sleeping mask like this you can use it during your travel because this is the most important time that this mask is very helpful so that you can have good sleep even during travel i have seen people using their covered 19 mask from sunrise to sunset for their nose and mouth and then use the same mask to cover their eyes from sunset to sunrise don that and the last step is let do all these things and you still don find good quality sleep you have to maintain a sleep diary when do you wake up when do you go to bed and what are the problems that you are facing so when i got married i used to write a diary my wife thought that i am writing new year when she opened the diary all she saw was total calorie 1800 per day and protein content is 150 grams i seriously think that blue light filter glasses is a must for night shift workers so please consider purchasing blue light filter glasses if you are working overnight and there is a link below in the description as well if you want to make use of the twenty percent discount uh anyways all donations all going through isharium trust if you think that you got anything out of this video you can make a change in a patient check that link as well in the description and our eyeshadow trust family is growing to an extra 50 patients and they are

down in the comment section what time you go to sleep how many hours do you sleep per day and do you think all these tips will be useful if so which one is the most useful tip that you are going to

4 TIPS to IMPROVE your mental health and Lose weight | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNU7BYIXBjo	Dr Pal	hello guys this is a doctor of alabama in this video we how to improve your mental health if you increase your head weight you are going to decrease your body weight my friend sarna kumar is like yen nana first you will talk about mental health then you will say if you improve your dental health you will lose weight and you will start removing my tooth huh it is true i promise you let into it nobody wants to talk about mental health these days because there is a clear-cut social stigma around it among people especially among indian community we think that a person has mental health issues only if he behaves like seidu [Music] see the biggest problem is as a society we need to understand that everybody 90 of us watching this video including me will have some kind of mental health problem it could be like mild inability to sleep inability to focus to moderate symptoms like anxiety or depression or severe symptoms like me running a youtube channel the problem is that people are not considering it as a mental health problem because they think it is very normal because we work very hard to attain this level of status in the society if your family member is noticing that something is wrong with you the disease has been advanced we miss the boat we should have caught at this at a very early stage my wife priya used to ask me every day you don good you look depressed are you okay i look at the wedding picture and i look at her and then say everything is double okay see one of the main reason that 90 of the population have some kind of mental health problems at some level is because of this hormone called cortisol so cortisol is a hormone being secreted in our body during stressful situations it is called fight or flight hormone imagine this situation a deer is being chased by a lion to escape from the lion the cortisol secretion in the deer is so much that it runs so fast as much as possible this is called the flight response on the other hand when the lion actually catches the deer the cortisol and the deer is again secreted to the maximum to fight against the lion as much as possible even though it doesn win so this is called fight response so flight or fight respond cortisol secretion is exactly like the argument between a husband and wife either you fight or take a flight and leave in my case it is usually the latter my favorite quote whenever there is an argument between my wife is hospital and the chief dr cooper anger nanny cray and my wife is so smart that she will ask me even before i tell her that hospital in the chief drink so see the cortisol is actually helping you right to help you to fight or flight from that stressful situation but the problem is when cortisol is secreted inside your body your body doesn about any other hormones your insulin your glucagon your growth hormone your melatonin nothing works cortisol is the one that dances throughout your body cortisol is like balaya when balaya starts dancing all the background dances just sit and watch and freeze and up so cortisol is secreted whenever there is a stressful situation like a lion chasing idea but the problem is our body doesn know whether the stressful situation is a lion or a whatsapp message so people think that you should be absolutely stressed out to secrete cortisol and put you in a stressful situation that is absolutely not true even with day-to-day activities like multi-tasking running late to the appointment preparing for a presentation and reading somebody else whatsapp status and thinking that it is about you after having an argument with my wife i kept a whatsapp status as ego is the only requirement to destroy any relationship and my wife status says those above we chat only through whatsapp status see the problem is with a fast paced environment with the financial pressure with work pressure with family pressure with fear of missing out with all these social medias we are being stressed out on a daily basis on an hourly basis and every minute as well every time we get stressed out cortisol is secreted and your body thinks that you will go into a fight or a flight mode from the stressful situation so cortisol is like a king all the other hormones goes down so no insulin no growth hormone no melatonin you don carbohydrates doesn properly it gets converts into fat easily and that is the bottom line reason for obesity heart disease blood pressure stroke and all the problems i strongly believe that we all get these whatsapp messages that young people are dying with sudden cardiac death it mainly because of their stressful situation either at their work or at personal level that initial stress gets translated into increased cortisol suppressing all the other hormones contributing to belly fat obesity and all the problems that we discussed my grandma used to say sudden death is a blessing since then i blessing from her on my birthday so i strongly believe that if we improve our mental health if we can control the stress level if we can decrease the stress level we can decrease this hormone called cortisol so that the other hormones can be a hundred percent quality and will take care of your health very well so let simple steps that you can do to improve your mental health decrease your cortisol level you don diseases and i don one my favorite method of time restricted feeding if you follow the circadian rhythm of your hormones naturally available hormones from sunrise to sunset so you don anything after sunset all your hormones are 100 quality even when cortisol is secreted because of good quality hormones your body will be able to control the damage due to cortisol so hormones with the circadian rhythm is like hilar symphony if you disturb that cycle by eating late at night then the ilea raja symphony will become 7g rainbow colony song raja raja di rajan raja second point is artificial lights at night again this disturbs the circadian rhythm there are two main things that disturbs the circadian rhythm one food after sunset two light after sunset unfortunately in our social environment artificial lights has become a part of our life without lights we cannot do anything including traffic lights but unfortunately our body doesn secreted thinking that that is a stressful situation that you need to either fight or flight from the situation you why are you secreting now huh why are you creating unnecessary damage i don need you to that question will be like sunset so just remember this any artificial lights after sunset was going to disturb your circadian rhythm so with our practical social environment it is not possible to be in the dark but you can go to bed early so that you don to disturb the circadian rhythm there are multiple research studies that shows that people who eat dinner around 6 pm at sunset and then going to bed 3 hours later around 9 pm at night their cortisol level is much much lower compared to people who eat late at night around 9 pm and going to bed at 12 a.m midnight so it is very clear that with these two steps of not eating anything after sunset and going to bed early can decrease your cortisol level can decrease your stress level which will promote your health and you will be in a wonderful situation already the third step that will actually decrease the cortisol levels and increase your mental health is meditation as soon as i say meditation my friend sarah nakamura is like meditation is only for older people who goes to kaasi rameswaram his body is celebrating diwali every day whenever he walks i could hear his bones cracking inside and he is saying he is youth see that somebody says i meditate people think that something is wrong with them and they are older people and they are not fashionable or it will be the other end of the spectrum where people are actually meditating for fashion oh you meditate oh what else do you do do you have a gucci bag so what does meditation actually do meditation will give you a control over your thoughts so that you can have a better control over the stressful situation so the cortisol secretion is decreased as well and number two it increases the connection of the neurotransmitters between two cells by shortening the distance between these two cells by practicing meditation over a longer period of time if you ask me meditation is the single most important factor that will decrease people take care of the mental health problem there is research supporting that if a person meditates 10 000 hours in their lifetime their chromosomes actually increase in length the aging decreases by 8 years and the risk of diabetes obesity and heart disease goes down significantly you know if you actually look around if people you know who are meditating they will definitely look much younger similar to the santur ad we should have a meditation ad which says khaleeja nana if i was the prime minister of india i will give one rupee to every minute that a person meditates so when they reach 10 000 hours they would have gotten one lakh rupees this would have decreased hospitalization and other disease related problems which will increase productivity will increase the quality of life and number four very important is writing a gratitude journal you know with the fast-paced environment we don appreciate what we have we always long for things that we don every stage of the life if you don married you if i get married if you get married it would be great if i have a kid if you have one kid it two kids if you live in an apartment would be great if you live in a house if you have a house it would be great if you have a swimming pool this requirement doesn comparing other people around us it not going to improve each and every time when that thought comes into you cortisol is getting secreted even without you being aware of it so spend just one minute a day enjoying the things that you have and don about things that you don do you do this you start the habit of writing a gratitude journal either you can write this before you go to bed or as soon as you wake up in the morning just spend one minute thinking about one factor that makes your life special you could be thankful for your family you could thankful for your health thankful for your job or thankful for this youtube channel so what i do is i have an app called gratitude journal it is a free app you can download in any app store and

How to lower our STRESS level? | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGZcTIeBGHA	Dr Pal	hello guys this is uh dr pauline monika in this channel we have been focusing on covert intermittent fasting but today i pathway to health which is meditation meditation is like brahmastram it destroys all the unwanted thoughts like personal anxiety work pressure their teleserial ira mana rojave and makes you feel divine advantages of one hour of meditation is more than one hour of weight lifting one hour of intermittent fasting and one hour of googling how to meditate in this video we see about three things number one how you can use meditation for your weight loss journey number two why there is social stigma against meditation and number three the best and simple way to meditate don ask you to go through the caves go to himalayas and do meditation like baba rajinikanth let so before knowing how meditation is helpful in weight loss you need to know the physiology of the hormones like similar to what we have discussed in the past number one we talked about insulin and growth hormones but more than that on the top of it the kum mailer there is a hormone called cortisol this is the mother of all hormones and we talked about this in detail on my previous video please check the link below in the description when the mother of all hormones cortisol is secreted all the other hormones will never work cortisol is like rolex surya when it comes out all the other hormones are like yes sir okay sir presents up so basically when the cortisol is secreted it is trying to save your body it is thinking that you are in a lot of stress and it will do anything to suppress all the other hormones to make you survive but the problem with this fast-paced environment that cortisol is being secreted very easily so since all the other hormones are not working properly the higher the cortisol level the higher the weight the lower the cortisol level lower the weight chin cortisol with this much advance in science the only thing that has been shown to decrease cortisol in the non-medication way is meditation so when you do meditation it calms down your mind it decreases your cortisol level because your body thinks that you are not in stress anymore when cortisol is decreased your insulin and your growth hormone goes up which means that it can work very effectively to control all the other hormones so that it can make you lose weight faster in addition to making you lose weight meditation also makes you look younger research study shows that people who are meditated for 25 years their brain looks much thicker and younger or more similar to a younger person for example a 50 year old patient who has been practicing meditation for 25 years his brain looks like a 25 year old brain that you look younger basically meditation is like a brain insurance for you few minutes per day is the only premium that you need to pay for that the reward is multiple years of healthy life if i was a part of the indian government i will not do life insurance corporation lic but i will do brain insurance cooperation bic if you have bic you will not need lic so whenever we talk about meditation people think that it is only for people with psychiatric problems i here to say that every person here in this fast-paced environment has some kind of mental health problems starting from mild insomnia with sleeplessness to anxiety depression and even suicide even laughing buddha will have mental health issues and he will need meditation to keep laughing and the other common mistake people do is they think meditation is religious my friend saran kumar says that day you are trying to convert people into hinduism and you are taking the nation towards fascism today i preach only fast some 12 hours of intermittent fasting meditation is not religious it is spiritual it is beyond your body it is pure soul i am really amazed that people have not tapped into this ocean as much as they should after i explain the importance of meditation my friend sarah nakamura goes into the room and starts meditating within 10 minutes he calls me i go inside the room he was like having the own pose upside down with arms and legs crossed today i said we are not non-codable arya meditation doesn all you need is a simple chair or even sit on the floor in a calm place another complaint that he always says is i busy i don meditation i if you open up the laptop he is looking for how to make insta reels tutorial he says i cannot even close my eyes for one minute without controlling my thoughts if i close my eyes all i could hear is arabic and puja hectare is coming in my mind if you cannot control your thoughts for one minute you are the one who actually needs meditation one of the comments in my video was hey pal your videos are too long can you cut short you are testing my patience i is an insta real it minute if you cannot have patience for this then you will be a patient pretty soon meditation is not about emptying the mind it is impossible our brain is not wired to be empty our brain has been wired to think meditation helps you control your thoughts so that you can think about what you really need to think let us do a one minute test now why don minute and then come back to the video and during that one minute see what are the thoughts or flowing through your mind there is no way that you to say that there the mind it flowing meditation helps you to guide the river in a positive way and discard the negative thoughts currently with the fast-paced environment with a stressful situation we are like a tennis net between our brain thoughts and our heart thoughts you and forth with meditation what i asking you to do is to practice this so that you don become a spectator so that you can watch the thoughts being bounced back with advanced stages you can even control your mind in such a way that you can watch only the match that what you want to and sometimes you can even switch off the match completely so this video is being sponsored by amre which is a stool testing kit we have talked about this in the past it will tell you what is the composition of bacteria in your small intestine whether you have a majority of good bacteria or majority of bad bacteria the reason i this in a mental health video is there have been multiple research suggesting that if you have bad bacteria in your small intestine it has been linked to anxiety depression and sometimes even autism so with this toolkit you could figure out which kind of bacteria that you have if you have a majority of bad bacteria you can change your lifestyle accordingly so that you can shift the balance it is a home-based test i have used this in few of my patients please check the link in the description as you know all the sponsorship money will be directed towards ishmarium trust i take a minute here to explain about ishwarium trust if you think that you got anything out of this video please do not like please do not subscribe please consider donating to our non-profit organization called ishwarium trust we take care of hospice patients with stroke and other neurological problems where they cannot even move their hands and legs which will require 24 7 nursing service that we are providing free of cost the link is in the description as well you could just click online and then donate as well i my meditation experience initially i did not believe in meditation as well even though i am a doctor i did not practice it so initially i lost weight as you guys know but after a while i hit a plateau and i was not sure what to do i knew that meditation will decrease the cortisol levels so i started looking into how to do meditation fortunately there was my neighbor whose name is rama who guided me to heart fullness meditation when i grew up i used to see director v shaker movies and i thought neighbors are only for exchanging grocery items i didn were introduced to meditation technique honestly i was not sold initially i was like i knew that this is going to be of some kind of benefit i let me just go to his house and do these meditation sessions persistently i even used to open my eyes during meditation and see everybody else is meditating or not there will be only one person who makes an eye contact with me at that time and that is my friend saranac so i didn 20 to 30 sessions but the only good thing that i did was i kept on going to these sessions around the 35th or the 36th session something magical happened during the meditation session around 30 minutes into the meditation for some reason i felt so light so relaxed and i cried for no reason and i asked my mentor what is this happening and he was like this is what the benefit of meditation is once i realized and once i felt that then i knew that my cortisol level is down i started practicing more cortisol level kept on going down which means that the insulin growth hormone is working well which is a recipe for a faster weight loss again any meditation practice is good what i encountered was heart fullness meditation and i absolutely love it if you want to practice this as well there is a link in the description there will be a heart fullness mentor around your area you could just shoot them an email they are just doing this out of good positivity to spread the thought throughout the world so until you get in touch with a mentor you can start doing meditation using these three steps number one consistency do at least for one minute a day doesn your house is burning down do it in your neighbor one minute every day until you hit five minutes per day and do this five minutes per day consistently for three months i can guarantee you that the way of reacting to a stressful situation will be much much different than what you were three months before even if someone poisons your foot you will smell and smile like bodhidharman surya number two pick a calm place but the same place every day as soon as you go to the place your mind should be tuned that this is a meditation area if you are at home with two little kids then go to work there is no way you are finding calmness at home i was once meditating in my office my medical assistant saw me and connected me to a blood pressure machine and was like for me the best place i figured out is my car i meditate before going to work and more importantly after coming from work before going into the home because once you come home even maga rishi meditation will be disturbed so the third step is once you figure out the place once you figure out the time which is consistent every day close your eyes think that there is a light at the bottom of your heart which is illuminating the soul completely making you energetic the most important step is do not try to stop thinking just let the thoughts flow through it will flow like niagara falls my friend sarah no kumar is like clenching his teeth making a fist and they gun trying to kick a villain just be relaxed don thoughts let it be a free-flowing music heartfulness meditation is an ocean i just wanted to introduce the concept to our subscribers so that you can explore more i will leave a link in the description as well a meditation challenge for you one place one time and for one minute can you do this every day for 30 days please write down in the comment section and please let me know how you are sleeping after this challenge again one belly at a time it is absolutely important i will see you in the next video bye	Success
How practical is FASTING during weekends? | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lmc7Wdhq3e0	Dr Pal	can you tell us the difference between Tim restricted feeding versus intermittent fasting the reason I asking that is many patients are say oh I start my first bite at 2 p.m and my last bite at 10 p.m. so I still belong to an 8 Hour window can you share your ideas on this well the thing is uh when we first uh published that paper we said 8 hours time restricted feeding is beneficial no 8 hours is not a magic number the reason why we did 8 hours was convenience then we have done 9 hours 10 hours we find very similar results so intermittent fasting is a very broad term MH which means that you have to reduce fasting means you have to reduce your calorie intake from your average calorie or what your body requires on on one or more days in a week right so that to whereas time restricted fitting is a very different t it doesn have to reduce your calorie explicitly if you can that mouse experiment that we do we make sure that the time rest fed mice actually eat the same number of calories as the control group the only thing is we align it to a time when the body is more prepared to digest food and do better so just imagine if you if you trying to grow a plant mhm say rose plant and then uh you know that you have to water the plant but it doesn to put the rast plant under your sink and water 24/7 that plant and you cannot do intermittent fasting on the rast plant because you just cannot stop watering for four or five days in a week the idea is you got to just water enough uh time rest feeding is just like that you water your garden just enough at the right time and it will take care of itself so that restricted you are restricting to a certain window in the day and we don because people think that fasting is depriving your body of something that it needs it needs ah what as time feeding is you are feeding the body at the right time every day but how about people doing 2: p.m. to 10: p.m. every day well 2: p.m. to 8 10: p.m. that feeding they just call it intermittent fasting or whatever they can call it it semantics the practice is the same like it they 10: p.m. is that good or bad I mean it scientifically in scientific literature there is nothing that says that 2: p.m. to 10 p.m. is interon fasting and everything else is time that last time but but they missing the effect of circadian rhythm if they do that isn 8: p.m. so yeah I mean uh there is a there is a convenience factor there some people think that they can just get up and skip their morning meal and then go to 2: p.m. to 10: p.m. and it may be okay for many people because uh for a lot of people they need to have uh dinner with their family or the business dinner which happens usually late at night and they that so in our experiment what we have found is any time restriction is better than no time restriction so it exercise any exercise is better than no exercise right good good then in this case whether you afternoon or morning there will be some differences for example if you 10: p.m. then it still eat a lot of unhealthy food many desserts sweets and alcohol because all of those things are consumed late at night whereas if you start early then you actually unintentionally you will improve your nutrition quality irrespective of what happens means reducing alcohol reducing the uh calorie right calorie dense diet and also reducing all the unhealthy food is all always better for you so that brings up the next question about the weekday versus weekend right that is the biggest deal breaker my all of my patients say you know I five first five days the next two days I just go hey why you know like 8:00 p.m. 900 p.m. yeah so that experiment in mice so we actually let the mice party in the weekend so whenever they wanted and these mice actually over it in the weekend they eat more than the mice that have had limit access to food all seven days but still they had almost 80% benefits of the of the time restricted fed who eat religiously all seven days within nine hours so so skipping um uh kind of getting out of the window for one or two days is not that bad but in practice what happens is if you and if you eat late at night on Saturday Friday or Sunday then on the next day your body will remind you because you groggy you might have acid reflux at night you might lose good night of sleep that feedback loop that it reminds you that you did something that you supposed to do	Success
How to manage hunger in Time restricted eating method? | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YClPWiC0iI	Dr Pal	so I was focusing on the acid reflux seen so many patients I they come in with this omoo pantoprazol all these acid blocking agents and we just implement this simple technique and all of a sudden they don medication yeah that that powerful and that have seen that time restricted eating completely changes the gut microbiome uh what happens is our our stomach actually has a rhythm rhythm Del Rhythm and acid production so that means you know every time we eat a stomach has to produce acid toh digest the food if you eat the same food late at night then our stomach produces more acid disproportionately more acid and second thing is the acid actually comes up and then our mouth our saliva right neutralizes that a but at night we are programmed to reduce saliva production Because unless we reduce saliva production we our sleep so we have less saliva production to neutralize the acid and if we eat more food later at night then we produce more acid and then third thing that happens is our GI track actually goes to sleep so that means a small intestine doesn that much the food just stays in the stomach right so that reason why if we eat late then we have more acid reflux M you know I can tell you from my uh patient experience as well right so you know um not only in terms of uh the medications the biggest problem that people are doing in terms of heartburn is that they go to sleep right after they eat and mainly they are are having at bedtime so the first thing that we always do is to do not eat late at night that is the number one thing that is written on the good handout that we give but people don people go directly to the medications okay om 20 milligram daily okay how much should I take how much should I take but anyway so uh I in my personal experience I can tell you that I have been implementing this technique to all my GI patients not only with good fatty liver big time and uh IBS irritable bubble syndrome I tell you my experience and you tell me whe you seeing this in your mice study as well so patients come in with fatty liver time restricted feeding elevated liver enzymes first and then three four months later liver enzymes come down in addition to that the fibrosis the scar tissue in the liver gets reversed uh from stage three to stage two is do you see that in mice so actually almost 10 years ago the first time when we published our paper um that was the biggest surprise when we opened up the mice the mice on time rested feeding had no fatty liver disease ah absolutely none and then what we did we section the liver and then sent it to a pathologist who was blinded to the mice M and he scored the Bron score which is the fibrosis score mhh and clearly show saw that the time restri hting reduced the Bron score the fibrosis was very low and subsequently we have put many M different of mice even mice that have a bad Gene mice with genes that will make them more prone to fatty liver disease and if we put them on time rested feeding then their fatty liver disease is reduced or completely eliminated so that this you know the point is the liver stores fat and that liver disease the fat should be stored in the fat tissue and by time restating uh during the fasting time the liver can export that extra fat to the fat tissue and second the liver can also burn that extra fat within the liver so that sophisticated analysis because we can take out the mouse liver we look at the genes and enzymes what we find is time restricted feding just supercharges this pathway or the mechanism that burns fat within liver so that may be the mechanism how about um IBS patients you know like I have patients with uh severe IBS like IBS diarrhea they go to the bathroom like eight 10 times a day and we change them oh change this diet oh low for map diet or keto diet but since I implementing that as well to my uh patients and um I can tell you like 50 to 60% of patients are getting better yeah so again this is where we look at when mice go to poop and mice actually go to bathroom almost 10 15 times throughout the day uhhuh at night but then when we put time restricted feding uh so this also we observed in a very weird way because we see whether the mice are pooping out lot of fat or so we throughout 24 hours what we found was the time rested fed m don poop for almost 12 hours so they go to the bathroom only four five times but not like 10 15 times that the other mice do is very clear in Mouse experiment too	Success
What is a good way to break the fast? | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnUiNhS5urc	Dr Pal	and the other question people ask is oh can i have black coffee with the cream or my indian patients everybody is asking jeera water in the morning lemon water in the morning and while people well you know they cook for family and they are tasting it all will this considered as their first bite well i think that you gotta we have to go back to the basics again so for example if you you know that our blood glucose is considered healthy when it an average person of your size or my size will have five liters of blood and if we squeeze all the sugar out of five liters we sugar which is one teaspoon of sugar and when you add just one fifth of that teaspoon then that becomes 120 milligram per deciliter which is at the bottom line of diabetes the bottom line is even if you have half a teaspoon of sugar to your tea or cream or whatever it is and that means you pancreas to do its job bring the blood vocals down to below 100. so this is really amazing that it needs only one or two grams of sugar extra wow kick your pancreas into high gear to produce that insulin and use that extra glucose let me ask you this um so you know our indian lifestyle is to not only indian lifestyle in general everybody lifestyle has been tuned to like late night gathering wedding anything they night part of it do you think as a society how do we change this and what can we do to help at an individual level because all my patients are saying you know i willing to do it but my wife my kids or my husband my kids or my society is not ready to change yeah so that you think about it our health well-being is all tied to what we do between sunset and midnight right because the day time we are all busy in earning our money and living but that want to socialize because the cradle of civilization is actually from the fireside chat right the hunter gatherers they came back or the farmers they came back they cooked something they ate they talked they socialized they um they sang they danced they talked about philosophy politics marriage uh setting up means orange marriage all of these happen at nighttime but then at one point we kind of pushed the envelope too much because it but then now we have fireside chat that goes till midnight chat along with along with so this is where and also when you think about when we think about our own independence of freedom we are tied to what our employers want us to do or what our family want us to do till evening and then after dinner is the only time when you are free when you are truly human we can use our creativity and all that stuff so that that has become a societal challenge that how to manage those five or six hours and if we come up with a different way so for example we have to change the cultural practice in a way so for example if i vegetarian and if i go to somebody party and then i say i will be very respectful they will find something that i something if i say no i actually don anything after 6 p.m or 8 p.m then people should be able to accept that just like people are accepting vegetarianism or veganism or you know in india people do all types of fasting or religious saying some days they eat fruit so we have to have acceptability and another thing is for us we also have to figure out how to how to kind of juggle those for example i go to late night gatherings and then i say that look i don they the next time i go i say well i had a bad stomach i cannot eat anything when you say bad stomach nobody will force you to feed you can sprinkling water with lime and you can have very good discussion you can get all the other people get drunk or get bloated with food and you can enjoy that so nowadays i go with the different box yeah i put everything to eat the next day yeah i mean this is uh this is something that you can do that uh i have seen some people do that they will bring the chicken box they will say yes i like whatever you made and i would like to enjoy it uh please pack them and i we have to bring that cultural awareness the only problem is my different box is pretty big that there is nothing left behind that you can eat for the next five days until somebody else calls you for another dinner [Music]	Success
Weight loss journey - Tips & Tricks - ft. Dr Anusha Karrthik (Ophthalmologist) | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIstio5gnSY	Dr Pal	hello guys this is uh doctor palpatine in this video i have a very very special guest for you guys she anusha we went to medical school uh together ph.d medical college we were like two thousand batch and uh the main reason for bringing her on the show is in addition to being her ophthalmologist she she actually followed the same path as me that she lost a lot of weight and adopted healthy lifestyle and we are going to talk about this from a physician and a medical standpoint and before without any due let [Music] hi um thank you thank you for uh coming over on the channel thank you thank you for inviting me super super super um so it it following a good routine i don bother you let me just ask you a few specific questions okay and for the audience she ophthalmologist a busy practitioner she removes cataracts from ice in the morning and then she puts cooling glass on her eyes at night and then she care in kovalev um but this concept of this video is not anything about i at all it mean right how to prioritize yourself and how to adopt a healthy lifestyle so um as my i mean the people who are following my channel know that i was close to 100 kilos like five years ago and then uh i had a small uh mini heart attack kind of uh issue like where my heart rate like was significantly high and that was a spark in me that you know something is not right in my life i need to correct it so then i started doing multiple channels and i found out that this intermittent fasting thing worked for me but doesn work for everybody else there are multiple methods available the i always say that the method that works for you is the most consistent method that you can adopt so um i know that you follow the same path as well um so what created that spark in new and what made and the light bulb moment on end actually to be honest thanks to kovit after manchester we all actually literally lost our jobs so first like we were asked to stop our surgeries as it was only elective surgery so we were asked to stop our surgeries and close our opd so and i was like oh my god what do i do now and my knee pain knock knock so it knocked me so my brother was like at least use this time for reducing your weight so that you can be uh you can postpone your uh knee replacements for a while so your confirm is going to be knee replacement so i started but when i started actually uh i didn fasting [Music] sorry to stop you so tell me the first time your brother told you that okay you need to lose weight so then what is the first method that you adopted uh i ran i started running started running and again i ended up in knee pay and again i took rest for two months so this is how i do so when i get doing i jump i overdo i enjoy myself then i sit coolly for two months eat a bunji bonda to recover the damage the mental trauma so this was happening for uh five or six months and then we our batch mates girls the fitness group so i started to learn more about fitness and uh it actually it living a healthy lifestyle rather than losing weight um and also the learning totally changed from weight loss to a healthy lifestyle so that the bulb uh went on yeah yeah so don our medical college right so we were there for like six years we were being trained so good right in any complications you have a cataract you will take care of it you have a retinal detachment you it i have a stomach ulcer bleeding we take care of it if you have cancer we diagnose we prevent it we treat it but you will agree that we don much on prevention yeah like uh they do tell we had an entire spm uh preventation prevention i just bi-hearted everything i just vomited but i never applied it and doctors also keep telling telling but they don is the point and uh you you don a way that it becomes not followable uh after allah after after a period of time very dramatic drastic changes you do in your lifestyle and obviously it will not be continuable you stop after a month it exactly so you have to teach them how they can do it and you know every treatment always include diet and exercise right but nobody actually sat down and then explained how much they explain the medicine they don exactly and that is the bottom line for everything um so coming back to your experience so when you are running so tell me something about it so you were running for like 5k how did you start and then when what happened with the injury i started walking uh my brother told uh your your heart rate is not rising so make it fast [Music] i started running in my apartment i used to run around the car park so he just i will go one side alone i will run the remaining side like that i did then seriously i started running all uh two to three kilometers i tried to run but one day my amy told tata bye bye i won i was 85 kilos then i thought i okay right away i started running without doing any strength training because i was not aware of it aware of it exactly only way i can raise heart rate in the exercise which i running [Music] but i didn way proper way how to do it in a proper way in youtube videos what your mind knows only your eyes will see yes yes i i didn search like i didn straight away started running running so what happened so you had that knee pain then you took a break then you start running again so you are being doing this for six months then you form that fitness group so what happened in that fitness group so that to get to know about this intermittent fasting and also about like how to gradually uh increase your strength so that it will aid you in uh in help you in your running so you didn intermittent fasting from my channel uh i saw it okay okay so you got the group and then they talked about so they talked about fasting they talked about uh they talked about strength training strength training um okay until then i was thinking dumbles are only for boys [Music] i everything comes and i have been doing doubles for the past two years so i have not developed anyway of course my strength has increased but then it so and you agree that women need more strength training than men actually definitely they need because uh it which i totally learned in the recent two years till then i have not even touched dumbledore on the side yeah i won it if i go to the gym i will usually all those mr psg competition in in uh phd right like we do the culture programs so you know most of my friends everybody um you know go to gym and then lift weights and then try to build muscle so it has been ingrained in my mind that okay muscle building is only for bodybuilding exactly if you have to walk on the stage and if you want to show off and if you want to build muscle so that is what muscle building is for us importance of protein intake i have never had it in my mind so always now if i think retrograde i have been only starving and not fasting so starvation will lead to lot of deteriorating effect you will start uh losing your muscles and nothing is going to help you whereas fasting is you nutrients at the same time it is a time guided eating so in that group so you learned about strength training you said okay no if you want to proceed further you need to build a muscle a little bit to increase the strength um so then what happened so you went to a gym or what happened so uh like i was initially doing following some youtube videos uh yeah but i was not that happy so i started having a personal trainer for so he taught me um how it has to be done properly we had a lot of like agility sessions uh strength training sessions ladder drills uh we had all uh so the sessions that you about is like stretches right stretches and then uh session will have 15 minutes warm up followed by a session with 15 minutes stretches stretches [Music] [Laughter] so he you know you started warming up you stretched out and then what was the first strength exercise that you did like push-ups body weight or you went to dumbbells right away uh it was mixed everything was mixed used um so a few days so basically i pulled in my kids also so putting on weight in this lockdown so i make them sit big all these online sessions nice snacks everything they were also putting on weight so i just pulled them also and trainer was very nice that he gave us a lot of variety of exercises so we didn um i could feel the difference me running before and now uh what the way in which i still have to learn more so no absolutely you know it exactly um so you started learning a little bit and then you started running again right yeah so i after that i uh registered myself for a marathon and i not done a marathon i did 10 kilometers that it has to be that even good 10 kilometers it it able to run 10 kilometers seriously it uh sitting in home with a knee pain yes running 10 kilometers i i am proud of myself absolutely you should be you should be proud of yourself you know it now this comes an important point that you are not you are not a person without any job you are a full-time ophthalmologist and you are a mom of two kids chicken myself i don so cook yourself um you cook yourself and you vegetarian yeah you protein conception is even difficult so there is something that motivated you to find time to do all this and um is it your knee pain or you started noticing improvement childhood i have been body shaped um always in my mind it will be running in back of my mind i have never thought it in the right way always i was finding out shortcuts okay 10 days i will fast so only now uh with the help of all nice friends like you and everybody i have started learning about it uh wanting to start fitness to know these basic facts so that they won so how to lose belly fat in three days that video is not good now also people tell me lower half circuit do only for that no exercise why are you running spot reduction spot reduction i know it might work for uh cinema heroines and i have to tell them the one full story it not put this part it will produce so i really want to focus on the time that you created that is the biggest problem that people are complaining i don time you know i look on but my problem is you know between 35 to 45 years of age if you have two little kids it is your damn responsibility to be fit for them until they turn 18. i keep repeating that all the time because you know you see all this young sudden cardiac death uh happening and all we do is rest in peace right we just write rest in peace and we don so that is the whole purpose of the channel to see how we can promote healthy lifestyle among 35 to 45 years of age especially they have kids so once you had all this setup you have a personal trainer you have this uh what to do how did you make time to do it i am lucky enough to tailor my uh profession okay in that way i lucky enough to get a lot of help from my family members [Music] only me cooking so helps me in cutting vegetables so everybody takes part my kids wash vessels so it domestic helper who just cleans our home but cooking part and kitchen uh washing utensils we all share our households but um to some extent i had to uh give up my early morning sleeps so i wake up uh you initially i was waking up only at six seven like that so for uh this exercise schedule i wake up a hour earlier that i make sure i get sufficient sleep so that uh i don that are saying that it is just a small step that is an important step and it is not easy to do it is not easy to do at all it was difficult initially but keeping a trainer was even happy because we paid money let me ask you this you know for me waking up has been a habit now it took me like around like 74 days because i keep track of it um for a person so now i have stopped the trainer and i wake up on my own on your own so for that to become a habit how long did that take me eight months eight months eight months eight months no it answer right it takes time it takes time so but i think that is one important thing that you did that is showing this much amount of outcome and the key thing that you said was to sleep early as well yeah absolutely so for running they say your diet your sleep everything manages and also your mindset if you are not feeling good don a run skip let me ask you this so when you made a change okay you know what when you wake up in the morning you tired so now you know that okay no i need to sleep early to catch up those hours so when you decide that what did you do what was your sleeping time before and how did you change that usual during long term initially it was late night movies popcorns everything and uh wake up at 10 o o two days a week i was working so slowly i started i have to regulate myself so i made it uh 10 o i have to sleep so i go to bed but i won time but then i same way morning also snoozing snoozing snoozing until the personal trainer comes and hit the smooth button for oh i had to wake them up because i have to make them a pie wake up or half an hour early so two things i learned from this for the audience as one one is you need to involve your family exactly and then they have to be on same page and who you you know i want to be healthy i want to lose weight i want to do this for my family they would of course they will say yes and it may be initially difficult initially but you will overcome that hurdle the second thing that you said is the sleep part is like absolutely important so you know in my channel i put a video on intermittent fasting the what worked for me so that went up to like one million views i mean this is not for not for uh summer peace anna i put a video on sleep like you know how to get um good quality sleep that meant only 30 000 views i wish it the other way around and sleep is the most important thing and you burn more calories while you are sleeping good and you are a living example for that um so when you adopted this method so eight months it took it took a habit but now how much can you run and what is your routine now uh i do hill climbing like i do fly over repeats which is supposed to be very over repeat time flies climbing the flyover running running and climbing the flyover regular i mean outside the gym yeah on road on route so to stimulate like uh just uh hill repeats he okay lot of elevation and everything you need to get used to it okay so maximum i have run is 15 kilometers until now oh my god so i you need a lot of training for that so i just taking it slow i don absolutely absolutely absolutely [Laughter] wow beautiful so so we didn a wonderful explanation like how you entered into fitness how you were slowly into running um one thing from your audience is if you are not a big running fan running is just a mode of exercise you know you can also do other things as well if you want to play tennis you want to play cricket cricket when i cricket can you play soccer or something like that so running was just what dr anusha it worked out for her um so in this change i want to focus on the diet so when does diet come in one what change did you do and how did that change walking regularly running regularly weight didn down to a point but after that i couldn i was when i was qualifying to my friends like see diet is only 80 percent exercise only 20 percent so unlike you as usual youtube videos gives making cake also i was baking cake every day how will i reduce weight in my intermittent fasting video my wife is saying that there is a swiggy ad that comes in between [Music] i was like oh wow from 83 suddenly i became 75 oh my god and after that every kg was very difficult in a plateau almost for six months i am still in a plateau i am pixifying my head how to come and the tongue is there no that is not letting me but but don i mean my main point usually i tell my patients is that um and the faster the panic i lost that initial weight i was like 100 kilos and then i went down to 90 right away on intermittent fasting and i see you here i hit a flattery at 90. but that 10 kilo loss was a big motivation factor that continuing also oh you get to know about so many things and it no more no more going back yes yes even if you want to your body will not allow you to exactly so i so much of positivity in you not only in your body wise looking wise also in your work your concentration everything improves so you start loving it so you will never go back that main thing you have to get it in it not weight loss yes healthy living healthy going into a healthy lifestyle energy energy how you feel for the day whatever you do i mean you lost so much energy even though there is no like significant change in the numbers on the scale um so in your case um so tell me about uh i mean what time you started how do you start the intermediate fasting and what are the challenges that you face uh see usually i have a late breakfast so breakfast was not at all an issue for me dinner was the most toughest part and also giving up my morning coffee was a very very tougher story i was used to have nice filter coffee with lot of sugar in the morning and what time do you usually have before this like 7 no as soon as i get up i need my coffee so 5 36 and that was the really toughest part long time for me every time i uh look into the black coffee i feel like vomiting green tea i used to ask how do you drink this and now i am drinking like oh wow it the only way that green tea is will help you lose weight is actually you go to the mountains and pick the green tea for yourself no i am a person who was drinking sometimes coffee ah [Music] lot of calories got cut down like that during work as well work as well [Laughter] my side is i did not know that the milk a cup of milk for example this is black coffee but this milk has like 150 calories abner it took me a long time to understand how did you come to know that about calories and everything this actually started uh previously itself except for the early morning coffee day i changed to green tea okay i had some weight loss so that when i realized okay so much surface empty calories [Music] it anything it so why should you have that stop but but uh and also having an early dinner was very very difficult i was having at nine o made it eight i have it before going to my clinic so i finish it off by five o wow and then after that what do you drink you don water water or if uh if i feel like having something i or something and tell me this one so in it i know it when you adopted this technique what was the what what did you do when you felt hungry in the middle of the night when you started this initially i slept then [Music] uh because i made it very i took it up very slowly i didn dinner one her one her like that i uh cut shortened the period so i didn and also uh the dinner when i am providing it with proper nutrients fibers and everything no you really feel full you don even if you bring my give me one big milkshake or ice cream also i don i don so once once it became a habit it easier for you but for the first six weeks or like two months what will happen when somebody invites you for a reception that you have need to go for like 8 p.m i started during college [Laughter] that thanks to so what do you do now like now it became a habit now for you no popcorn so so what do you do now um now you have this is a habit so let say somebody invites you for reception you go there what do you do a reception this party only happens very frequently [Laughter] thing which i find it very very difficult so i just they know about me so they don we just go we sing together we dance together we have all the fun except that i won finished my dinner i don also know they don so two important points number one dr anusha is a singer one of her videos went viral like a year ago and she sing [Laughter] songs i sang is so please check out a small video so two point number one she number two it that you know your you let your circle know circle of friends know that you are adopting this method yeah that that really made a difference to you exactly and is your friends is doing the same thing as well actually many have got inspired they are trying uh they keep asking me tips so i help them whenever they find it difficult but uh many stop after a while i don know why but at least they know that you are following it religiously you are showing some results so when there is social situation they don sometimes hospitality can be a problem even family we in case we are going to order dinner we do it by 5 o and then what do we do we go to the hostel and then we see tv or we hang out we come back again for dinner at 8 pm [Laughter] so i think i think it will take a lot of time for the society to change slowly but i think somebody has to incorporate the change for our younger generation and this cannot this can this is not sustainable the current lifestyle that we have is not sustainable um anyway i know that it to sleep uh we want to let you not disturb your circadian rhythm one last question if you want to wrap up this whole session if i to you or a friend to you i come and then say hey you know i want to lose weight like how you did what will be your first suggestion and then give us a wrap-up summary please so first and foremost is uh it it is going to be a healthy lifestyle so that will be the my first advice so start something which you can follow it for your life and also don start it in a proper way and the diet is 80 percent exercise is 20 so make your diet properly calculate it you can see it in all pioneering videos so i learned i never knew for td anything so i came to know your protein intake everything matters so do it in a proper way seek help seek professional health it makes a lot of difference rather than just doing it by yourself initial initially if you have that professional help you will attain your goals at and uh will also sustain it because you won super super sounds good um thank you so much thank you thank you so much big kudos to you it know with the busy medical

Weight Loss journey - ft. Mr. Sastry Malladi (Youtube family member) | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0fOOIraeOY	Dr Pal	hello guys this is a doctor pallavika in this video i very special guest you know i don know him i came to know him through youtube channel and he sent me an email that you know he has been losing weight since following this method and uh i just asked him whether he would be willing to share his experience on board and he was more than happy to come on board and then share his experiences with us the main reason to do this video is to make sure that you know you understand that this is definitely possible this is a long-term solution it you like seven days that happen right so i example and i guaranteed that i don before and he reached out to me by himself so i want to explain that this method is very very powerful and the only thing that is needed from you is consistency and long-term dedication and commitment to this method and this is pretty simple and secure and safe and let me just bring shas 3 on board [Music] oh hi shastre thank you thank you for reaching out to me thank you so much doctor thank you for uh having me here nice nice so i super super super so um so shastri lives in ohio and he has two uh beautiful daughters eight and three years old and why don audience why don how did all the starter how did you come across my channel what happened what triggered the change in you sure sure yeah it was back in 2020 uh when uh like everybody i was working from home uh pretty much and uh started gaining weight uh you know uh over a period of time and uh my work uh demands that i have to i have to be you know uh in front of computer for a long time so it was uh i put in a put down a lot of weight and it was close to 200 pounds and then i was searching for some um ideas or something to start off with uh and somehow i came up to your channel and and uh you know with all your uh uh you know um your your videos about the uh kovid and you know how to how to uh you know go from step one to step two and you know uh i i really like the like your approach and your videos and the way you i think i think you know my channel comes in between swiggy and kfc french fries so uh i started i started doing that uh you know just adopting and i did not even um uh you know have like a specific goals or anything like that at the beginning i just took your advice and started with a 12-hour eating window uh and uh and then i did it just to clear so 12 hour 18 window you just figured out that you fast for 12 hours and your first bait and last bite is going to be within 12 hours yes yes 8 8 a.m 8 a.m to 8 p.m was my eating wind and then i know the rest of it is the fasting window fasting and in that fasting you don anything just water just water just water and initially uh initially i was just drinking cold water and uh you know later stages i switched that to hot water and it really helped it really helped over time so before this 8 pm change i mean before you come across my video what was your last dinner time what was your last bite usually it was really regular i mean i used to i used to be like it used to go to like 9 10 sometimes okay and uh uh you know usually during the weekends it was worst uh and the main uh uh the main uh habit that i that i had was eating snacks a lot alone which i think one of your one of your video it suggested to you know maybe cut down on the snacks and maybe concentrate more on you know having your dinner done early and so that kind of triggered everything so you know i i think it is just the same story for everybody that was including me as well you know when i was obese i do the exact same thing so the the the trick is that you can have your snack i anybody it kadalamata in the afternoon at 3 p.m and not at 3am basically yeah okay so you made that change um 8am to 8pm so how how did you feel in the first two weeks that should be a little bit different for you yeah it was very difficult in the beginning i used to wake up in the middle of the night and i was so hungry and like i think one of your video what you said was exactly right everything around me was looking like it was it was food around me i wanted to eat and i have a foodie i mean i eat i like to you know so it was really hard at least i think two to three weeks was uh really challenging uh but i really wanted to do this because i wanted move i mean next next year i wanted to show that okay this is i want to change myself and i want to be in a position where you know i can i can do whatever i want i can be an example to my kids and nice beautiful that is what i really wanted perfect so perfect that that that should be the common specific goal for everybody who have kids [Laughter] right right i um so okay so you got that temptation i mean i mean it is extremely common to have that kind of temptation in the first two weeks because your body has never seen this before right your body have been like fed every time when you want it you know there is never a period of starvation at all so in those two weeks when everything around you looked like food what did you do to overcome that yeah so uh you know along with uh this video i was also uh watching uh uh some videos on how to like you know avoid temptations and that kind of stuff i came up with uh one interesting video about uh uh which amir khan the actor uh he said uh i think he was shooting for some movie and then he says how to you know control your uh temptations and he gave these three golden rules and i really followed that and i following it till date you know and you know the first rule was if you really wanted to eat something uh which is in front of you and you know you really don first rule was to uh try to wait for 10 minutes just don for 10 minutes and then you know uh and then so i i i did follow that and the second second rule he said was try to drink some water and just come back and then see if you still want to eat it uh the third rule he said was uh if you still want to eat it maybe just take a little bit a bite size of uh you know of the whole food in front of you which will uh still you are you know got your taste leave it like that but i mean uh to be honest uh i strictly followed the first two i never went to the third one and i really wanted to do that uh and i somehow i followed it and it worked uh worked very well for me and uh uh you know uh so i i tried my best to uh not have anything nice nice i did that in the first two three weeks and then it became a habit really it wasn i i stick to that window blindly without uh you know without eating anything so right so so one thing that helped me and also i tell all my patients is that um you know you have this uh in amazon you can buy this 64 ounce water bottle yes to be honest as a water intake for everybody it start with um so i just filled that with water and we have this hot water at home you can get it from the indian store and it used to just fill it up and sometimes you can infuse that with orange and lemon and everything but you could just keep it right next to you wherever you go right you go to the bathroom you go to the rest you go to the dining room kitchen wherever you go you just carry that as if you are a sage carrying that bottle with water yeah that for me and then as you said the key thing that you mentioned was a habit right and multiple research have shown that it takes 66 days for a person to develop a habit on an average and then then you don your willpower i think in your case what has happened in the first two weeks you have enforced your willpower a lot kudos to you that doesn people and especially the weakens right that where the problem is so what happened for you during the weekend did you plan anything in advance or did you just go over you didn was easy for you i mean it was kovit was one reason uh where we didn of weekends or potlucks or anything like that but even then what i what i did was uh i talked to my wife i talked to my kids and i talked to my friends and told them that this is what i want to do and then i told them hey if you wanna if you wanna be uh meet over the weekends let let it always like goes you know beyond eight nine and absolutely absolutely absolutely um i try to uh and then some of them were on unavoidable like you know they were at uh during the uh dinner time but i was very strict i i either either eat uh ate at home before going there i just went there and then pretended i was eating but i really did not eat so um wish because i i really want to stick to that 12 hour window no matter what yeah so uh weekends was really really tough but but if you do it uh if you know i i managed to do it somehow in the first period and then like i said it we can just have it and you know right right right so the other tip that i can tell my patients and also the audience is that um when the weekend the biggest thing that you can do for yourself is to pre-plan so for example for me next week and know there is a reception that they have invited me over so i know that it going to be a problem for dinner so what i usually do is i eat everything uh well before to go over there and then i go in with a big different box yes i just pack everything yeah and you know the indian hospitality will not let you not eat anything right so the more they serve you the more you get they feel happy but the problem is they don that they are affecting you on a long term basis so it that you made very clear to all your surroundings your friends and families are going to say you know what i to do this you need to help me out i going to do this for my kids i want to change so when you are upfront about it i don say you know you should eat more of the gulab jab that i made yeah actually like yes absolutely actually the other thing is uh most of my friends are in the same boat really i mean they are near the same boat they wanted to uh you know they tried uh several different diet plans and other stuff but um they uh understand where uh where i from and uh i told them hey this is what i want to do and i want to just take it for i can seriously i wish all the change that you made um it has to be like a default change for everybody who of age you have little kids here and especially here in u.s and also uh in india and also outside india as well um especially we just get absorbed in this like fast-moving culture that we don we end up in a gofundme page for little young kids um that i can i can so coming back to you after a few days then it became a habit to you then when did you first notice some weight loss in you or any kind of change yeah so it took it took a few weeks uh i was just strictly following that uh uh window uh eating window and uh i think probably like six to seven weeks into the you know into this i started uh observing that i at that point i was really encouraged because i i really wanted to so it took it took a little bit of time but when it when i started losing weight uh the weight loss was so was significant i mean it was uh it dropped quite a bit i think it dropped like you know uh you know maybe four or five pounds in a period of like you know in a week or something and uh i started noticing it uh then i said okay yeah this uh you know it working work and i was not really and i was not really you know fasting or doing anything you know absolutely so at that time uh doctor uh i was you know i your videos every week one thing what i did at for at that time was uh i made a list of what i can do to uh eat healthy food within that 12-hour interview and then i made like a little flowchart for myself i said okay this is my morning routine uh afternoon routine in the evening what can i avoid what can i avoid or what can i replace with a healthy alternative instead of you know uh i don or something with something else uh so uh which is what i made for myself and uh i took it to the next you know next level what i did and i wanted to show you um i made like a calendar for myself oh my god this is awesome and actually this uh calendar approach really really works uh because it simplifies things a little bit uh on my end my wife me and then uh even like you know there is really uh i set a calendar for one month and i say hey this is what i for the entire month for uh lunch dinner and then breakfast and uh you know she knows what i going to really go for you know anything yeah anything special for cooking and i stick to that routine i i just said okay this is what i some protein in the morning and uh afternoon for lunch and then evening dinner i usually when i used to come back from office i used to eat snacks like or i was so hungry when i came back eat a lot of uh so i what i what i just coming back uh from from office i just eat my dinner directly i just okay i think i think it that you up right you when we grew up in india evening five six pm what is the time that snacks and then the dinners are only like 8 9 p.m so i do the exact same thing so i come back from work and i have my dinner as a family everybody me my wife my kids everybody and then that just water and the other thing that you really mentioned was uh you know one thing that you you you didn has happened to you that you know the you started looking into the healthy foods only after you notice some change isn yes you didn right because it to do so that is what the problem with all the current weight loss programmers you know they focus on the diet first and they keep on saying oh don this don everything and then there is only a certain amount of willpower that you can put it yes right with this time resetter thing you notice the effort then you get motivated you get hooked on to it you say that the weight loss is happening then you want to make it even better yeah yes that that eat matters uh at that time yes absolutely that was one of the and then on top of it what i also challenged myself was uh via whatsapp we have facebook so i just said okay i updates every week to everybody and say hey this is my week one this is my week two this is my week three whatever you know and then uh and everybody started appreciating that you know see seeing the change and that also kind of motivated okay this is this program really works right and you know i i adjusting the timings and eating i guess you know help going for healthy alternatives uh there was nothing really special i was doing uh so uh it kind of uh it really by that time it was really a habit for me and everybody around me they understood me and my wife she uh she pretty much like she was what i was asking for obviously of course you helped her with the cooking as well that important absolutely that important absolutely so so okay so your journey started with your weight loss you notice after six weeks how much weight you lost tell us some numbers please yeah absolutely uh so initially when i before starting the um you know uh starting this program i was close to 200 pounds 200 200 uh or 191.99 you know very close to 100 and then i started losing weight um i remember uh remember the day when i was 180 uh you know after maybe after starting with the healthy alternatives i was down to 180 and then from 180 got down to go down to 160 so when did this 180 happen 180 uh i would say probably 20 weeks into the 20 weeks like five six months super yeah we say like you know four to five pounds uh three to four pounds among the average okay um that rate of weight loss and uh the problem with this method is you know you don notice right away and you notice only after six weeks of persistent consistency so you lost 20 pounds in let months and then you really lost a lot even 20 more pounds yeah i lost quite a bit after uh from that time to about 40 weeks uh time uh i lost another 20 pounds and that is another five months yes so 10 months you lost like 40 pounds yes 40 pounds so there approach that when you lose so many pounds you will lose some muscle as well along with it right yeah yeah so what did you do did that happen to you yes it did happen to me and then my mom you know i she was yeah she called she calls me she you know we do video call weekends and she was like what appreciate it we stopped there you know she was like uh please unsubscribe from dr paul [Laughter] yeah but but i knew i knew uh the biggest thing was even though uh i was i was down to 160 at that point i had good sleep i really was suffering a lot of i was sleep deprived before but since i started the program drank a lot of water that was the main thing and then i sl i i mean to be honest more than my kids sometimes i i just uh sleep quality increased quite a bit uh i mean i i do track like the sleep quality you know in my senior watching it was it was always over 85 but but to get back to the you know uh i was i was a lean and um it was 160. then um at that time uh knowingly or unknowingly i just started doing some weights and i really did not did not know why i started it um and i brought the weight set a long time ago and never touched it and uh i just started doing it i don really to be honest um and at that time i think i saw another video of yours dr paul with and i had no idea what a circadian rhythm is to that ball i had no idea what that is but i started reading some uh articles about circadian rhythm and also what are the benefits along with doing some resistance training um then i started doing training i mean i just uh you know i have my calories i increased my calories a little bit for the weights i i was at 1900 calories right now up to like 2200 um 800 i have to do uh you know burn it however with the weights or nice nice so you started doing weights for how long now uh so it i started the program and i think after 40 weeks when i was down to 160 um like at that time i started doing uh you know just uh started with like very basic basically basic numbers more importantly how often you were able to do that like how so i started doing four times uh in a week um and right now i all day seven days i so because but i could see that show us your muscles look at that but yeah i mean uh i i i saw a significant change like i was maintaining that uh i know i was down to like 150 154 at one point but uh i was the my weight currently right now i and i can i can so uh i think this i think yeah you know it really works and currently what i following a 10 hour eating window during the weekdays and then try to do 10 to 12 during the weekends weekend so but i make sure that i do some type of weight training every day it doesn what uh if you know um you know dumbbells so let me ask you this i that problem that it like a selfish interview as well because i want to know more about you as well so that can be motivationally for me um so you know my problem is that i to find time how do you create time so what i did uh dr pal was i i want to uh start my breakfast at eight that is that is one of my goal or you know from the beginning but i do wake up early uh so i need to do something in between uh to uh so that was one of the reason why i started doing weights because once i woke up it was really hard for me to wait for two hours to get my not doing anything yes exactly before so that is the reason that was one of the reason i started doing weights because actually i wanted to kill some time in between uh so um i started doing so right now what i do as soon as i wake up i just hit the gym i i just go i mean by gym uh i want to make you a garage it dumbbells and that fancy you know like a fancy equipment okay i just go directly to uh lift weights or do some resistance and that that really helps because uh everybody around me are sleeping at that time so i really asking for me to play with them or anything like that uh so that was that that one hour of um i i now and i think i change i wake up at like five and i doing from 5 30 to 6 30 and it working and i hit the uh i go to the hospital uh i start from like seven reach hospital by seven so it a little bit more i need to be a little bit more disciplined about it uh to get this as a habit okay super so you found time you hit the gym you lifted weights you were doing four times a week initially then you got hooked on to it because you started noticing some changes and then you increased to six to seven times a week so now you are around 155 pounds i mean yeah 155 uh you know plus or minus two but more importantly your quality of life has improved significantly yes absolutely i mean i for last uh before two years uh like you know very uh unhealthy lifestyle i would say at that time eat eat at whatever time you know sleep quality was bad uh and like i said uh right now i think i think i you know i eat eat uh appropriately in the correct time good let me ask you this how do you feel about your energy level uh it high i mean uh very high right now uh like even my workwise it demands me to be i talk to a lot of people every day so i need my energy levels to be high um you know uh one thing which i need to mention was uh the stress levels have gone significantly in the last one year or so uh you know especially once i started this program um because uh you know once you have those 16 17 hour work days uh the stress will get get to you absolutely to disconnect to disconnect from that stress or yeah from that uh to get this balance uh this program and the weight training really helped absolutely i again want to thank you so much no you very happy i was the main reason that i actually diverted the channel from covert to weight loss stuff and you know when you say program people might think that it is a it is like a full-blown design program absolutely not the main reason to bring shastri here is that he was not even he didn before this interview and he just followed my youtube videos what i put in like a general stuff so i thought about it actually see let are a living example that if you can follow this method even without meeting me every anybody can do this anybody can do this but if i can put together a program and if somebody needs help that you cannot do it by yourself then i think this might be the way to go if you are not able to do anything else absolutely i think i think if you have like a little bit of guidance to uh you know you know i think there uh especially a lot of my friends who want to change uh themselves but they are looking for you know what is the starting point how do we advise and you know i have been there as well i thinking now is that maybe um again people who are watching this you have seen shastri which is very very heartwarming statue measure for me you can do this by yourself you don just stick with this feeding window eating window and then do some kind of resistance training so that you can be yoga as well you don lift weight lift weights yoga is a wonderful way of resistance training as well but you need to do something after you notice some change uh so that you preserve your muscle uh but let some help in case if you want some kind of guidance please email me um askdocpal gmail.com we are trying to put together a program for you guys and i don that much amount of time as of now so i initially but i want to make sure that you know people who wants help uh will definitely get it from this uh this channel basically so it productive platform uh we are trying to grow together we are trying to get help from each other and you have motivated me so much uh shall say that next year by this time you will be interviewing me about my muscle so i they reach out to me to reach out to you as well to see how your progress is that okay with you absolutely absolutely i would love to help but i thought absolutely anyway sounds good super thank you thank you so much for coming on the show and uh i wish you good luck in your all your endeavors and you are a role model for your girls and i proud of you i right thank you so much thank you so much thanks for all the guys thanks thanks for your thank you	Success

emails like this but this one was really peculiar because um she old based on her profile and i was like how come a young girl from coimbatore is interested in fitness and she all i know about fitness is when i hit 34 33 years of age only then i came to know about fitness so i was very very curious regarding what made her choose the journey and i i we can also use it on our day-to-day activities as well so let aparna [Music] good very good very good so um i hospital and she is in coimbatore and we have like a 12 hour difference except that this is almost close to midnight for her and she explain um the fitness level as well okay so uh apana thank you so much for joining okay so i really want to emphasize on two important points number one at such a young age you are into this fitness journey and number two being a girl being a woman um it is even more important that you know i about the hormonal imbalances and it is very very important for fitness especially in addition to time restricted feeding in women to maintain the muscle mass and everything so you actually check the boxes for both the criterias and i really want to know what actually triggered you to come into fitness because this is not a common thing that we do because i know i grew up in coimbatore i know exactly what is the uh um thinking among society so tell me what made you choose the fitness journey okay uh so i got into fitness during the first day of core 19 so before the pandemic i was completely different person shooting a break faster so i got into fitness during the first wave of covert 19 so before the pandemic hit i was a completely different person i i hated fitness i literally hated it so during my um high school days uh i was into tennis and athletics uh but i never really enjoyed it and um i used to bunk all my sessions i used to be a very very lazy person back then uh so uh practice sessions i used to bunk my classes because i was very lazy and like usually follow us in the other way around right we bunk the lecture classes and we go to the athletics sessions she used to call me every day morning yeah so he ensured that i attended all the classes even though i hated it so so this was me before the pandemic and um uh so even my eating habits was really bad uh before two years back yeah so something happened in kobe copenhagen what happened yeah that what so before covered i was like uh totally totally different i used to eat all kind of crappy foods so maggie i used to eat maggi and coke was my favorite drink and and during my college first year i used to uh skip my mails i used to eat a lot of outside foods but during that point of time i did not realize that i was spoiling my health that i was damaging my gut so due to due to all these unhealthy lifestyle habits i ended up getting severe ulcer and gastritis and even today i have a very poor gut health and i because of the all things i did in the past reverse it now and so this was me before the court after the code during the first lockdown of over 19 um i did not know what to do it was very boring at home so i thought i should get active and during that time i was very insecure about my body because uh two years back i was very chubby so i started working out uh watching these youtube videos a 10 minute youtube video i started with that and only for 10 minutes not more than that would be maximum 15 but not more than 15 minutes because you know i hate it so but the thing was even though i hated working out i i made sure i was very consistent in it it was very close every day except on sundays and uh slowly uh this became a habit for me it was a habit for me and um i started seeing results in my body um so you whether you liked it or not you bite the bullet and you do it every 10 minutes looking at the video and then what kind of changes that you noticed so um i saw that i i was getting rid of my flabby arms my flabby stomach i was getting spit yeah but the the thing that surprised me a lot was [Music] [Laughter] but it was only for 10 minutes 10 minutes so so what time of the day does it matter do you have like a consistent time no no i did not follow any time sometimes it sometimes in the evening but you made sure that you did at least 10 minutes a day yes as it went on i felt really energetic my mental health improved a lot my confidence drastically improved and also for two years back i had severe migraine issues every every week i used to get migraine and after introducing fitness into my life and after adopting healthy lifestyle uh i just disappeared i never took that i you used to take medications before for migraine but not anymore i did not actually take any medications so but then it just disappeared i didn get migraine after that so that thing changed my life and slowly i uh started uh adopting a healthy diet so i thought okay we are working out so much i think we have to nourish our body well so i thought uh the first thing the next step i did was i completely avoided all the processed foods like no sugary drinks coke pepsi instant foods i completely avoided avoided that and give me some examples of instant foods i know coke pepsi is pretty obvious what is the instant food uh no i wouldn processed like you know uh in the haldiram the pale puri instead take processed foods today when i go to grow grocery shopping i make sure i check the list nutrition nutrition list i make sure that is there is no added sugar saturated fat and all those things so uh so when i stopped eating such processed foods i saw much more results in my body i felt more uh you know i felt good about mentally mentally magically so that happened and did you did he lose weight with this yeah okay that thing i did not uh you know force myself to be in a restrictive diet or something it just slowly changed it slowly adopted a healthy lifestyle uh i lost around seven kgs but it took me nine months it was a very slow process but i enjoyed it it was very good nice uh so i did that uh i became like i fell in love with fitness because you had so much energy you started noticing some results and you got self-confidence so you fell in love with the fitness you wanted to go to the next level yes and then i started learning a lot of things about fitness nutrition our health our bodies work so slowly there was one point in my life i couldn workout what happen yeah i was like okay so the point i was thinking why don make this as a take this as a barrier because i passionate about fitness and i wanted to create awareness among people and i wanted to change their lives so how about your diet you during this nine months initially except for avoiding processed foods did he focus your protein into carbs or what happened yeah slowly when i started learning about uh slowly i started eating a lot of protein protein rich foods you can fish eggs i started increasing my protein intake uh but i was not very restrictive like carbs i increased my protein intake uh power was uh i love carbs actually to be honest i couldn companies yeah even today i love carbs and uh i actually did not do much uh diet restrictions i i started eating a lot of whole and natural foods stop eating processes max focus on protein rich diet so that was all i did are you a vegetarian or non-machine i am a non-vegetarian you non-vegetarian so your protein source was what chicken chicken and fish eggs so so let me summarize your journey so you were not into fitness before covert and in cover you had some kind of background though your mom was fit and your brother was into hockey so you thought okay you must be active as well so you started doing this youtube videos 10 minutes every day and then slowly first thing that you did was avoiding processed food and then since because of the consistency in three to four months you started noticing difference about like seven kilos in nine months and then it about what protein what cardboard waters macros and everything good beautiful beautiful ninga youtube learn the transition and jim lavender what did he do okay so first uh uh i started with body weight exercise just body weight for over uh five months i did only body weight exercise like push-ups and all those things burpees and all those things and after that that more about it so push-ups burpees and tell us other few other exercises that the audience can follow okay so basically i started for example for upper body i used to do shoulder taps i used to do uh shoulder clamps shoulder taps [Music] then you do push up for upper body and for the abdomen ab workout i used to do bicycle crunches normal crunches um all those things obliques focusing on obliques and all that and for the legs i used to do squats uh pelvic bridges uh all those so i kinds of these kinds of uh workouts in the beginning one important point so to interrupt you i think for the audience it important that when people think that they that you need to lift heavy weights or you bodybuilding competition just with your regular body weight what aparna said push-ups planks sit-ups squats um shoulder taps all these or regular body weight exercises you could just type in shoulder tabs in youtube and they like so many videos explaining to you how it is done and all these are like simple videos that you necessarily don need any specific trainer to actually uh do that for you um again consistency is a key thing as well so so you started doing that and then obviously your tone must have gotten better right yeah yeah and then i started okay i should switch to weights so the same i started learning a lot more than a i used to i used to use my medicine book so uh so after a month uh two kgs was very easy for me my body got adapted to the weight it was very very easy okay so too simple for me and then after that after two kg i thought i should buy a pair of five kilograms okay all these are home that journey was very good uh when i bought the dumbbells and i started working i used weights for my workouts so for example when i was doing bodyweight squats now i used uh squats with dumbbells so added some resistance to my workout so i saw much more resist i saw my muscles were building i was looking more toned and after that after a few days i thought okay 5kg is getting easier i should move to heavier weights so after 3-4 months i bought sun perfect dumbbell and now i beautiful you know there point to what you just described it called progressive increase in your intensity it increase in your intensity so if you keep on doing just two kilos for like two years nothing is going to happen so 2 kilos 4 kilos 5 kilos 7.5 kilos similar to what you have done um you need to progress of stimulating your muscles so you know in all this journey that you mentioned so far you never mentioned about walking or running did you ever look into it no no walking was a part of my routine i used to like go for evening work you know ten ten minutes walk but i was not a complete beginner i used to do athletics and tennis i used to play it and so i [Music] and then after that if you want to do strength turning you have to first strengthen your muscles especially your lower back your hip is very important before you go into uh strength training it spend time in strengthening your muscles first condition it and after that you can slowly start lifting weights uh start with body weight exercise first and after you um if you are good at it if you have to correct your form make sure your form is right because if your form is not correct you might end up in injuries so right absolutely absolutely i first time i signed up in gym i didn the gym train absolutely allowed me because i went in i strained my ankle and he got the money and i didn back [Music] so um okay so beautiful kudos to you not many people do this at your age and at your with your social environment um the second question i have is so let most of my uh audience right you know they are emailing me they asking me that hey you diet 20 person is exercise uh and workout and 80 percent i that you know don eat and focus on when you eat because you rhythm to lose weight and you must have seen in my youtube channel post as well you know so many people right so many people have lost weight and everything but there is an important piece missing to it to the next level is that you know initially you get this weight loss on this intermittent fasting but it has to be walking running or resistance training to keep that tone up um or to get to the next level so i okay the first scenario is that a patient comes to me that hey you know i followed your time restricted feeding i lost 10 kilos nothing is happening anymore so and i and you told me that 20 percent workout is this the time to do so that patient has never worked out in her life so what will be your approach for that patient okay so the reason why he has stopped losing weight is because he has attained the weight loss plateau [Music] so what happens is when you can continuously follow a diet or if you are eating at for example if you you months your body gets adapted to it it used to it get used to it and after that it its fat burning process after that either you have to decrease your calories or you have to increase your uh activity [Music] so if that client has no experience as working out i would suggest him to start with basic uh strength training you know basic strength training like as i said uh start with conditioning workouts and slowly go uh switch to body weight workouts like very basic should be very easy to do and after that after he so when you say basic is like body weight etc that similar to what we talked about like yes push-ups should be like uh for them if it client then he has to start with wall push-ups not the normal not body that google up pelvic bridges just go to youtube just type in but that wonderful exercise to strengthen your lower back yeah yes so you have to start with such basic very very simple exercises and when when the when he push ups easily you can then go to knee pushups is knee push-ups is the lighter version of an actual push-up that you know you can kneel down and then take a push-up compared to having your knee extended during the push-ups that push-ups so you body weight exercises even before knee push-ups he can do inclined uh inclined push-ups okay maybe tall bench or something he can do that so incline is inclined is how how does it work so you have a bench here and incline is like this yeah let me say if the person is this much tall the bench should be here ah you could go down more easy if it height is more less than this slowly you have to decrease the height of the bench or whatever and then after he know 10-12 reps in that motion switch any push-ups [Music] if he uh 20 25 then he can easily do the normal push-ups okay okay so let that we have like four or five exercises what you said okay so let you run 30 minutes or you walk 30 minutes let calories um the strength training you would spend 200 calories throughout the day because of your building muscle and muscle is the number one fat burner in your body so a big big take-home lesson for the audiences and if you only have 30 minutes and if you for time don working or running and focus on stem training it mentioned very impressive yeah so today a lot of people think that cardio will make them lose more fat more weight but that completely wrong um strength training if you do strength training you can burn much more calories because uh when we you know as you said when we have more muscle the our metabolic rate will be more so which in turn we will increase our uh you know build more we that if you keep on doing this because he looks so young and there um so sen training we talked about so walking running if you want to do it do it if you have more time but if you limited for time just focus on strength training so once you are done with this body weight then you go up in your level to do uh dumbbells right similar to what you did yes okay how do we know we are making progress so uh number one strength wise we able to see okay my strength is increased i i that when you are doing this so you will not be like mine you will know by yourself you you don have to hit the wall or punch the wall of the player so let doing like five reps of push-ups before now you a sign of improvement and that should motivate you to do more yes and secondly if you are very consistent you will notice visible change in your body okay okay so all these are like beautiful tips right beautiful tips and um i really want to focus on one thing before wrapping this session up is fitness in women and from a medical standpoint i can tell you that because of hormonal imbalances in women they mass degradation more increased risk of bone changes like osteoporosis and weak knees while they go up but but but the biggest thing that i seeing especially in coin i mean in our society is that gym is only for men and for women they just walk and what is your take on that and how should we change it okay so for a very very long time we have been said that uh uh gym is not for women you have to stay from it uh lifting weights will make you look like a man look like a man exactly yeah like a very common face [Music] say don believe all those things because you see women cannot build so much muscle because we don like men men have a lot of things so they when it comes to women we do not have so much testosterone so we won uh build so much muscle so i think a woman should stop worrying about you know looking bulkier because it won happen it won even if you want to do bulkier you have to work hard you have to work a lot harder i going to put a statement now that every woman seeing this channel seeing this video right now should do at least five push-ups to their level per day will you agree to that yeah if they start with world bishops yeah wall push-ups right yeah they can increase their intensities in you know few months and they is you need to you need to incorporate some kind of resistance training in your routine so don know people are so obsessed i can you how much questions i okay you know how about this organic unsweetened almond milk mixed with chia seed with super high fiber probiotic but they completely forget about the resistance training which might be even more helpful for them compared to this i think people are to be honest they don start that is number one and you have clearly mentioned that you know so start with regular body weight exercises which is very very simple that you recommended and then slowly increase your severity to start with you could even get a trainer to make sure that your form is okay um so basically you said that the form is more important than the reps and the severity and the intensity um wonderful i standpoint as well that you know i see many patients um more than like 50 years of age because of my gastroenterology practice and i can clearly say that people women especially if they have worked out or if they have included resistance training as a part of their routine in the first 20 years between i 50 years of age they look completely different they look so young they look they don much of gi problems as what i see in their counterparts they don out so fitness and women is absolutely important and please include resistance training as a part of the routine so um so open it was a wonderful session thank you for coming on and i know that you are taking clients as well so i will leave down your information in the description and if you does remote training as well so if you want to reach out to her please reach out um one last question so if you want to being a woman and being so young 21 into fitness um if you want to say one good advice to uh women watching this youtube video what we say would be first thing is that uh it very important to take care of our bodies first of all because uh today different we live a sedentary lifestyle and our bodies are not print for such a sedentary existence we have to uh if you want to live a healthy lifestyle you have to start training if you start doing some kind of physical activity not just studying some kind of physical activity so that especially especially for women if you talk about women after after their menopause it helps them a lot training especially helps them a lot and today if you see uh due to poor lifestyle and sedentary lifestyle women are getting so many problems like pcod pcos infertility issues so i think if they these conditions can be reversed if they follow a good workout routine and a healthy lifestyle no absolutely one thing that we didn people think that after delivery they put on all this weight and then they will not be able to get back to their normal routine you know you you have a disadvantage of putting this weight because of hormonal changes during pregnancy but it is absolutely not okay to just leave it like that you need to be unconsciously putting some effort to bring it down and it is definitely definitely possible it this time restricted feeding combined with this resistance training i guarantee you that consistency will definitely give you those results um and we hope okay so maybe we can give some one recommendation to uh to wrap this up so i would say that watch chloe thing video right [Laughter] a very simple video for our audience to watch to start five minutes per day every day similar to what you did yeah just type uh you know simple 10 minute workout routine and then maybe in due course of time you might start a youtube channel for fitness right and then maybe your youtube video might be creating down the road so anyways thank you thank you so much for all your time and all your recommendations and i hope that um our audience got something out of it if you think that you got something out of it please consider donating out to our non-profit organization called ichirim trust we take care of hospice patients comfort care patients who are not able to take care by themselves okay sounds good thank you so much apana thank you so uh [Music]	Success
Â I am glad I am a vegetarianÂ- ft. HARISH UTTHAMAN (Actor) | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNd_bRPvQxg	Dr Pal	hello guys this is uh dr palanibar manikam i have a very special guest for an interview today i got a notification from instagram that uh uh harish uttam an actor actually following my channel so i thought i will have an interview with him because i have seen him in multiple roles and i was really a big fan of his muscle building and strength training and i always wanted to be like him so i him on the show without wasting any time i [Music] hello sir hello hello good morning doctor good morning good morning how are you so good to see you absolutely absolutely same here i super happy to meet you because uh i actually stumbled on uh stumbled upon your profile in instagram and you were really witty and it is very entertaining at the same time you to be said and it i i saw one video of yours one reel of yours and then you know ended up watching few of them you know at the shop so that is how you know you are you are presenting yourself and things you are saying so it is really nice and uh when it comes to fitness and when it comes to uh you know health and all that i you know for so thank you so much sir um i wanted to give you an introduction about myself so i was i obese before okay right i was weighing like 100 kilos you know when i jump into a swimming pool all the water will come out my god 100 kilo wow and and may i ask you what your way what weight now uh doctor well now we 65. wow 35 kg 65. what so in in two years i came down to two to three years i came down to 65 and i did huge achievement right but can you imagine you know i medical doctor right so i tell my patients to lose weight and my patient is telling me why don first [Laughter] absolutely absolutely see i i always leave when we go to some of the gyms you know we who are like really stout and you know be rounder so right if you are like that how are you going to train people you know if you you know you should inspire them you know the first thing is the way you look absolutely absolutely absolutely i think that actually uh resonated my mind like you know i think i always said that you know some medical professionals are hippocratic because you know we ask other patients to follow but we don follow the same thing what we are supposed to um so then i slowly lost weight and you know the only thing that stuck to me was intermittent fasting and but the main thing i learning a lot is about muscle building and when i saw you in all the movies and especially the solo series the trillo character the one thing that really attracted was all the time you have any belly fat at all i don but if i could see or measure based on the movies um i think it should be around like 15 to 17 percent it should be doctor and the timeline i didn be around that yeah 15 to 17 18 yeah max 17 18 percent right [Laughter] but one thing i have to say i i was actually looking for a picture where you said you were 100 kilos i couldn guess i kept scrolling scrolling scrolling but i find any i wanted to see maybe you can send it to me just i have 100 of those pictures okay so one thing i really really learned during my weight loss journey was you know diet is the main thing and 20 person is uh workout and even the 20 percent workout the most important thing is to build muscle so that will increase your metabolic rate i really wanted to hear from you and also to my audience is that you know you look so fit now is it because you went into movies and you want to present yourself well or you have been health conscious and muscle building even before that um i have been a sports person from my 10th standard show 10 standard i started playing basketball so basketball is a very strenuous game and even now i play uh so basketball has been you know i playing for the past uh 20 yeah more than 20 years now so then so every weekend i one and i don a proper a gym gym types more of body weight workouts i see yeah and at least monthly twice or thrice i include cycling at least 100 kilometers a day and 100 kilometers a day so why i number when we when we are stick to one routine in line let to the gym you know after a point we get tired we you know we feel like uh you know all these different things so i do crossfit now recently i practicing and uh i was doing parkour for a while and even now and then you know i go practice parkour so all these for me agility and mobility is the first thing nice so i always concentrate on that and i was part of a normal gym uh or a typical gym uh till about 2016-17 working but adi kapra i don to the typical gym i i go to all these you know bodyweight workouts and strengthening workouts cycling basketball you know sometimes swimming so so i include all these you know whenever i want and wherever i want so i don i always make sure i do a lot of strength training workouts i don don lifting heavy would be only for the deadlift when i first learned about deadlift i was like oh my god that was in my anatomy class where there was a dead body i should live dead body that that you will hope that you know they will teach about the um you know diet exercise during medical education they don or they did i didn right okay you know for instance you know is there in every video and i could actually see that person whenever you say something i can see saranac doing whatever you so it is really nice and people attract people get attracted to these kind of videos and when you meaningful i reach the people it has to be right so thank you sir thank you thank you so much thank you thank you the the key point that you said was that strength training i think that is where people are missing the point actually as soon as they talk about exercise the first thing that they do is walking yes yes yes which is not bad at all which is good but it has to be a little bit you have to exert a little bit you just cannot walk like so slow that [Laughter] [Music] me is when i go to a water theme park [Laughter] sweat is dripping try writing a you know a script a comedy script or something yeah i always feel you know some people say uh um workout is not a separate thing in your you know a one day 24 hour left okay eight hours you 16 hours left at least half an hour to 45 minutes you can keep it for your health for your workout and that is a part of your everyday routine you don you know keep half an hour 45 minutes for workout i think that is that we have to you know keep telling people because you know that you can do it at home you know you don need weights with with body weight workouts there is there is so much to do and and you there is so much to do you know like yeah push-ups and squats and there are so many various squats lunges and you can combine workouts you know from let you you have a one liter bottle take two one liter bottles in both the hands and uh you can combine workouts like squat with shoulder push up that is enough you know you do that three sets or four sets of 20 that like combined workout you your lower body that upper body and and you know cardiovascular at the same time you are developing the strength and it is really good so it is easy [Music] i am sure everybody can work out in their own house in their own space you know my trainer uh he recently here his name is runs a fitness studio called uh curative curative so he has made a abdul he has got a abdul kalam uh [Music] asian records uh he has worked out in uh [Music] worked out continuously non-stop non-stop no weight no weights nothing only body weight workouts so yeah so you know what he can work out but only thing that you during my college days as well i always thought that okay people going to gym or working out is only when they become a model like you or like or if you want to act in movies i was like you know i medicine going to be a doctor i don need all this right right the other thing is people all people i friend has done the push-up workshops with the vodka bottle as well that and he says this workout but the other things i think i sure you might be attesting to it so no matter how much home workout you two things one is you know consistency yes i always tell my patient is that you know you do 10 workouts a day i uh it doesn push-ups it can be like kneel down push-ups as well but that 10 push-ups has to be every day for the next one year please please make a point that you do that 10 push-ups every day for the next 10 years and then consistency doubles the outcome don totally completely see consistency is the the key point key point when it comes to our health and workout consistency and uh as you said uh you know uh as i said and i could go with under the cup i i kind of lost weight during that time and then after covert because i was feeling very weak i started eating you know i couldn month month and a half i couldn out and i was eating nicely and i put on weight and to reduce that it took some time for me to get into my workout routine and that proper diet pattern um but then for a for a week i didn i just did a calorie deficit you know that was the first thing i did for a week and there was a change in my body there was a change in my you know weighing scale so that is the first thing so that does wonders thank you so much for pointing that out because i spent you know i signed up for personal trainer right away right you know i i this personal trainer he i client for him because i never went oh nice every time the subscription time comes up he how are you hopefully you you will not come to meet me but make sure that the subscription is done done wow but then i started motivating myself i went to gym i did like five days a week then i didn because i did not correct my diet at all yes yes when you know when we say diet i don call it a diet doctor i think eat sensible [Music] you know you should know what to eat and what that is all there is you know instead of calling it a diet you know i should not eat carbs at all you know you should eat carbs at the same time you should know what to include you know i yana konda i i have gone to a dietitian only once i guess that was long time back must be around 2013-14 but now what i do is i don digestion what i do is you know uh i go for whole foods non-processed no not processed at all and i don sugar so coffee coffee coffee very little and i like it without sugar also yeah and you just develop a taste to it it is but uh so you eventually i think you we will you know get it on the rotating we will get adapted it exactly i juice or around 11 o another fruit or something or a handful of nuts uh it all changes every day yeah on the proper set uh a meal plan career and afternoon i always make sure i have a lot of vegetables like a lot of vegetables and leaves absolutely you know i promote the exact same thing as well i said diet and it so literally you so that is why i say you know don fasting they say time restricted feeding so it what i tell my patients is you know don said avoid that process take the whole foods increase a lot of vegetables with a lot of fiber and there is studies saying that if you have lots of fiber like this there small intestine that will help you weight losing weight more than anything and that is a multiple research to it absolutely absolutely doctor and and uh you know i have been a non-vegetarian from the time i recently it was it was something you know i am very happy about it uh i stop non-vegetarian every day i where i for working out and yes getting ready for a movie uh physically so anna marie timela i one and a half kgs of chicken a day either last afternoon but uh in 2020 there was a day uh my mom made a chicken curry and i served i served in my plate but i didn we did that same thing happened another day uh i didn mom said okay let we tried fish i didn and that non-which is out of my system i don saying you know you know eating non which is bad or i not saying anything it i didn to eat the chicken i i didn system i don reason i have not been you know thinking okay i should stop afternoon and today if you want to keep fish not within all you can keep it in my plate and you can eat if you want i can feed you also but i don so that was something uh you know it just happened naturally and can i ask you a question since before non-veg and now vegetarian energy level sleep i think i feel the lightest now lightest so and now which is stopping uh i no no workout you know there is so much to have in vegeta vegetarian you know there are so much you know and it than enough it ready to accept that fact that okay make that switch but i very happy i feel very light when i wake up the next day morning and i i try and finish my dinner by by seven o max so if i and do that so so whenever i it is it is eight hour window nice and even even when i intermittent yeah i would say we should we should finish eating anything solid by around 6 6 37 it way there is a lot of difference that will make and if somebody does that for 20 days i am sure they will see a buying amount of change in their uh weighing scale plus their body the way they feel the next day morning and there my practice yeah why because they will feel healthy i telling you i girlfriend feel healthy yeah i you i that has been that is what i been promoting in my channel is if you don and if you turn to a vegetarian with increased fiber 25 grams per day i will not have a job i you can but uh coming back to that research is the same thing whatever you are saying that is what research says as well in america we see a lot of colon cancer pancreatic cancer if you track down their intake when you compare to vegetarian and non-vegetarian the risk of cancer is actually low in vegetarian patients it pretty proven here in american population i do i i do colonoscopies every day to look for colon cancer i have not seen a single colon cancer as a preventive exam in an indian vegetarian patient so far okay right it is mind-blowing it is mind-blowing and as you said there is a netflix documentary they say that folks overnights document repaired in that they show all these huge bodybuilders wrestlers who are a vegan-based diet and they are showing that even with vegetarian diet you can build muscles and to all my audience if you are becoming if you you can become like harish uthman as well thank you definitely definitely anybody can you know fit healthy uh with just the vegetarian stuff there is so much you know there is so much uh doctor so you know people don be [Music] they develop diabetes cholesterol either either you know i pondering you know this is what i been i so other are the foreign so at least they have a at least they have an um like an active work during the day but think about all the software engineers and who are not only software engineers all this office-based people so they always have dinner as the heaviest meal regardless break versus delight lunch is light yeah that is really a bad doctor and another thing which i have to say when it comes to you know fitness sleep sleep that you know according to me from 11 to 4 or 5 o if i haven workout i don i might just just do some stretching and i for the day because i think we should switch places you i sleep is more powerful than workout completely completely see those two work very closely with each other workout bunny there is no use workout workout there is no use and for me somewhere uh i kind of you know gotten used to this deep on there around 10 13 early i sleepy and by 11 i and wake up by 6 6 6 30 you know this indoor situation maybe a lot of people must be uh you know going through on the how what i do is i keep my phone away by around 10 30 phone gadgets but eventually it slowly slowly started reducing so from two it became fun and now i by 10 o and 10 30 i can doze off and i can wake up happily and banger light the next day morning 6 30. so in the problem i a lot of people must be facing for them i would say first thing is throw your gadgets away i keep it away and even if you be in the bed just keep counting numbers or sing a song or do do whatever but don i don yeah i don you know that is something which will keep us awake so no this is something which i so i thought i should say this absolutely i mean you have you have a victim right in front of you uh same thing happened so so look at this this is my phone i so so there blue light that is emitting so this is my uh my kits as well so at 7 00 p.m what happens is it turns into red filter it on the zoom but what happens is there is a blue filter blue light filter on iphone or any other phone so i turn that on after 7 pm when the sun sets so the blue light from any gadgets tv light on the shooting for a phone artificial lights a camera laptop phone especially phone because it is so close to us the blue light reaches the eye goes back to the retina and gives an artificial environment to the brain that this guy is active okay okay okay so it suppresses the melatonin which is a hormone necessary for sleep okay right it redoing some research since then i always keep my phone in the other room and i have a pager from for the hospital if somebody wants to reach me and i have an alarm clock super super that doctor you know to be to be uh truthful uh till 10 i might be you know on the phone which i should reduce it and i should keep the phone in another room i this time here i uh you know maybe i should i always always tell my patient is that you know you just figure out what works for you right so for example if you example you you have so many contacts so many messages so whatever works for you you could just modify accordingly so take uh small small changes will give you big outcomes eventually yeah anything emergency abdina abdena there are a lot of ways to contact us right but we don know next to next to us and another thing what i do is i don internet on all the time so even during the day when i the phone i i when i finish my work switch off the internet and then leave it wow nice that is another thing i do so these are small small things but i have to leave i well so as soon as i go to bed i actually i switch off the bluetooth i switch off the wi-fi i switch off the uh 4g same thing same thing i do because you know this sound i think this is you know if we follow this if we do this for a longer time this will really help us in a lot of ways super super super absolutely i think two most important points i want to convey to the audience and also thank you for emphasizing that is don involved too much with a particular diet so just go sensible diet what exactly what we talked about and i promoting don incremental fasting as you need to fast for just eight hours i for eight hours it could be more than that the minimum recommend that we after 7 7 30 p.m that if you do these two in addition if you do like 10 push-ups every day for the next 10 months you will be like hari shutaman thank you so uh so maybe doctor i i should say about intimate fasting that is the for me that is the go-to uh thing doctor whenever i want to you know you know get into one one proper routine intermittent yeah intermittent really helps me and it intermittent uh or the main thing inanna it makes you feel light doctor and that too when i not

Intermittent fasting mistakes preventing weight loss | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIaYofsp4h8	Dr Pal	hello guys this is uh Dr parliament manikam in this video we talk about why you are not seeing results on intermittent fasting and what are the most common mistakes that people do let the first mistake is going very aggressive before starting intermittent fasting you need to find out what is your regular eating period I patients adopting eight hour eating period and a 16 hour fasting period right away but when their initial eating period was like 16 hours it the opposite never start aggressive like this start slowly because what will happen is your body will having some internal changes and sometimes the changes can manifest as fatigue lack of sleep increased water intake increase amount of urination and all of these will take some time to adapt remember you need to enjoy the process if you put yourself too much aggressive initially you might quit the process early you need to have a mindset that this is a long term process and this is not a short-term win this is not a Sprint this is a marathon so take it very slowly I still remember when I wanted to become fit I went to gym and I wanted to lift a 50 kilogram Rod as a bench press right away okay I couldn trainer was looking at me from all angles and then just gave the rod without any weight I was thinking whether I came to gym class or silambam class problem number two is eating too many calories people think that fasting is a golden ticket that they can eat whatever they want during the eating window and then the results will come right away that is absolutely not true yes you are making the advantage of the Circadian rhythm giving your insulin rest overnight but if you have too much calories it will still take some time more than what you think so the outcome might be delayed to expedit the outcome you will have to focus on your calories a little bit not as much as in other dieting method the key thing is to make this as enjoyable as possible so look at your eating habits eating items and then see which one can be cut down easily I pretty sure the evening snack murukku can be cut down even if you can instead of eating two murk you could go with one my friend Sarah Kumar was like that this intermittent fasting method will not work because look at me I losing weight while he is eating a heated gulab jamun on a frozen ice cream with chocolate pudding third the biggest mistake is not drinking enough water when you are following intermittent fasting the first thing that your body targets is glycogen glycogen is the stored form of carbohydrates glycogen binds water since glycogen is used for energy during fasting there is nothing to bind water so you lot more than usual there has to be supplemented with adequate hydration at least two to three liters of water per day until the color of your urine becomes white or pale yellow the next World War is going to be about water so better use it right at this time before the world goes Mad Max and number four eating snakes more frequently I mean snacks in this method of intermittent fasting it is better to just eat three meals during your eating window for example when you wake up at 8 AM and you break your fast at 8 am your lunch should be around like 1 pm and then your dinner should be around like 7 PM or 8 PM nothing in between no snakes no snacks nothing each and every time you have snacks you are going to stimulate your insulin again the concept of the fasting method is to give insulin rest as much as possible the biggest struggle in making this mistake is during a marriage you have breakfast lunch and dinner and in between breakfast and lunch there will be another breakfast between lunch and dinner there they will make sure that you will not have even a single space in your stomach empty number five is not having enough protein I repeatedly have said in the channel that you need to have one gram per kilogram per body weight so if you should have 70 grams of protein start looking into the food ingredient and find out how much protein each and every item has for example one egg has 7 grams of protein 100 grams of paneer has 14 grams of protein 100 grams of chicken has 25 grams of protein and 1 cup of milk contains 10 grams of protein you may have a doubt whether you can take away protein I would say that there are other ways to get protein otherwise the whey protein is way expensive please check out my video about protein in the description and number six the biggest mistake is not paying attention to your cortisol levels we have talked again in this Channel about cortisol this is your stress hormone whenever cortisol is secreted in your body it stimulates glucose levels thinking that you need some kind of energy to fly away from or fight away from the stressor but unfortunately there is no stressor and the glucose has to be metabolized by insulin again you are putting a stress on the insulin there are only two non-medication ways to decrease cortis or one is seven hours of quality sleep a number 2 is doing meditation on a regular basis thankfully Buddha was not born in this generation because there is no tree to meditate Under And even if he meditates inside a cave there will be v-loggers shooting him and creating an insta reel the best place to meditate it there is an argument with your spouse you could say I am meditating and then you go inside your room please check the detailed video of how to meditate in the description as well when you start this intermittent fasting process there are so many internal changes that is happening that you will not be able to realize please do not check your weight daily Let It Go trust the process check the weight after two to three months everything will fall in place your blood pressure will come down your glucose levels will come down your cholesterol levels will come down you better your energy will be more at one point of time you will make sure that this is your fixer eating window that you are very very comfortable with that is the best case scenario please let me know in the comment section then what is the most common mistake that you are doing I [Music]	Success
How to choose the best FASTING timing for YOUR weight loss? | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrIyXMddx9g	Dr Pal	hello guys this is uh Dr parliament manikam in this video we are going to find out what is the optimal duration of fast is it a 16 hours fasting 24 hours fasting 36 hour fasting five days of fasting or fasting for your entire life to a point that you lose interest in living okay let [Music] so God has made it very simple we need energy for our daily activities and energy is obtained from three macronutrients carbs proteins and fats and our body loves carbs because it is very easy to digest carbs to get energy from so if you have carbs your body will have energy and you will maintain whatever you state you are in right now but if you want fat loss or weight loss you need to go A Step Beyond you need to deplete your cups force your body to utilize fats as a source of energy and your body will not like it because it will have to work harder to break down the existing fats and that body will be pushing you to choose the path of least resistance by craving you to get more carbs my friends around Kumar was like eating Italy and telling me that I come he was like I burn carbs even before the Italy came out by burning the Italy the only way that he can burn fat is to make him sit on a stove so now we know that we need to decrease the carbs to make sure that our body burns fat we can do this in two ways one we can completely deplete our carbs to zero like what we do in keto diet and that why it is not sustainable and people put on weight right after stopping keto diet sometimes it might work for few people but majority it is not sustainable which will bring to the second option called intermittent fasting so during intermittent fasting we are not only decreasing the carbs we are decreasing protein fat in general overall calories which will in turn make our body burn fat slowly but definitely it is like the lecture hall in Medical College we fill the attendance from the last row to the first row and if you come late to the class you have forced to sit in the first row that trying to do with intermittent fasting forcing our body to burn fat instead of Cups so research shows that we need at least 12 hours of intermittent fasting to burn the carbs that we ate during the day for example if your last bite is at 8 pm at night you need to fast at least for 12 hours and then your first bite is at 8 am in the morning and the 12 hours of overnight fast will help you burn the carbs that you ate in General on a modest way to maintain your weight however if you want to lose fat if you want to lose weight even more then you need to decrease your eating window extend your fasting period from 12 hours to 14 hours or even sometimes 16 hours slowly so when you hours for the first 12 hours your body will utilize all the carbs the remaining four hours it needs energy and the only way that energy is provided is by burning fat which will in turn result in weight loss so in those critical four hours it is absolutely important to remain silent to remain empty with calories and be patient it similar to when you have an argument with your spouse be silent things will get get better but sometimes if your body allows you can even fast for 20 hours a day with just one meal a day extending up to four hours this is what we call one meal a day concept o-m-a-b my friend Sarah Kumar also follows omad but the diet is one kilo mutton a day this sounds very aggressive but if you it is actually much much easier than what it appears to be I have had patience fast actually for 36 hours if they are used to fasting 36 hours is not that big of a deal for their body for example your last bite on Monday evening at 7 pm and then just water overnight and then the whole Tuesday is just water and Wednesday morning 7 A.M you break the fast you feel 36 hour fasting the advantage of this fasting is it will give you 16 hours of free fasting when you are sleeping overnight Monday night on Tuesday night I don Kentucky Fried Chicken or McDonald Araya above and in your dreams even it was news to me when I started learning about this method because I was like it is crazy how can a body live without food but actually we are overestimating the calories that what we need our body doesn doesn overloading with calories overloading our mitochondria causing the cell to die which is not needed and I agree that this is not going to be a simple thing when you start it is going to be difficult because you are forcing your body to do something that it is not supposed to but if you put your mind to it for one or two days things will get better slowly and I guarantee you that within a week or two you comfortable with this fasting on the contrary that people think that this will make them lethargic it will actually make them more energetic multiple Studies have shown that fasting actually increases the metabolic rate which will in turn help your digestion process which will in turn help your energy process overall this is a wonderful way to live life so where do you start which technique to choose it is no one size fits all you need to pick a time that is suitable for you based on your social environment and what stage of life you are in to simplify this I going to give you three examples so bottom line everybody over 12 years of age should follow this 12 hours of intermittent fasting overnight no matter what that is a given and there is no negotiation in that factor okay so the first group is if you 35 years of age in this group most of them are either single or they are just got married so they have lot of time this is the exact time period to experiment with fasting you start with 12 hours you can easily extend up to 14 hours you can easily go up to 16 hours if I were you if I need to start this all over again I would have started the fasting period when I was single when I had a lot of time so that I can be more efficient and my body will get tuned to it so that the initial first few weeks of fasting might not have a significant impact on my life so once I get to the 16 hours of fasting I will maintain to this as much as possible and after couple of months you will absolutely love it to a point that you might even extend to 20 hours a day or even 36 hours so that you can actually enjoy the complete benefit of fasting including autophagy which means digesting your damaged cells so that your new cells are formed with 100 quality so that you will never develop cancer in your life and if you are single and if you are looking for Alliance make sure that intermittent fasting is a criteria along with Raghu and ketu in the jathagam so second group is between 35 to 50 years of age in this group most of them are married with little young kids either between 0 to 10 years of age which means that they are very busy their hands are full fasting is the last thing that they will worry about because their hands are already filled with diapers so as I mentioned before this method has to be sustainable if you put yourself very aggressive to start with it follow so I would recommend to start with the 12 hour fasting talk to your family members talk to your spouse make sure that they are on the same page as well you start with 12 hours continue that for like a month and then slowly increase that to 12 and a half 13 13 and a half and 14 you will definitely be proactive in doing this because you will start to notice changes so let me tell you a beautiful 10 hour eating window all right so in the morning we are very busy we need to prepare food for the family we need to wake up the kids get them ready get them dropped to school and we need to run to work make sure the meetings are on time so in the morning we are like so busy that it is easy to skip breakfast so I will break the fast around 10 a.m in the morning and just drink warm water black coffee with no sugar sometimes lemon water is okay as well apple cider vinegar is okay as well so after 10 am breaking the fast you know the time will go fast to lunch around like 1 pm or 2 p.m I will have a good high fiber high protein lunch and then once you come back again kids are back from school you are very busy in the evening you will have a family dinner sometime around like 8 PM which is totally doable so your eating window between 10 AM and 8 PM which will be a 10 hour 18 window 14 hours of fasting this will be an excellent start to your intermittent fasting journey I strongly believe that instead of running after money to save it for future Generations save time for fasting so you can live longer and enjoy the time throughout the process with the younger generation there is a fine line between comfort and greed and you and your spouse will sit together and determine that line for your family and determine the fasting period based on that line third of category is between 50 to 60 years of age in this group most of the your kids are grown up they it intermittent fasting you can easily adopt 12 hours of fasting because you have time and you can slowly extend I would recommend to stick to 14 hours of fasting for at least two to three months to notice the internal changes and then slowly increase to 16 hours a day of fasting if you can maintain the eight hour eating window for the rest of your life I can guarantee you the later part of life would be fruitful would be more productive would be without any medication so the quality of life will be much much better at this age you should not only follow intermittent fasting you should tell stories to your grandkids to ask them follow intermittent fasting as well so let say you fasting you have to go to the next level it is absolutely okay there is no contraindications at all in most cases so 36 hours of fasting has been been done before some people have fasted up to six months can imagine six months without any food no problem at all that is why I overestimating the calories that what we need to survive you need to make sure that fasting is aligned with your lifestyle you cannot force fit fasting into your lifestyle because this is not a Sprint it is a marathon my friend saravana Kumar is asking if I follow intermittent fasting like what you said for one month will I get any discount I said your body will give 10 percent discount 10 fat free and also buy one get one free offer buy intermittent fasting and get happiness I guarantee you this will change your lifestyle please let me know which period of fasting is convenient and sustainable for your lifestyle please mention that in the comment section if you think you got anything out of this video please consider donating to our trust aishwaryam trust in India in madurai where we take care of hospice patients free of charge 24 7 Medical Care to them and also we we have a trust here called One malarical Foundation in U.S where this is completely tax deductible so all the information

Why lemon water can be a tool in fasting ? | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A84uGaF_s8E	Dr Pal	hello guys this is Dr palan manik in this video we can use lemon water to your benefit during fasting let [Music] it in this channel we have been promoting sunrise to sunset fasting method for a long time and I know that many people have gotten benefit out of this if you think these videos are helping please consider donating to our nonprofit organization called aaram trust this is an hospice patient Care nursing home that is being run completely free of cost for close to 50 patients until they die please look up the link that is mentioned Below in the description the biggest problem in adopting the sunrise to sunset method of eating is consistency people get really motivated they do it for 3 weeks and then they lose motivation and they don do it at all first week you have self-control and you lock yourself inside the room second week you go near the kitchen but you come back third week the kitchen itself is on your plate sometimes people are IST and they go until 2 to 3 months but they don any external changes they lose motivation and they go back to their previous routine this is a very very common thing that we see remember external changes happen after a while there are lots of internal changes happening because it is a factory reset of your body resetting your circadian rhythm so it you to actually see external results if we go and keep checking out in the mirror whether our curves are straighten only our smile smiling curves will be straighten during this process of getting this as a habit lemon water is your friend it can help you extend the fasting period at least for more than 1 to 2 hours towards the last bit that you water is like the lenient exam staff who gives you extra few minutes to complete your paper ideally you should just drink water but lemon water almost have no calories as long as you don sugar if you squeeze like a mediumsized lemon of about 25 G into some cups of water and you keep sipping it that is going to help you extend the fasting window and the pain might not be that much since this does not have any significant macros like carbs proteins or fat your hormones will not be disturbed that much when life throws lemon at you don lemon Aid so when you do this fasting for a while you tend to make more acids in your body what we call as ketosis I not talking about the extreme fasting even on a day-to-day fasting you tend to form some kind of acids in the body which might cause you some tiredness fatigue grows and you might be finding it difficult to adopt this method for the first 6 weeks but once you drink lemon water after an hour or two the acidic pH can slightly turn into a normal pH towards the alkaline side so these side effects might not be that much including headache and drowsiness my friend sarak Kumar mixes lemon and vka to nullify the effect he getting this basic thing acid big thing in addition lemon water has been shown to contain this phytonutrients called naren which is shown to decrease insulin resistance promote glucose update but all these are in animal studies not significant in human studies but I strongly believe that we could use this advantage to our benefit while we are adopting this fasting method my neighbor to decrease blood glucose level she puts on the Lululemon pan goes for a walk and comes back with kaju cly sweet for this lemon water is much better when you drink lemon water it is absolutely essential not to add any kind of sugar any product with vitamin C which is mixed with sugar our body absorbs only the sugar 90% of the time only 10% is Vitamin C in addition when you add sugars it contains carbs it will stimulate insulin it will reset your circadian rhythm problem again so when you use lemon water it is absolutely important that you don in it I still remember drinking Tang the orange powder that you mix and then drink it as an orange juice it so much sugar and I got absorbed was fructose and glucose and not vitamin C I wish I would have known at that time I could have saved some money of saving this tank boxes when taken with sugar vitamin C in lemon is getting crushed similar to The Lemon getting crushed under the car wheels lemon water is a wonderful resource for patients with kidney stones the citrate in lemon combines with the oxalate and prevents calcium oxalate stones for patients with kidney ston Stones the most common stones that is formed in kidneys are oxalate Stones if Avengers have used lemon against Thanos they could have prevented him from using his infinity stone please please don boxed to lemon juices try fresh lemons or lime that is absolutely important box juices may contain pasteurized vitamin C which might not have actual vitamin C so get fresh lemon or lime squeezed in a cup of water in boxed juice the vitamin C in the lemon is PE out our body needs close to 65 to 75 G of vitamin C per day one small lemon squeezed into a cup of water can give you actually onethird of the requirement if you do two or three times a day you will meet the requirement just with this lemon water per se so include lemon water in your fasting extend the fasting Period start with 12 hours maximize to 8 hours as much as possible remember one belly at a time it is absolutely important I you in the next video bye-bye	Success
The ÂunderratedÂ reason of heart attacks | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlSNNECCoGY	Dr Pal	hello guys this is uh Dr Paulson recently had a heart attack and she had a stent placed I her Celebrity Status to convey a very important message that I want to tell you guys for a long time let into it [Music] so I really don history behind all these celebrities but there is one common theme that there is increased heart attacks in young people and also in people even when they are fit let is a heart attack heart does not get blood supply heart is being surrounded by blood vessels and when the blood to the heart is being compromised or being stopped so then heart doesn which leads to heart attack and these blood vessels to the heart are like pipelines and the pipelines are getting blocked by cholesterol plaques so if we can find out what is causing this cholesterol plaques then it is very easy to prevent heart attack right so to understand this you need to understand two important hormones in this channel we have been talking about insulin like anything so when our insulin is not working our blood pressure gets high our blood glucose level gets high our cholesterol levels goes up and all these together we call this as a dangerous Triad called metabolic syndrome when this Triad happens they cholesterol deposits in the blood vessels so the heart increases blocking the circulation so how do we know that you working we talked about this before if you have belly fat if your weight circumference is more than 80 centimeters in females and more than 90 centimeters in male there is some kind of compromised quality of your insulin and if we can improve that by decreasing your blood pressure decreasing your glucose level decreasing your cholesterol levels then we can decrease the risk of heart attack everybody knows this the biggest question my patients are asking is why do people get heart attack when they are fit so we been focused on overweight belly fat causing metabolic syndrome with diabetes high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels and we have been focusing on insulin which is absolutely important but there is a mother of all hormones called cortisol cortisol controls all the hormonal actions when cortisol is high none of the hormones will work cortisol is a stress hormone when your body is in stress your body secretes cortisol and increases the glucose levels increases the cholesterol levels increases the blood pressure levels thinking that you parameters for your safety it can can cause the exact same dangerous Triad called metabolic syndrome diabetes hypertension and hypercholesterolemia even when you are fit even when you don have obesity so regardless whether you the cortisol level is absolutely important on the top of it we Indians have a bigger problem we are born with the manufacturing defect we have a smaller coroneries the blood supply the blood vessels supplying the heart are much smaller compared to the Western population based on multiple studies done recently this is mainly because of a smaller body surface area and has been proven repeatedly so when you have a smaller blood vessel then the likelihood of blockage is even higher whenever this kind of news happens all the news channel will be like oh sushmita sen was very fit all these celebrities have six packs even they have heart attack there is no point for us to go to gym to go to control our diet we are going to have heart attack anyways so you only live once your low concept please follow the yellow to all the people out there having a family if you follow Yolo your spouse will be so low not controlling our diet not going to gym is a stupid argument we are already at a disadvantage the blood vessels are playing our heart are much smaller which means that we need to make sure all the factors that is under our control is under control we call this is modifiable risk factors like controlling our diet going to the gym and making sure that our cortisol levels are decreased all this can be easily done I am emphasizing The Point again that diet is more important than gym 80 percent is Diet 20 is workout remember that another school of argument is that covert vaccine is the problem because of the vaccine there is heart damage and that is where all these heart attacks are happening whether you support covert vaccine or not it is very clear that just because of covert vaccine we are actually having a normal life no it has prevented deaths it has prevented serious infection that is proven and one more thing that has been proven is that cover infection can cause inflammation of the heart leading to myocarditis because many people are exposed many people got infected with covert that could be an underlying mild inflammation of the heart and the magnitude of the problem is not known yet if you consider this as a limiting factor then it is even more important that we control the modifiable risk factors within our control so that we can have our body strong to sustain any kind of attack so what should we do we should make sure that we have good quality insulin levels and low cortisol levels in our body regardless so number one if you have belly fat if you are overweight if you are obese you should not eat anything late at night preferably after 7 PM or even after 8 PM insulin level has to be controlled insulin quality has to be preserved I repeatedly emphasizing this point that if you eat late at night your insulin will hate you and it will form those dangerous Triad with blood what the blood vessels sooner number two let problem it is absolutely important that you decrease your cortisol levels we cannot live without stress in this modern environment stress is everywhere we cannot live without stress but we need to develop the energy to cope up with the stress the cheapest and the best way to develop that energy is having good quality of seven hours of sleep this is the most cost effective way to decrease the cortisol levels and the other non-medication way to decrease cortisol level is meditation in our culture we value emotions at the highest level we don we take care of our family like anything we take care of our spouse we take care of our kids but we don so since that is the case I am submitting a request to you if you were loved one or if you is having diabetes blood pressure or high cholesterol levels which means that they have insulin resistance which means insulin is not working so please have them not to eat anything after 7 pm and then the next bite would be 7 A.M in the morning so 12 hours of fasting minimum and number two if they are fit they don they need to make sure that they have seven hours of quality sleep and at least do 12 minutes of meditation every day if you can make your loved ones fast for 12 hours meditate for 12 minutes I can guarantee you that day and heart will tell you I love you if you eat at 7 pm go to bed at 10 pm and wake up in the morning at 6am I can guarantee you that every one of us could lead a even healthier life with a longer life duration remember one belly at a time it is absolutely important I next video

What really happens when you don't eat (Fasting)? | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwHxAnZpwCw	Dr Pal	hello guys this is uh Dr parliament manikam in this video we what happens inside your body when you [Music] if you have been following my channel and if you think that you something out of the Channel please consider donating to our non-profit organization called aishwaryam trust we take care of hospice patients neurological patients where they cannot even walk and talk we give complete free 24 7 Medical Care please look at the link in the description I you point is we should understand that our body is not used for frequent eating they our ancestors actually start for a long time and then had a feast and then start the game so starvation and feast was repeatedly happening throughout their life and they never had a situation where they had frequent eating fortunately they did not have swiggy or zomato delivering Foods in bulakat and that this channel to maintain an intermittent fasting of at least 12 hours a day maybe from 8 AM to 8 PM this is absolutely doable if you look at it you have eight hours of sleep already I for four more hours which is almost equal to a span of time that the financial minister is delivering the budget speech so why should you fast for 12 hours you have to give your hormones the rest that it needs so that can be fresh the next day and also when you go beyond 12 hours that is an increase in the growth hormone which is absolutely important for repair and new protein synthesis this hormone is secreted by our pituitary gland which is a tiny teeny gland right in the brain and it helps to grow all over organs during childhood and maintains its renewal during adulthood as well including skin intestine liver growth hormone is so so critically important in certain medical conditions actually we give artificial growth hormone to actually stimulate growth stimulate cells and sometimes people use it for anti-aging properties as well so fasting is a cheaper alternative version of stimulating growth hormone rather than other expensive version of artificial growth hormone injection it grandmother knows only to use the green and red button on the phone but gets an iPhone as a gift let was 8 pm and you can extend your fast to the next day until 2 pm that will complete the 18 hour fasting window this is where the ataf edgy kicks in let me explain to you what this autophagy means if you have belly fat if you meet the criteria of weight circumference more than 80 centimeters in women and more than 90 centimeters in men it is very clear that you have been on a high carb diet before or your body has more carbs than it actually needs this carbohydrates actually combines with the existing proteins and it starts damaging the proteins your body has the tendency to repair those damage and start generating new cells but only if you let it fast and that concept kicks in and you need to fast for 18 hours to get the process started and if you fast even more the execution is even higher so that the repair hormones get more time to repair the damaged cells if we don time what happens is the carbohydrates combines with the proteins damages it and it gets deposited in the heart causing heart disease in the pancreas causing diabetes in the skin causing aging and the Brain causing dementia if you really notice people who have adopted longer periods of intermittent fasting they actually look much younger as soon as he heard this my friend Sarah Kumar started intermittent fasting because he wanted to look younger but he cannot withstand more than 12 hours and he was like I don going to eat so let was 8 pm and then you were able to extend the fast by just drinking water up to 24 hours up to 8 PM the next day this is where your body completely uses up your stored glucose levels and starts breaking down these stored fat which is what we want to convert that fat into ketones which might be an energy fuel for us ketones are a wonderful source of energy and you don amount of ketones either for example if you need 100 grams of glucose for energy all you need is 10 grams of ketones because it is very very powerful so when our extra fat is broken down the inflammation in the body goes down that decreases the risk of cancer that decreases the risk of heart disease and that decreases the risk of diabetes as well but more importantly after 24 hours the gut gets significant rest which is absolutely important when the gut is rested it can come back with good quality hormones and the proportion of good bacteria and bad bacteria starts to change when there is rest to the gut if we keep torturing the gut with repeated eating what happens is bad bacterial proportion is higher than the good bacteria this is considered as our second brain so when bad bacteria is more it communicates with the first brain and starts to eat more by creating those cravings and that is the bottom line of obesity these days bad bacteria or like sleeper cells they will fade away if you don the body is exposed to fasting more than 24 hours that of decreasing the formation of pre-cancerous cells happen as the inflammation is going down the repair hormones have a lot more time to repair the damaged protein get rid of all the damaged proteins forms new proteins so that you get new cells everywhere in the place where you actually meet multiple basic studies are showing that intermittent fasting Can Be an Effective tool in prevention of cancer even in patients who have been diagnosed with cancer the burden of the cancer cells are known to be decreased with periodic prolonged fasting techniques if you extend the fasting to more than 48 hours then you actually stimulate your stem cells to produce any cells whatever you want whichever place that your body needs stem cells or cells that your body produces periodically to replace the damaged cells and the new cells will be formed based on what the body needs for example we are stressed out and the brain cells are exhausted the stem cells can actually form new cells in the brain because your body needs it when people do 72 hours of fasting and when we actually evaluate these patients we actually see a increase in stem cell production increase in their immune effect to a point that any autoimmune disease the effect can also be decreased because the inflammation goes down on the whole people will be surprised how can a patient can be fasting for 72 hours you the hunger and the appetite significantly goes down after 18 to 24 hours so periodic prolonged fasting is recommended but it has to be done under a very careful setting all I am asking for is to start slowly with a 12 hour fasting and you can maximize slowly to 16 hours based on how your body reacts so it is a lifelong process it is not a Sprint it is a marathon you need to include all the factors surrounding your lifestyle your social environmental situation and then decide what eating window or fasting window will be suitable for you I intermittent fasting is a Holy Grail intermittent fasting is a sustainable technique that many people can use in this rapidly paced environment to get all the advantages remember it takes time it it takes at least 66 days to form a habit so choose an eating window or a fasting window stick with that and then let me know how you do please write down in the comment section what eating window or fasting window that you are very comfortable with remember one belly at a time it is absolutely important I will see in the next video bye thank you foreign	Success
How much water to drink for weight loss? | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrfX5lvD4Lc	Dr Pal	hello guys this is uh Dr pal Nepal manikam we have been talking about intermittent fasting in this channel I cannot emphasize how important water in this method so in this video we to talk about how much water you need how do you know whether you are dehydrated what water actually does to you how water actually gets into your body let [Music] again if you like the content I asking you to subscribe I to consider donation to our non-profit organization called aishwaryam trust in madurai we support hospice patients we provide food shelter and medical care free of course the link is in the description so in our intermittent fasting method water consumption is a key because each and every trillion cell of your body needs water the more important thing is whether the water is getting inside the cells or not the temperature of the water doesn big difference in this case even if you drink cold water or warm water or hot water it doesn water into the cells happens in these two ways regardless so I say this again the temperature of the water doesn matter if you like cold water please drink cold water if you like warm water you drink warm water it doesn that much the temperature can be fahrenheat or fair and cold the water will still transition inside the cells so what happens after water gets inside this cells ourselves is mixed with proteins all our action walking talking our basic metabolic rate everything is different upon the proteins inside these small cells and for the proteins to function properly the water has to combine with the proteins inside the cells properly so if you actually look inside the cell it looks like an electric Factory a lot of positive charges lots of negative charges they binding it together forming stable bonds you need the stable bonds for the cells to perform properly from this cells the hormones are secreted including your insulin if the cell is not working properly your insulin doesn properly then the Biryani that you eating is not able to be digested so you need to get a refund from the Biryani place so it is all linked together the key thing is that the cell has to work properly and for that cell has to work properly the water has to bind to these electrons and protons so that there are forming stable balls every God is even more a bigger director than Quentin tarantine know like Inception cell water inside the water upside the water but the key message I want to convey across is that it is absolutely important that the negative charges are binding with positive charges to form stable bonds when the negative charges are more we call this as free radicals or reactive oxygen species these free radicals are the main reason to damage the cell membrane again coming back to this Inception cycle that if the cell membrane is damaged the cell is damaged which means the hormones are damaged which means you maximal outcome of the hormone what it is supposed to do I have a strong feeling that all the endocrine problems hypothyroidism adrenal problem obesity diabetes everything starts from this Baseline concept of cell being working properly so how does water help water acts as an antioxidant which means when water gets into the cells it covers all these negative charged electrons so that it doesn is called and antioxidant so if your wife is angry you will buy flowers to cool her down similarly you drink water to cool the negatively charged electron so it doesn in my case it is Biryani but that different story so now we know that if you are going to follow the sunrise to sunset method if you want to make sure that all your hormonal quality or 100 percent you absolutely need this water so the next question is how much water you should take right the water doesn have to be just pure water it could be fluids as well let lots of factors that goes into this equation to determine how much water you need like what is your hydration status what do you are doing whether you are exercising whether you are in a hot and human environment but in general if I have to summarize and if I have to give you a small value to Target in the first 10 hours after you wake up you need to drink 240 ML of water or 8 ounces of water every hour up to 10 hours this will come around approximately two and a half liters of water and damn sure many of us will not even reach that minimal content every day most of us think that we should drink water only when we are thirsty this is a biggest mistake thirst is not a good indicator for your hydration status my patient is saying that if God wants me to drink water he will let me know I said he is sending me to let him know that you will see him soon so why this 10 hours this is where science gets very interesting this is where my credibility of my channel gets increased as well because in this channel we have been talking about sleep wake cycle for each and every organ including your heart intestine kidneys in this context we need to focus on the kidneys similar to how we sleep at night and wake up in the morning kidneys also wake up in the morning and work continuously doing their filtration techniques for 10 hours during this filtration process you need to supplement kidneys with a lot of water so that the entire body is filled with hydration so that it is maintained in a good home you stasis this is absolutely fascinating when you actually look into the kidney cells under a microscope the filtrative process goes down significantly after 10 hours for example you wake up at 7am you drink 250 or 240 ML of water every hour until 10 hours you are done with your two and a half liters of water you could actually see the active filtrate to process for the first 10 hours and then beyond the 10 hours after 5 PM the number of cells in the kidneys activity goes down significantly so they say don more than 250 ml of water after 5 PM people who are software engineer listening to this video you might change and become a doctor after completely impressed with the signs you might not get that much money but you can still be happy so the biggest question that I get is when you drink 2.5 liters of water per day you are going to wake up in the middle of the night and then use your urinals more frequently my friends I don drink in water because I don waste that two minutes waking up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom I he is Elon Musk in that two minutes he is going to send a rocket to Mars and then come back but I understand that this can be a problem to avoid this number one you need to make sure that you get your two and a half liters of water in the first 10 hours once you do that then your body is adequately hydrated you don to the bathroom because all the filtration process is done within the first 10 hours number two we know that the activity in the kidney cells goes down after 10 hours after you wake up for example if you wake up at seven am after 5 PM the activity goes down which means that your body will not be able to filtrate that much amount of water which will stay during the middle of the night so you have to urinate in the middle of the night so to avoid this you should not drink more than 150 mL of water or 5 ounces of water after the 10 hours which is usually around 5 PM for most of us and number three this is very important and this is very fascinating as well the urge to go to the bathroom at night is directly proportional to whether you are gulping the water or you are sipping the water if you gulp the water the water goes inside the bladder and it stretches the mechanical receptors of the bladder imagine that a bladder is a balloon and it expands when it expands it touches the nerve Supply and that goes to the brain and even though you are sleeping it will wake you up and then ask you to go to the bathroom use a urinal and come back and you sleep again it cannot get more beautiful than this so you develop this habit after five years of age and that first five years your body is getting trained not to wet your bed and responding to this mechanical receptors and that usually wet the bed all the time my mom was very proud and used to tell my friends that my son used to wet the bed until he was 10 years old I said did somebody ask you well there is no reason to bring that point out so if you want to avoid going to the urinal frequently please sip the water after 5 PM which is your 10 hours after you wake up and in the first 10 hours it doesn whether you Gulp or sip because your filtrate the process in your kidney is pretty active at night be the crow that sips Water by dropping the stones but not the crow that steals wada from the grandma so when I say two and a half liters it doesn could be juices or it could be any other liquid but it cannot be coffee coffee as you guys know it is a diuretic which means that it excretes water from the body now to an extent that you significantly dehydrated but it clearly makes a significant impact multiple research have shown that even two percent of dehydration will not make you focus so because coffee is a diuretic you need to drink water two times more than the amount of coffee that you consume for example if you drank 250 ml of coffee you need to drink 500 mL of water on the top of your normal requirement I complete Black Coffee that people drink here in the United States back in India we used to drink a cup of milk and add coffee powder on the top of it so that milk could be included in that two and a half liters of fluid but not the black coffee I still remember when I first came to United States I entered Starbucks store the guy right in front of me was ordering tall organic gluten-free skimmed oat milk with cappuccino and the Barista was asking me what do you want I said I want exactly the same but now I know that a tall cup has around 250 ml of coffee which means that I should have drank 500 mL of water right away so this equation of approximately two and a half liters of floats in the first 10 hours after you wake up will be determined whether you are exercising whether you are in a hot or a humid environment in India we just experienced the hottest February which means that the intake should be a little bit higher even more than two and a half liters especially when you or when you are in a hot and human envelope so how to test whether you are dehydrated during the day a simple test is a skin pin test when you pinch the skin on the back of the hand if it gets flattened within one to two seconds and goes back to his original position which means that you are well hydrated but if it takes like four to five seconds to go back to its original position then probably you were dehydrated if the skin never returns to normal that pinch force from the max teacher this car is the only Mark I got again remember multiple Studies have shown that even if you are two person dehydrated it will compromise your focus memory and cognition that why my friends around okama gets a big bottle of chilled water and opens this laptop I thought he was working he was watching Netflix movie and he that this cold water will make him focus on the movie this is his version of Netflix and chill so now we know that water intake is very important we need to figure out how we are going to drink the water mainly not in a plastic water bottle let me explain that as well the concern that you should not drink water from a plastic water bottle comes from the fact that these plastic water bottle might contain a chemical called Benzene which can means the bone marrow causes genetic mutation in those cells causing cancers like leukemia which is the blood cancer the concern even though it is there it is not very significant because the level of benzene in this plastic is extremely low there is another chemical called BPA bisphenol a which might be more harmful than Benzene and the concentration might be a little bit higher than Benzene again it is still low not to a point that it causes contamination in the body in most cases when BPA enters the body it binds with the estrogen receptors and it causes hormonal imbalances mainly in women so that are saying BPA free which means that they have removed this ingredient BPA which reduces the risk significantly my only concern with water in plastic bottle is how long the water is inside the plastic bottle and number two whether it is being exposed to high temperatures the longer the water in the plastic bottle the higher the temperature it is exposed to the leakage of the chemicals into to the water is a little bit more the classic scenario is you have plastic water bottles in the trunk of your car it is a hot weather you forgot that for like a month and you are playing Cricket or any other sports and you come back to the trunk you drinking the water from the plastic bottle that is the biggest mistake otherwise if you basis with the duration and exposure is very low and if you a cold temperature the risk is not that much my friends are saying what do you know about plastic done huh you are a gastroenterologist if you are a plastic surgeon I will listen so we have talked about so much in this video let me just summarize what I will do so wherever I go whatever I do I always have this water bottle right next to me and you keep it right next to your working table it has to be right in front of you so that it can be easily accessed it cannot be in the closet it cannot be in the bathroom it cannot be on the ground it has to be right in front of you I was proud of my friends when he has this black water bottle right next to him and he keeps sipping throughout the day but I was literally shocked when he took the water bottle to a liquor store for a refill so number two temperature doesn matter I like drinking cold water in a warmer weather and warm water in a Colder Weather so I will not pay too much attention to the temperature of the water and number three as soon as I wake up let sure that I drink 240 ML of water every hour for 10 hours up to 5 PM it doesn have to be right on the dot it could be an average in general if you can include two and a half liters of water in the first 10 hours regardless whether you are a man or a woman it is the best case scenario next if you I mean black coffee you need to drink water two times more the amount of coffee that you coffee isn sure that I will drink my required amount of 2.5 liters of water in my first 10 hours and then beyond that I make sure that I kidneys by drinking maximum of only 250 mm of water which will help me in two ways my kidneys will also be happy the second thing I don the middle of the night to use the urinals again remember you can gulp the water in the first 10 hours after 10 hours it is better to sip the water during the day I will make sure that I pinch on the back of the hand to make sure that I concept of water had changed completely when I was obese my mom used to say that don cannot eat more now with lots of obesity around drink water before you eat so that you don sunrise to sunset intermittent fasting method along with this significant amount of water intake I can guarantee you that all your hormonal imbalances will return back to normal in a due course of time it overnight it needs consistency it needs perseverance and that listen to these kind of talks repeatedly so that it gets ingrained in your subconscious mind so that it becomes a habit and not based on Willpower again remember number one belly at a time it is absolutely important I the next video [Music]	Success
Top 3 foods to DECREASE sugar spike for weight loss | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlQ1m2ktOnE	Dr Pal	hello guys this is uh Dr Palani parmanikam in this video we talk about how carbohydrates enter our body how is the insulin response associated with the carbohydrate intake how you can maximize this fasting technique to expeditate your weight loss let [Music] if you think you this video please do not subscribe please consider donating to our non-profit organization called aishwaryam trust in madurai we take care of hospice patients patients who cannot walk talk or move and who require 24 7 nursing assistants we provide food shelter and Medical Care completely free of cost please check the link in the description if you you could consider donation to one malakal foundation so that your donation can be tax deductible the website for Vanna Malaga Foundation is in the description as well so I have been promoting intermittent fasting in the channel for a long time and I wonderful responses from patients and people who I and all those responses motivates me to spread this message even more so that we can reset our circadian rhythm in a way that we were born we came into this world with a particular Rhythm we make sure that we maintain that Rhythm so that we will never ever see a doctor again so in addition to following the sunrise to sunset method where we worship our hormone insulin to make sure that we give rest to the insulin overnight so that when there is no food no calories insulin will not have any more work to do an insulin will love you and it will take rest overnight and it that it can do the work for you insulin is a very simple hormone like a government employee who works from 8 AM to 5 PM please don worker it will be very bad for you see the other way to decrease the workload on insulin is to eat during the eating window with foods which is low in carbohydrate so that insulin don to do that much amount of work either to understand this you should know how digestion of carbohydrates happens normally in a body let food rich in carbs like pizza pasta or a gulab jamun the moment you bite inside your mouth there is an enzyme called amylase which is secreted in the salivary glands this enzyme salivary amylase breaks down the carbohydrates into two small molecules called amylose and amylopectin so this digestive process of breaking down the carbs into amylose and amylopectin continues from the overall cavity all the way into the food pipe into the stomach until the stomach acids are secreted and the pH of the stomach goes down to less than three until then salivary amylase is the only enzyme which digests the starch into few smaller molecules so that it gets absorbed into the blood once it gets absorbed into the blood insulin is secreted converts the glucose into energy if you need it if you don it it stores as fat that is the problem when I told my friends it will take one to two hours for just this digestive process he never believed me because he gulab jamun I am hungry again that he is eating the second gulab Jam right away he thinks he is Iron Man but unfortunately there is a Thanos being developed in this pancreas so once in the stomach the activity from salivary amylase is being transferred to pancreatic amylase this is an enzyme secreted by the pancreas us again it digests the carbohydrates into two smaller molecules like amylose and amylopectin which gets absorbed into the blood but this is only 30 percent of the digestion process 70 percent of the digestive process happens in the salivary amylase until it reaches the stomach so in that 70 percent of the digestive process once it is broken down into amylose and amylopectin these small molecules gets absorbed into the blood and this stimulates insulin release and Insulin converts this into fat it is absolutely important to understand this concept you might be walking you might be seeing TV or you may be eating a gulab jamun while you are watching this video I want you to stop for one minute listen to this explanation in detail with full attention so that we can clearly modify our diet so that we can decrease the insulin response so if we can find a way to decrease the release of this amylose and amylopectin the smaller carbohydrate molecules to be broken down down then this will not get absorbed into the blood right away there would be no insulin Spike there will be no storage in fat so I will repeat this again if we can delay the breakdown of the smaller carbohydrate molecules and if you can delay the absorption there be no insulin release which means there will be no deposition of fat I told my friends I don doing something until I explain this concept he is like hey I didn anything to start with so the way these smaller molecules are released determines the response of insulin if it is released fast that is a sharp rice in insulin if a food can do that they call that as high glycemic index if a foot can delay the breakdown of these smaller components And Delay the absorption then the food has low glycemic index obviously we need to prefer foods with low glycemic index I am not going to talk about the foods with low glycemic index in this video I about what you can eat along with your favorite carbohydrate Foods so that it can decrease the glycine make index with the same amount of carbohydrate content the most interesting thing is Studies have shown that when you mix carbohydrates with foods like lemon juice fermented foods and vinegar the glycemic index goes down significantly let me give you an example let small cup of white rice has a glycemic index of 100 a study has shown that if you mix this white rice with vinegar the glycemic index of 100 goes down to 57 with the same content of white rice why does that happen because it influences the salivary amylase so it doesn digest the combined portion of rice and vinegar together so that the breakdown into amylose and amylopectin doesn happen right away since there is a delay in Breakdown there is a delay in absorption into the blood there is a delay in insulin Spike which means that there is no sharp rise in insulin Spike which will help in preventing body fat accumulation this is absolutely mind-blowing because who would have ever thought that mixing some something with carbohydrates will decrease the glycemic index but my friends said that I always believe in this concept of mixing and that is why I mix my vodka with water and lemon all the time so there was a very interesting study comparing these Concepts they took four different groups first group contains bread mixed with water second group Bread mixed with lemon juice third group Bread mixed with vinegar fourth group Bread mixed with fermented foods all the four groups were mixed with salivary amylase remember the 70 percent digestive process where the carbohydrates is converted into smaller molecules that enzyme was added to all these four different groups so they measured the glucose level they measure the insulin levels to see how the glycemic index of these four different categories affected the glucose and insulin response since the first group did not have any other mixer ingredient we call that as naked carbs out of all the four groups the naked carbs group had the highest insulin Spike highest glucose response which in turn means that there will be higher fat accumulation so compared to the group one which is naked Cuts all the other three groups mixed with lime juice mixed with vinegar mixed with fermented foods every group had low glycemic index despite the same bread that they had the low glycemic index which means that the low degradation of the smaller molecules dig less absorption less insulin response less fat deposition it good things so what do we know from the study carbs are very good carbs are very critical in your overall balanced diet it is absolutely important for your health but naked carbs might not be naked carbs are like highly processed food like Pizza Pasta soda juices and boxed juices all these naked cups increase your glucose levels very fast increases her insulin levels have an insulin Spike and digest the carbs so fast that you will be hungry again so you it is a vicious cycle that office get together if you get a box of pizza slices nobody can stop with one because he takes the whole one box with him so hope you number one is avoid naked cups as much as possible okay number two what does the study show the study shows that if you mix with some other acid like lemon juice has citric acid vinegar has acetic acid fermented foods has lactic acid Whenever there is acid when you decrease the pH the glycemic index goes down which might be good for us we can take advantage of this concept so that we can enjoy the carbohydrate content what we like mixed with these acidic Foods so that we can decrease the glycemic index which means that the harmful effect of increasing your glucose levels might not be that much this is not a blank check to eat whatever we want at the same time we can include this concept in our balanced diet so that we can make this lifestyle sustainable so what does this mean to us we know that if we add these three foods lemon juice fermented foods vinegar to an existing cup the glycemic index is low so I you three different options so that you can include that in your diet to decrease your glycemic index when you decrease your glycemic index your insulin will love you your insulin resistance will get better all that stubborn belly fat might get better my friends like finally if I look down I going to see my foot I said based on the amount of carbohydrate that you are taking doesn how much acetic acid how much lemon we add the likelihood of you seeing your foot is very low so tip number one please try to include lemon juice as much as possible the citric acid will decrease the glycemic index in the existing carbs mixing lemon juice in the food or drinking lemon juice along with the carbohydrate can lower the glycemic index remember again I you can drink lemon juice as much as you can you can eat carbohydrates aspects as you can practically speaking our South Indian diet is rich in carbohydrates so when we are trying to decrease the glycemic index these are all small tips and tricks to decrease the workload on insulin so this might be a first step again in moderation you know for the better longevity of the car to make the car run faster and live longer we crush the lemon under the car wheels all I saying is crush the lemon and put it into your stomach we need to make the food content acidic that is the basic thing so this doesn eat like all Pizza Pasta and just keep on drinking lemon juice that is not what I throws a lemon at you don lemonade make lemonade before going into Point number two we need to understand what low carb diet is in general low carb diet varies between 50 grams or carbs per day to 150 grams of carbs per day if you mine if you moderate if you called aggressive and in keto you go less than 20 grams for a typical South Indian diet the normal average carbohydrate consumption is between 200 to 300 grams of carbs per day so when our diet is rich in carbs we need to make use of all these tips and to decrease the glycemic index in addition to choosing High complex carbs rich in fiber which will also do the exact same thing so the second trick is adding vinegar it could be white vinegar it could be apple cider vinegar white vinegar is very common in kitchen we use in pickles and it is a common ingredient in Indian cooking apple cider vinegar has gained a lot of popularity these days I tried apple cider vinegar in multiple formers by drinking it in Water by gulping it by itself and by forgetting what apple cider vinegar is none of the formats have worked for me because the taste can be a little bit pungent it can be a little bit harsh you need to develop a taste to it but if that is something that you can do you could use that to prolong your fasting and also you could take it along with your food so that you can decrease the glycemic index as well when I first came to United States I didn apple cider vinegar was I didn the word properly I was thinking vinegar will be applied on the side of the Apple only when I started adopting this intermittent fasting technique I started to know more about this wonderful ingredient and tip number three is adding fermented foods along with your cups we have talked so much about good gut bacteria in this channel fermented foods promote development of good gut bacteria when you take fermented foods on a daily basis the number of good bacteria gets multiplies into large numbers what an irony bacteria becoming viral the most important tip is including Palace left over rice in your daily meals either during breakfast lunch or dinner at least once a day palaya Soro is left over rice soaked in water overnight so that it becomes fermented overnight so you can actually onions and then have a very tasty meal in the morning that gives you so much good gut bacteria which will decrease the glycemic index of the other carbohydrates that you are eating which will blunt the insulin response as well if you look at it closely homeless in United States are obese because they get Kentucky Fried Chicken in India homeless people are lean because they as their food we treat the nutritious fermented food as Papa the actual purpose where we cannot even lose weight even on paper so to summarize in the Circadian rhythm method we are trying to increase the quality of insulin while you are eating from sunrise to sunset method we are already giving rest to insulin overnight to expedit this process you could also decrease the workload of insulin while you are eating by eating complex carbs and being on low carb diet and when you eat carbs if you can add these three things along with it it will decrease the glycemic index it will decrease the insulin response which will be helpful for you the concept is making the food acidic so decrease the glycemic index the three things are number one lemon juice number two vinegar number three fermented foods please write down in the comment section I what are the different tips and tricks that you have to include these three categories in your daily diet remember one belly at a time it is absolutely important I up [Music]	Success
Top 5 mistakes I did during my fasting journey | Dr Pal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOFt9-AuRBw	Dr Pal	hello guys this is Dr pal manikam in this video we what are the mistakes I did when I started this time restricted feeding so that you don that you can reach your outcome pretty fast let it if you think you got anything out of this video please consider supporting our nonprofit organization called One malal Foundation which supports aaram trust in madur which helps new neurological patients who cannot even move their hands and legs who cannot even eat who needs 24/7 clinical care we are providing the clinical care doctor support nursing support ambulance and nutritional support free of cost in addition we also support V Embrace which is an organization for kids with special abilities kids with autism kids with developmental delays everybody has a wonderful atmosphere over here to grow together your support means a lot to us the first biggest mistake is I started aggressively I started involving in Research In Time restricted feeding I was blown away by the results and I wanted to jump on the wagon right away so I did from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. and then I just drank water after water after water after 6:00 p.m. and my sleep got Disturbed I was not able to focus properly and the next day I was literally very tired for the first week I was like why am I doing this let me be fat then I realized that you don have to start with this 8 hours of eating window and 16 hours of fasting window you could start slowly you could even do 12 hours of eating window with just 12 hours of fasting which I thought it might be a reasonable option the only drawback with that approach is the results are going to be delayed you might lose motivation during the progress but as long as you can force yourself and then reassure that you are doing the right thing you are trying to align to your circadian rhythm then that thought process will keep the motivation going and will keep the outcome much sooner than what you thought so remember fasting is a journey and not a destination you need to choose according to your own lifestyle and any weight loss method I fasting is the Holy Grail all the other methods I as long as it is sustainable and you need to enjoy the process my friend saruk Kumar is saying I cannot resist eating at night ra because the smell from the kitchen tempts me to eat which window will work for me I said only closing the kitchen window and door will work for you number two not selecting the time based on my lifestyle when you start this process it is absolutely important to understand that the eating window fasting window determination is not generalized it has to be individualized it cannot be one size fits all you need to figure out what works for you in your environment in your family and then pick and choose the time that can be sustainable for 3 months 6 months months 9 months and even one year it could be any window as long as you keep in mind that if you eat early dinner the results will be double because you are respecting your circadian rhythm so in my case I started with 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. that didn work then I started from 9:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. that didn I realized that 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. is the first step in the journey because I was able to stick to it I was able to sustain it for a long time and once I was a month in then I was able to decrease my eating window from 8 8:00 p.m. to 7:45 p.m. even that 15minute decrease in your dinner time will make significant changes in your circadian rhythm that you will not be aware of third mistake is relaxing my criteria during Hospital night duties whenever I was on call whenever I got called into the hospital to see a patient maybe at midnight 1:00 a.m. 2: a.m. I took that as an opportunity to reward myself with all kinds of junk food that you ever think of because I was telling myself that okay you are working at 2: a.m. you I go to doctor bread butter biscuit everything together as much as possible then I go back to my fasting window the next day I thought I being disciplined even during a night call on night duty is absolutely critical in getting to the outcome so what I did was you know I used to eat a little bit late dinner on my night call duties and then try not to eat anything overnight if possible but if not I will choose the best quality foods with complex carbs high quality protein high quality fats and lots of water and I try to limit my snacking as much as possible this is a big problem especially in India because many people are working in US timings and they are all night shift workers in India it is very difficult for the night shift workers to choose an eating window between sunrise to sunset because most of the time they don see the sun they get ulcer and they see the doctor more than the Sun so to all the night shift workers be conscious of what you are eating after Sunset if you are eating after Sunset remember that you are bothering your circadian rhythm which means that at least what you can do is to give the best quality food with clean cars high quality protein and not eating junk Foods especially don Biryani in the middle of the night fourth mistake was choosing unhealthy foods during eating window so while I was following this method I started noticing results I got a little bit arrogant I was like okay as long as I can stick into my eating window I can eat whatever I want so I started going back to my eating habits of eating everything I used to eat like two plate of Biryani at the same time I will never leave a buy one get one free offer in a restaurant then I realize that my timing is good but the content of the food is not good so I try to condense it as much as possible again this has to be sustainable whenever I go out of the N I tell to myself that it is okay to do this today but I next day it is a healthy Rel relationship between food and you remember quality is more important than quantity of the foods my friend s Kumar eats chicken for breakfast lunch and dinner to an extent that there is no hen in the community to wake us up in the morning and mistake number five not adding enough fiber in my diet so when I started this it was brand new to me I was trying to fix so many things for example when I woke up I used to have my early morning coffee right away if not my day will not start it was a big thing for me to just postpone that morning coffee at least 30 minutes to an hour after if I just do that I feel very successful and then during the day I try to focus on the quality of the food I tried to learn about protein carbs and fiber and tried to do everything at the same time it was a very slow process I failed multiple times but one thing I was very clear is the lifeline of this eating window I never changed at all once the lifeline is secured adding all the other decorations like increasing the fiber increasing the protein decreasing the CS a little bit trying to limit the eating window will just make you to the next level but you don to do everything at the same time it is a process so in my case I added fiber at the last because I wanted to make sure that I love the process it should be sustainable so once I started doing this as a habit rather than using willpower I started adding more fiber in the food every man should get at least 30 G of fiber per day every woman should get at least 25 G of fiber per day the Fiber goes into your gut creates some good gut bacteria produces short chain fatty acids strengthens the brain gut access controls your foot Cravings controls your sweet Cravings makes you think better in terms of your food choices regarding what we spoke in the previous four mistakes so initially when I started it was very difficult because I started having bloating some diarrhea some GI disturbances so I started slowly with 15 G of fiber for one week 20 G of fiber for the next week then 25 G of fiber fiber the week after because you need time to identify what is the fibers rich foods how you can get it in your environment who is going to make it for you or you you vegetables all this will take time so the key thing for all this process is patience and trying to figure out the workflow that works for you for example Apple has lots of fiber one apple a day keeps do pal away if not I will keep posting videos and come right in front of you emphasizing that you need to eat that apple in summary if I have to do this all over again number one I will not start My fasting very aggressively I will start it very slowly I will understand that this is a lifelong process this is a marathon it is not a 7-Day crash course on weight loss and number two it is okay to relax your eating window as long as you can be consistent and you can be sustainable and I understand that the results will be delayed but I am in the right track and number three when you call duties you need to really focus on the quality of the foots a little bit more than than what you were eating in your eating window in the daytime because nighttime eating is going to disturb your circadian rhythm even more and number four during your eating window you focus on the best quality of foods rather than quantity of foods high quality protein high quality fats complex cars low C content will expediate your journey to the destination and number five adding high fiber diet will also help you significantly by promoting your good gut please write down in the comment section what mistakes you are doing we will try to help you out as a community together remember one belly at a time it is absolutely important see you in the next video bye-bye	Success

other patients to take care of what but she said no I thought I was her only patient mom well you were her favorite but you weren patient that is such a goodl looking color he purple and it looks good Mom it looks good okay thank you it like your shirt you wearing we he can also happen with anesthesia we see it pretty frequently we call it emotional liability and it specifically happens in a lot of children and teenagers I love it I love it it patriotic so it looks like she got her wisdom teeth removed and usually for wisdom teeth you give a little bit of sedation so you might remember it or you might not but you might also be acting this way so I got my wisdom teeth removed this summer and I this was me right now yes I am in the car with you you kidna me I kidnapped I where we going I know oh no oh no girl I pull my cheek out mom Abby that one thing that we see with a lot of teenagers is that the boys actually can sometimes be very angry when they wake up from anesthesia and the girls sometimes are very sad and very emotional nobody really know why the difference between boys and girls but it happens after anesthesia and we see it pretty frequently that are hot spicy and sharp P chips things like that if you want soup let it come down to room temperature yep quite Sou oh no no hot sauce after wisdom teeth no just for just for a couple days just a couple days and everything will be good I promise uh uh-oh oh no oh oh no oh no so people do have a lot of interesting Cravings after anesthesia but also the more important thing is that things can seem very very very serious and if your family just be cognizant that when they way they really are feeling this way and you should support them through this time until the anesthesia wears off W are you a a giraffe I love that well people can also have differences in the way they perceive things so things might look a little bit different and you can easily get confused and again all this wears off within a couple of hours but it sure makes with some viral Tik toks well you feeling all right yeah don anything I remember talking to them she gave IV and I was asleep it I had things in my not I don know I you just woke woke up and you out here huh just a super plying good guy was it easy for you guys yeah yeah good yeah he was worried that we had a hard time such a good patient one thing we sometimes see after anesthesia is people that are crying and you ask them why they crying and they idea and it actually remember could be worse it could have chopped off your penis again I have a penis everybody this why well about an hour ago what did they do to me but now you can stand up and go pee you want to sit and go [Music] pee I don yet oh God no stop don Taylor I have I is inredible all no comment on that so again be patient with your friends that get anesthesia because things feel very serious to them I okay next video oh my gosh Dam I want to have surgery so I can get sh again so it had surgery or had his shoulder relocated from a dislocation either one could have happened but yeah some of the medications that we give for pain uh can cause some of that Euphoria which is what you get dependent or addicted on it after a one-time thing but it something you want to take home and keep doing yeah let me see let me feel you I anywhere a I love you so much well thank you you welcome so obviously they have just met to we just met today I know but we getting married we are we are where are we going to get married we going get married at the chapel at the chapel I see yep M I don chapel too much oh I

made him feel so self-conscious I think he of playing into it though it though wow yeah he that he is really enjoying it so hello oh man so obviously anesthesia can make you feel pretty good but again it not something you want to take home and do it home don to feel the effects of it afterwards I mean come on we give people anesthesia to get them through some of the toughest Parts in their life which is getting surgery it willy-nilly so it side effect but the problem is that some people discovered that side effect and and they desire to take these medications not for anesthesia but for recreational use and that very slippery slope not something I recommend obviously and in the US right now we have a huge problem with addiction and dependence and overdose and I um it happening to to our country so well hopefully you you like And subscribe hit that notification Bell and see you later oh	Success
Why surgery is more intense than you think	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xracE6HSLi0	Doctor Myro	fun fact anesthesia doesn numb you or like help with the pain it just puts you to sleep so your body is still feeling pain so that true under deep anesthesia your brain is off and if we were to put EEG sensors on your brain we would see flat activity meaning no activity like a dead person there your body will react to surgery it might even move during surgery this is why we often have to give you a paralytic medication but even if paralyzed your body will produce epinephrine cortisol and other stress hormones that will cause your blood pressure to go Skyhigh and stress your heart now this is something your anesthesiologist or anesthesist can control through different medications but surgery is stressful on the heart so if you have heart problems you have to let your doctor know and if you might have heart problems you want to investigate those well before surgery you do not want to have a heart attack and surgery that happens	Success

Anesthesiologist Reacts: awake for surgery?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqiyWgNkG2U	Doctor Myro	so you want to stay awake and watch your own surgery you can with an epidural anesthetic you see the epidural space contains nerves and if we inject medicine into that space numbing medicine we stop the nerves from conducting pain and you go numb now that space is only a few millimet thick so we advance very slowly until we find it with a loss of resistance if you go past it you might get a complication so we go very very slow almost there	Success
Why fentanyl is SO dangerous	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p6Ic5OIvVQ	Doctor Myro	this is enough fentanyl to kill you and if you think this is a lot you anesthesiologist I give fentanyl to patients every single day so let me tell you how it actually kills you so first the reason why you want to breathe isn because of oxygen it of carbon dioxide that builds up in your blood so when you run for example you generate a lot of carbon dioxide which then your brain senses in makes you breathe faster you huff and puff but fentanyl changes the threshold with which your brain does that so your brain becomes less responsive to carbon dioxide and all of the opioids do this including your pain medications and if you overdose basically your brain just stops caring about breathing and by the way Narcan can reverse that in 2 to 3 minutes that nose but otherwise your brain just stops breathing and you suffocate [Music]	Success
Doctor Reacts: whatÂs on her eye?!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUiimosrww	Doctor Myro	so when you have surgery your eyes can dry out which can be very painful after the surgery so we will tape your eye closed or put lubricant in it although this amount of lube I anybody put that much	Success

How babies get anesthesia for surgery	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K35gk3zxKuY	Doctor Myro	sometimes the little ones need to have surgery too this is spinal anesthesia injection of medicine into the back blocks the nerves supplying the lower half of the body and allows them to go through surgery painfree [Music]	Success
How doctors prepare you for surgery	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKXzvKFsFsA	Doctor Myro	so there happen after you go under general anesthesia the very first thing we do is we mask assuming we can breathe for you well we through the IV that will paralyze your muscles and the reason we do that is to facilitate the placement of an endot tral tube which he places the lingos scope in the idea is to retract the jaw and visualize the vocal cords sometimes this requires a bit of manual manipulation with the hand like he view he will take the breathing tube and will advance it through the vocal cords there you have it and once the breathing tube is through they will inflate the balloon which is on the end of the tube and that keeps it in place throughout the surgery well done	Success
Why anesthesia = life support	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOOFj-Fyr-k	Doctor Myro	a lot of people don going under general anesthesia is life support to the max seriously every major body function is supported your brain is off there breathe we control the amount of oxygen amount of carbon dioxide is in your system your are heart function we routinely increase or decrease your blood pressure change your heart rate even change the tone of your blood vessels your stomach is decompressed with an orogastric tube we control your electrolytes and blood sugar your anesthesiologist is is responsible for all vital functions okay or maybe sa for hormones although we do give you steroids	Success
Doctor Explains: preparing for surgery	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbW-dFEoWLs	Doctor Myro	this is the last thing you before falling asleep under general anesthesia once you placing a breathing tube to breathe for you this is done with this lingos scope this metal device that goes in into your mouth to retract the jaw until we can visualize the vocal cords and sometimes this process of the intubation is not easy and a lot of force is required to retract your jaw until the breathing tube is placed this can cause a sore throat or even heness in the voice for the next couple of days Dental damage is possible but uncommon he there	Success
Why you should NEVER eat before surgery	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JOX-wpmCXY	Doctor Myro	wow this is the reason why we ask you not to eat before surgery stomach contents under anesthesia can go into your lung and can actually be deadly	Success
Doctor Reacts: heÂs intubating himself?!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2KvXrOS8yg	Doctor Myro	he is intubating himself through the nose while awake educational purposes I suppose I just want to make sure you understand what placing that breathing tube into his nose it fings and oral fairings and then is going to go through his vocal cords and sit in his trachea which is the windpipe they balloon which is going to make an occlusive seal and he breathing completely through the breathing tube wow not for the Fain of heart wow	Success

Why anesthesia made her forget EVERYTHING!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG7Nn7P4P40	Doctor Myro	you know her do you know who that [Music] is it yellow these are twins and they just had anesthesia so why does this happen anesthesia does three things that makes for some viral videos afterwards one it groggy tired sleepy that to most people but two is memory impairment sometimes you can memories even though you awake I wedding planned everything out and the next day had no idea she did any of those things wild and three this inhibition and emotional liability and this one things they would never do in real life they actually just cry their eyes out and they can crying but don resolve and you go back to being normal usually within 24 hours	Success

How does this procedure really work?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7I8ei7eZGM	Doctor Myro	a question do you have to be asleep for this let the sporing object whatever that is and the short answer is no you do not have to be asleep for this in fact all across the world endoscopies and colonoscopies are done awake so what can be done is you can actually gargle and swallow a local anesthetic things like Li cane benic cane will numb up your throat and your mouth and then you take the camera down and you can watch the whole thing as it thing for colonoscopy as well and obviously sticking cameras in the mouth or down there is probably not the most comfortable thing so even though most of the world does it awake in the US most patients select to be sedated for this it most people again want to and that makes sense and the way that works basically is we keep giving you the anesthesia through the IV until you fall into a light gentle sleep you breathing on your own and then we do the procedure then we stop the medication you wake up and then you go home	Success
Anesthesia for a brain dead patient?!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwfWHucEXRQ	Doctor Myro	so sometimes I anesthesia for a brain dead patient now you might ask why would a brain dead patient need anesthesia so typically these patients come to the O for an organ Harvest so again even though the brain is dead the organs are still alive and when the surgery starts the body can still feel the pain so you can say there cord reflexes that due to stimulation of surgery cause a lot of high blood pressure techic cardia even muscle movement all of which can be damaging to these organs now these organs obviously can save a lot of lives so you want to protect the organs and you suppress some of these reflexes so you anesthesia in a classical sense but you	Success
THIS is how you breathe during surgery	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_ZOJoyv4lI	Doctor Myro	immediately after you fall asleep under general anesthesia we put in a breathing tube this is called the intubation as you see that metal thing is a lingos scope it retracts the jaw and helps him visualize the vocal cords the breathing tube is then Advanced through the vocal cords and will sit in the trachea it will be there for the duration of the procedure and will serve the purpose of delivering oxygen removing copper and dioxide and also delivering the anesthetic gases now we will make sure the breathing tube is in the right place by looking for presence of carbon dioxide carbon dioxide will only be present if the breathing tube is in the air wve versus the esophagus we will also listen to both lungs to make sure they breathing tube can sit towards one lung versus the other we want it in the middle in the traum	Success
How to stay awake during surgery	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw9GMCirj-4	Doctor Myro	so you want to stay awake and watch your own surgery you can with an epidural anesthetic you see the epidural space contains nerves and if we inject medicine into that space numbing medicine we stop the nerves from conducting pain and you go numb now that space is only a few millimet thick so we advance very slowly until we find it with a loss of resistance if you go past it you might get a complication so we go very very slow almost there	Success
Why are you paralyzed for intubation?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Lw6sdXd7g	Doctor Myro	this is actually a fantastic question why do doctors paralyze you for the intubation and just to remind you intubations when we place a breathing tube to help you breathe it pretty much for all kinds of general anesthesia and just to calm any fears we actually give you the anesthesia first you fall asleep and then we paralyze you so you that would that be good so in order to place the breathing tube we need to have all the muscles over here relaxed now we can do that by just giving you a ton of anesthesia but what happens is anesthesia has side effects and these side effects actually reduce your blood pressure reduce your heart function amongst many other things so in order to avoid these side effects we only give you enough anesthesia for you to fall asleep and then we use the paralytic medications to actually relax all these muscles to facilitate the intubation	Success
How you breathe during surgery	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOmo15W6IA0	Doctor Myro	a breathing tube is usually placed in the mouth but not always and in this case it scope is still placed into the mouth so we can see where we tube is then Advanced into the nose until we see it on the screen go through the vocal cords a little bit of struggle here some rotation that can cause a sore throat afterwards and the breathing tube will sit there for the duration of the surgery	Success

Drill Through The Skull WITHOUT Damaging the Brain? ??? - How a Brain Surgeon Does It - Doctor Reacts	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FwcML8mdWg	Doctor Myro	how does a neurosurgeon drill through your skull during brain surgery without damaging your brain the answer is this single-use cranial perforator drill bit and it has a special mechanism inside that will automatically stop before it reaches brain tissue if someone says drill bit to you this is probably one of the first things you think of something that you might find in your garage this couldn because the surgeon could end up drilling too far breaking through your skull bone and going right into the brain let notice the cranial perforator has two moving pieces an inner and an outer portion the outer portion moves freely while the inner portion is locked behind a spring-loaded mechanism the drill bit only engages with downward pressure on the skull and then is released when that pressure is no longer there did you notice how it moved down it movement so let as soon as the inner portion depresses like that it automatically stops let watch the same mechanism again in real time on my genuine piece of skull bone here watch how that top portion is screening freely because I don enough pressure applied and then as soon as I apply enough pressure the drill bit engages and I can drill so even though this is on a piece of wood the drill bit still stops right as it breaks through and there you have it that is how the surgeon avoids drilling right into your brain during brain surgery foreign thanks for watching if you hated that video make sure you like it if you liked it like And subscribe really helps me as a new Creator thanks and see you soon	Success

My MOST VIRAL TikToks ?? (with @FootDocDana)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K6mBnSSgPE	Doctor Myro	our most viral Tik toks have earned us tens of millions some even hundreds of millions of views and today we to react to each other videos I let go abandoned mansion and a pool he jumps in except it for brain eating amoeba the neurologist came in and told us 4 days you have 4 days with your son from baseball in summer sand to a hospital room and that is what brain eating amoeba can do cold naria foler it thrives in freshwater bodies like ponds lakes and rivers when you dive in it will swim up your nose and infect your brain it is over 99% fatal but 100% preventable honestly every time I go on vacation and I jump into any kind of water I think about this seriously okay so at the end you said it was preventable did did you want to explain to everyone how it preventable yeah don water you literally just said you jump into water every time I go on vacation and I jump into any kind of water I think about this be better than me thank you for your comment I get comments like this surprisingly often and I wanted to take a moment to address them I appreciate the concern this person and so many others have for the well-being of my suture pad it to not be wearing gloves for the safety of my suture pad I will keep the this in mind in the future so that my Sutra pad does not get infection thank you you honestly early on I would troll people much more often than I do now I should go back to that so this is unusual his foot is broken he ambulance and yet he me right through so what that whistle that inhaler he has is called penthrox it and aesthetic carried on the ambulance pain relief in just a few breaths and we actually have no idea how it works so he basically these devices were actually banned in the US this is a video from Australia why was it banned there were people like this that kind of took it a little bit too far and they got into side effects and they had kidney failure oh yeah that example of a partial thickness skin graph surgery we do this to cover skin defects usually the donor site is from the thigh so it it will be meshed which means to M basically make a bunch of small holes in it so it can cover a larger area when it we Staples maybe some sutures and then a compression dressing will be applied looks good of course did this remind you of making spaghetti I I don me of the top of a pie they call it pie crusting cutting a the little slits in it yeah I can see that doctors are crazy watch this before buying a [Applause] helmet oh my friend the next time somebody yeah you might want the last one but otherwise the one that breaks is actually safer seriously bicycle helmets are designed to break because the brake increases the surface area and decreases the deceleration on your brain it same idea with cars old cars used to translate all the impact to the driver versus new cars collapse trying to gradually decelerate the force of the impact I still I still stand by it everything in that video is true so you think the car at the very end was a safest a good example of safe modern cars it might not be the best example of but everything in that video still stands it is true bicycle helmets are almost designed to break uh because they they reduce the forces in your brain but yeah the car maybe could have used a different example watch what happens when you mix blood with hydrogen peroxide blood contains an enzyme that reacts with the hydrogen peroxide making water and oxygen that these bubbles form that know after a long shift in the hospital when you there clothes hydrogen peroxide is how you get them off you covered in blood uh surgeons sometimes not so good surgeons this one favorite not this video oh no this lady does not have a gag reflex just watch they goal here is to prevent the tongue from falling back and obstructing the airway and if that does not work we have another device called the LM a o oh my God you can actually breathe for the patient with this device and this is always done in unconscious you bro this is uh some pretty intense military training military takes their training to a whole new level got to do what you got to do to learn like gu I missed the person I was 20 seconds ago we talk about what these humans let go oh that muscles mhm this person just has hyper flexibility that is a skill amazing wow and that colar bone wow and this person just grew out her fingernails they grow twice as fast as his toenails oh that looks like umbilical hernia yeah I think so just pop it in huh mhm and this person has really flexible skin probably ell Stow syndrome I think so mhm in hindsight we did not make the smartest observations I would say it was a blind react and this video got 100 million views that insane yeah everyone just kept commenting stupid doctors this is why doctors want to sue us for Millions no more need for expensive doctor surgery so fake if you look closely she was stepping on her toe to pretend like she had a bunion in the first place and she even added a crack sound to the video but these bunion correctors don fix your bunion only surgery can do that but you wouldn this person scroll down to their main spokesperson you never approved did this or my image to be used this way don everything you see online guys social media is crazy sometimes people will sell you anything and they will use other people problem is that the platforms are making Comm Mission off of it they trying to take it down anytime soon so these videos just keep circulating yeah we didn and social media there going around with these doctors pointing to like Viagra type pills and these dietes that it yeah I have seen it all blood gore Cho body parts feces everywhere but the eye oh it still gets me don is anesthetized and the patient is [Music] sedated I have so many questions but for one why is the eyeball moving I mean just because the patient is sedated doesn move those are two very different things you can be sedated relaxed you might not even have the memory of this but you might be able to follow commands isn anesthesia amazing it all right also some many people thought that that was soy sauce I can that was not soy sauce it septical Betadine is to sterilize the [Music] eye so uh radiate pregnant women huh oh don dumb it this some people said actually you can radiate pregnant women I saying that it if you look at something from one angle it can look completely different from the other angle so that need multiple X-ray views to identify a fracture or anything or to identify a pregnant woman apparently there is only one condition that makes you deathly afraid of water and once symptoms appear it 100% [Music] fatal this is rabies I wasn this video when I first posted it because because once uh these symptoms appear really there and uh it think it is important to educate people though that you know rabies is really serious so don animals like stray dogs in another country if there like don vaccine while you still can it serious if you don progresses to having symptoms like this channan uh it unfortunately is very fatal at that point Let switch to something a little bit more fun this stuff is pretty toxic and cancer causing so I silicone hand here however we can drink from this cup this liquid is toxic we straw bro what he used his finger minus one no gloves oh my God I can first videos that ever went like pretty viral oh ah interesting okay okay let did you did you cheat no you didn cheat no you were that still yes there is some tricks for example instead of holding your hand out when you suturing and stuff like that you want to keep it tucked in so it your body and then it was doing that I was having it anchored by my side okay skull bone wow he is touching his brain he had his scull bone removed anything that increases the pressure inside of the brain bleeding swelling tumor can cause the brain to die very quickly so to save his life would take the bone off allow the brain to decompress I find it so funny cuz people always ask me how I can do my job since feet are gross and then I look at something like this and I think it it gross this kind of freaks me out though the fact that the brain is just right there yeah I mean I I think the problem here is that uh this gentleman in particular probably didn to Great medical care because usually we don their brain exposed like that we would put the bone back on before we discharge somebody from the hospital um so that really unfortunate this is one of our videos that went surprise [Music] viral it paddling and it kept being just as far away that was some paddle it took us like a while I guess at least an hour yeah it was so cool though once we were there and it beautiful than you can see here and it looks gorgeous here yeah I think the water was like warm too it was just very pleasant yeah except old The Reef is dead no wasn so cute in that video but the comments some of the comments we got on that video I have to say I was like some people were mad at us thinking we were invading private property or something like that obviously we knew it was okay to paddle there they gave us the paddles like all the things people were mad at us about are kind of story people got really mad at that video kind of funny how social media Works in that way yeah vaccine your gluteus muscles are your biggest muscles in your body and certain medications actually get absorbed better through the intramuscular route but here she actually missed the spot so of forc they running well in reality it is it is slightly like a little bit lower you know she got injected into the hip yeah this is a a fake video it skit right can this like that like going to your CVS and like bam one way to get microchipped microchipped [Music] yeah how this the things you learn on Tik Tok [Music] yeah yeah they really do go crazy I feel like that do not so just to explain what was actually happening in this video is sometimes to fix a bone you have to put a rod in it and then when that Rod eventually causes issues you got to take it out now this is not every orthopedic surgery

trending online with somebody playing the violin as they brain surgery now don painful the brain tissue itself doesn have any pain receptors and the interesting part is that even though you might not even remember it happening afterwards because of the medication that we give you nuts yeah kind of crazy did you know that surgical procedures date back to ancient times some of the first evidence of surgery was tration which is drilling a hole in the skull and this was found as early as the Mesolithic period which is 6,000 BC wow skulls with this surgery were found in North Africa Ukraine and Portugal Miro do you think you first brain surgery patient no wonder I smart wait you mean giving the surgery or receiving the surgery you seem like you received it your is Ukrainian I think there holes in my brain though last time I checked the first successful organ transplant was 70 years ago the first successful kidney transplant surgery was performed in 1954 the donor and the recipient were actually identical twins reducing the risk of rejection but here there really weren transplants because we were so afraid of rejection and now we have a lot of great medications to keep those at Bay and also better matching process to align the body to the r Don the fact that organ transplants are relatively new lows my mind cuz we do so many all the time we do dozens in our hospital every day maybe you not so much me you don transpant feet not yet what about toenails not yet speaking of kidneys a random fact when someone receives a kidney they do not swap out the new kidney for the old one in fact they put the new one on they suture it in and then they leave the old one in place so people that have had a kidney transplant actually have three kidneys technically it non-invasive brain surgery which means there brain at all this is often accomplished by going through the blood vessel in your groin all the way up into your brain and doing the surgery through the blood vessel it all the time this is actually exactly how we fix strokes and embolize aneurysms or foil them basically stop them from bursting this is crazy but some people have performed surgery on themselves it in a desperate circumstance people have had to give themselves appendectomies remove their appendix or amputations most famously a Russian physician had to remove his own appendix when he was at an Antarctic mission in 19 1961 because he was the only doctor there razov works for an hour and 45 minutes to remove his appendix that appendectomy right oh yeah sometimes these can be done in under 5 minutes actually the fastest appendectomy has been done in 46 seconds seconds now because appendix infections are so common surgeons that winter in Arctica and they around they actually have to get their appendix removed before they even travel there would you sacrifice your appendix to work in the freezing cold by yourself with no other surgeons around oh you really sell it yeah somebody it but I like the beach during a lot of very routine surgeries you on life support which means the anesthesiologist is actively keeping you alive for the procedure you see when you get anesthesia often you stop breathing your blood pressure drops your heart isn all those things for you we have to breathe for you keep your heart beating keep your blood pressure good not too high not too low and we responsible for all major bodily functions so can I Pat myself in the back now yeah thank you anesthesiologist guys surgeons get all the credit it can be a stressful job especially when the patient about anesthesia is it with moments of sheer Terror for example let they can breathing tube in I mean that right there is life or death anyway very scary very very scary plastic surgery has ancient Roots skin grafting was done as early as 600 BC W however arguably some of the biggest advancements in modern time is due to World War 1 and 2 surprisingly and the reason is before this most facial injuries were caused by small firearms and swords but weapons used in World War I were heavy artillery and gas and they caused severe facial deformities and a lot of soldiers so huge advances were made in reconstructing the faces of injured men during this time so we all know the placebo effect is when a person physical or mental health improve after a placebo or a dummy treatment did you know that research has found that Placebo is even effective for surgical procedures many Studies have found that patients improve after being told they had a surgery that didn happen who would do that this study for example in one study a group of placebo patients were told they had a knee arthroscopy and surprisingly a lot of them improved this is is not routinely done though how much do they charge for that a lot I bet you the bill was still six figures American Healthcare charge for everything charge for everything just nickel and dime everybody oh my goodness see anesthesiologist don surgeons you can no no no surgeons blame them getting anesthesia doesn for certain eye procedures for example like cataract extractions you actually awake but we still give you some anesthesia and and i example of my father who had a cataract remov recently he would not ever touch his eye nobody would ever touch his eye he would not let anybody touch his eye but a little bit of medicine through the IV and he was like me all right do whatever you need and that is because anesthesia is a spectrum with a little bit of anesthesia the anxiety completely goes away and you can be awake following commands but not care about it at all even if you getting surgery also we can block ner nerves going to different parts of the body which means you can get a lot of surgeries like a whole knee replacement completely awake watching the whole thing obviously a lot of people don want to do that but you can and here the last bonus fact in 2015 a very very first penis transplant was successful in South Africa and it restored patients reproductive and urinary abilities well that subscribe the video and let us know in the comments what we should do next time bye see you later	Success
UNHINGED & UNFILTERED Anesthesia Clips ??	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1yE1JiB95c	Doctor Myro	all right guys let anesthesia Tik toks wait can we go back and see Sarah she has to work honey she has other patients to take care of what but she said no I thought I was her only patient mom well you were her favorite but you weren patient that is such a goodl looking color he purple and it looks good Mom it looks good okay thank you it like your shirt you wearing we he can also happen with anesthesia we see it pretty frequently we call it emotional liability and it specifically happens in a lot of children and teenagers I love it I love it it patriotic so it looks like she got her wisdom teeth removed and usually for wisdom teeth you give a little bit of sedation so you might remember it or you might not but you might also be acting this way so I got my wisdom teeth removed this summer and I this was me right now yes I am in the car with you you kidna me I kidnapped I where we going I know oh no oh no girl I pull my cheek out mom Abby that one thing that we see with a lot of teenagers is that the boys actually can sometimes be very angry when they wake up from anesthesia and the girls sometimes are very sad and very emotional nobody really know why the difference between boys and girls but it happens after anesthesia and we see it pretty frequently that are hot spicy and sharp P chips things like that if you want soup let it come down to room temperature yep quite Sou oh no no hot sauce after wisdom teeth no just for just for a couple days just a couple days and everything will be good I promise uh uh-oh oh no oh oh no oh no so people do have a lot of interesting Cravings after anesthesia but also the more important thing is that things can seem very very very serious and if your family just be cognizant that when they way they really are feeling this way and you should support them through this time until the anesthesia wears off W are you a a giraffe I love that well people can also have differences in the way they perceive things so things might look a little bit different and you can easily get confused and again all this wears off within a couple of hours but it sure makes with some viral Tik toks well you feeling all right yeah don anything I remember talking to them she gave IV and I was asleep it I had things in my not I don know I you just woke woke up and you out here huh just a super plying good guy was it easy for you guys yeah yeah good yeah he was worried that we had a hard time such a good patient one thing we sometimes see after

his shoulder relocated from a dislocation either one could have happened but yeah some of the medications that we give for pain uh can cause some of that Euphoria which is what you get dependent or

it not something you want to take home and do it home don to feel the effects of it afterwards I mean come on we give people anesthesia to get them through some of the toughest Parts in their life which is getting surgery it willy-nilly so it side effect but the problem is that some people discovered that side effect and and they desire to take these medications not for anesthesia but for recreational use and that very slippery slope not something I recommend obviously and in the US right now we have a huge problem with addiction and dependence and overdose and I um it happening to to our country so well hopefully you you like And subscribe hit that notification Bell and see you later oh	Success

even banned in some places it imagine but in a lot of human history surgeries were done completely with no anesthesia whatsoever things like medicinal plants or alcohol were used but it leg off with an axe and having the alcohol numb that pain they felt it especially in the US when some surgeons used to say if it doesn surgery what yeah that is crazy and other people thought it was satanic

I got my wisdom teeth removed! ?? -TOP TIPS from a Doctor on surgery and wisdom teeth recovery	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLudaiFvhDU	Doctor Myro	I teeth removed here they are in the bag oh gross so I journey and exactly what you need to know to recover well after wisdom teeth and surgery in general [Music] so first things first do you need to have your wisdom teeth removed and the answer is it depends there is no scientific reason to get them removed if they not projected to cause problems in the future for me they cavities and only getting worse and also I wanted to get my teeth straightened out so they wanted to have my wisdom teeth removed for that okay first the preparation you should know it takes one to two weeks for you to recover after the wisdom teeth surgery now I was back after day three but that realistic and you should not expect it but here way I wrote a book with a couple of my colleagues check the description below it basically has everything that you need to recover after surgery it completely free check the description after this video so number one your journey starts with finding the right person to do your surgery and my advice is don an oral surgeon who specializes in this and I know dentists are going to comment me and be like oh well I can do it too but guess what my channel my opinion and the more you do of something in healthcare the better you get at it so find somebody who specializes in oral surgery and wisdom teeth removal now number two you have to optimize your body before surgery what does that mean even the smallest surgical procedures place an enormous stress in your body comparable to running a marathon you would not run a marathon without a proper preparation and nutrition right so ideally a day or two before even a couple days you want to start eating really clean avoid any processed foods generally meals with complex carbohydrate can do a trick you you essentially want to carb load for your surgery and put your body in their repair mode so Hobie pasta can do the trick include healthy proteins in your meals salmon can do the trick because it has also Omega-3s which are helpful in healing obviously put a little bit of Greens in there too you want the antioxidants and if you sauces use the natural ones that have not a lot of processed chemicals in them all the chemicals in the processed foods really can drastically slow down your healing now I also took heel fast which is a supplement for surgical recovery it heal well after surgery and full disclosure I created the supplement over a decade ago for my own mom to heal after surgery so it minerals amino acids probiotics pretty much everything you need to heal you start that five days before surgery and you continue it for 10 days after surgery and it has all the ingredients to help with bruising swelling and pain all the things that you wisdom teeth now 3 and this is really important you actually want to cut out all the other supplements including your daily multivitamin which is going to have vitamin E which can actually increase bleeding during the surgery also take a look at this list right here these are all the things that you should avoid at least seven days before surgery day of procedure this is me I elected to get IV sedation as you can see I getting ready I and the anesthesia will come through the IV for me there are other options like inhaled anesthesia nitrous or laughing gas or even you can stay awake for the whole thing which honestly I don recommend now if you anesthesia you the night before for at least eight hours nothing to eat you can have clear liquids up until two hours before surgery now what people don is those two hours before surgery you actually can have a coffee if I don have a coffee I have terrible headaches but make sure in this coffee there is absolutely no milk because they will cancel your surgery if there fattening foods or milk this anesthesia thing is wild yeah anesthesia is crazy afterwards I was awake doing things on video and I remember none of it it totally insane I actually had my own patients that had anesthesia that that day went home and planned an entire wedding and the next day had no idea any of it happened wild I mean I wrote text messages I wrote emails I have emails to take that top one and I had no idea later I wrote them totally wild like Bonkers so that day don anything like that do not sign any legal documents do not write any crazy emails do not quit your job you will also need a ride home they won unless you have somebody else driving you you can for 24 hours alright so now you getting home so the first thing to do probably is take some pain meds as the anesthesia then numbness is wearing off you personally immediately after took heel fast post-op it has a lot of anti-paint swelling and bruising agents really for the first couple of days you eating very well so the nutrition and heal fast I think really helped me recover and there data out there in the first seven to ten days a lot of these nutritional elements really speed up healing but what you do need to do is you need to plan ahead because for the first few days you mostly eating soft foods so you still want to have a nice solid diet that going to help you heal so get things like yogurt cottage cheese applesauce even Jello but again try to avoid the processed foods if you can consider investing in or borrowing your friend blender a blender will allow you to pack in nutritious foods and make sure you heal well after surgery without having to chew which you able to chew for the first day or two or three and again if it wasn already now is not the time to go on a diet you actually want to increase your calories that into repair mode and probably the most important thing is hydration hydration hydration honestly lots of water that your friend avoid anything fizzy and a little bit we go any further I want to stress the importance of following your surgeon post-op instructions whatever they say should Trump anything that I say because they know you the best and can give you the best advice but here is this surprise to No One pain after surgery is normal you to be a little bit painful but each Progressive day the pain should be getting better your pain should be controlled aim for something like a three out of ten and obviously you gonna have pain medications to help you with it now here are concerning things to call your surgeon about pain that is getting worse each day pain that can be controlled with the pain medications you are given bad odor in the mouth fever increased bleeding after first few hours after surgery now by the way for the first few hours you might have a lot of oozing and that combined with saliva can really make it seem like it okay hang in there it now here recovery and the most important part of the video after the surgery there will be a blood clot that will form over where the tooth is removed and that blood clot is the most important thing when it comes to your recovery that blood clot covers the tooth and protects the nerves and the bone underneath and that what is going to stop your pain and allow you to heal now if that block clot falls out early or dissolves early that can set you back for weeks that is called a dry socket and everything we going to talk about next is there to prevent that from happening so again follow your surgeon the clot typically this means bite on gauze for the first few hours do not suck on anything no straws these can dislodge the clot and set you back for weeks no sucking on candy and no sucking on a cigarette now tobacco is particularly bad because the nicotine can constrict those small blood vessels that allow you to heal constricting those blood vessels mean no blood going to the site which means no healing cut out all nicotine for at least a couple of days after surgery no spitting either that can dislodge the clot do not rinse your mouth in the first day that can dislodge the clot too now brushing your teeth usually can be good but you really want to stay away from the side of surgery a clean mouth is a mouth that will heal better now sneezing and coughing you should also avoid these if possible if you have allergies definitely let your dentist know before they might prescribe you something to suppress your sneezing and coughing because again back in dislodge that clot and cause a dry socket by the way dry sockets are excruciatingly painful and again can set you back for weeks of healing also do not exercise in the first several days that can increase your blood pressure and can dislodge that clot that was honestly so hard for me because I was like oh I sort of move but no just relax sit back watch some TV close your eyes really rest and recover it and allow your body to heal also when you when you flow can go into your head elevate your head with a couple of pillows it allows better blood drainage from your head no hot foods or beverages those can also irritate the tissue that away from alcohol that can delay healing in the first week ice packs are fantastic for the first day you want to do 15 minutes on 15 minutes off it really going to decrease the swelling most doctors do want you to stay away from the ice packs after 24 hours alright now speaking of day two swelling swelling usually gets worse around day two or three before it starts to get better so just expect that pain is usually the worst day one and with each day it should be getting a little bit better so if the pain is getting worse you really should think about calling your doctor a lot of doctors will recommend salt rinses starting on day two and usually continuing for a week now the most important thing with salt rinses none of this you do not want to use your cheeks because that can dislodge that clot that is so critical to healing and I to repeat myself over and over again but it put the fluid in your mouth and you go like this [Music] you gently Rock back and forth I know looks hilarious but it works so really you want to do this three to four times a day and what salt rinses do is they actually clean your mouth they kill the bacteria and they can reduce the swelling too so you might even feel better after doing them otherwise my biggest and the most important advice follow your post-op instructions from your surgeon I cannot stress this enough your surgeon will know your particular case the best so overall I heal that pretty well it wasn is me about a week after as you see not a lot of swelling obviously I okay to do the video I some soreness some tenderness but it really manageable and my surgeon told me I things that I you can have a great recovery too don worry too much just try to relax as much as possible you gonna be fine and if you have time check the description below I the ebook that I wrote with my colleagues for surgical recover every it and it has all the advice for surgical recovery not just wisdom teeth but for all surgeries consider using heel fast supplement obviously I I created it but I thought it helped me you can check it out on Amazon it a couple of thousand reviews at this point of people that also think it helped them but otherwise good luck I hope this was helpful and if you like this video and you want more please like And subscribe for the algorithm it helps me

EPIC FAILS that Doctors Can't Even Explain	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmrP-_lh62g	Doctor Myro	Oh, she got a bat. Oh, ouch. Ouch. If you get hit on the knee, rice it immediately. If you don it can make the injury worse. And a hit like this could cause a fracture of the patella. It could cause ligament tears in the knees or meniscus tear. These things need surgery. Yeah. When the dummy fights back, that concussion at the least. And it could even be incraanial hemorrhage. Not good. Not good. [Music] Oh. Oh, he [Music] Uh-oh. Oh. Oh, no. I see where this is going. So, this is basically a balsa maneuver. And that happens when you bear down. You increase the pressure in your chest, which decreases the flow of blood into your chest and into your heart and then into the brain. No blood flow in the brain.

My MOST VIRAL TikToks ?? (with @FootDocDana)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K6mBnSSgPE	Doctor Myro	our most viral Tik toks have earned us tens of millions some even hundreds of millions of views and today we to react to each other videos I let go abandoned mansion and a pool he jumps in except it for brain eating amoeba the neurologist came in and told us 4 days you have 4 days with your son from baseball in summer sand to a hospital room and that is what brain eating amoeba can do cold naria foler it thrives in freshwater bodies like ponds lakes and rivers when you dive in it will swim up your nose and infect your brain it is over 99% fatal but 100% preventable honestly every time I go on vacation and I jump into any kind of water I think about this seriously okay so at the end you said it was preventable did did you want to explain to everyone how it preventable yeah don water you literally just said you jump into water every time I go on vacation and I jump into any kind of water I think about this be better than me thank you for your comment I get comments like this surprisingly often and I wanted to take a moment to address them I appreciate the concern this person and so many others have for the well-being of my suture pad it to not be wearing gloves for the safety of my suture pad I will keep the this in mind in the future so that my Sutra pad does not get infection thank you you honestly early on I would troll people much more often than I do now I should go back to that so this is unusual his foot is broken he ambulance and yet he me right through so what that whistle that inhaler he has is called penthrox it and aesthetic carried on the ambulance pain relief in just a few breaths and we actually have no idea how it works so he basically these devices were actually banned in the US this is a video from Australia why was it banned there were people like this that kind of took it a little bit too far and they got into side effects and they had kidney failure oh yeah that example of a partial thickness skin graph surgery we do this to cover skin defects usually the donor site is from the thigh so it it will be meshed which means to M basically make a bunch of small holes in it so it can cover a larger area when it we Staples maybe some sutures and then a compression dressing will be applied looks good of course did this remind you of making spaghetti I I don me of the top of a pie they call it pie crusting cutting a the little slits in it yeah I can see that doctors are crazy watch this before buying a [Applause] helmet oh my friend the next time somebody yeah you might want the last one but otherwise the one that breaks is actually safer seriously bicycle helmets are designed to break because the brake increases the surface area and decreases the deceleration on your brain it same idea with cars old cars used to translate all the impact to the driver versus new cars collapse trying to gradually decelerate the force of the impact I still I still stand by it everything in that video is true so you think the car at the very end was a safest a good example of safe modern cars it might not be the best example of but everything in that video still stands it is true bicycle helmets are almost designed to break uh because they they reduce the forces in your brain but yeah the car maybe could have used a different example watch what happens when you mix blood with hydrogen peroxide blood contains an enzyme that reacts with the hydrogen peroxide making water and oxygen that these bubbles form that know after a long shift in the hospital when you there clothes hydrogen peroxide is how you get them off you covered in blood uh surgeons sometimes not so good surgeons this one favorite not this video oh no this lady does not have a gag reflex just watch they goal here is to prevent the tongue from falling back and obstructing the airway and if that does not work we have another device called the LM a o oh my God you can actually breathe for the patient with this device and this is always done in unconscious you bro this is uh some pretty intense military training military takes their training to a whole new level got to do what you got to do to learn like gu I missed the person I was 20 seconds ago we talk about what these humans let go oh that muscles mhm this person just has hyper flexibility that is a skill amazing wow and that colar bone wow and this person just grew out her fingernails they grow twice as fast as his toenails oh that looks like umbilical hernia yeah I think so just pop it in huh mhm and this person has really flexible skin probably ell Stow syndrome I think so mhm in hindsight we did not make the smartest observations I would say it was a blind react and this video got 100 million views that insane yeah everyone just kept commenting stupid doctors this is why doctors want to sue us for Millions no more need for expensive doctor surgery so fake if you look closely she was stepping on her toe to pretend like she had a bunion in the first place and she even added a crack sound to the video but these bunion correctors don fix your bunion only surgery can do that but you wouldn this person scroll down to their main spokesperson you never approved did this or my image to be used this way don everything you see online guys social media is crazy sometimes people will sell you anything and they will use other people problem is that the platforms are making Comm Mission off of it they trying to take it down anytime soon so these videos just keep circulating yeah we didn and social media there going around with these doctors pointing to like Viagra type pills and these dietes that it yeah I have seen it all blood gore Cho body parts feces everywhere but the eye oh it still gets me don is anesthetized and the patient is [Music] sedated I have so many questions but for one why is the eyeball moving I mean just because the patient is sedated doesn move those are two very different things you can be sedated relaxed you might not even have the memory of this but you might be able to follow commands isn anesthesia amazing it all right also some many people thought that that was soy sauce I can that was not soy sauce it septical Betadine is to sterilize the [Music] eye so uh radiate pregnant women huh oh don dumb it this some people said actually you can radiate pregnant women I saying that it if you look at something from one angle it can look completely different from the other angle so that need multiple X-ray views to identify a fracture or anything or to identify a pregnant woman apparently there is only one condition that makes you deathly afraid of water and once symptoms appear it 100% [Music] fatal this is rabies I wasn this video when I first posted it because because once uh these symptoms appear really there and uh it think it is important to educate people though that you know rabies is really serious so don animals like stray dogs in another country if there like don vaccine while you still can it serious if you don progresses to having symptoms like this channan uh it unfortunately is very fatal at that point Let switch to something a little bit more fun this stuff is pretty toxic and cancer causing so I silicone hand here however we can drink from this cup this liquid is toxic we straw bro what he used his finger minus one no gloves oh my God I can first videos that ever went like pretty viral oh ah interesting okay okay let did you did you cheat no you didn cheat no you were that still yes there is some tricks for example instead of holding your hand out when you suturing and stuff like that you want to keep it tucked in so it your body and then it was doing that I was having it anchored by my side okay skull bone wow he is touching his brain he had his scull bone removed anything that increases the pressure inside of the brain bleeding swelling tumor can cause the brain to die very quickly so to save his life would take the bone off allow the brain to decompress I find it so funny cuz people always ask me how I can do my job since feet are gross and then I look at something like this and I think it it gross this kind of freaks me out though the fact that the brain is just right there yeah I mean I I think the problem here is that uh this gentleman in particular probably didn to Great medical care because usually we don their brain exposed like that we would put the bone back on before we discharge somebody from the hospital um so that really unfortunate this is one of our videos that went surprise [Music] viral it paddling and it kept being just as far away that was some paddle it took us like a while I guess at least an hour yeah it was so cool though once we were there and it beautiful than you can see here and it looks gorgeous here yeah I think the water was like warm too it was just very pleasant yeah except old The Reef is dead no wasn so cute in that video but the comments some of the comments we got on that video I have to say I was like some people were mad at us thinking we were invading private property or something like that obviously we knew it was okay to paddle there they gave us the paddles like all the things people were mad at us about are kind of story people got really mad at that video kind of funny how social media Works in that way yeah vaccine your gluteus muscles are your biggest muscles in your body and certain medications actually get absorbed better through the intramuscular route but here she actually missed the spot so of forc they running well in reality it is it is slightly like a little bit lower you know she got injected into the hip yeah this is a a fake video it skit right can this like that like going to your CVS and like bam one way to get microchipped microchipped [Music] yeah how this the things you learn on Tik Tok [Music] yeah yeah they really do go crazy I feel like that do not so just to explain what was actually happening in this video is sometimes to fix a bone you have to put a rod in it and then when that Rod eventually causes issues you got to take it out now this is not every orthopedic surgery operation but once in a while it is it does require that much force yeah all right it videos let us know in the comments don forget to like And subscribe helps us with the algorithm and also hit the

asking for a relationship reveal and today is the day we answer all of your spicy questions and I most amazing wonderful gorgeous thoughtful perfect foot dug Dana hello hi beautiful hello handsome oh you pretty so amazing you welcome to the channel so this video is part two and part one of this video is actually on Dana watch that one by the way what what my channel we could answer some questions about our relationship here and I put some questions in the bucket and now we have some tongs will be the tongs of Truth the tongs of Truth and will reach in grab a question and then we that what always ask us how did we meet so the story is very long and complicated we met online yeah yeah we met online but hey you know I will say about meeting online today is really amazing because there would have ever matched I couldn imagine where I would have met Dana yeah I think we should also specify we met on a dating app so didn or anything like that and even though Dana I had a huge following already when when we met I actually have never seen her before so it was it was completely random in a good way in a good way yeah it interesting is our first date was in February of 2022 which is uh yes I remember yes I remember okay so do I so do I it was February 12th of 2022 and if you guys think about what February 12th is uh just a few days days later is Valentin Valentine on February 12th immediately on that first date at the end of the first date I was like I have to see you again I I for sure thought I was going to get a no as an answer but then I asked Dana what she two days after we met we were each other nice Valentine extra special he made reserv and of course he got me Valentine flowers and chocolates and the whole shebang and he was a very nice Valentine yeah so that how we first met sometimes in life it just like that you just have to ask for what you want should we start answering questions you want to go first I guess so I tongues of Truth all right okay here one what who made the first first move oh God so truth be told when I reached out to Dana on the dating app she ignored it multiple multiple times I don like I don because I needed to and so I kept like you I kept not checking it so uh I wouldn obviously once I did I realized what a steel miral was had to I had to reply and uh you know nailed down a date with Mir oh come on you know I I will say in Dana some of the things that I said I uh I don guys that you can be awkward and silly and still score a deal of a lifetime oh my goodness okay now that you brought this up let so I do we have to no yes we do okay so I asked him just as a conversation starter uh cuz it said you were a doctor on your profile so I asked what specialty are you and he gave me a hint this is the hint he gave oh God that so embarrassing so I said something like I pass gas it the basement of hosal I know I know I know like yeah so I asked him oh radiologist no anesthesia at the time I thought it was clear I just thought you were a lactose intoler theologist but despite that we together okay a year and a half later so it just shows you that you don have to be perfect you just have to be perfect for each other yeah you are perfect though no okay well you perfect oh thank you Meo kept expecting me to have red flags and I kept expecting Meo to stop love bombing me because he was so nice I was I just thought to myself oh love bombing I need to be careful tread carefully by the way Dana had to explain to me what love bombing was like last week cuz I didn know what that was this is how like out of touch with social media I was before I met met Dana it again I I was barely even on Instagram and when I met Dana that one that inspired me and um couldn have imagined being here today we both in a very privileged position and as always Miro gives me way more credit than I deserve in that oh you deserve so much credit I would not even consider doing it if it wasn bucket I here question uh who said I love you first I did of course of course of course I remember exactly I actually I planned it out I was it was very I was like oh I have to find like a perfect moment I remember we were staying in uh it one of our first trips together we went to Paris and we had this balcony and the balcony actually overviewed the Eiffel Tower and at night it lights up so it pretty and so we got a bottle of champagne we opened it together and then I said uh I love you and I said thanks friend I said I love you too very much it was very sweet it was very nice was our first international trip together it was very romantic and Miro chose a very romantic time to say he loves me yes and since then our love is only grew a whole different level today than we did in the very beginning and those red flags never came who is the funny one oh come on guys obviously put do Dana with like how many millions of viewers do you have now like six 6 million like bazilian obviously comedy this one I you be funny it people will cry that well dang yeah okay let one who is the better cook oh well okay yeah I mean it make a pretty mean French onion soup that one cuz there things french onion soup morning eggs I guess egg I was about to say eggs yeah omelette yeah who is the most romantic I mean I feel like this is Meo he yeah you always make things very special and you put a lot of thought into things and you you try to make those moments special like when you said I love you and Valentine Day and something else we reveal pretty soon each each of these moments are special because the two of us are together that baby when sick illness hits murro harder than me cuz we get each other sick a lot whenever one of us gets sick both of us get sick but somehow we get sick with different illnesses or different levels of illness you know what I mean like I thought I had allergies one time and then mro was like bedridden poor mro yeah yeah who is more stubborn oh this one is uh oh man oh man you that stubborn is good because you have to be stubborn in life in order for you to achieve things and I think Dana really exemplifies that mentality he basically saying I puts it so nicely he what she wants she knows that she knows that don fell in love first I know from the very first date I knew that Dana is going to be amazing and that see her so soon after her first date on Valentine love first for sure yeah I I mean I would say that it know you know yeah who eater obviously like she like the makeup is done great all the time the hair looks amazing and then the chocolate is like all over the place and I manage to do that like it clothes than in my stomach I just it really it bad I love it it better driver that would be Miro because I is more frugal we don stuff uh we have nothing designer uh we drive cars from I mean like decades ago yeah but we do spend on experience it so like case in point like vacations we we like to go on uh and really experience life because you live once and that started to be the case for me after I met Meo because you know during the pandemic I was in residency and there was no really travel in then and before that I couldn to travel at all soira was the first one that took me to outside the country for our Paris vacation and since then we gone to a lot of different countries I don point in our life where uh we travel because you know training for doctors is extremely intense and it leaves a very little room to travel and on top of that you now that we and training we finally have the flexibility to so I take advantage of it while we can mhm all right all right time to do one last one okay I you go tell is a truth tell is a truth oh oops who has the last say in an argument well obviously me we so rarely argue I I couldn that we wins if we do have one yeah keep talking me M always knows exactly what to say all right well I hope you guys enjoyed it this was fun for us hopefully you learning a little bit more about our relationship

Two Doctors React to Greys Anatomy Premier - Medical Drama Reaction - PART 1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZDkgH7YKfY	Doctor Myro	good talks like this welcome to the game what is this Hunger Game you asked for it and you got it I finally getting Dana to watch Gray Anatomy I Anatomy so I this let switch to an easier specialty five of you will crack on the depression two of you is the absolutely this is your story this is your Arena this is so over dramatic in surgical Fields women are still underrepresented however out of All Med students as a whole there women than men I think that started to be the case like two years ago when something like that yeah Nazi me too do you got the Nazi so did I these will be tortured together right and I don but co-ed locker rooms have you ever seen one yeah I I seen the co-ed locker room no although it is a drama show it is yeah George O went on a black dress with the slip side strappy sandals now you think I it George because it is so realistic you know doctor spent a lot of years just studying studying studying and into books and so social awkwardness is a thing very often it [Music] my name is about Stevens but everyone calls me Izzy [Music] I have five rules memorized and rule number one don already hate you that all right so medical hierarchy definitely exists it malignant as this but you know you entrusting people that just graduated from school so there protocol phoneless pagers we still use pagers in the hospital to this day also you can ignore a cell phone you cannot ignore a pager oh yeah I still have PTSD from those noises the shift starts now and lasts 48 Hours your interns once no bodies bottom of the search for food chain so 48-hour shifts shifts can be crazy long but they anymore residents used to work up to 120 hours and even more but what happened was someone died Libby Zion passed because of a resident mistake they were overworked too much they ultimately missed the diagnosis and she passed so since then we have a law that caps resident hours at 80 hours per week I mean this is pretty accurate usually the call Rooms where doctors sleep overnight is pretty Bare Bones kind of a thin prison mattress and just some Essentials and oh and these are co-ed oh they are yeah oh drama have you ever seen a co-ed sleeping room no one one bed per room which brings me to rule number three if I me unless the patient is actually dying number four the dying in case you better not be there when I get there I don know if you would kill someone you would have woke me for no good reason you clear it because as an attending you can delegate work to the intern but if they mess up it is on you what do we got piggy price 15 year old female nuanced seizures intermittent for the past week IV lost in roof during the Grand Mall season okay so we do sometimes go up to the helipad usually for critical trauma when the patient never seen anybody transported for a seizure though my helicopter [Music] and also there is no reason why in route they can this fish has been seizing for what three hours they just died five times and they would not be accurate usually again you would terminate the seizure and roof is it 10 milligrams no no the walk over fire so what they talking about right now is where to place the leads for the EKG so you can see the electrical activity of the heart fish on dry land absolutely [Music] that means every test in the book CT CBC chem seven top screen Christina you on Labs George patient workups Meredith get Katie for a CT that is just not how medicine works you don order like a bazillion test it is not effective you create what differential diagnosis and they go through the most likely diagnosis and you order tests to either prove them or disprove them the only time that you do this shotgun approach is if you really have no idea what I your patch to Spokane Teen Miss I was in the top 10 after the first two rounds this show is so funny because they have the residents doing everything even pushing the patients to the CT I don do push the patient bed and a lot of times it bit quicker there the hospital there for everything it for a reason okay so I insert my fingers click into your refractive fingers how many fingers what let I don not wrong I don be too good you the bone you know what IVs anesthesia nurses oh yes I mean in general in general nurses in general you want to nurse doing your IV but you missed a lot when you first started out you and I are gonna have so much fun together you know if you and you want to learn but you want to get more information people will support you it it for having not the healthiest food than what we serve in the cafeteria are like chicken nuggets fries Burgers it where marathon not a Sprint beat I can should eat something you try eating after performing 17 right to exams I think this is very inaccurate because we can do the grossest things and then still eat just fine afterwards like I can drain an abscess and then eat two minutes later I always have an appetite yes maybe not until though as you know the honor of Performing the first surgery is reserved for the intern that shows the most promise as I running a large day I get to make that choice I mean no intern is going to be first assist in a surgery on their first day to be lucky to see the inside of the or in the first few months yeah the way it usually works is C1 do one teach one so the first time you you not going to be doing the surgery that so silly our doctor at home said that she might need an operation is that true what kind of operation she well you know what I um I doctor so this definitely happens a lot especially if you covering multiple patients after everybody goes home in the evening usually if there for everybody and they can be covering 50 60 patients so you can find yourself in this position where you have to synthesize a lot of information quickly during this time at night me [Music] there will be no memories I you get that right so does this happen yes yeah you know a lot of people end up finding their wife or their husband working in the hospital most healthcare workers spend a lot of time with each other at work and they get through a lot of difficult situations they support each other and sometimes magic happens not as often as it does in Gray you took advantage of me and now you want to forget about it vulnerable and good looking and you took advantage okay I was the one who was drunk and you are not that good looking Maybe not today again say Friday night no and I stop looking at me like that but what Dr Shepherd this is inappropriate sometimes relationships form in the hospital but it would be a bit inappropriate if it different levels of training you know an attending and an intern that grounds for disciplinary action yeah being fired thank you for clarifying yeah you welcome things are certainly getting juicy so we here and if you want to see part two head over to my channel we link somewhere right here yeah there part two click right here and head on over to see where this goes	Success

Where People Go To Wake Up in the Future: Inside a Cryonics Facility	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw6qT2GN0Ao	Doctor Myro	[Music] our goal is to have reversible suspended animation just like in the movies can you just put me in stasis and wake me up in the future when everything I hope that I won body but I nanobots so tell me is cryonics a pipe dream [Music] [Music] let it like but what if there was a way to escape the apocalypse in fact what if we could cheat death altogether freeze ourselves in time and wake up in the future when all of our problems have disappeared the idea of putting humans into cryo sleep is everywhere in science fiction Han Solo trapped in carbonite Captain America frozen in ice but what about the real world can we stay off death through the power of cryonics I out welcome to the Al Khor Life Extension foundation the self-proclaimed world leader in cryonics for just under a quarter of a million dollars Alcor is selling a second chance at life the AL core team looks after nearly 200 people who are waiting to take that second chance one small catch every person preserved here has been pronounced clinically dead but al khor that estimates are that within fifty to a hundred years we will have the medical technologies needed to restore our patients to health and function the team at Al Khor refers to its customers as patients and just like patients in a hospital alchohol hopes that in the future they health when they arrive each body or patient depending on how you look at it goes through a technical process to increase their chances of survival on the other side they chemicals and drugs carefully called lowered into a giant steel vat of liquid nitrogen and stored at minus 196 degrees Celsius all in the hope that one day they will live again alcor in the middle of this building is possibly the strangest and most unsettling thing I of stainless steel tanks holding the bodies and heads of a hundred and seventy dead people frozen in stasis how many people in each one of these each one of these has approximately nine patients four whole body patients around the outside and then there the middle which holds five neuro patients yes neuro patients people who elected just to preserve their heads not only is it less expensive it also saves on space that would be the neuro can that the patient is in and it of course has identification on it each of these vessels is known as a Dewar a custom-designed insulated tank that computer controlled to preserve the bodies inside their massive even considering how many bodies and heads they contain but these doers have been designed to protect alcohol they so tall I can I insulation both around underneath and on top these lids do come off the insulation on the lid comes down almost to here Wow and people often ask us what happens if the electricity goes out it doesn have backup generators to keep our computers running and that sort of thing but these patients are in liquid nitrogen it just sits there at minus 196 Celsius we don patients are not damaged in any way by a power out it sign up for cryonics I figured it would just be sci-fi mad doomsdayers or ultra rich billionaires but the photos of patients that Lynelle cause walls point to a pretty normal looking clientele more than 1200 people have signed up for our core services of the 170 patients roughly three-quarters of men but otherwise it retirees mums and dads even a very young girl she had brain cancer and her parents had her cryo preserved they wanted to come over and do a Buddhist ceremony so we put her picture on the capsule for them to have that ceremony my husband is in this Dewar right here and so I come in every now and then say hi Fred how you doing okay let science behind cryonics is completely unproven it experts say there preserve the human brain or reverse the biological finality of death but for alcohol being declared clinically and legally dead isn only really means that your heart and your lungs have stopped functioning without intervention doesn cells are dead it doesn organs are dead up until maybe 30 or 40 years ago most people in medicine thought that death was an event on/off switch you dead it that it your heart and lungs stop functioning for you to really be totally dead alcohol says if you intervene early enough and preserve the body as quickly as possible after death there reason you couldn the future when science has improved so what exactly do you do to a dead body if you hope to bring it back to life one day well turns out it dropping it in a tank of liquid nitrogen when a patient arrives they are brought in to L cos facility for stabilization this room kind of feels like a cross between a hospital and morgue the initial process varies depending on how long the patient has been dead and whether they were placed on ice before arriving but here the goal is to start cooling the body as quickly as possible and for that they go into a sort of post-death life-support the patient is placed in the ice bath and then covered with additional crushed ice the patient is intubated to restore the lung function and oxygenation to the blood there placed on the patient the blood starts circulating again and that protective medications but the real action happens in the operating room where the body goes for cryo protection via surgeons pump blood out of the patient cryoprotectant eventually you trying to cool them down and you know putting effectively like an antifreeze in Velen exactly is a medical grade antifreeze so that their cells do not crystallize when they go past the ice point so our bodies are made up of about 50 to 60 percent water when that water starts to freeze it forms ice crystals which damage the body but by replacing that water with cryoprotectant alcohol says it can slowly lower the body it will vitrify kind of turning into a glass-like state rather than freezing and in that state you can keep a cryo preserved body in liquid nitrogen for decades it takes about six to 12 hours to cool the body and fill it with cryoprotectant ready for long-term storage but the good news it quicker if you head and how long would all of this process take well it doesn long with the whole body because obviously you don a mass so the procedure can frequently be only half as long okay so why would you only preserve your head well the most important things for Alcor is to keep the brain intact that our memories our personality everything that makes us who we are the idea is that by the time technology is advanced enough to bring a brain back to life we could upload it or even grow a new body from scratch once close to 99% of the water in the body or head has been replaced the patient is gradually called to minus 196 degrees Celsius from there they go into the long-term care room and that they stay [Music] [Music] walking through a room full of fog surrounded by dead bodies and severed heads it felt like I was walking through a graveyard I found it really hard to believe these people would be coming back to live and walk among us and I not alone in fact one neuroscientist says the evidence points to a pretty grim outcome for the people who get Cryer preserved Ken Hayworth has a PhD in neuroscience and he of al khor he founded the brain Preservation prize to challenge the cryonics community to prove that they could preserve a brain without damaging it and according to Hayworth no one has come close so I animal brains that were preserved under ideal laboratory conditions by a technique that they say they use in cryonics companies they didn showed a tremendous amount of shrinkage there was probably a lot of damage and to those structures that encode memory but if cryonics was your one hope for waking up in the future then there might be some good news Hayworth says he has seen evidence of a way to preserve brain so that the neural connections stay intact it stabilized cryopreservation it almost instantly glues together all the proteins in the brain now you as a rock at that point you coming back but the advantage of that is it glues all of them in position it doesn that in the future you could potentially scan upload and even simulate that brain but there do it while a person is living what the downside well the downside is that it kills you but then again everything kills you I not sure that this is the solution for me I needed a second opinion so I decided to make one final stop the apartment of neuroscience at Columbia University in New York I needed to know is death really the end could we actually preserve and restore a human brain without any damage Ken Miller is a professor of theoretical neuroscience at Columbia University and when it comes to the promise of cryonics he convinced so tell me is cryonics a pipe dream in my opinion yes according to Miller we understanding how the human brain works so working out a way to perfectly preserve it and revive it in the future that answer to how the brain works is we don pieces work we know how neurons work at least a lot about how neurons work in my opinion it before we wouldn understand how the brain works it a complexity it just it levels on levels and levels and levels it the imagination okay but even if we could find a way of perfectly preserving our brains and uploading them in the future I still had one question if I found a way to chronically go to sleep and then be woken up in the future would I still be Claire I think so but it funny question because of course if it was all information that you got up into a computer that was somehow running and making something feel like Claire well we could have a million of them on a million different machines and each of them would feel like Claire but immediately just like twins start having divergent experiences and becoming different people and so all these different Claire start having different experiences and becoming different Claire but while Ken Miller says with thousands of years away from understanding the human brain back in Arizona Alcor CEO max more has a different view I do believe that what makes you who you are can be brought back in the future so long as you reasonably good conditions I think everything important is hard coded up here so long as we retain the structure over time we hopefully will reach a point where we can actually restore the function so right now what we can do is preserve the structure we cannot reverse the process today but I think it doesn matter of time and better technology cryonics isn for a full-body or 80,000 for a neuro preservation it for hope Moore also says there are no guarantees with cryonics Alcor doesn exactly let you choose which day you want to be woken up still I guess your chance of waking up from here is probably better than if you go to the crematorium you know I think what we doing is we potentially be preserved we throwing them in the ground and having been eaten by worms and bacteria or we kind of crazy when we could give them a chance if they want it do you see this then is kind of the ultimate insurance policy it really is actually real life insurance I mean you think about life insurance is actually death insurance pays out on death this really is life insurance is it you don figured out the biology of Aging but while critics say people like the team at Alcor are trying to play God more simply wants to push the bounds of what unethical to try and live longer makes me scratch my head so compared to what what is the right lifespan you the Bronze Age and people died in their 20s and 30 used to be go back at all oh yeah like a century ago and people died in their 40s is 70 right is 80 right there is no you know privileged answer to that so I think it to give people the opportunity to live as long as they choose to live in good health they can decide when their time is up before coming to ELQ or I thought people who believed in cryonics were kind of mad I science and I think we way of bringing a dead person back to life but after being here I realized maybe they of people who are not afraid of that they can look at as a grand adventure you know take some getting used to the future but I I hope that I won body but I nanobots so it as a nanobots swarm or a nano cloud and it will be much more durable I can be as beautiful as I want to be I won any more already thank you listening to Linda Chamberlin it her patients and she cryonics for her and the rest of the team at Alcor cryonics might be a long shot but it stage putting myself on ice and sleeping through the apocalypse just isn option which means there way I can think of to escape the end of the world and it leap to get there you
