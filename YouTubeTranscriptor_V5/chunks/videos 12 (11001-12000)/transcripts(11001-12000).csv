Doctor Explains: low calorie rice hack!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X48IKUWeCio	Doctor Myro	Here to 50% of carb and calorie absorption in rice. Do you know what it is? Yep. And it even more than 50%. A team of scientists from Sri Lanka found that taking rice and cooking it with a teaspoon of coconut oil and then freezing it will reduce the calorie content of that rice by literally 50 to 60% when it reheated. How? Well, you see when you freeze carbri foods like bread, pasta, rice, amalos, a carbohydrate forms really strong hydrogen bonds with other amalos molecules during the freezing process. And yes, those bonds are still there when you unfreeze this food. And these strong bonds cannot be broken down by your body very well, so they don get absorbed. And this team of scientists found that adding just a teaspoon of coconut oil actually enhances this process even more. [Music]	Success

YouTube is blocking requests from your IP. This usually is due to one of the following reasons:
- You have done too many requests and your IP has been blocked by YouTube
- You are doing requests from an IP belonging to a cloud provider (like AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure, etc.). Unfortunately, most IPs from cloud providers are blocked by YouTube.

There are two things you can do to work around this:
1. Use proxies to hide your IP address, as explained in the \"Working around IP bans\" section of the README (https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api?tab=readme-ov-file#working-around-ip-bans-requestblocked-or-ipblocked-exception).
2. (NOT RECOMMENDED) If you authenticate your requests using cookies, you will be able to continue doing requests for a while. However, YouTube will eventually permanently ban the account that you have used to authenticate with! So only do this if you don't mind your account being banned!

YouTube is blocking requests from your IP. This usually is due to one of the following reasons:
- You have done too many requests and your IP has been blocked by YouTube
- You are doing requests from an IP belonging to a cloud provider (like AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure, etc.). Unfortunately, most IPs from cloud providers are blocked by YouTube.

There are two things you can do to work around this:
1. Use proxies to hide your IP address, as explained in the \"Working around IP bans\" section of the README (https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api?tab=readme-ov-file#working-around-ip-bans-requestblocked-or-ipblocked-exception).
2. (NOT RECOMMENDED) If you authenticate your requests using cookies, you will be able to continue doing requests for a while. However, YouTube will eventually permanently ban the account that you have used to authenticate with! So only do this if you don't mind your account being banned!

If you are sure that the described cause is not responsible for this error and that a transcript should be retrievable, please create an issue at https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api/issues.

YouTube is blocking requests from your IP. This usually is due to one of the following reasons:
- You have done too many requests and your IP has been blocked by YouTube
- You are doing requests from an IP belonging to a cloud provider (like AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure, etc.). Unfortunately, most IPs from cloud providers are blocked by YouTube.

There are two things you can do to work around this:
1. Use proxies to hide your IP address, as explained in the \"Working around IP bans\" section of the README (https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api?tab=readme-ov-file#working-around-ip-bans-requestblocked-or-ipblocked-exception).
2. (NOT RECOMMENDED) If you authenticate your requests using cookies, you will be able to continue doing requests for a while. However, YouTube will eventually permanently ban the account that you have used to authenticate with! So only do this if you don't mind your account being banned!

- You are doing requests from an IP belonging to a cloud provider (like AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure, etc.). Unfortunately, most IPs from cloud providers are blocked by YouTube.

There are two things you can do to work around this:
1. Use proxies to hide your IP address, as explained in the \"Working around IP bans\" section of the README (https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api?tab=readme-ov-file#working-around-ip-bans-requestblocked-or-ipblocked-exception).
2. (NOT RECOMMENDED) If you authenticate your requests using cookies, you will be able to continue doing requests for a while. However, YouTube will eventually permanently ban the account that you have used to authenticate with! So only do this if you don't mind your account being banned!
