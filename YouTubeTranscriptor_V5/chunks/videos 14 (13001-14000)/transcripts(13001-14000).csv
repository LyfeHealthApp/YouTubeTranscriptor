RE: LIVER KING LIE & DISHONEST INFLUENCERS	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ypXV3D4Yjc	Dr Day	hey you guys it with a quick little video on the social media sensation the liver King I had quite a few thoughts so if you interested please keep watching all right you guys so the liver King is someone who had a viral uh viral attention viral growth and he is essentially a bodybuilder this is content that I don Do cover influencer scams and misleading marketing so that video has come to my Channel I want to give you guys a brief synopsis of kind of who he is and then kind of what has unfolded over the last few days and my thoughts on all of it so I refer to this article I will link it down below but it says Larger than Life bodybuilder Brian Johnson dubbed the liver King allegedly has a secret to his impeccable physique steroids Johnson Who Rose to Fame after claiming he lives in ancestral lifestyle that includes eating raw liver was outed by a fellow bodybuilder who claimed to have evidence of Johnson seen in leaked emails allegedly sent by Johnson the father of two has been posting Instagram since August 2021 amassing of her 1.7 million followers and swearing that his intense workouts in eating as a modern caveman is the are the secret to how he maintained his ripped body Johnson who has posted videos of him chowing down raw animal liver protein shakes egg yolks and bone marrow claims that his body is 100 natural and has staunchly denied steroid use now the first time that I saw this guy I automatically looked at him and said who in the hell is believing that this guy is not using some kind of ped who is looking at him and saying that I don understand the oh my God Factor if I being really honest I Guru I of um anything as soon as I saw him I automatically thought he has some kind of PED in rotation that is helping him get this physique the guy is 44 years old I believe and there is just no way that eating some kind of a really weird caveman diet is going to make you look this way and that the way ped is performance enhancing drugs it continues and says Johnson has been accused of using performing enhanced performance enhancing drugs so by a YouTuber who simply goes by Derek whose channel name is more plates more dates and I dedicated to speculating whether bodybuilders are Natty or not meaning naturally ripped or using steroids in the hour-long video which has exceeded 1.68 million views Derek shows emails he claimed Johnson sent to an unnamed coach in 2021 in which the muscle man allegedly shares his goals to build his liver King brand and admits to spending eleven thousand dollars on the figure enhancing drug YouTube commenters ridicule Johnson after seeing the details revealed in the video and the email allegedly is sent from Brian Johnson who is the liver King he said he PEDs a month in an email it says I been working out for 35 years I know how to eat train rest and recover I even have a hard shell hyperbaric chamber at my house but I it kills me to support these exhaustive efforts I recently taken omnitrope the 5.8 milligram vials from Empower Pharmacy 11 000 US dollars a month for my new dose four dial four vials per week 16 vials per month I don grossly under dose or what but I taking two vials per week and my if and my ifg one is only 139 C Labs below my doctor told me that I could double an effort in the upper 200s low 300s she thinks I could be hyper non-responder blah blah blah and he goes over this blood test stuff hopefully this watershed moment for the fitness industry will lead to Greater transparency one person wrote while another added man it finally made perfectly clear what we all knew was true I feel bad for the few people who believed that he was Natty natural this was bound to happen another agreed I did in an Instagram video depicting a workout that Johnson posted on Monday the tractors alluded to the revelations with one noting a must be nice to spend 15K a month on drugs and another one added better not turn your Wi-Fi off tonight bro you and your team have some damage control to work on while I believe in practice what you preach in general you should have just been honest and the reason that people are so upset too is because he so adamantly denied the fact that he was using anything so it not being honest but you avoiding the the chance to literally lie to people Johnson had previously addressed allegations about using Peds bluntly but cheekily telling Barstool Sports podcast I execute and dominate every effing morning when approached by uh Rolling Stone Johnson said that he was grateful for the video in a weird way I grateful for the recent events that have shed lights that has shed light on this complicated as topic Johnson wrote in an email to the publication although he apparently did not address the latest latest steroids allegations or whether or not the emails were real and then if we move on to more recently he has addressed the allegations in a recent YouTube video titled liver King confession I lied it was posted Thursday the Creator who um his name is Brian Johnson again describes suffering from a pervasive self-esteem issue which led him to taking steroids last year when I talk about the 85 percent of the population that suffers from self-esteem issues that work myself to death in the gym and this is why I do 12 to 15 blood burning workouts just to feel okay in his YouTube video he said that he 120 milligrams of testosterone per week so I medical lingo and stuff because again I a whole lot but when it comes to influencers lying I cannot wait for more influencers to be exposed if you are building a massive amount of wealth off of giving people a skewed image of yourself or lying about the things that you know helped you get to this amazing physique that you you you supplement that make you just become like superhuman these are the kinds of business practices that I liked as he exposed I cannot stand allowing us influencer do not sell me this product when you the whole um you know look at JLo and the beauty industry she claiming that she uses olive oil on her skin but knowing that she has access to the best plastic surgeons in the entire world anyone who believes that JLo is actually using olive oil or the skincare that she the skincare that she think that she videos or tick tocks so that people believe that she actually uses it but let with like Kylie Jenner do you actually think that Kylie Jenner is sitting up in her 20 million dollar house using a Kylie Jenner skin care product no and if you do

What's The Real Difference Between Sunscreen And Sunblock? ??	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8YoX9PnGhg	Dr Day	which one is better sunscreen versus sunblock well hey guys I many posts on Tik Tok Instagram of people being like Oh my gosh I had no idea that there was a difference between sunscreen and sunblock and that one is better than the other so in today video I am going to set the record straight once and for all which one is actually better sunscreen versus sunblock are you ready there thing as a sun block the FDA does not allow any product to claim to be a sun block because the term is super misleading no product that you would put on your skin will 100% block out ultraviolet radiation some amount of UV is actually always going to reach your skin there is only sunscreen many years ago the FDA updated its regulations on sunscreen labeling and it does not allow products to claim to be sunblocks for that reason it Upon a Time products were sold um as sunblocks and you want to know what happened well people put them on and were under the impress that oh I sun block on so I burn I safely be outside so they went outside with just sunblock on and they stayed out too long they didn you recall at least from what I remember back in the day and you of this a lot of people just put their sunblock sparingly on areas like their nose and not the rest of their body so all that to say when people were under the impression that sun block was a thing they misused these products and as a consequence got a lot of unintended sun exposure unprotected sun sun exposure um so for that reason you you won block you also won labeled as waterproof because there such thing as a waterproof sunscreen while some sunscreen formulations can resist removal by repeat water exposure they are not waterproof eventually the water will rub them off and I know that some people are rolling their eyes going oh my gosh she language what does it matter clearly we know that most people when they say sunblock they the other listen when language is not clear it leads to confusion so in a lot of people product that has organic compounds as the active sun protection ingredients organic compounds are those that contain carbon not the produce you buy at Whole Foods but rather compounds that contain carbon like organic chemistry is the science of these compounds um so that is what the active ingredients in chemical sunscreens are and I say that in air quotes because the other type of sunscreen is what people call mineral sunscreen or physical sunscreen and these sunscreens their active ingredients are not organic compounds they are inorganic compounds which as a side note are chemicals that chemical and air quotes because all sunscreens are chemicals but inorganic chemical compounds these are metal oxides zinc and titanium dioxide they typically leave a white cast on the skin now a lot of people are under the impression that the organic sunscreens the chemical ones work by absorbing UV rays and dissipating that energy as heat which is correct however they are under the impression that the mineral physical inorganic sunscreens work by blocking reflecting and scattering ultraviolet radiation while they do that to a certain extent that primary way in which they work the primary way in which inorganic metal oxide containing mineral or physical sunscreens work is actually by absorbing UV rays and dissipating the energy as heat so exactly like the organic chemical sunscreen active ingredients they all work the same to protect from ultraviolet radiation so which one is better the best sunscreen you ready is the one you are actually going to wear it doesn it mineral it doesn which we video as long as you are willing to wear it you know it sustainable for you to use to protect your scan that period stop over scientif Ying sunscreen that It Gets period sunscreen is not a shield of armor it should never be the sole means by which you protect your skin from the Sun you should always be raining in other Sun protective behaviors when you are spending time Outdoors enjoying the outdoors and that includes wearing sun protective clothing seeking shade and not staying out to long don people made in the solely relying on sunscreen that was a mistake that was a mistake in the sunblock era we want to get away from them but people will say what about isn protecting us from a tan from hyperpigmentation from melasma no um it better at protecting against those compared to a chemical sunscreen you will not find a randomized control trial comparing inorganic mineral sunscreens to organic chemical sunscreens for melasma hyperpigmentation anything of that sort uh the claim that a lot of people make is that a mineral inorganic sunscreen is superior at protecting against UVA compared to a chemical organic sunscreen and that not true um in order to call yourself a sunscreen because again there thing you can block there to call yourself a sunscreen you have to demonstrate that not only do you protect against UVB but you also protect against UVA so all sunscreens will protect against both types of ultraviolet radiation when used correctly they all protect against UVB and UVA uh and they they all need to be reapplied when you are spending time outdoors and people get real fixated on this like I live in a cave and I only go out to get my mail do I need to reapply every 2 hours no I mean like you have to exercise some discretion within your own life about how you are going to incorporate sunscreen because there as sunblock into your daytoday life um and the general consensus is to wear sunscreen to protect your skin from a sunburn as well as to use other Sun protective measures but on days you are mostly indoors you might choose to wear sunscreen but not reapply it you may find that you have problems with sunscreens and that you forgo them now I have videos on the benefits of wearing sunscreen indoors especially when you are sitting by a window because UVA does come through the window I have videos on that but if you don not in into wearing sunscreen you might not want to do that um it people will claim that a mineral in organic sunscreen is safer than a chemical organic sunscreen and that both are safe have been used for many many years with no evidence of causing any health problems in humans aside from allergic reactions irritation um are possible as with anything you put on your skin aside from that there are no adverse Health consequences associated with the use of sunscreens now a lot of people will get hung up on this one thing and that is well the active ingredients in organic sunscreens they have been detected in the bloodstream bodily fluids after application to the skin this really does not sit well with a lot of people um while we have no evidence that that leads to any sort of adverse Health con consequence whatsoever and these have been used for a long long time we have no evidence to support that we have no evidence that they cause any kind of endocrine disruption to people when used in sunscreens that being said it still doesn which I respect people in that case then you might want to choose a mineral sunscreen with inorganic metal oxide zinc and titanium dioxide because those will not be detected in the bloodstream upon application to your skin so that is an option however the inorganic mineral sunscreens with zinc and titanium dioxide they leave a white cast which you may be okay with but a lot of people are not especially people who have a deeper skin tone so so that really do not like the unnecessary unsubstantiated fearmongering around uh organic chemical sunscreens because it sends the message that the ones that are probably more aesthetically acceptable to people with a deeper skin tone are somehow bad or harmful and it makes it um you know it sends a message that makes it more likely people will just not adapt wearing sunscreen all skin tones can benefit from the use of sunscreen screen and again the best one is the one that they are actually going to wear all right guys that about wraps up what I want to say take home Point there protective product that you apply to the skin is going to block out ultraviolet radiation completely um both organic chemical sunscreens and inorganic metal oxide containing mineral sunscreens they primarily protect you the same um by absorbing UV rays and dissipating them as heat and the best one is the one you actually going to use but does sunscreen even work like I not a shield of armor you got to do these other things so like does it even work watch my video does sunscreen actually work does it do what everyone claims it does um because I go into a lot of details there and clarify some things in terms of what sunscreen can and cannot do what the research shows it actually can help with and where we have gaps and knowledge in terms of what it can help with so that a watch uh and I

magical experience like a once in a-lifetime thing it was it was such a let down it to outer space ah despite all the rain we got this morning it beautiful day aren pretty I don they pretty butterflies out here look at these things they like something on a Dr Seuss I don is it though feel the need to engrave their name on the poor succulent what kind of tree is this it little I don nuggets we were here a few weeks ago and they were not nearly as many flowers as there are today got a grale check him out mouth breather hopefully he doesn Peck me on the head [Music] a lot more stuff is growing compared to when we were here last time is that a month or so two months ago time flies they are about to be salsa ready ah see gorgeous day I think I go up that little thing I don what the proper name is walking Fountain sculpture but we must move quickly for there are mosquitoes coming out the garden over there stay [Music] here we are the be top practically see the theater over there The Outdoor Theater and that butterflies I always take an Uber when I come down here because parking is difficult there fountain well hey guys I shower I came in tonight with a little hydration stackage I am almost finished with the cedil healthy renew face serum this is what I love about it I know I always point this out but I just think it it it we we should be doing this moving forward brand should be doing this moving forward this push pop style pump where you can see I mean I still have more to go you get every last Dropout and you can visualize it coming out you know that you the wackadoodle song and dance to my body I came in with gold bonds Radiance renewal but on my face I did a little of that and then um came on over with Trad noan and now um I mentioned this in my May skin care reviews stuff I bought and tried out throughout the month of May that I have been using the Madagascar cantella hyalo seea sleeping pack if you have watched any number of my videos over the years you know I huge fan of of the serum in this line love it to bit so when I saw this mask was available and and it has melatonin in it which is a rare gem if I do say so myself in skincare products hard to come by like beakman has a melatonin product that I really wanted to try um but Ulta their website what is going on with Ulta as a side note like what is going on I I feel like Ulta is on the brink of collapse like Target is holding it up um otherwise it it it seems like their website is just unreliable anyway um this is what it looks like you can see if you is the same color in opacity if you will but a thicker gel-like texture so I just going to come on over but truthfully you could use this under tro you know it gel I think it for some I like to use a gel moisturizer but one thing you have to be careful with gel moisturizers because if you use them in the morning they often will lead to peeling of your sunscreen on over it all it not a guarantee that that will happen but it than like lightweight lotion type facial moisturizer but it lightweight it greasy I don serum though it essential oil free but it does have rose water in it like I Korean products like to put rose water in things um and if so if you allergic to fragrance there possibility that it could crossreact the thing I like about these though is the polyglutamic acid it ingredient that I feel like you know enough I love niacinamide don wrong and that are just relying too much on niacinamide carry their products through I would love to see more polyglutamic acid in in action because for me personally it really steps up a Moisturizer in terms of just like the Cosmetic effect my skin just looks a lot better polyglutamic acid is hydrating but also has this ability to just improve the elasticity of your skin really give it a luminous kind of Radiance to it and in that bounce you know I would love to learn play golf because I I feel like that would be kind of fun let me know in the comments have you ever tried Top Golf is that worth dabbling in is it something you can do by yourself or do you have to go in a group like bowling um because if you can do it by yourself I might get into it more than if I had to rely on like rounding up people to come with me not to say I wouldn of people I just feel like I would you know I want to do something I don have people to do it with that nature in case you haven know a lot of people prefer doing things with other people I can you know I happy doing things by myself or doing things with other people but all that to say if there to do I don comes along to go do it with um the exception the exception is I don by myself and I don by myself either because I to be alone in the woods let me know in the comments about Top Golf is that fun or is it boring I want feedback um I up here I hope you enjoyed it and hope you you are off to a good start or unwinding from a great time uh if you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen And subscribe I to you guys tomorrow bye [Music]	Success
This Body Odor Hack Will Blow Your Mind ??	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrAk3qk6r_M	Dr Day	but I wanted to remind you guys that since vany cream also discontinued their fragrance-free anti-perspirant um which is a huge bummer um I have been using the certain dry antiperspirant and I really like this it fragrance-free and the fun fact about anti-perspirants is you know you put them on at night that on before you go to bed not in the morning that way they have the best chance of working for you to reduce sweat but you them regularly for a few nights in a row after about a week or so you actually don anti-perspirant daily anymore because you have residual effect of the ingredient down in the F down in the in the echine sweat gland reducing sweat output so for me personally I only end up using my antiperspirant two maybe three times a week at most	Success

Hair Removal Creams Explained #dermatologist	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5n3e2NhNo	Dr Day	slowly but surely as I I can blame the majority of my problems in life on the fact that most people are jealous of me it better than most of you at growing unwanted facial and body hair I familiar since around the age of 11 of various and aundry hair removal techniques including hair remover cream but I don what this can do or how it works hair removal creams Foams lotions like nare vet and other brands they have thioglycolates in them which basically work to dissolve the disulfide bonds and the Keratin in your hair essentially dissolving the hair if you want to impress your friends call them chemical depilatories the advantage of using one of these bad boys over shaving is that when you shave it cuts the hair at the surface of the skin whereas the chemical depilatory product can get a little bit down in the follicle and and dissolve the hair down there so in other words it hair to grow back plus in contrast to shaving you get more of a tapered end that grows out so you don blunt stubble hair removal cream is not as topnotch as waxing cuz that to that deeper below the surface of the skin so it back the downside of using these products is they the skin and a common mistake I see a lot of people make is not following the directions carefully enough when you use these you want to make sure that you leave them on the skin only for the recommended amount of time not any longer because what ends up happening is you get a lot of bystandard impact on the surrounding skin and that can lead to a lot a lot of irritation make sure you are rinsing all of this product off so you don can cause a lot of irritation Brands like Nar they make different formulations and intended for like body versus face facial skin is going to be a lot more sensitive than like your legs for example the tree hut Community needs to be aware you do not want to come in with a sugar scrub after using one of these things because the Skin Barrier is like a little bit stunned after having this hanging out on it for a while it can to be really careful to avoid using anything that could be considered a kattic meaning things that dissolve keratin after applying this because your skin is just like way too vulnerable and that will lead to a lot of irritation for example Ura glycolic acid lactic acid mandelic acid also probably want to avoid benzo peroxide immediately after using this or your retinol or prescription retinoids make sure you really careful when you go out in the sun that you from the Sun this will leave the treated area a bit more vulnerable to sun damage to getting a sunburn but you should be protecting your skin from the Sun anyway	Success

It strand of hair or multiple strands of hair that are mostly gray but have some segments that are still pigmented, including up close to the scalp. Every hair on your head comes out of its own follicle and the hair follicle is like a little biologically active unit. Our hair turns gray as melanin pigment production declines. This of course is part of the normal aging process, but loss of melanin pigment can also be influenced by stress as well as certain medications and micronutrient deficiencies. Early on in the graying process, those cells that produce melanin to pigment the hair, they can regain for periods of time their melanin producing abilities and you can get repigmentation of segments of the hair.

It doesn makes my under eyes look a million times worse. And while treoan can be amazing for improving wrinkle depth around the eyes because it improves collagen production. It can be very drying and irritating, especially in the beginning and especially on delicate eyelid skins. If you and irritation of the eyelids with tininoan, use a skin protectant to the eyelids before applying tininoan to the rest of your face. This is what I currently use, but you also could use petroleum jelly. You want to improve the appearance of wrinkles around the eyes similar to tininoan, but with less risk of dryness and irritation. Consider a cosmetic form of topical vitamin A such as retinol in an eye cream or retinaldahhide.

Vaseline Lash Growth: The Secret Nobody Talks About	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Jd2QRWMjM	Dr Day	Did you know that Vaseline can make your eyelashes grow? Oh, wait. It can you really shouldn you see on the internet. Amen to that. Like she goes on to say, putting Vaseline on your lashes is not actually going to make them grow. But what it can do is make them less brittle and less prone to breakage just by essentially keeping them moisturized. The downside of putting Vaseline on your eyelashes is that if you go too heavy-handed with the application, it can get in your eye and be irritating. So, if you try this hack, I suggest getting a little spoolie brush and just putting a tiny amount and directing it towards the tips of the lashes, not up super close to the lash line itself. But I say, for me personally, the biggest difference I saw in my lash growth and getting longer lashes is not using Vaseline, surprise, surprise, cuz I use that anyway I can, but rather in using an oil cleanser as a first step in my facial cleansing routine to essentially break up mascara from the lashes as opposed to like makeup remover or myicellar water where I was having to rub a lot. I found that over time that rubbing was very harsh on the lashes causing them to break more readily. When I switched to using an oil cleanser, it just dissolved the mascara, wrapped around the lash, so it came off a lot more easily. And ultimately that combined with likely the imolliance in the oil cleanser has really just help my lashes personally.	Success

Now, that being said, there are many types of hair loss disorders out there, and reasons to have thinning hair. Things like hormones can influence hair growth, nutritional status, underlying medical conditions, autoimmune diseases in particular. But one thing most people don about hair growth is that it is one of the most energy demanding tasks your body has to perform and bails on it when you have other things going on. Blood flow is key to that because it allows for delivery of nutrients, growth factors, signals that are necessary to initiate good hair growth. In fact, many of the hair loss treatments available actually help to improve blood flow to the hair follicle, such as minoxidil, low-level laser therapy. There evidence that a motivated individual who engages in daily scalp massage can improve hair growth by improving circulation to the scalp. But as I say with any hair loss video, if you struggling with hair loss, see a board-certified dermatologist.

Duct Tape Wart Removal That Actually Works	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Au19h-WOmQ	Dr Day	If you take duct tape and you place it on your skin when you have a wart, then the duct tape can help suffocate the wart, causing it to begin falling off in about six days. As wacky as it sounds, duct tape definitely can help get rid of those pesky warts. Warts are caused by a little virus that gets into little cracks in the skin. In otherwise healthy people with no underlying medical issues, warts will go away on their own with zero treatment. A lot of the treatments that we do are in an effort to create a lot of inflammation so that your immune system comes in and clears out the wart virus. Duct tape likely helps to improve wart clearance by exfoliating the wart and traumatizing it, causing the immune system to come in and clear out the wart virus. It also helps to prevent you from picking at the wart because wart virus can be transferred from your fingers to neighboring skin and you get more warts. In order to do this, soak the wart first, then file it down while the skin is damp with a pummus stone. Let the skin completely dry and cover it with a piece of duct tape. Leave the duct tape on for about 6 days, after which rip it off, take a break for a night, and then repeat the process for another 6 days. Do this until it goes away.

It Isotininoan can actually help to reverse some of the visible signs of sun damage with changes appreciated at the hisytologic level on biopsy including an improvement in collagen production, anti-rinkle goals, and yes, it can be helpful for rosacea as well. But we don comparing to topical teninoan for the purposes of anti-aging. But in this small randomized control trial, it appears as though topical teninoan versus oral isotininoan no difference in terms of improving photoagging. Even at low doses, oral isotreinan can have side effects. Most common being really dry lips, dry eyes, dry skin. And it potent traden, meaning if you who gets pregnant while you it, it will cause severe birth defects. Topical treininoan likewise effective not without side effects most common being dryness irritation and peeling but without the potential risk for systemic side effects. While it to use topical tininoan in pregnancy there have never ever ever been any reports of birth defects in people who were using topical teninoan and happened to be pregnant. Oral isotininoan can have systemic side effects. So I wouldn It depending on your overall health and what risk versus benefit there is to taking that versus using the topicals.	Success

Sometimes you don start seeing results until the 3 month mark. Here though. And you get a lot of dryness, peeling, irritation. That can be uncomfortable. Why are you not using it with a moisturizer?

You might need an additional treatment. Talk to your dermatologist. Things like benzole peroxide along with adapylene can really seal the deal for you.

Do you have hormonal hair loss aka androgenetic alopecia that hairs into little baby vellis hairs? Or are you just dealing with a lot of breakage so that your ponytail doesn feel as thick? Maybe maybe you hair because several months ago you went through something super stressful like an illness, psychologic stress, fever. Maybe you went on a crash diet and lost a bunch of weight very quickly. Wearing extensions or tight hairstyles can put a lot of traction on the hair cause breakage and over time lead to thinning. Also, aggressive heat styling, especially without a heat protectant, can lead to fragility of strands and more breakage.

These are a variant of skin tags on the face called dermatosis papillosa that happen in people of deeply pigmented skin tones. Here frustrating about having skin tags. While there are several ways in which they can be removed, no removal strategy prevents you from getting more.

These are closed comedones, commonly referred to as white heads. Basically, a little clogged pore. The number one thing you have to keep in mind is that the stuff I recommend is not going to fix this overnight. And it if if you actually use it and use it consistently. Put the scrub down. Don ignore salicylic acid. It actually gets down in the pore to dissolve that plug. You can use a salicylic acid cleanser or a leave on salicylic acid. Contrary to popular internet belief, salicylic acid can be used not just once a day but twice a day if you tolerate it. Oh my gosh. The dapylene, a retinoid which will clear up and prevent white heads and rough skin texture. Benzol peroxide also can fight comedy although it can be super drying. So look for 2.5% or lower for mild comedalytic effects. If you got really really sensitive skin, try sulfur. It though it does smell like eggs, but it does offer some mildly effects as well. Just choose one. And make sure you stick with it for at least 6 weeks before bailing on it and considering an alternative.	Success
Daily Hair Loss: Normal vs Concerning Numbers	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peszkzVdKH8	Dr Day	Whoa, that actually normal to lose about 100 to 150 hairs a day. All the hairs on your scalp are in different phases of the growing cycle, and some of them move over to the resting and shedding phase. So, those hairs that are shedding mean that a new healthy hair is going to grow in its place. What if you than 100 hairs a day? Well, that might just mean that you have a condition known as tiloggenofluvium. Tilogenlovium or excessive hair shedding can happen anytime your body goes through some sort of stress. Whether it be psychological stress or physical stress such as a fever, pregnancy, delivering a baby, being in the hospital, having a surgery, running a marathon, losing a bunch of weight, going on a bizarre weird crash diet that you heard about on the internet. The excessive shedding usually starts about 3 months after the stressful event began. Provided you address the underlying root cause for the stress on your body, eventually the hair will go back to normal and you will go back to just losing on average 100 hairs a day. A lot of times people might confuse hair shedding with hair breakage. Hair breakage also can add on to the normal 100 hairs a day. So how do you tell the difference between a tilogen hair that versus a brokenoff hair? You want to look at the end of the hair where it came out of your scalp. If you see a tapered white tip, that hair. But a shorter hair than your normal hair length, that brokenoff hair.

People don petroleum jelly and Aquaor actually helps to exfoliate the peely stuff. It slides and glides between those chunks of skin that are trying to flake off and allows them to more efficiently and gently flake off. But what is this madness with the flosser? It does look diabolical. I really like that you put the Aquafor on first instead of going in dry with one of these things. See how this would be at least temporarily effective for removing those big sheets of shedding peely lip skin. But you really need to be conservative and not overdo it with this kind of thing or press too hard or go overboard because the lips, they don protective outermost layer. That they are vulnerable to getting chapped in the first place.

Never Get Another Ingrown Toenail With This Simple Fix #dermatologist	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPYFOSe-Ruk	Dr Day	[Music] I would not wish ingrown toenails on my worst enemy. They are miserable. The edge of the nail grows down into the lateral nail fold where it supposed to be, creates an inflammatory response, and can lead to skin infections. As the video illustrates, the way you cut your toenails can be a gamecher for preventing this from happening. You want to avoid cutting the edges so that it grows outward and not around and down. Avoid wearing tight fitting shoes. Pointy toeed shoes not your friend here. Also, if you have really sweaty feet that is a exacerbating triggering factor for the development of ingrown toenails, consider using an anti-persperent on the soles of your feet. This is a great option and apply it at night for maximum results. When you have the beginnings of an ingrown toenail, I highly suggest doing Epsom salt soaks for symptomatic relief and putting a piece of dental floss up under here.	Success

Oh, I If you eye, the worst. These are my go-to tips. Tip number one, choose a waterresistant sunscreen, at least for around your eyes. Water resistant sunscreens less likely with heat, humidity, sweat to end up seeping into your eye. Also consider using a zinc oxide sunscreen for your eyelid area. No, these are not superior to chemical sunscreens. However, they tend to be less likely to cause burning and stinging around the eyes. Unfortunately, they do leave a white cast. You can use a chemical cast-free sunscreen to the rest of your face and just use a zinc oxide sunscreen to the eyelid area. And when you apply sunscreen to your eyelids, avoid getting it within a millimeter of the lash line. This will reduce the risk that it ends up in your eye. Consider a sunscreen stick. These are solids, much less likely to seep into your eyes. This one around the eyes no problem with no burning, stinging.	Success

Retinoids have anti-inflammatory mechanisms that might help with the hair loss process and they also stimulate cell renewal pathways which ultimately can help get the hair follicle cells to well grow your hair. Where tininoan really shines as a hair loss intervention is in conjunction with the established hair loss treatment minoxidil. Not only can trein enhance the penetration of minoxidil down into the scalp, but tininoan also upregulates the enzyme necessary to convert minoxidil to its active form so it can actually work. So for people who aren really responding to minoxidil, perhaps pairing it with tininoan can affect changes that allow them to better respond to minoxidil. It clear if using tininoan will prevent hair loss if you don Nor is it clear what the optimal regimen of using this with or without minoxidil would be.

Your Scars Are Begging For Sunscreen - Here's Why	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NenKG5sxH4k	Dr Day	Three reasons why you need to be putting sunscreen on your scars. Sunscreen will not erase a scar, but it can make it look significantly better in the long run. Ultraviolet radiation from the sun slows down and impairs proper healing. Ultimately, that compromises the quality of the skin as it more prominent scarring. Even though your skin has healed over at the surface, the healing process underneath it takes a long time and goes on for a while. So, you want to keep it protected. The number two reason is that sunscreen will help reduce the risk that the scar develops overlying hyperpigmentation that can make the scar a lot more obvious. Don post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation with scarring. They Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation can gradually go away with time, provided the underlying insult is controlled and the inflammation is kept in check. But a true scar will never completely go away. Regardless, sunscreen helps with the discoloration. Reason number three, sunscreen is a moisturizer and moisturizing a scar can be really helpful for cutting down on the frictional forces that ultimately lead to scar thickening and more prominent raised elevated scars.

Why Your Hair Falls Out After Pregnancy #dermatologist	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeI7zvdVQSI	Dr Day	The best thing about postpartum hair loss is that it It very normal. When you hormones of pregnancy cause more of the hairs to enter the growing phase. Once you deliver, those hormone levels start to normalize. And about 3 months after the fact, all of that hair that you were growing, it goes into the shedding phase. And you have all this hair coming out in clumps. It usually by the time of your child first birthday, it starts to resolve and goes away and your hair will return to its normal growth, its normal thickness. So it hair loss. The best thing you can do is to make sure you stay healthy because any sort of stress on the body like crash diets, nutritional deficiencies, surgery, profound rapid weight loss can cause a hair cycle to shift around and put more hairs in that shedding phase so that the shedding lasts longer and longer.

Your Sunscreen Is Failing You - Here's Why	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC-omeJcs-s	Dr Day	Five reasons why your sunscreen might cause skin cancer. To be clear, sunscreen does not cause skin cancer and is well established to protect against certain types of skin cancers. But there are a few reasons why your sunscreen use might just backfire. Number one, you are using a sunscreen that only protects against UVB. You want to make sure that your sunscreen is broadspectctrum because it our skin, it majority of sunscreens these days are broadspectctrum, but back in the day when sunscreen was first introduced, it really only protected against UVB. And so, people put it on thinking they were all good and they ended up staying out a lot longer and ultimately that contributed significantly to their skin cancer risk. Number two reason is that you are not applying enough sunscreen. In order to get the protection that you need from a sunscreen, you have to apply it at a density of 2 mg per centime squar of surface area, which works out to roughly two finger lengths of sunscreen for your face and neck. Most people don you don reapplied every 2 hours while you outdoors. It rubs off. It loses its efficacy. And so, you need to put more sunscreen on. Number four is you only wore sunscreen. Sunscreen is not a shield of armor. For example, a lot of people will put sunscreen on, even put a good amount of sunscreen on, but then they laying out there with no umbrella tanning for hours upon hours. That ton of ultraviolet radiation exposure that you are getting. The sunscreen is diminishing returns. And the fifth reason why sunscreen might cause skin cancer is that it remains in the bottle. It only works to protect your skin from the sun if you actually use it. Some people only wear sunscreen when they remember, when they go to the beach, when they are participating in some sort of big outdoor thing. But people who wear sunscreen on the daily consistent use, they ultimately fare the best with getting the protective benefits of sunscreen.	Success

I already know you this wouldn been following my sun protection advice all these years. Sunburned skin, wounded skin. One of the worst things you can do at this point is to pull this off and pick at it because the part that adhering to the skin is trying to protect the vulnerable skin underneath. And if you go pulling at it, it going to leave vulnerable skin exposed and can lead to hyper or hypo pigmentation. Don exfoliate this with some sort of sanding device, sugar scrub type gizmo. Nor should you use a chemical exfoliant on this. It be pissed when I tell you what you actually need to do. A, you need to stay out of the sun so this can heal properly. And B, put on a bland fragrance-free moisturizer. Moisturizer kind of helps with barrier protection here because it You can use plain Vaseline or a nice lightweight hydrating gel cream.

Citrus fruits have compounds called furumerins. When they get on your skin and the skin is exposed to ultraviolet radiation, it causes a bad reaction that leads to these awful blisters, usually in a linear configuration like the streaks and it often can heal with hyperpigmentation that takes a very long time to fade away.

TOP 5 FUNGAL ACNE PRODUCTS THAT WORK| Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y38D2ZMLhy8	Dr Day	hey guys today five ingredients for fungal acne if you andrea i dermatologist i would love it if you would subscribe to my youtube channel and hit the thumbs up it really helps my videos out a lot first of all what is fungal acne fungal acne is a condition that results from overgrowth of a little yeast that naturally lives on everyone called malassezia it piterosperon and this is particularly a problem in people who have very oily skin what ends up happening is that their oily skin plugs up their pores and that little yeast is down there within the oily pore and it proliferates too much and brings in an inflammatory response against it and that results in fungal acne it climates and it who works in a sweaty environment and you stay in your sweaty clothes that sweaty oily milieu gets trapped on the skin and can further contribute to this skin condition people who are prone to this tend to have very oily skin and very active oil glands that put out a lot of oil and can plug up the pores again creating a little happy environment for overgrowth of that yeast within the pore fungal acne is most often located on the face it can also be on the upper chest and back unlike regular acne fungal acne the bumps are uniform in appearance meaning they all basically look the same and fungal acne unlike regular acne is itchy so that difference other risk factors for fungal acne include being on antibiotics for a prolonged period of time that can kind of change your skin microflora favoring overgrowth of that little yeast also if you have been on a systemic steroid like prednisone for a while uh that can actually be associated with fungal acne because what that does is put the brakes on your immune system and so that little yeast is like hey nobody gonna go to town and the poor and then once the once the prednisone has stopped and your immune system kind of comes in i was like whoa what the heck you get this inflammatory response and you get fungal acne the good news is that it is treatable with anti-fungal medications and it can you know go away ingredient number one is a zinc pyrithium zinc pyrithium can be found in anti-dandruff shampoos as well as a favorite skincare product of mine that is fantastic for pretty much everybody in my opinion the vanity cream z bar this is a facial bar but you certainly can use it on the body as well zinc pyrithione as an ingredient has been used in dermatology for a long time to treat conditions related to uh that little yeast zinc pyrithione is bacteriostatic and fungi static and it put the brakes on that little yeast it also anti-inflammatory which is going to be helpful for calming down those little itchy bumps and zinc pyrithium can put the brakes on proliferation of that little yeast kind of telling it to hey chill out with multiplying in the four how do you use it well simple you just use it as a wash lather it to the affected area whether it be the face or the chest let that lather sit on the skin for a few minutes and then rinse it off that way you get the zinc pyruvate into the skin and uh you can use either an anti-dandruff shampoo like head and shoulders that has zinc pyrithium but i am particularly fond of the vani cream z bar because it gentle and doesn the shampoo is an option obviously but it so it can be a little drying but the vanity cream z bar is great it also great for regular acne because that zinc pyruvate is so anti-inflammatory i highly recommend it it product i will list this down below as well as everything i this video ingredient number two is ketoconazole what the heck is that uh it can be applied to the skin to help reduce the burden of that little yeast and it product that you can buy over the counter that has ketoconazole in at least here in the states is nizoral shampoo and that is an effective option again wash your face with it let that nizoral shampoo sit on the skin for a few minutes and then rinse it off again it can also be used to other body sites where you might be coping with fungal acne now if you um see a board certified dermatologist or you even your family physician would feel comfortable with this they can prescribe a topical ketoconazole at a higher percentage probably more effective but if you stay consistent with the over-the-counter stuff that too can really help so don uh stuff that strength over the counter it can be helpful ingredient number three that is wonderful for both fungal acne and regular acne even though they are two separate conditions to be clear ingredient number three is salicylic acid salicylic acid is wonderful it helps to unclog the pore remember a part of what is that your pore gets plugged up with all of your oil and within that plugged up pour the yeast are way too comfortable so the salicylic acid it concentrates in the pore it loves that oil it gets in there and it exfoliates the pore and clears it out salicylic acid is also anti-inflammatory so that inflammatory response that leads to the itchy bumps and salicylic acid is also antimicrobial so it can kind of help in reducing the burden of that little yeast a bit and it helps uh smooth out the skin surface as well and remove excess oiliness from the surface of the skin there are a variety of fantastic style silica acid based products on the market you can start with a salicylic acid face wash but personally in this setting i recommend using some of these other washes that i recommended and instead choosing a salicylic acid levon product that way you multiple ingredients to address this issue so rather than just using a salicylic acid wash although that is an option instead select a salicylic acid levon product the way to use it is to just apply it to the affected area in the evening and again in the morning if you tolerate it can be used twice a day to the those affected areas whether it be on your face or your chest or back now salicylic acid can be very drying and very irritating so start very slowly you know using it every other day maybe at night time and then try introducing it nightly and then try introducing it in the morning so that you do it using it twice a day it can be very effective for helping to control this issue and and get it under good control ingredient number four is clatrimozol cream what the heck is that it actually a cream for for athlete fungal infection of the feet different different organism entirely not the same organism but clitramzol has a little bit of efficacy against reducing the burden of malassezia yeast or piterosperm yeast in the skin as well and it that you can buy over the counter that is in a cream form we a lot of washes um and so it have a cream that you could put on the skin as another ingredient to incorporate and it need a heaping glob and you only need to use it to the affected area clitramizol is also any antifungal as a side note is going to also be anti-anti-inflammatory so it can maybe help with in reducing redness and irritation so uh that that little different from ketoconazole ketoconazole what i mentioned earlier is probably even more robust at reducing at reducing the burden of malassezia but over-the-counter you can only buy that one shampoo of it so it cream form you know you can incorporate two different antifungals and you also get that benefit of having anti-anti-inflammatory effects of both ingredients on board as well last but certainly not least is selenium sulfide this is another anti-dandruff ingredient helps reduce the burden of that little yeast and helps reduce inflammation this is something that comes in a shampoo form again so you can use it as a face wash or body wash again as with any wash that has an active ingredient you want to lather it to the affected area leave it on the skin for a few minutes and then rinse it off this is something you can do in the shower um and if you talking about your face you know you can wash your face with it so those are my top five ingredients for fungal acne i will list in the description box all my favorite products that have these ingredients um but how do you how do you begin do you need to dive all in and go all in with all five of these ingredients no but it may be a good idea depending on the severity of your fungal acne to incorporate multiple ingredients for example you may want to use that z bar that i mentioned with zinc pyrithione as a face and or body wash and you may also want to then apply a levon salicylic acid product to exfoliate the pore open it up and you may also want to use the clatrimzol cream uh it all depends on what you can maintain and what for you because of the nature of the skin condition remember that little yeast is down in the pore and a lot of times topicals they effectively in which case i recommend seeing a board certified dermatologist because we can prescribe oral medications that will eradicate this issue much more efficiently than the topical things uh so these are things over-the-counter that can help clear it up for sure but in many cases prescription treatments may be needed so definitely see a board certified dermatologist but these are ingredients and products that you can get started with that can help one more thing before i wrap up this video and that is there is all of this hype on the internet about fungal acne safe there is no such thing as fungal acne safe and those websites they are so bogus they go over like all these random ingredients and rate them as like feeding malassezia it is complete anecdote bunk uh you know they get comments all the time is this thing is this product fungal acne safe is this product fungal acne safe it another lucy goosey term non-comedogenic um it really being applied to marketing it an internet hyped thing so stop focusing on that the pathophysiology of fungal acne relates to oiliness in the pore just a predisposition to that and immune response which you know there response safe it doesn uh you know your climate sweatiness the environment that you live in um it doesn with random random emulsifiers in a face wash no not at all i mean that science behind this this condition yeah so i wanted to point that out don fungal acne safe lists i mean just stop saying fungal acne safe let saying fungal acne safe i would love to eradicate that from our lexicon because i hate nebulous marketing things that are not substantiated in science and the fungal acne safe thing is one of those things that if we keep putting it out there on the internet as a reality then marketing you know companies skin care companies are going to start putting it on their products and it like oh here we go again with with you know clean green things that don the consumer two bits the ingredients i mentioned in this video can help but again oftentimes prescription remedies are necessary and importantly removing the aggravating factor whether it be immunosuppression long-term antibiotic use um you know changing up your routine if you live in a hot climate so that you skin these are things that can make a difference not like obsessing over random ingredients and products i hope this video was helpful to you guys if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don i [Music] you	Success

Top 5 OILY SKIN CARE INGREDIENTS| Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3gxcigyA6U	Dr Day	hey guys in today sharing with you my top five ingredients for oily skin as well as some skin care products with these ingredients oily skin is something i know a lot of you guys deal with and it tends to be more obvious in the summer months especially if you live in a humid climate it however that oiliness is due to the skin care products that you use to be clear moisturizers sunscreens they don you oilier oil production is largely governed by hormonal influences for example in women the time of ovulation progesterone levels are higher and that makes you oilier or shinier men tend to have oilier skin than women as a result of the androgens testosterone things like that that do in fact lead to increased oil production you can have oilier skin as a result of your genetics some people just have larger oil glands more prominent pores oilier skin so if you a moisturizer that won stop looking they don it it products that i today they can help reduce that burden of oiliness and help kind of degrease you ingredient number one clay it can be bent night clay kale and clay clay is found in masks and clay is very absorbent it helps wick up oil from the surface of the skin and from within the pore that can reduce the appearance of shininess excess oil on the surface of the skin is what clogs your pores and can lead to blackheads and whiteheads as well as acne lesions doing a clay mask can help reduce overall the amount of oil on the surface of the skin and from within the pore that will help you not look as shiny it will help in controlling breakouts potentially and it will help your skin care products go on better to be clear however the clay is not going to impact the rate of oil that comes out of your oil glands it gonna kind of mop up some of the excess i am a huge fan of the cetaphil clay mask i reason i like this product so much is that it has clay but it moisturizing a downside of the clay masks is that they can be drying and you know people with oily skin they sometimes think that they need to dry out their skin and it not true at all oiliness does not necessarily equate to moisturized skin in fact some people have oily skin and they also have a tendency towards dryness so don same box oily and moisturized they they they like the cetaphil mask for that reason it thing that if you you can you know try introducing it into your routine obviously maybe a few days a week but if you tolerate it it you ultimately could do on a daily basis i also am a huge fan of the inky list kaolin clay mask this too is very moisturizing and if you sunscreen makes you look shiny and you feel as though it you oilier again to reiterate it making you oilier but sunscreens they tend to reflect light and really make everyone look shiny if you have oily skin that so try doing a clay clay mask like first thing in the morning to help kind of remove some of that excess oil from the surface of your skin then rinse it off and then you know later apply your sunscreen it will go on more evenly and not look as shiny ingredient number two niacinamide niacinamide is a b vitamin it has tons of benefits for the skin beyond just helping with oiliness it is anti-inflammatory and it can also help in improving the moisture barrier so for those of you who have oily skin but you also have a tendency towards dry skin niacinamide is a good ingredient to incorporate niacinamide also can reduce the burden of oxidative stress in the skin which ultimately can break down that excess oil on your skin and lend itself to two flares of acne and inflammatory you know redness irritation etc because of its anti-inflammatory properties there are studies examining its efficacy for the oily skin condition acne and interestingly using a four percent niacinamide moisturizer daily and people with acne lended itself to an overall reduction in acne severity comparable to using the prescription uh one percent clindamycin so that great because unlike clindamycin niacinamide is not an antibiotic so you don to worry about bacterial resistance developing and another study showed that using a two percent niacinamide moisturizer daily reduced the output of oil onto the skin as well as the overall volume of oil on the skin so these studies that i using four percent and two percent niacinamide suggest that it beneficial and like i said it tolerated and it has anti-inflammatory benefits the niacinamide market is saturated every brand is trying to grab your attention for their you know niacinamide serum 10 15 20 um whatever you don niacinamide serum and a high percentage of niacinamide is not necessarily better in fact in many cases it can end up being too irritating you guys know i pm this is a facial moisturizer with niacinamide it works quite well it suggest it it also has ceramides which will address any skin barrier defects you may have and help with dry skin so that is a great product but this video isn best products it ingredients so i will list down below in the description box some more good basic products with niacinamide but the take-home point is you don can find a reasonable percentage strength in most moisturizers just look at your moisturizer if it has niacinamide in it great it can help out your cause as far as the oiliness ingredient number three is green tea specifically the polyphenols and green tea they can reduce oxidative stress and there some data that green tea and emulsion form can reduce oiliness and pore size likely potentially by inhibiting some of the pathways downstream of the hormonal signaling that goes on a lot of that is a lot of the mechanism has been teased out preliminarily in lab-based studies but we do have some studies on actual people showing benefit and oiliness using a green tea emulsion specifically a three percent green tea emulsion for eight weeks showed an overall reduction in sebum in people and then another one using a green tea emulsion for 60 days showed an improvement in in oiliness you guys actually recommended this product to me and i have been trying it out isn don but it is a green tea emulsion similar to what you know was used in the studies although like i said i don percentage of the polyphenols but it it you can derive the benefit of the green tea polyphenols using it green tea is also helpful for reducing redness and helping with hyperpigmentation so it niacinamide and you can use it multiple times a day if you want to twice a day typically what people have you know the bandwidth to incorporate is twice a day um and it can be layered along with other ingredients you don irritation it another product i wanted to draw your attention to you is by a brianna i i really like replenix they have a lot of great sunscreens with green tea polyphenols and they have this age restore brightening moisturizer that you might want to check out not only does it have green tea polyphenols but it also has niacinamide in it so you get both of those ingredients in this if you niacinamide or green tea you know you have both of those which can help with the oiliness so green tea is a great option and the other nice thing about green tea is that it can also help potentially in reducing oxidative stress and free radicals from environmental stressors like sun exposure pollution because both green tea and niacinamide are antioxidants i suggest you know you can use them up to twice a day but i also suggest using them first thing in the morning apply them to the skin allow them to absorb fully and then apply your sunscreen on over and if you want to do a clay mask before that fine and then just apply either the green tea or the niacinamide or both and allow those to absorb fully and then apply your sunscreen the advantage here is that because niacinamide and green tea also are you know their antioxidants in theory they can help reduce the burden of oxidative stress that comes from environmental stressors like sun exposure and the reason that for people with oily skin the breakdown of their oils can contribute to flares of acne and skin problems so i suggest doing that but you also can use these at night time okay ingredient number four is an exfoliant that is really good for people with oily skin and that is salicylic acid or bha salicylic acid is a chemical exfoliant that loves oil and it focuses in the oily surfaces of the skin it can penetrate into the oily oily areas very well especially within the pore it exfoliates the pore and it reduces oiliness it kind of clears it out and the other nice thing about salicylic acid is that it can help reduce the burden of acne lesions but it also can help reduce hyperpigmentation and i am a huge fan obviously i talked about it at length the polish choice bha liquid exfoliant this is great two percent bha it can be used up to twice a day if you wanted to if you tolerate it but i suggest incorporating it into your routine very slowly a few days or nights a week in the beginning and then bumping up to daily see how you tolerate it can be a little drying so introduce it slowly see how you do and if you tolerate it well then it can be used actually up to twice a day it list some alternative bha products down below in the description box so this isn the end-all be-all you have to have this um but this is a good exfoliant for people with oily skin salicylic acid you can kind of just think of as getting into the pore nicely and what it does is it breaks up the bonds between skin cells that are kind of stuck together so that they can dislodge and exfoliate out and it also you know helps clear out some of the oil so it can help with clogging of the pores that ends up happening if you the surface of the skin so it blackheads whiteheads and oily skin last but not least we have good old topical vitamin a retinoid or retinol this can help actually in suppressing oil production at the level of that hormone signaling and it can help shrink the oil gland i over-the-counter retinols and retinoids i down below but don different gel this is a very well tolerated topical retinoid that really can help with the oiliness and especially if you are prone to [Music] clog pores blackheads whiteheads and acne this is a great product it helps in kind of controlling skin cell turnover so it helps clear out the pore rhinoids actually can help shrink the pore minimize pore size that has been shown so a dappling is a great choice you can get over the counter it doesn have to be the brand different several brands have adaptolene for example larish jose does and i think cvs even has a generic version of different so it doesn to be the name brand different just look for a dappling and again i some other forms of topical vitamin a namely retinol or retinaldehyde that likewise can help all right guys those are the top five ingredients for oily skin but to reiterate products do not make you oily using a moisturizer is not going to make you oily not using a moisturizer is not going to make you oily that is another myth that i hear a lot sunscreen does not make you oily these things have no bearings on oil production that remember is going to be governed by hormones now other things that can influence oil production are going to be obviously your genetics if you have if you have a larger oil gland your gender men tend to have oilier skin your diet can also play a role in your oiliness because diets rich in processed sugary foods or potentially diets that are high in skim milk these things they can cause spikes and insulin-like growth factor which ultimately leads to increase in oil production and more oiliness that associated with stubborn acne thought to be due to the role of insulin-like growth factor in oil production so don diet that that can that can definitely feed into the oiliness women who deal with polycystic ovary syndrome because their hormone profile is skewed more towards and more towards androgens they suffer a lot of skin conditions related to that acne being one more oily skin as well as hirsutism or hair growth uh in a male pattern you know facial hair or body hair in a male pattern and they pattern hair loss driven by sensitivity of the hair follicle to those male hormones so this is yet another situation where you may find that you have oilier skin i mentioned the diet but don working out doesn either in fact working out and getting some form of exercise into your daily routine may actually help improve your oiliness long term because exercise can help regulate your insulin and blood glucose better and reduces total body inflammation that going to impact that signaling to the oil gland and make you less oily so that causes you stress or poor health poor sleep can raise inflammation in the body and lead to spikes in cortisol another hormone that can contribute to increased oil production so the lifestyle factors go a long way products they help minimize the appearance of oiliness and they may help control it to a certain extent but they don don necessarily change your genetics or change they can but products do not cause oiliness they don push your oil gland and make more oil if you think about the science and physiology of the sebaceous gland that doesn i hope this video was helpful to you guys

Top 5 DRY SKIN CARE INGREDIENTS| Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lltKrgfyo3s	Dr Day	hey guys in today share with you my top five picks of skincare ingredients for dry skin dry skin is something that can pop up at any point in your life if you use too many skin care products you over exfoliate that impairs the moisture barrier you lose more water out of the skin and skin becomes dry and more prone to irritation and when the skin becomes more prone to irritation you things like acne flares if you have a dry skin condition like keratosis pylaris eczema then you to be mindful of your moisture barrier and using these ingredients will help you long term with age our skin is not as efficient at producing natural moisturizing factors making us more prone to dry skin so you may notice that as you get into your wiser years the skincare products and ingredients that you used to use are no longer serving you as well and your skin is more prone to dryness so these ingredients may help you out don if you have oily skin people with oily skin can also have dry skin as well oil is sea bomb that comes out of our sebaceous gland within the pore and you can have oily skin but you can also have an impaired moisture barrier leading to dryness so the oil doesn trans epidermal water loss and keep the skin hydrated that lot of people have oily skin that sensitive because they have an impaired moisture barrier and they dryness and that acne find that their skin is really dry and overall a lot more sensitive to some of the drying active ingredients used to treat acne ingredient number one is urea urea is a humectant it actually part of our natural moisturizing factors in our skin but it can be man-made and put into moisturizing products and when applied to the skin it first and foremost acts as a humectant meaning it pulls water from the atmosphere into the top dead layer of the skin hydrating that that layer up improving moisture retention smoothing out the look of wrinkles and fine lines but importantly urea is also a keratolytic and what that means is it breaks up the glue between dead skin cells facilitating their turnover and shedding so that the moisture can better penetrate the skin into the deeper layers of the skin ultimately improving moisture retention long term another benefit of using urea and skin care products especially those that you is it has antifungal properties meaning it can help if you deal with toenail fungus it speaking of nails not only is urea good for dry skin but it dry brittle nails it can actually help hydrate the nail plate and improve the strength of the nails when used like on your hands and on your feet um i am not going to go into detail of different products but definitely check the description box i will list by ingredient a spectrum of products but why you guys have heard me recommend a fair amount is by my favorite one of my favorite brands yusran their um your their roughness relief cream this has urea in it it find it uncomfortable on the face i love using this on my feet though and to dry elbows and knees that care to look keratolytic action helps break up that dry built up stuff on those rougher surfaces and ultimately smooths things out and allows for better function of the moisture barrier long-term improving dryness this is also a particularly fantastic product if you deal with keratosis pylaris that dry skin condition where you have the rough and bumpy skin on the upper arms the upper thighs i mean it can happen anywhere on the body urea is a great ingredient now i mentioned that this particular product is very heavy and so in the sense that you may not find it comfortable to wear on the face i suggest instead as an alternative for the face the ordinary moisturizing factor plus ha i think it great facial moisturizer i recommended in many videos that has urea this product or you know other urea creams are also really good for your hands to keep them moisturized and looking more radiant more youthful and it your nails if you like to paint your nails the urea will help ultimately smooth out the surface of the nail plate and allow your nail polish to go on better urea is also a really good ingredient if you are somebody who paints your nails a lot what can happen when you paint the nails a lot is it blocks kind of the transfer of moisture the nail polish and that nails a lot they themselves getting brittle nails or more susceptible to ingrown nails so taking a break from your nail polish for a while like a week or so and using a urea based hand cream or moisturizer can really help hydrate up that nail plate and restore it back to its regular moisture content and ultimately help the health of the nails long term so urea is a fantastic ingredient i have a whole video all about uh you know kind of the science of urea and skincare so definitely check that out if you want to learn more about urea but that would be ingredient number one number two is going to be ceramides ceramides are part of our natural skin barrier if you think about this the top layer of the skin you have the skin cells which are kind of like bricks and then you have all of this stuff in between which you can think of as a mortar and a big part of that is going to be ceramides ceramides are very important for the integrity of the moisture barrier and long term that is really important not only for keeping your skin hydrated and keeping moisture within the skin but also for keeping irritating things out and infectious things out like fungus um and bacteria people with eczema often have a deficiency in ceramides and that water loss out of the skin but actually anybody can have a disruption in ceramides within their skin again using too many irritating skin care products over exfoliating and when you start to get into your 30s and 40s you make fewer ceramides and that why you irritation symptoms of stinging and burning there a fair amount of data showing that ceramides and moisturizing creams when applied to the skin can actually help your skin begin to replenish its own ceramides and ultimately improve barrier function so it in moisturizers there confusion about ceramides as ingredients and skincare products what to look for on labels you ceramide ap ceramide np or ceramide eop to name a few ways you identified there are actually nine different ceramides and they differ based on their carbon chain length but honestly it doesn what type of ceramide is in the product at all they all basically do the same thing and they all can help equally to begin to clear your you know to clear your skin into restoring the moisture barrier so don get hung up on the type of ceramide i have a whole video explaining ceramides and skin care products and talking about the amount or the ratio it doesn doesn yeah they function pretty much the same you don the type of ceramides in the product uh they will do they will do you justice regardless you guys know i they skincare products for a long time but they ceramides in their products as a matter of fact this user and roughness relief product i held up also has ceramides in it um so you a number of products but sarah v has been doing it the longest as a matter of fact the name stands for ceramide vehicle there applying ceramides to the skin can help in fighting off some of the free radical damage that happens as a result of environmental stressors like ultraviolet radiation namely ingredient number three for dry skin arguably one of the best is petrolatum nothing compares to petrolatum when it comes to reducing water loss out of the skin petrolatum is also very good at promoting healing so if you do have eczema for example and you raw rashy skin petrolatum is fantastic it will create a barrier to irritating things getting into the skin and water loss out and help with with facilitating healing now petrolatum gets a lot of it gets a bad rap especially from the clean beauty marketing but it that we for decades and decades and decades like since the early 1900s petrolatum has been used for skin conditions it it site and allowing for the new skin cells to migrate into the wound and close things up so it get cuts scrapes but it will see it incorporated into moisturizing creams along with other good ingredients for for dry skin now vaseline is just petrolatum alone and so it spot remedying dry skin and reducing water loss out of the skin it develop an allergy to it people worry that it their pores but it doesn that is a myth and in fact it actually very good for people who have acne prone skin because it really does such a good job at addressing that moisture barrier now anything that is a moisturizing ingredient or an occlusive that helps trap water into the skin if you dirty skin that can actually trap the dirt up against the pore and lead to some irritation and that could flare the acne in theory that is that is a theory so just make sure that you cleansing the skin regularly and that shouldn probably one of the best ingredients out there petrolatum like i said it early 1900s it oil and waxes and the petrolatum and skin care products very refined you don worry about contaminants nothing compares to it if you want a true dermatologist recommended ingredient i mean we use it recommend it we use it in clinic all the time best one of the best ingredients arguably for dry skin ingredient number four is actually related to petrol autumn and that is mineral oil mineral oil is a colorless odorless compound derived from petrol autumn and what surface of the skin smooths down skin cell edges and traps in water into the skin but it can actually penetrate into your skin so it irritation truthfully you can it system you know cares about and it uh very very stable i mean it doesn go bad unlike vegetable oils which can oxidize become rancid unlike vegetable oils also mineral oil is just pure mineral oil mineral oil gets such a bad wrap but truthfully it plant oils because plant oils are not a pure substance like mineral oil and they can have potentially compounds in them that are allergens and plant oils many of them are not stable they oxidize readily that manufacturers have to add antioxidants to the formulation which you also can become allergic to as i mentioned it doesn it doesn large compound just sits on the surface of the skin mineral oil is in a lot of skin care products i actually from uriage for a while now i got it on i herb i know this brand is available to those of you throughout europe uh and i actually really like it initially i didn great but it does a nice job obviously and you know preventing dry skin and helping dry skin but it also kind of gives the skin a nice healthy glow smooths down those skin cell edges yeah i this particular product all right the final ingredient is a great one for those of you who are in that category of oily plus dry and that is dimethicone or really any silicone but i would say dimethicone is the most common dimethicone is a derivative of silicon which is a natural you know ingredient from the earth and it is really nice in the sense that it smooths down skin cell edges it with oily skin who have their own oils on the surface of the skin it doesn that is one downside of like petrol autumn and mineral oil is that for people with oily skin it feels very greasy and uncomfortable to use those ingredients try dimethicone it is wonderful the other nice thing about dimethicone is that it actually allows your sweat to evaporate that another downside of petrol autumn and mineral oil is that because they sit on the surface of the skin your your sweat doesn up making you feel hotter especially if you and it dimethicone is nice in the sense that it allows for evaporation of sweat so i actually rather fond of it in in sunscreens you guys notice most of the sunscreens that i use many of them have dimethicone or some sort of silicone and i think that makes them a lot more breathable and and lightweight but it also does a really good job reducing water loss out of the skin without feeling heavy or greasy dimethicone is going to be or dimethicone is the most common like i said but you there are other silicones out there and you often going to find them in products labeled oil free this is why we always direct people with oily acne-prone skin to choose oil-free moisturizers which oddly enough silicones are silica are kind of an oil anyway so it doesn but we direct them to these products because they feel better for people with oily skin uh silicones do not clog pores or you know or they responsible for breaking people out these are all you know myths and misconceptions about comedogenicity which is flawed in and of itself another advantage of dimethicone partially because it allows for the evaporation of sweat is that it doesn look shiny which is really you know a store spot for people with oily skin they already look shiny as a result of their natural oils on the surface of their skin which may be dry and then if they use a moisturizer with petrolatum or mineral oil it shinier so dimethicone doesn it kind of has a poor blurring effect a smoothing effect it is a great it water loss out of the skin dimethicone is also fda approved as a skin protectant so it really does a great job reducing water loss out of the skin and acting as a barrier to things getting in so those are the top five ingredients for dry skin everything that i mentioned in today video is aimed at improving barrier function aside from urea which is aimed at improving barrier function i didn much on the different types of humectants hyaluronic acid polyglutamic acid i have videos on all of these ingredients but i really wanted to focus on things that are going to help reduce water loss out of the skin and these are honestly the mainstays when it comes to dermatologist recommended ingredients for dry skin that are well tolerated low risk of problems like irritation and allergy the other point i want to emphasize again is you can develop dry skin at any point in your life and these ingredients can help serve you in those situations for example if you move somewhere where the air is a lot drier you lose water out of the skin and suffer dryness and irritation these things can help if you are actually in a humid climate and you develop chafing that is a sign of an impaired moisture barrier that shaping and breakdown of the skin barrier from friction plus skin on skin contact plus moisture from sweat using a skin protectant that helps act as a barrier like petrolatum or dimethicone or mineral oil that can really help you in those situations another time in your life you may find as you get wiser and your skin barrier doesn own moisturizing factors as efficiently you you may feel that when you put products on they now sting burn these ingredients will help in correcting that issue i hope this video was helpful to you guys i have a whole playlist going now of ingredients that work and this will be included in that playlist so check it out if you want to know about different ingredients for other skin issues i hope you all enjoyed this video if so give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don i [Music] you	Success
TOP 5 SKIN CARE INGREDIENTS YOU NEED | Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2glNXcql_s	Dr Day	well hey guys in today be covering five skin care ingredients that you need and maybe you didn you did these are ingredients that you hear me talk about a lot but you may have it in your head that they acne or for dry skin but in reality the ingredients have multiple multiple uses for various conditions and so i key ingredients that you definitely should consider incorporating into your routine i some products that have these ingredients in them many of these products i have mentioned in numerous videos before but you can find these products at walmart today walmart walmart you guys know i fan of shopping there um i love going in there and checking out their skincare uh i i life actually ingredient number one benzoyl peroxide okay benzoyl peroxide you probably heard of it for acne right as something like a teenager with acne would use but in reality it has so many more uses than just that benzoyl peroxide is an antibacterial ingredient but the benefit of using benzoyl peroxide for as an antibacterial is that the bacteria on your skin cannot develop resistance to it as opposed to an antibiotic like clindamycin bacteria that live on your skin they can develop resistance to it and that is a real problem benzoyl peroxide not the case it can reduce the burden of problematic bacteria on your skin that cause a variety of skin issues i benzoyl peroxide washes here it is penoxyl four percent benzoyl peroxide washed again it i also love and adore the cerave acne foaming wash i guys as well i these products down below um by the way it can be incredibly beneficial for reducing body odor you guys who have followed me you know this at this point but i do have a lot of new subscribers uh if you deal with body odor especially in the summer you sweat a lot in the armpits definitely consider incorporating a benzoyl peroxide wash lather it to like your armpits while you let it sit on the skin for a few minutes and then rinse it off this can help cut down on the bacteria that would otherwise break down your sweat and make you make you stink not only can you use it in the armpits if you are a loved one has foul smelling feet get yourself some benzoyl peroxide wash lather your feet up let it sit on there for a few minutes and then rinse it off certain bacteria end up on the feet they break down sweat and they can cause a pretty foul odor it and kind of helps to exfoliate the skin if you deal with ingrown hairs try benzoyl peroxide i know a lot of men who follow me you know they for ingrown hairs in the beard area but a lot of women are asking the same question especially if you shave in the bikini area while with summer coming up you out a benzoyl peroxide wash because you can lather it to that area leave it on the skin for a few minutes and then rinse it off it will cut down on the chances of the hairs growing downward just by kind of exfoliating a little bit and it will help with the bumps if you have that condition hydrabinitus sapurativa which is miserable to live with this is something you need in your life uh you know for controlling the boils in your armpit groin area same same approach lather it to those areas leave it on the skin for a few minutes and then rinse it off will help tremendously and then of course acne which is what it is indicated for but you can use it for acne breakouts on the body too like your chest your back same approach lather it there leave it on the skin for a few minutes and then rinse it off because if you are on an oral antibiotic for a skin condition like acne or rosacea you on an oral antibiotic for a couple of months like doxycycline or minocycline or ceracycline you definitely want to incorporate benzoyl peroxide why it reduces the risk that the bacteria on your skin will develop resistance to those antibiotics lastly impetigo what is impetigo it is a superficial skin infection caused by a pathogenic strain of staphylococcus aureus bacteria and you can pick it up uh you know gems is a frequently a frequent location people some people are colonized with it in their nose and it ends up getting into little cuts and things and causing a type of skin infection called impetigo if you or a loved one works out in a gym it you know if you have a young teenager who is in team sports like wrestling in particular where they have not only the contact with potentially contaminated surfaces of like the gym equipment but then they contact with one another they can transfer it to from person to person this is a must-have all right so that is a favorite ingredient of mine and i highly recommend it it just an acne treatment it has a lot of other benefits number two ingredient is a retinoid now retinoids for the most part are prescription retinoids are forms of topical vitamin a that are indicated for acne and many for anti-aging purposes but over the counter you can buy a dapolin which is a retinoid for acne and you know i here differing gel which you can get at walmart different gel or adaptolene is fda approved for the treatment of acne but it can be used for a lot of other things off label for example there is a good evidence that adaptolene can help in improving the appearance of sun damage if you have age spots like on the back of your hands it just a face product if you have age spots on the back of your hand give different gel a try sun spots on the face freckles it can help improve the appearance of it also can help with sebaceous hyperplasia a lot of you guys deal with that those little enlarged oil glands because it kind of gently exfoliates the skin and helps control cell differentiation it certainly can help that as well you have to use it consistently for a while to see benefit but if you deal with those definitely try a dampling i can help the other condition that it can help is with milia milia are those little tiny superficial cysts they can happen like on the cheeks i haven a common area backs of the hands they happen um either spontaneously or after some type of skin injury and they should resolve but sometimes they can be really stubborn and stick around or you can just be prone to them using a retinoid like a dapolin can definitely help hyper pigmentation if you have hyperpigmentation definitely give a dappling a try i can inhibit some of the machinery that leads to upregulation and abnormal pigment and it will exfoliate the skin kind of increasing the rate of turnover to clear out that residual hyperpigmentation in the top layer of the skin number three should come as no surprise to you guys it is petrolatum petrolatum is a favorite of mine and it doesn than good old-fashioned vaseline petrolatum is the active ingredient vaseline is the only ingredient in vaseline petrolatum great for improving healing you get a cut vaseline you sustain a first degree burn cooking in the kitchen vaseline dry eyelids crusty flaky maybe you came in contact with something vaseline dry peely lips chapped lips vaseline working out or walking you get chafing vaseline it is a skin protectant it reduces water evaporation out of the skin keeping it hydrated healthy and when you do have a skin injury whether it be a cut or an impaired skin barrier from flaring of eczema what vaseline does is it provides a seal that allows for the skin cells to migrate in and heal properly so it does facilitate healing and it this it is amazing no i don vaseline or unilever and it doesn the brand name basiley and you just want petrolatum now there are some competitors on the market which are good uh aquaphor some people are loyal to aquaphor it petrol atom based ointment it has a few other ingredients like lanolin which people can be allergic to so it is more likely to cause problems whereas vaseline 100 usp petrolatum uh you don allergic to that so it is not as safe as vanillin but it is another option and then likewise a long time favorite of mine you guys know is a cerave healing ointment this is another petrolatum ointment that likewise is great this as opposed to vaseline has hyaluronic acid in it which will help improve the moisture content of the skin and this also has ceramides which kind of clue your skin barrier into repair so it has a few other good ingredients but again the more ingredients more likely for you to develop problems to one of them if you you know for example contact dermatitis so this is a holy grail for me but i would always i would always default to vaseline all right ingredient number four is one that nobody ever really talks about and that is urea i mean urea is an ingredient it sounds like urine it off-putting maybe that don eucerin has some fantastic urea based products the roughness relief cream is a gem now urea is great for addressing dry skin what it does is it actually actively improves the moisture retention and barrier recovery similar to ceramides it also is a keratolytic meaning it dissolves the glue between built up crusty skin cells facilitating their removal so that your skin barrier can function better it doesn stuff on top of it smooths things out if you have dry skin you need urea in your life but it than just a dry skin ingredient it also great for your nails it improves the health of the nail plate if you have calluses it will help exfoliate that and just make your feet look a lot better i love using a urea based foot cream you guys know i huge fan of the carousel foot ointment definitely recommend that now that we months to make your feet look better you don salon and have them scrape off your callus just use a urea cream this one by eucerin you could use the carousel one is a lot more intense and you will get results faster but yeah great for calluses great for just making your feet look better and great for the health of your nails if you have toenail fungus or fingernail fungus using a urea based ointment is helpful as well because it uh kind of cuts down on the burden of scaly stuff that the fungus feeds off of and then if you use anti-fungals it allows them to get into the nail better so it wonderful if you have psoriasis to put like for example if you have psoriasis patches on your elbows put urea on there it will help soften those scales away and it will allow your other psoriasis medications to get into those lesions better if you have uneven skin tone on the body highly recommend a urea based cream such as this because it will help exfoliate that dead stuff that is making the skin look discolored i have a lot of people who have deeper skin tones asking me what can i use to even out skin tone on the body this will help you got to stay consistent with it but it definitely can help makes your skin more even more moisturized it just smooths everything out and improves hydration all right last but not least you guys are like how is this an ingredient we didn spf all right i know what you thinking of course we know we need to wear sunscreen but i do have a lot of new viewers here and some people are not you know in the know if you don to be wearing sunscreen every day all year round but the reason i this video is because people kind of get the gist that you need to wear but there are so many locations on the body that people are forgetting to put sunscreen on for example people often forget to put sunscreen around their eyelids that was one of the most commonly neglected areas in a study looking at how people applied sunscreen they missing around their eyes and the skin around the eyes is very thin very delicate prone to damage from the sun more quickly than other areas of the face and it show up a lot of skin cancers form there and i know many of you with deeper skin tones you deal with hyperpigmentation dark circles under the eyes you need to be protecting your skin from the sun with sunscreen and sunglasses people also forget sunscreen on their lips and the lips are very prone to damage from the sun because they don rest of your skin to kind of buffer and block out some of that damaging uv radiation plus there aren the oil glands and things to keep the skin moisturized highly highly recommend a long time favorite product of mine the vanity cream lip spf and this product is a two for one you can put it not only on your lips but you can also use it around the eyes as protection see a lot of people they are hesitant to put sunscreen around the eyes because it burns it stings i always suggest using a mineral sunscreen but a mineral sunscreen such as this intended for the lips is going to go over much better you know in that delicate area as well so highly recommend this it is very good other places people are forgetting sunscreen now this is not an everyday occurrence but do consider putting sunscreen on your scalp why if you scalp it needs no addressing why you need it there but skin cancers on the scalp are very common now if you have hair that covers the majority of your scalp you probably find it does offer some protection but if you wear if your hair is thinning or you wear a hairstyle that exposes a lot of your scalp you definitely want to consider using a sunscreen there of course you can use the regular sunscreen that you put in your face but a lot of times those end up building up on your hair they can make your hair brittle greasy frizzy unmanageable the best protection for your scalp is going to be a hat but if you are out by the pool if you are out of the pool or out you know by the beach and you gonna get in the water you probably not gonna wear a broad brim hat in the water let would wear a swim cap but not everybody wants to do that highly recommend this product by banana boat it is their hair and scalp defense it does have fragrance in it but i have not found a scalp specific sunscreen that does not have fragrance um this is a chemical sunscreen the way to use it is to just part your hair like down the middle spray it directly on your scalp don spray it on your hair spray directly on your scalp part here and spray and part here and spray and then massage back down get it get it all over your scalp now people will be like isn little extreme putting all that sunscreen on your scalp every day i would say this is not something you necessarily need to use every day because you covering stuff this is more for those days where you like at the beach or the pool and you don you get in the water definitely grab this what i also like about this product is it does not run into the eyes with sweating that is that is something that you know would not be pleasant so highly recommend that is a good one stay tuned i will have a video coming out soon about all my go-to recommendations for scalp sunscreen so stay tuned for that but that is one that video that i strongly recommend other locations people forget their ears not just the the front of the ears but the back of the ears see a lot of sun damage uh skin cancers on the tops of the ears very common do not forget the hands you guys know i way to protect my hands from the sun when i don the same sunscreen you use on your face you can use on your hands and don getting into summertime that is an area that a lot of people neglect yeah the top of the feed is an area that people just don and in the summer you flip-flops whatever you there one product i really like to wear every day as a body moisturizer is the eucerin daily hydration cream you can use this on the hands the feet the face i mean you can use this from head to toe just as like an everyday moisturizer with spf it value and uh i like you know i put this on my body in the morning as a body moisturizer and i put it on my feet so i and that attention it just getting in the habit of putting sunscreen everywhere where you covering it like your legs your feet your arms um and you can use this on the head and neck as well like your face your neck your ears those are areas you don as far as sunscreen to the lips one point about that too i get questions can i just use my regular sunscreen on my lips you certainly can but they can be very drying there because remember the lips they don things that the skin does so they that a specific lip spf product plus sunscreen rubs off a lot more frequently on the lips because you drinking talking what have you so you need to reapply it more frequently having a lip balm you know is nice otherwise if you regular sunscreen it drying and irritating after a while so yeah those are my top five ingredients you should seriously consider incorporating into your routine they have a lot of potential benefits not just for you know the first and foremost thing that comes to your mind i hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you walmart for sponsoring today video i will link everything down below in the description box if you liked it give it a thumbs up

BRANDS ARE LYING TO YOU: CLEAN BEAUTY EXPOSED | Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvwIGLn2xkk	Dr Day	well hey guys in today doozy for you because i came across an article the other day in the journal of the american academy of dermatology that basically exposed a clean beauty marketing lie i mean i already knew it was a lie but it really really is a lie if you here welcome my name is andrea i board certified dermatologist i would love it if you would subscribe to my youtube channel and hit the thumbs up it really helps my videos out a lot if you didn is complete bs it doesn regulated i mean one brand another brand really it that fear mongers unnecessarily different ingredients despite no scientific evidence to support the claims against these ingredients as a way to sell you more expensive products they love to fear monger certain preservatives and one family of ingredients that they really love to fear monger are those that are derived from petroleum mineral oil petrolatum and liquid paraffin they love to claim that these ingredients are toxic despite evidence to the contrary because these ingredients have been used in medicine since 1872 with a lot of established benefits not harms to human health and i towards the end of the video petroleum derived ingredients they don get into the skin at all they form a film on the top layer of the skin and that to your advantage in skin care products they help to lubricate the skin surface and importantly they reduce what out of the skin that ultimately allows for your skin to stay moisturized hydrated and helps your skin barrier function better also because they form that film they or a wound because they create a barrier allowing new healthy skin cells to come into the wound and fill in the wound defect allowing for better healing this is why petroleum derived products are used in medicine on cuts scrapes and surgical wounds if you petroleum jelly products on your skin because they work many clean beauty brands will boast that their products are petrochemical free free of petroleum so this paper that i ran across gathered a handful of products making these claims from the clean beauty movement and they actually did an analysis on these products and found that they actually do have petrochemical derived ingredients and they identified their products just by searching online using terms like clean uh petrochemical free and so that list of 11 products they then used radiocarbon isotope analysis and found that 100 of these products did in fact have ingredients of petrochemical origin anywhere from six percent upwards of 28 petrochemical ingredient content in these products to be clear that doesn think it valuable but they products to an audience that they have made fearful of these ingredients and in reality the product still has these ingredients here are the products that were examined and found to be guilty babo botanical sensitive baby fragrance free shampoo baja baby shampoo and body wash in the soft citrus scent beb or beb organic bubbly wash all in one for hair and body ever eaten baby shampoo and body wash fragrance free gaia natural baby shampoo organics babies by green people baby wash and shampoo and the lavender scent live clean baby gentle moisture tearless shampoo and wash pipette baby shampoo and wash puristy naturals baby shampoo and wash in the citrus grove scent pure adore baby all-in-one baby wash with organic aloe vera and then last but not least shea moisture raw shea chamomile and argan oil baby wash and shampoo with frankincense and myrrh sounds biblical i these are bad products because personally i lot of these products i love the babo botanicals baby shampoo and i also love the ever eaten baby shampoo i use them to wash my hair and my face i have used them they but the claim that they false they have ingredients of petrochemical origin at least by this analysis what better audience to fearmonger to than parents caregivers of young children nobody wants to put a cancer-causing toxin on a baby however there is zero evidence of any harm to human health from putting petroleum-derived ingredients on the skin whether it be my favorite petrol autumn or mineral oil another favorite or liquid paraffin these ingredients are actually helpful for the skin there reason to be fearful of these ingredients i know what you that these companies can get away with making this kind of claim uh when their products were found to actually have ingredients of petrochemical origin well it products cosmetic products they are not regulated as drugs and these claims are not regulated so i am pointing this out to you guys because there are a lot of claims that brands make about their products that mean nothing this is one such example petrochemical free they don petrochemical free they just have to look at the ingredients and say well there in this we didn jelly in this so it must be petrochemical free but they this group did just to prove a point that there you know the results are telling that 100 of these products actually do have ingredients of petrochemical origin where does it come from if they putting it in there and they come from i did not know this but apparently mineral oil is used by farmers and has been used by farmers for eons as a pesticide and miticide to treat plants and it pesticide for organic farming so a product can use organic plants that were treated with mineral oil and it that that then makes its way into the skin care product also many of the many of these products as you noted from the list do have fragrance it the botanic extracts in the fragrance were plants that were treated with mineral oil as a pesticide or you know miticide many people want to avoid petroleum derived ingredients in skin care products because petroleum is a non-renewable resource however more than 50 of the ingredients that are used in cosmetics are derived wholly or in part from the petroleum industry so it altogether and seeking out products that are free of petrolatum mineral oil liquid paraffin is unlikely to make much of a difference products are transported in vehicles that are fueled by petroleum-based ingredients gasoline and they are likely stored in plastic containers in a warehouse somewhere another petroleum derived ingredient so it impossible to avoid this and i know people who are you know trying to minimize harm to the environment they realize that they can all possible issues but going out of your way to avoid mineral oil liquid paraffin or petrolatum it making much of a dent given that over 50 percent of ingredients in skincare products are going to be some sort of byproduct from the petroleum industry in my opinion and this is just my opinion if you want to minimize the use of this keep your skincare routine very simple minimize the number of products that you use i mean that would be my tip and i don fault the consumer for trying to choose products that have the least impact on the environment where i have issue is when i go into target or go into any store and i see shelves upon shelves upon shelves of skincare products new brands launching 10 15 20 products all at once under the guise of being eco-friendly and you know using the claims of petrochemical free to lure consumers in thinking that they are choosing products that are going to have a better footprint on the environment when as hopefully i it as i said at the beginning of the video mineral oil liquid paraffin and petrolatum they have tremendous benefit for human health i mean medicinally speaking there are numerous uses of these ingredients with zero evidence of any harm to human health but where these clean beauty organizations start their fear-mongering is they leave out a tiny detail and that is the purification and the grade of the mineral oil in the case of skin care products there are different grades just like there are different grades of fuel there are different grades of mineral oil you have technical mineral oil which is what is used by machinists to lubricate engines and things like that and there with technical mineral oil and there is an association of an increased cancer risk in machinists compared to the general population thought to be due to exposure to technical mineral oil perhaps however that is technical mineral oil there is no technical grade mineral oil and any skin care personal care product medical grade product nothing like that that you are going to be putting on your skin then you have cosmetic grade mineral oil which is purified and any potential harmful compounds are completely removed from cosmetic grade mineral oil now some people worry that the purification of cosmetic grade mineral oil is not good enough and some people worry that cosmetic grade mineral oil still can be irritating to the skin but one up from that is actually pharmaceutical grade mineral oil which is as pure as pure can be it is pharmaceutical grade or usp grade mineral oil it is what is in prior for my cold dead hands vaseline a wonderful product for numerous skin issues etc it is what is used in the medical field what bothers me the most about the fear-mongering around petroleum-derived ingredients and skin care is petroleum-derived ingredients like vaseline for example are some of the most effective and affordable no-nonsense products this is you know maybe a few bucks and this is the brand name vaseline you can go and get generic brand vaseline it less expensive you don the brand name of vaseline yeah i mean for a household that is on a very strict budget doesn what this is something that really can go a long way as far as meeting the needs of skin care you know in certain urban areas there is a higher incidence of really bad eczema eczema that is really refractory to treatment and in these urban areas tend to be associated with lower financial means this is something that can really help those people with eczema and young children with eczema who really don resources to go by babo botanicals and truthfully as a dermatologist i would recommend this over any of those clean green beauty products any day for a young child with eczema to put on the skin of young children 100 would recommend that over anything else because of its track record of safety efficacy and affordability it product the other concern about um petroleum derived ingredients that i hear a lot of times is that they clog pores and there either human studies fail to substantiate the claim that mineral oil or petrolatum liquid paraffin clog pores of course any ingredient left on the skin for a prolonged period of time you know in theory could aggravate acne by trapping dirt and whatnot on the surface of the skin but i really think it call out mineral oil or petroleum-based ingredients for doing this when a as i said there that they actually do that in human studies and b you could make that claim then for any skin care product any skincare ingredient sits on the surface of the skin whether it be a natural plant-derived wax lipid an oil a plant oil you know jojoba seed oil you could make that argument really for anything that you put on your skin that if you don cleanse the skin and it stays on there it could trap dirt into the pore for many people with acne or really oily skin they do find that products that contain petrolatum or mineral oil feel greasier and they feel like it makes them look shiny that which case you have another ingredient set that clean beauty loves to fear monger silicones which are alternatives that what and silicones don heavy feel on the skin and they create they allow for the better evaporation of sweat off the surface of the skin as opposed to mineral oil or petrol autumn and therefore they have a shine and anti-shine effect so that is why you know for people with oily acne prone skin oil-free products are a good choice because they feel better they look better but not because mineral oil or any of these ingredients actually clog pores all right guys you know i love exposing the clean beauty and marketing lies for what they really are you know baseless claims i hope this video was helpful to you if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen and subscribe i guys tomorrow bye [Music]

TOP 5 ANTI-AGING SKIN CARE INGREDIENTS| Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYCdaKcDxY	Dr Day	well hey guys in today to be sharing with you my top five anti-aging skin care ingredients these are ingredients to incorporate into your skincare routine to prevent and minimize the visible signs of photo aging things like age spots sunspots uneven skin tone hyperpigmentation fine lines wrinkles and skin sagging today with cerave so thank you cerevi for sponsoring today number one goes without saying coming for me is sunscreen why sun is responsible for the majority of skin aging if you your skin from the sun then you need to start absolutely today sun damages our skin in a variety of ways and it exposed to when you sun that comes through window glass uva rays also plays a major role in aging our skin it activates something called matrix metalloproteinase enzymes which chew up collagen and that is why we get wrinkles and fine lines it also plays a major role in up regulation and abnormal pigment production that leads to dark spots and sunspots and ultraviolet radiation causes destruction to the dna and your skin cells and that is really what lays the groundwork for skin cancer formation down the road wearing sunscreen can minimize the burden of those dna mutations can reduce the activation of those enzymes that chew up your collagen and can also allow your skin to recover and to heal from things that have led to hyperpigmentation people don actually suppresses the immune system that circulates around in your skin and cleans up messes and by messes i mean things like dna damage and uneven pigment that the skin and left a stain on the skin if you sunscreen i highly recommend a favorite of mine the cerave hydrating mineral sunscreen spf 30 sheer tint this is a 100 mineral sunscreen it basically creates a barrier on the surface of the skin to protect you from those ultraviolet rays it also is very hydrating and helps keep the skin moisturized allowing for hydration to stay in your skin and it helps protect you from irritating things getting into the skin it also has ceramides in it as do all of cerave have ceramides and ceramides are fats that are naturally present in our skin barrier but as we get wiser we don ceramides and we don readily and therefore we to water loss and dryness and irritation and that in combination with uv plays a major role in skin aging and loss of skin function if you sunscreen you know that they can leave a white cask what has always impressed me the most about the sunscreen is that the tint really offsets that white cast that you often get with a mineral sunscreen it the skin and it really leaves your skin looking smooth hydrated and glowy this product provides all-day hydration and it looks good it feels good if a sunscreen doesn you going to work this product was developed in collaboration with dermatologists it it sunscreen to keep your skin healthy and protected from those damaging uv rays all right ingredient number two is one that you want to incorporate into your routine conservatively and that is glycolic acid glycolic acid is an alpha hydroxy acid which is a family of chemical exfoliants and glycolic is the smallest it penetrates the skin most deeply and exfoliates the skin as a result it smooths out the surface of the skin lifts up discoloration and ultimately ends up smoothing out fine lines and wrinkles anytime you slough away the top dead layer you smooth out the surface and that really gives your skin that radiant healthy glow glycolic acid works by dissolving the glue between skin cells because it helps slough off those dead dry heaped up skin cells on the surface it actually ultimately improves the moisture retaining ability of your skin and by smoothing everything out it really allows your products to lay on the skin better and your moisturizers to help keep the skin hydrated better because they go on more evenly glycolic acid can really also help to accelerate the rate of clearance of uneven skin tone hyperpigmentation and sunspots and with long-term use it can boost up collagen production which is going to firm the skin and smooth out wrinkles and fine lines you want to be conservative however with glycolic acid products using them only a few times a week i recommend doing a test spot first and only use it a few nights a week glycolic acid will make the skin a little bit more sensitive to the sun it is estimated that your skin remains sensitive to the sun up to 24 hours after wearing glycolic acid so all the more reason to be really aggressive with the sunscreen and the sun protection by wearing broad brimmed hat and avoiding being outside for a long time during peak exposure times and you know honestly if you are going on a sunny beach vacation of course rain in all of your sun protection but i would say lay off the glycolic acid in those cases because of the increased sun sensitivity now if you have a deeper skin tone a lot of people worry that glycolic acid may not work for them because as i said it can cause irritation and any time there irritation in the skin that actually can worsen uh hyperpigmentation of people with deeper skin tones it mention another ingredient in a moment for exfoliating that is often a better safer choice for people with deeper skin tones now glycolic acid can be found in an array of products over the counter peels pads toners lotions i have reviewed many of these here on the channel so if you interested in incorporating glycolic acid into your routine just search my channel dr dre alpha hydroxy acid or dr dre exfoliating and you need to ingredient number three is a cosmeceutical workhorse in my opinion niacinamide or vitamin b3 this is an antioxidant it can help reduce the burden of oxidative stress in the skin by scavenging free radicals that are generated from exposure to sun pollution not only that niacinamide applied to the skin can help in reducing redness and it can help in reducing hyperpigmentation so it if you are looking to fade sunspots age spots uneven skin tone unlike many other ingredients that address hyperpigmentation it doesn doesn skin cell turnover so it doesn with the risk of dryness and irritation it and actually helps improve the function of the moisture barrier of the skin uh so it has that added benefit as well it evidence that niacinamide can help reduce skin yellowing which is a consequence of photo aging it incorporate niacinamide into your skincare routine you favorite moisturizer of mine is the cerave pm facial moisturizing lotion this is really lightweight very comfortable it and dry skin and it has niacinamide in it to help calm down that redness as well as the three essential ceramides which is really important because as i said earlier when we as we get wiser our skin starts to make fewer ceramides and we so this is a great product for addressing those needs don well keep the neck skin hydrated and moisturized and then you get those benefits of niacinamide there as well niacinamide is also great because it helps your skin barrier function better long term and in reducing what water loss loss of water out of the skin is a major driving force for irritation a lot of skin problems and with age we become more vulnerable to water loss out of the skin ingredient number four is one that you may not think of salicylic acid or bha typically people think of this as an acne ingredient because it is but it is a chemical exfoliant but unlike glycolic acid which i mentioned earlier salicylic acid is oil soluble glycolic acid is water soluble but salicylic acid is oil soluble so what that means is that it really likes oily areas and it really likes to get down in the pore and help to exfoliate the pore as we get wiser we may notice that our pores become more prone to clogging apart part of why that happens is that with age we lose some of the surrounding supportive framework around the pores so it dilates it exfoliates the skin and it can really help in improving dark spots hyperpigmentation and it is anti-inflammatory um in contrast to glycolic acid which i mentioned earlier salicylic acid is far less likely to cause irritation so i recommend it for people who have a deeper skin tone it risky than glycolic acid and offers many of the same benefits of increasing skin cell turnover removing sun damaged skin cells smoothing out the surface of the skin but it also kind of gets down into the oil gland to exfoliate the the oily surfaces similar to glycolic acid because it smooths and exfoliates that top dead layer your skin will appear brighter when you use it using a acne face wash with salicylic acid will get you these results you just have to stay consistent with it or you could use a levon salicylic acid product again because this is exfoliating the skin it can make you more prone to dryness so make sure you are using a moisturizer how frequently should you use salicylic acid you can actually use it a little bit more frequently depending on how well you tolerate it up to twice a day actually including levon forms of salicylic acid last but not least arguably the most evidence-based ingredient for anti-aging aside from sun protection is retinol retinol is a form of topical vitamin a that can exfoliate the skin minimize the look of fine lines and wrinkles and with long-term use can boost up collagen production in the deeper layers of the skin it also can help in removing sun damaged skin cells and it can help in improving hyperpigmentation unlike glycolic acid retinols do not make your skin more sensitive to the sun in fact using a retinol in conjunction with sun protection during the day actually can make your skin better able to handle the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation just by how retinols work in helping cell differentiation now they can be irritating in the beginning so check out my tips on starting a retinol i have a videos on that i have videos on retinol for sensitive skin how to incorporate it definitely check those out two retinols that i have recommended in numerous videos that i highly recommend by sarah b are there skin renewing retinol serum or for those of you with acne prone skin the resurfacing retinol serum this retinol serum is great for people who just want to incorporate a retinol into their skin care routine for the anti-aging purposes it shea butter which actually will help in reducing some of that dryness and irritation that can accompany retinols and it will help with redness hyperpigmentation and have the anti-aging benefits that niacinamide does now the resurfacing retinol serum is a good one for people who have acne that tends to heal with a dark mark because it also incorporates a licorice root into it which has the additional benefit of helping to reduce redness as well as hyperpigmentation but both of these are very good products if you are interested in incorporating a retinol i would highly recommend these all right guys those are my top five anti-aging skincare ingredients but the real secret here is that when it comes to anti-aging skin care it you know smoother more glowy skin it actually about protecting the health of your skin long term it health these ingredients can help your skin stay healthy long term especially the sun protection exciting news modern life has made it so that we live a long time when you get into your 80s and 90s you want your skin to still be functional and to be healthy and keeping keeping that irritating stuff out keeping the moisture in and protecting you from the outside world that is its function so these ingredients can really help keep it healthy long term that is the goal and looking better is just kind of an added benefit so i hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you cerevi for sponsoring today video if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don i

The BEST ANTI- AGING SUPPLEMENT FOR SKIN| Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3xs7Ox0tL4	Dr Day	well hey guys in today to be talking all about the best supplement for skin if you new here welcome my name is andrea i dermatologist and i would subscribe to my youtube channel and hit the thumbs up it really helps my videos out a lot side note i got a new microphone so comment below how you like the audio is it worse is it better let me know i still have my old microphone so we can go back to that if this doesn getting into the topic of today if you go into a target a health food store chances are you gonna be hit in the face with a wall of supplements promising smooth shiny clear radiant skin but nine times out of ten those supplements are nothing more than expensive candy now i supplements for skin hair and nails on this channel including hyaluronic acid and collagen so make sure you check out those videos i in the description box if you are at all interested in those supplements i biotin i mean a lot but today i telling you about something that actually works to help the health of your skin long-term and potentially ward off many of the visible signs of photo aging things like wrinkles fine lines and sunspots what is this magic ingredient it goes by the name polypodium derived from a fern actually it is a potent antioxidant that can be taken as a dietary supplement to reduce free radicals in the skin that are generated from the sun now in contrast to the sea of antioxidant supplements on the market polypodium actually has a decent body of literature too supported to use for reducing sun damage if you didn already know uv rays from the sun are pretty harmful to your largest organ system your skin they damage the dna and the skin cells they lead to a lot of inflammation unfortunately they also suppress the immune system that circulates through your skin and you know kind of helps remove any bad actors things like pre-skin cancers uv rays lead to upregulation of enzymes that chew up your collagen and they themselves directly destroy the collagen as well uv rays are so destructive to your skin that many of your skin cells unfortunately just give up the ghost quite literally they go through a process known as apoptosis which is programmed cell death and that in and of itself generates a lot of inflammation taking polypodium can actually reduce all of these outcomes of uv exposure polypodium is not a substitute for sunscreen and sun protective clothing and sun protective behaviors taking polypodium is not a license to go outside and sunbathe it will not keep you protected it merely helps in conjunction with sun protective behaviors and sunscreen lower the burden of damage that happens in your skin as a result of uv exposure from the sun benefits of taking polypodium include warding off and preventing or minimizing the visible signs of sun damage things like dark spots fine lines wrinkles hyperpigmentation coarse skin texture yellowing of the skin and enlarged pores i know a lot of you guys out there deal with hyperpigmentation whether it be from a pimple that healed or maybe you have that condition melasma which if you have that you know it really leave you feeling defeated even with the best sun protection sunscreen sun protective behaviors it still can be really stubborn there is promising evidence that polypodium supplements along with the sun protective behaviors can actually get you better results in terms of improvement of the severity of your melasma so that is really encouraging another frustrating condition to cope with is a sun sensitive disease known as polymorphous light eruption polypodium supplements can also help those folks as well by helping improve the burden of damage that happens upon exposure to the sun if you take this supplement you still have to protect your skin from the sun it will not protect you and prevent a sunburn but if you do happen to get sunburn it may actually lower the overall burden of damage in the skin now it supplements unlike medications they not regulated by the fda so that is something that you always have to bear in mind whenever you taking a supplement it the quality of the supplement is not something that regulated i always suggest people look for third-party testing of supplements for example nsf certification my recommendation is the brand heliocare because the only ingredient in heliocare is actually polypodium heliocare is just a brand name and it is third party tested how do you take it well it comes in a 240 milligram pill ideally you take it in the morning if you are going to be out in the sun you want to make sure that you have it in your system at least 30 minutes before you go outside that way it has time to absorb and be in your system to help you out when you go on the sun side effects with polypodium are pretty rare most common side effects are going to be a little bit of gastrointestinal upset maybe you feel a little bit bloated nauseous or you can have itch with polypodium supplements but do you have to take them every day you don every day indefinitely but you might want to focus on taking them during the sunnier months especially if you like to vacation at the beach or you like to go hiking or maybe instead of the sunnier months maybe in the winter time you vacation somewhere or go somewhere or live somewhere where they people don get a ton of uv exposure now this video is not a recommendation that everybody go out and take polypodium supplements i encourage you definitely before ever taking any supplement whatsoever to always always discuss it with your healthcare provider your doctor why well some supplements might interact with any medications that you might be on when it comes to polypodium we know it safe in adults and again as i said very few side effects no adverse you know dangerous side effects but we don this supplement in young children or in pregnant women or in women who are breastfeeding i like to think of this as another piece in the sun protection package and an add-on if you will not essential but in certain circumstances definitely can be helpful for example if you who spends a lot of time working outdoors maybe that you just like spending a lot of time out outdoors and if you deal with melasma or hyperpigmentation and you best with the sunscreen and sun protective clothing you those sun protective behaviors adding this on might get you res you know a little bit more improvement or improvement faster just because you have something else on board to mop up all of the all of the spillover if you will from what sunscreen and sun protective clothing and your behaviors are not capturing i also think this is a really good thing to consider if you have polymorphous light eruption so this supplement can inhibit the generation and release of those free radicals that happen when you are exposed to the sun destroys your collagen and leads to wrinkling and fine lines so you can imagine taking this supplement has the potential to reduce the formation of those wrinkles now it wrinkles that you already have when it comes to sun protection you can rely on one method it needs to be an all-inclusive package i view this supplement as an add-on but not necessary you may find however that you want the add-on in certain circumstances namely when you going to be spending a lot more time outdoors or if you have melasma or deal with hyperpigmentation or if you have a photosensitive condition when it comes to sun protection i like to think of it similar to how i stay safe when i drive my car i wear a seat belt but wearing a seat belt alone is not enough you have to follow traffic rules stop at stop signs look both ways you don influence of alcohol or other substances and you drive a car that is in good working order and moving along with this analogy you could view this supplement as when you buy a car obviously all of these things that i just said are what you or what are going to keep you safe but the dealer may try and get you to think about some additional safety feature add-on that can view helio care this is not a substitute for sun protection and definitely discuss it with your healthcare provider before just taking a supplement so hopefully this video was helpful to you guys comment below have you taken heliocare or polypodium supplements if so let me know how it went and if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don i [Music] you	Success
HOW TO USE LACTIC ACID | The Ordinary & MORE FROM SKINSTORE.COM | Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gr86AvAkmMA	Dr Day	well you guys in today to be talking all about lactic acid a skin care ingredient that has many benefits i those benefits are i talking about how to choose products with lactic acid for your given skin concerns and i highlighting some of my skin care product favorites that contain lactic acid today with skinstore.com you guys know i like to get skin care products on their website really reliable fast delivery excellent quality they have a great selection and they really good sales and i have a discount code for 25 off many of their products including some that i in today skin care ingredient in the family of ingredients known as alpha hydroxy acids you may have heard of glycolic acid another alpha hydroxy acid lactic acid differs from glycolic acid in that it intense in terms of its exfoliating and therefore it offers some unique advantages in contrast to glycolic acid it tends to be better tolerated by those who have dry and or sensitive skin like all alpha hydroxy acids it soluble this is in contrast to salicylic acid which is oil loving rather than water soluble and therefore tends to localize within the pores lactic acid it it of many metabolic processes if you ever worked out really intensely and you feel sore afterwards you have lactic acid to thank for that it also can be made from a variety of sugars like glucose sucrose and it milk as a matter of fact cleopatra was rumored to have used sour milk to her skin to keep it looking soft radiant youthful and to remove sun damage because it naturally present in your body it actually an ingredient that use in pregnancy so if you conditions that i today can feel safe using lactic acid first and foremost when you alpha hydroxy acids including lactic you exfoliating exfoliating and that correct lactic acid is a good ingredient for exfoliating the surface of the skin it helps to smooth out that dead layer and allow for better penetration of other ingredients it does this by dissolving the glue between skin cells the ability of a lactic acid to exfoliate your skin is dependent on a few factors it has to do with the concentration of the free acid that not necessarily reflected in the percentage of the product what that has to do with is how the product overall is formulated and its ph the amount of exfoliation you get is also dependent on the volume of product that you use and it contact you appeal products tell you to only leave the product on for 10 minutes to not go too deep not be too excessive whereas other products they guide you to use the product a couple of times a week or maybe even daily that reflected in how the product overall is formulated so you can blanket answer for how frequently should i be using lactic acid in my skincare routine it the product overall so make sure you read the instructions for example you all know i lactic acid 10 plus ha this product you really only need to use at most once a day as instructed now they have other products from the ordinary that have lactic acid in it that tell you to only use it maybe one to two times a week and the benefits that you product like this are smoother skin and better skin texture as it and smoothing out that top dead layer not only will it allow for better penetration of your skin care products but it also will allow for better moisture content in the skin allowing for the enzymes in the moisture barrier to function optimally ultimately that going to also improve skin texture this has hyaluronic acid in it which is going to also help with that moisture retention piece of things using a product like this also can be beneficial for improving the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines and using lactic acid long term on a consistent basis actually can do more than just exfoliate the top dead layer of the skin it can begin to stimulate collagen production in the deeper layers of the skin so you can get a wrinkle smoothing effect with a product like this if you use it consistently on a long term basis provided you tolerate it and using lactic acid can help accelerate the rate of clearance of hyperpigmentation so it can brighten up and even out skin tone speaking of hyperpigmentation lactic acid is typically well tolerated by people with deeper skin tones but you do need to be careful because people with deeper skin tones if their skin becomes easily irritated they actually end up getting worsening of hyperpigmentation to be conservative if you have a deeper skin tone but don lactic acid is off the table for you it certainly is still an option another advantage of lactic acid is that not only does it improve the moisture content of the skin by exfoliating all that dead stuff and softening it it softens and allows it to slough off stimulates ceramide production in the moisture barrier and that ceramides are a fatty acid that are essential for the function of your moisture barrier and with age and with certain skin conditions ceramide production it starts to decline a little bit and as a result you prone to not only dryness but irritation and skin sensitivity consistent use of a lactic acid moisturizer can help in not only softening the dry heaped up stuff but in boosting the moisture content of the skin lactic acid is a really really good ingredient if you suffer from that dry skin condition keratosis pylaris because it helps to soften and exfoliate that dry built up bumpy stuff around the hair follicle but it also improves the moisture content of the skin in the case of keratosis pylaris rather than trying to peel the skin all the time select a moisturizer with lactic acid in it and or other hydroxy acids alpha hydroxy acids and i have recently discovered this one by neostrata it resurface problem dry skin cream this is a lactic acid moisturizer it has glycolic acid another hydroxy acid and it has mandelic acid another hydroxy acid it also has polyhydroxy acids which like alpha hydroxy acids are water soluble and help improve the moisture content of the skin they gentle but this particular product i highly recommend if you have dry rough and bumpy skin it elbows does anybody else neglect the skin of their elbows i am guilty of that i forget about them all the time elbow skin is a territory that everybody sees but you and so you forget about it but your elbows can become dry and rough very easily likewise the knees this is a great product for softening that skin and i know a lot of you all deal with discoloration of the elbows and knees and you recommendations for products that will help brighten that up this would be a great choice because it helps increase the turnover of that dry heaped up stuff that look discolored now this product you can actually use twice a day you see how it you day a lot more intense the ordinary product is intended for exfoliating whereas this is intended for moisture and for helping the moisture barrier something you one to two times a day this particular product is also wonderful if you have crepey skin because that lactic acid remember not only is it going to improve and smooth out skin texture on the top but with long-term consistent use can kind of help firm up the skin and improve overall skin texture now it not going to lift up crepey skin no product can actually do that but it can improve the texture overall of crepey skin and kind of smooth things out especially if you have that fine wrinkling that can often happen on the upper arms another plug for a lactic acid moisturizer such as this is for your nails lactic acid can increase the moisture content of the nails i get comments all the time can i recommend can you recommend a moisturizer or a product to help with the nails and the cuticles choosing a moisturizer with lactic acid is a good idea it can help improve the moisture content of your nails and it can help your cuticles be healthier not you know appear as rough and jagged you guys know if you paint your nails and you wear a nail polish non-stop the nail polish actually ends up drying out your nail plate if you polish non-stop for a long time you take it off your nails feel brittle lactic acid to your rescue start using a lactic acid moisturizer it will kind of bring them it will bring the nails back to life so to speak while you a break from the nail polish all right one other thing i want to talk about when we another advantage you know i mentioned earlier on that lactic acid can help in improving discoloration just by increasing skin cell turnover it to help accelerate the rate of clearance of hyperpigmentation dark spots but another advantage of it is that not only does it do that but it will allow for better penetration of other ingredients that you may be using to target your hyperpigmentation you all know a while ago i used the pca skin pigment gel the hydroquinone free formula i documented how i use this i have a video all about it i link it down below but this really helped me in fading a lot of hyperpigmentation when using it i used it in conjunction with a retinoid i can using a dappling at that time or if i had already transitioned to tretinoin anyways the combination really helped improve my hyperpigmentation above retinoid alone which i had been using for quite some time prior to prior to introducing this anyways what is this it has lactic acid in it again that of clearance of hyperpigmentation but it also has kojic acid in it a skin brightening ingredient and azelaic acid an ingredient that targets hyperpigmentation acne redness this also has a variety of antioxidants that can help reduce oxidative stress in the skin that ultimately leads to upregulation of pigment producing pathways so this product for me really was a game changer i highly recommend it do you only need a tiny tiny amount to create a thin film and you actually only need to use it on the areas where you have hyperpigmentation of course it use to a widespread area if you have a lot of hyperpigmentation or big patches say of melasma but you really only need a tiny tiny amount to create a thin film and you can use this product twice a day morning and night if you use it in the morning of course after it has absorbed definitely put on sunscreen that is an essential when it comes to fading hyperpigmentation but when you use it at night after it absorbs apply your moisturizer because again remember from my videos when we go to sleep at night our skin loses more water is more prone to dryness we need a moisturizer so put this on first allow it to absorb get the penetration of those good active ingredients and then apply moisturizer on over it so that is an example of a skin brightening product that harnesses the the power of lactic acid to enhance efficacy now i mentioned the ordinary is lactic acid plus h a earlier but i attention to a skin brightening product from the ordinary that has arbutin in it now arbutin is a good ingredient for improving hyperpigmentation it targets some of the pathways that lead to discoloration this product combines the arbutin with lactic acid they don on the ingredient list it lower percentage not intended really to exfoliate but intended to help enhance penetration of that of that alpha arbutin and like the lactic acid exfoliating product from the ordinary the 10 this also has hyaluronic acid that going to improve the moisture content of the skin the combination of lactic acid plus hyaluronic acid they humectants so they both help pull water into that top den layer of the skin ultimately improving enzyme function and the downstream effect of that is just better barrier function long term this product you can use similar to the pca skin pigment gel you can use this product twice a day on a daily basis you can use it just to the areas of hyperpigmentation or again to a more widespread area you can see how products really differ substantially in terms of frequency of use and that is based on the formulation overall all right i want to talk about side effects of lactic acid probably the thing that people worry the most about is irritation i mean anything that can exfoliate the top dead layer of the skin ultimately can cause some irritation lactic acid is typically pretty well tolerated i will say this if you have very sensitive skin you can expect that lactic acid may cause some stinging for you that is that is likely especially when we 10 strength you likely can get some burning and stinging i suggest as with any skin care product but definitely with lactic acid i suggest doing a test spot first say for example behind your ear or somewhere on your arm to get a sense of the product and how irritating it might be do a little test spot actually also on the skin before the ear just to kind of feel it out before putting it all over your face all at once make sure you follow the directions as far as frequency of use and don fall into the trap that more is better you really don lactic acid at all you just need to create a thin film and to allow for it to to work so don think that you need a big glob i think that getting into a lot of problems because remember what i said earlier that depth of penetration has to do with contact time as well as volume use so using too much volume you can end up with a lot of irritation so you really only need a very very thin film one of the most common concerns that people express to me about reservations when it comes to using any hydroxy acid including lactic is will this cause purging any ingredient that increases skin cell turnover has the potential to cause what basically just the temporary worsening of acne it worsening it the surface of the skin that would otherwise appear regardless of what you do but because you it remember that is a temporary thing it should not last more than a few weeks if it does it likely that your acne is just flaring or that you have developed irritation so getting back to the question will lactic acid cause purging it but it is you know potentially it can because again it does increase skin cell turnover and it formula overall is it a product meant to really exfoliate like a peeling product or is it lactic acid in a moisturizer formulated at a low percentage strength at a ph such that it a humectant and is really just there to improve the moisture content of the skin you see you can all the time by looking at ingredients as with anything in skincare it useless if you are not protecting your skin from the sun it rays to come into the skin in a more focused fashion so you are a little bit more vulnerable to a burn but you should be wearing sunscreen anyways the sunscreen piece is essential especially if you are trying to fade hyperpigmentation all alpha hydroxy acid products do come with a warning that they can make you more sensitive to the sun speaking of sun i wanted to draw your attention to this sunscreen because you know i love talking about sunscreen but this product has lactic acid and i gotten a lot of questions from you all when i talk about this or other products hey that sunscreen has lactic acid is that going to make me peel is that okay to use in a sunscreen if the lactic acid is in your sunscreen trust me it free acid value and is in there acting as a humectant so remember it boils down to formula overall so i wanted to draw your attention to that because this particular sunscreen is a combination sunscreen it and octane oxide so those are the ingredients that are going to protect you from uv rays that will worsen any skin condition that you improve this product is tinted so it has iron oxides and that is nice because iron oxides may offer some additional protection to your skin from those wavelengths of visible light that actually contribute to discoloration hyperpigmentation the hev wavelengths remember hev it radicals and for people with deeper skin tones it can really be you know a stumbling block to getting rid of hyperpigmentation and we found that tinted sunscreens may offer some protection against those blue light wavelengths so for those of you who are seeking remedies to improve your hyperpigmentation whether it be you know you you ingredient hydroquinone sunscreen is essential but also consider a sunscreen with iron oxides a tinted sunscreen because you protection from those pro pigmenting wavelengths of visible light all right can you use lactic acid with retinol with vitamin c with insert your favorite ingredient you know lactic acid can compromise the stability potentially of certain other active ingredients so it but i would suggest choosing products that are formulated with both ingredients all in one because again when it comes to hydroxy acids alpha hydroxy acids it product overall so if you use say for example you use the ordinary acid plus ha and then you applied tretinoin on over it after after you applied this i would worry that this would be that combination is likely too irritating for you um but if you you this a sunscreen with lactic acid then i humectant combining it with other ingredients may get you more irritation so you have to be careful but generally speaking it acid and azelaic acid together or lactic acid and arbutin lactic acid and kojic acid i mean that is that is what is in this pca skin pigment gel that works so well for me um i do recommend however choosing a product is formulated with all that rather than rather than picking and choosing from your skincare shelf and trying to mix or combine or layer too many things together because again at the end of the day it dictates the outcome with the lactic acid all right guys that lactic acid it is a skincare favorite for hyperpigmentation wrinkles fine lines even sensitive skin can often get away with using it just be careful introduce it slowly it may be helpful as well for acne just by exfoliating the top dead layer of the skin but unlike salicylic acid it into that oily pore it is a wonderful ingredient for that dry skin condition keratosis pilaris it uh textured skin and lactic acid is really good for the health of your nails and kind of resuscitating them from those times where maybe you have been wearing nail polish a little bit too long doing the gel manicures or whatever that don to have access to much moisture can really dry them out and make them brittle lactic acid can kind of resuscitate them all right guys that lactic acid i products that i mentioned in the description box and my code will get you 25 off many of these my code however does not work for the products from the ordinary skinstore.com wanted me to let you know that so definitely check these out if you are interested and i hope you this video was informative if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe i bye

video number one is an ingredient that has been around for a long time but it really blew up in 2020 and now pretty much every brand has a product with it and that is niacinamide chances are you long time but what is niacinamide otherwise known as vitamin b3 it is a b vitamin and it has numerous benefits for your skin it can help in inhibiting the enzyme tyrosinase that leads to hyperpigmentation so it ingredient if you deal with discoloration and it is an acne sufferers friend because not only is it anti-inflammatory but it help in reducing oil production and it nourishes the skin moisture barrier it helps to boost up ceramide production and as you guys know from my videos your skin barrier helps to keep water in the skin as well as to keep irritating things from getting into your skin so by incorporating niacinamide and helping the health of your moisture barrier through boosting up ceramides you really can help to not only reduce irritation but overall improve the hydration of the skin and that improve the look of wrinkles and fine lines so you can think of it as an anti-aging ingredient for sure it antioxidant so it can reduce reactive oxygen species that damage dna in our skin cells as well as proteins and lipids and lead to premature skin aging its anti-inflammatory and anti-redness properties make it a wonderful ingredient for those of you who deal with rosacea niacinamide can be used alongside any other ingredient it a common misconception that it can used with vitamin c but that was based on a very very old study looking at vitamin c and niacinamide at high temperatures and in real world use it it alongside vitamin c and it generally well tolerated at most it can cause irritation irritation is a lot more likely using a product that has niacinamide at a very high percentage and that has become increasingly popular as niacinamide has become a more coveted skincare ingredient over the years so you like a 20 niacinamide serum at that level it can be a lot more irritating stick to anywhere from five percent or less of niacinamide niacinamide is already in many moisturizers including cerave this is wonderful for sensitive skin rosacea prone skin acne prone skin mature skin it is lightweight but moisturizing not a whopping dose of niacinamide that enough to help calm down that redness irritation and really derive the benefits of niacin of mine i know a lot of you find that that product stings so in the description box i can moisturizers with niacinamide in them but you know maybe i other videos just to refresh your memory that it can find with niacinamide there are several others out there okay similar to niacinamide the next ingredient is one that offers many similar benefits to niacinamide can be used alongside niacinamide or by itself and that is licorice glizer is a global it mouthful i because sometimes in skincare products it will be listed as that licorice has a ton of beneficial compounds for the skin it has antioxidants that are going to reduce reactive oxygen species that damage dna in our skin cells damage proteins lipids lead to skin aging impair the moisture barrier leading to more water loss irritation compounds in licorice decrease production of the enzyme tyrosinase that leads to discoloration but not only that there compound in licorice licoritan that can help in removing existing hyperpigmentation you get two benefits there as far as hyperpigmentation this is a really good ingredient for those of you dealing with dark marks post acne marks discoloration it down redness uh there is a compound lycoconae it lycoshalcone a is very anti-inflammatory so it for redness rosacea and it for people who deal with acne breakouts having that anti-inflammatory piece on board will help reduce breakouts and similar to niacinamide although we don have the studies like we do with niacinamide it too may help in reducing oiliness licorice isn products it but a product i discovered a few years ago that i love is by this brand it have heard me talk about it it li effector this is a serum and i was elated to see that it herb now because i always had difficulty finding this i would mention it in a video and it would sell out right away and so many of you have started using it since i mentioned it and you love it too you say you benefits in terms of improving redness and discoloration you don too new to the skin care world to know that retinol is a good ingredient for the skin you its anti-aging benefits namely it can remove sun damaged skin cells and with long-term use it can help in boosting up collagen production in the deeper layers of the skin the way retinol works is it gets into the skin and is converted to retinoic acid and that can help in improving how skin cells turn over it can also help in removing sun damage as i said damaged skin cells long-term use of retinol also can help in improving the strength if you will of the skin barrier if you are prone to dry irritated skin even eczema believe it or not retinol can help strengthen the moisture barrier and help reduce flares after a long-term use now retinols do have a reputation for being irritating they lead to a lot of dryness and peeling and a lot of people with very sensitive skin are told or believe that oh they can use that ingredient that not the ingredient it introduce it so check out my video on using retinol if you have sensitive skin you guys know a favorite of mine is going to be differing gel it a retinoid so your skin doesn have to convert it to its active form it and it for all of these benefits that i mentioned but it treatment of acne so if you this is a great over-the-counter option and then there i some time y their rapid wrinkle repair regenerating cream the reason i like neutrogena retinol is they johnson johnson has been working on retinols for decades and they have the most patents on retinols and they have a long-standing track record of retinol formulation retinol sa is what is in their products it stands for sustained action and it release formulation that helps minimize irritation while allowing for effective delivery of the retinol you guys like i said i neutrogena rapid wrinkle repair regenerating cream but they recently came out with the stubborn marx pm treatment this is marketed for people who have acne but it comparison to the rapid wrinkle repair so i thought i would show it here retinol is going to be really useful to you if you deal with discoloration or hyperpigmentation if you have acne it going to help in in calming down the acne preventing breakouts in the future and it improve and prevent discoloration hyperpigmentation many of you with acne also have acne that heals with redness using retinol can help minimize that even though it does cause dryness and peeling and some redness in the beginning long term is actually going to help reduce that for you and for those of you who are looking for an anti-aging benefit retinol is going to be your hero ingredient because it going to remove some sun damage and with long-term consistent use it can boost up collagen production in the deeper layers retinol also is a great ingredient for improving the appearance of scars smoothing out scars and improving the appearance of scars and retinol is also a good ingredient for those of you who deal with stretch marks long-term use of retinol can improve the look of stretch marks many of you deal with sebaceous hyperplasia consistent use of a retinol can help in clearing the sebaceous hyperplasia and preventing future bumps from forming i have a video all about sebaceous hyperplasia so make sure you check that out if you consistent use of retinol can also help reduce the formation and accelerate the clearance of amelia those pesky little bumps that crop up often on the cheeks retinol is also going to improve overall skin texture another ingredient which is my next ingredient that can definitely help with skin texture is urea urea is both a humectant meaning it holds onto water and improves the water content in the skin and it keratolytic meaning it dissolves the glue between skin cells and helps them to shed and it helps to soften and exfoliate dry heaped up skin cells urea is wonderful if you have any kind of dry skin condition especially keratosis pylaris the rough and bumpy skin urea can help hydrate the nail plate and improve the health of the nails and it can enhance penetration of any nail treatments that you may have been prescribed especially if you with nail fungus some people develop skin thickening that appears discolored it people who deal with that they think that it actual pigment it the skin has thickened this notoriously happens like on the elbows and knees especially anywhere where you have a lot of friction it have a video all about this urea is also going to be really useful for improving the look of callus on your feet now urea is available in moisturizers at a variety of percentages this particular product that i numerous videos is the eucerin roughness relief spot treatment this is really good for stubborn dry patches on the elbows the knees the feet i think the percentage of urea is 30 which is too high to use on the face um but you can comfortably use this on the body it also has lactic acid another great ingredient for softening dry heaped up stuff also very good for keratosis pylaris this is also going to be a good product for those of you who have psoriasis it can help soften the plaques of psoriasis smooth them out flatten them out and allow for your psoriasis medications better access into those thick plaques of psoriasis so this is this is a favorite from eucerin and oddly enough when i was scrolling on irb i saw that one of you guys left a review of this a glowing review and you mentioned that you saw it in my elbows and knees video and that it really helped you so i was glad to see that okay the next ingredient is petrolatum vaseline is a brand name for petrolatum you can also find petrolatum and other branded ointments it really reduces trans epidermal water loss out of the skin better than any other ingredient and that help with skin healing petrolatum is wonderful to put on a clean cut so after you get a cut clean it out with some water and apply petrolatum this is going to seal off the wound and allow for the healthy skin cells to migrate in and fill up the defect allowing for better healing it will also prevent the wound from becoming contaminated petrolatum aka vaseline has been shown to be equally effective in comparison to an antibiotic ointment except antibiotic ointments come with a risk of contact dermatitis and they also come with a risk of bacterial resistance so plain petrolatum is superior yeah it should allow a scab to form or dry out a cut scrape if you dry it out and you allow a scab to form that get in the way of those skin cells coming in the wound is going to contract in a way that for scarring petrolatum also a great ingredient for reducing chafing under the armpits between the thighs under the breasts wonderful as a lip balm i currently and the reason it balm is that it doesn else in it many lip balms have common allergens flavorants dyes that can irritate the deli the skin of the lips saliva on the lips is very irritating actually and it pulls more water out of the skin so petrolatum is a great ingredient for the lips and the corners of the mouth i know a lot of you guys deal with angular culitis petrolatum is going to be a hero ingredient for you in those areas wonderful for the delicate skin of the eyelids as well as an eye cream you can safely use it i mean don tiny tiny amount especially at night time when our skin is losing more water petrolatum to the eyelids it eye cream will help in keeping the eyelid skin healthy hydrated and it will reduce penetration of any irritating things that might settle on the skin and try and make their way into your skin and lead to eyelid dermatitis if you have eczema petrolatum it reducing water loss on the skin which you result of having eczema you have an impaired moisture barrier at baseline because of your disease last but not least i you can guess but the multi-tasking ingredient is going to be actually a family of ingredients we course we know that it wear sunscreen to reduce sun damage that leads to skin aging and to reduce skin cancer formation rosacea is triggered by uv exposure hyperpigmentation you know you get a lot of oxidative stress on the skin from uv rays that leads to more upregulation of discoloration if you have enlarged pores well uv rays they damage the supportive framework around the poor it the pores make you more prone to blackheads it causes flares of acne and of course you know as i already mentioned skin cancer is is you know one of the major motivating factors behind emphasizing the importance of sunscreens to reduce the formation of skin cancers even if you have a deeper skin tone it still important to protect your skin from these rays because it the burning rays that people with paler skin types you know sustain a burn that that we are those uva rays that penetrate really deeply into the skin damage collagen and cause all sorts of inflammatory issues for you the ingredients that you know for anti-aging they benefit you if you your skin from the sun and a lot of sunscreen is formulated with zinc oxide which is anti-inflammatory and helps kind of act as a skin protectant so you can appreciate some benefit in terms of improvement in maybe irritation and sunscreens are in vehicles lotions and creams that are moisturizing so you get multiple benefits from using a sunscreen here in several videos i use this is actually one of the first sunscreens i started using consistently back in the 90s it the eucerin daily protection face lotion and sunscreen broad spectrum spf 30. this is a great everyday facial sunscreen it it has zinc which is a mineral active it has titanium dioxide another mineral active and it has some chemical filters in it as well and once you put it on give it a few minutes it really does dry down a lot more transparent and with even less of a cast and this particular sunscreen is very moisturizing but it heavy another favorite brand of mine is vani cream and you can now get vani cream on i herb and i recently reordered because i shared with you in my sunscreen empties video i finished up a two of my favorite lip spf the vani cream uh spf 30 lip balm this is a mineral lip balm water resistant i love it it does leave a little bit of a cast on the lips but as it dries down it almost kind of gives a pinkish glow and this particular product is also great to use around your eyelids if your skin around your if your eyelid skin is really sensitive to sunscreens they burn or sting or cause irritation this is a great one i am really into the matcha green tea these days you guys hopefully my teeth aren all right those are the multitasking skincare ingredient heroes they offer multiple skin benefits and will help you in cutting down on the number of skincare products that you need because let in my videos more products more problems it develop irritation or some kind of issue if you products also you know they start to butt heads with one another and you get pilling of the products they don well you know you know the deal but the other thing is after a while you can all your compliance with these complicated skin care routines it and that encourage you to when you think of an ingredient to address a problem reach for ingredients that have multiple skin benefits and that are low risk of irritation those that i mentioned here their hero ingredients they have multiple benefits all right you guys check the description box i will list these products thank you ierb for sponsoring today enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as

HOW TO USE MANDELIC ACID | The Ordinary, WISHTREND, & MORE | Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SB_Rgk0EQws	Dr Day	well hey guys in today to be talking all about mandelic acid i ingredient is in your skincare products what it can do for your skin and i going to be covering some of the best products with mandelic acid today video is in partnership with walmart you guys know i love shopping at walmart either in store or online and some of my most popular videos are of me shopping in walmart for skin care products what is mandelic acid it acid all hydroxy acids they of ingredients that help to exfoliate the surface of the skin they do so by dissolving the sticky stuff between skin cells allowing that top dead layer to shed efficiently and just kind of smooth everything out alpha hydroxy acids include glycolic lactic and mandelic and if you can be pretty irritating the reason for this is that it penetrates a lot more quickly into the skin whereas mandelic acid is a lot larger it penetrates the skin more in a uniform fashion actually and a lot more slowly so it is a much gentler way to smooth out the surface of the skin and lactic acid is kind of somewhere in between what can mandelic acid do for you in your skincare routine it improving skin texture because it smooths out and helps to accelerate the clearance of those dry heaped up skin cells on the surface of the skin so it just smooths everything out but as it doing that it allows your skin moisture barrier to function better keeping your skin hydrated as a result you see an improvement in skin firmness your skin just looks more luminous more glowy as it helps to release those skin cells from the surface layer of the skin it helps to improve the look of sun damage especially sun spots age spots as well as any type of hyperpigmentation that you might be dealing with whether it be post acne dark marks or maybe you had some irritation that healed with discoloration a couple of reasons why i really like mandelic acid it gentle it you have a deeper skin tone it wonderful ingredient to introduce into your routine for improvement of dark spots and it as are all alpha hydroxy acids actually as you with pregnancy the skin can become more sensitive so things like glycolic acid may actually just be too irritating for you during pregnancy your skin is more susceptible to healing with a dark mark and this is a safe ingredient to incorporate into your routine and as this ingredient is helping to smooth out the surface of the skin ultimately you will appreciate that your skincare products lay on the skin more evenly especially like makeup goes on better and you get better penetration of any other active ingredients that you might be using in your skincare routine so to summarize the advantages of mandelic acid are it helps to reduce the appearance of sun spots it helps to improve the appearance of hyperpigmentation it smooths out and improves skin texture and it can improve overall skin luminosity and skin tone evening out skin tone giving you a more luminous glow it low risk of irritation and it tolerated in people who have a deeper skin tone and it pregnancy of course every person differs in terms of what they tolerate so before introducing this ingredient into your routine i do recommend doing a little test spot on the skin maybe right before your ear so how do you use this ingredient in your skincare routine how often do you use it what can you use it with it ingredient to introduce into your routine and for the most part you can use it alongside any other ingredient provided the combination does not cause too much irritation for you and that is an individual outcome so you kind of have to test it out yourself as always i strongly advocate keeping your routine as simple as possible to reduce the risk of irritation now one ingredient that you would not want to use together with mandelic acid is going to be any form of topical vitamin a whether that be a retinoid that you over the counter retinoid adaptolene retinol serums that you might buy retinaldehyde products that you might buy you don alongside mandelic acid because that combination can be very irritating however you can continue to use retinol at night and mandelic acid in the morning you can use it twice a day morning and evening now again if you using retinol you that at night time so in that case you would only want to use a mandelic acid in the morning but otherwise it can be used twice a day i suggest following the manufacturer specific product that you because it will vary from product to product many products you will notice have other active ingredients in them alongside mandelic acid and the relative percentage strengths of those other ingredients may influence how frequently the product should be used but when you are using mandelic acid or any alpha hydroxy acid because these ingredients smooth out and even out the top layer of the skin and exfoliate all the dead stuff away well the sun can come into the skin in a more focused fashion putting you at a slightly increased risk for a sunburn so it that you wear sunscreen when you use an alpha hydroxy acid product but you it really important that you wear sunscreen regardless so you get my drift now at night time after cleansing the face of dirt oil makeup then apply it again the frequency is going to be dictated by the individual product as far as how many nights you would be using it after that you can apply moisturizer on over it again do a test spot see how you tolerate the given product then as you your routine try just using it once a day in the beginning maybe even every other day for the first week then bump up to once a day the following week and then if you then try using it twice a day what are the potential side effects of using mandelic acid well anything that increases skin cell turnover and exfoliates no matter how gentle can end up drying out your skin if you go overboard and use the ingredient too frequently and that is kind of going to be dictated by you as an individual people with more mature skin where you have a delay in skin cell turnover you may actually tolerate using it a little bit more frequently whereas somebody who maybe is using a lot you know too many other active ingredients maybe has exquisitely sensitive skin they may end up being more prone to dryness and irritation if they use the ingredient too frequently and anytime you exfoliate the skin you want to be very careful of sensitive areas the neck the eyelids you don armpits i know that was a trending thing on tick-tock the reason is that these sensitive areas the eyelids the neck under the armpits anywhere where you have skin on skin contact either the skin there is too thin or the skin on skin contact and friction make the ingredient far too irritating for those locations one thing you may want to do when you when you face is put a little petrolatum ointment vaseline aquaphor to your eyelids to keep the mandelic acid from migrating to the delicate eyelid skin now what are the products that probably why you even clicked on this video in the first place number one is by neostrata it mattifying serum this product not only has mandelic acid but it has a glucona lactone which is a polyhydroxy acid in the description box i a video where i talk at length about what polyhydroxy acids are but as a reminder like mandelic acid they are really really really gentle exfoliants and they also help with improving the health of the moisture barrier so this product has mandelic and it has polyhydroxy acid and the mandelic plus polyhydroxy acid in total constitute eight percent this product is really good if you have immature skin and you texture it dimethicone in it which is helpful for reducing water loss out of the skin but has a more lightweight feel and allows for better evaporation of sweat if you find that it enough again you certainly can apply moisturizer on over it you actually again you can use it twice a day anyways i love neostrata they make really good skincare products with polyhydroxy acids this is a great one a little on the pricey side but it is well formulated free of fragrance pretty minimal ingredient list overall which i appreciate number two is a lot more affordable i a long time it is by a wishtrend it is their mandelic acid five percent skin prep water i like this product for people who have sensitive skin and they want to incorporate mandelic acid into their routine because it has other ingredients in it that help with the health of the moisture barrier this product is also wonderful if you are looking to improve the look of dark spots hyperpigmentation it has some botanic extracts that can help improve that by themselves plus in combination with mandelic acid it going to help improve the look of sunspots and hyperpigmentation just by increasing skin cell turnover and exfoliating the dead stuff away it licorice fruit extract which is anti-inflammatory and helps with hyperpigmentation as well as redness it also has centella asiatica extract in it scintilla is wonderful it moisture barrier recovery and it some good humectants it glucan in it as well as sodium hyaluronate the salt of hyaluronic acid so that the top dead layer of the skin plumping up skin cells and it helpful for calming down inflammation improving skin elasticity this product you can use twice daily as tolerated after cleansing pat it into the skin and then apply your sunscreen on over it or at night time your moisturizer on over it all right number three is by the ordinary it plus ha this is a serum again you can use it twice daily first step after cleansing pat it into the skin apply moisturizer or sunscreen on over it they say you can mix it in with things to kind of dilute it out i always have reservations about that because i think that can end up getting you patchy application depending on the formulation of what you product into this is a really good product as well for improving the look of sunspots hyperpigmentation and as a really short simple ingredient list the hyaluronic acid helps again to pull water into the top layer of the skin plumping up those skin cells and smoothing everything out and then last but not least is for those of you out there who have acne and post acne mark neutralize it is their renewal complex this is a moisturizer this product has two percent salicylic acid that those of you who deal with acne because it helps to exfoliate the pore and it good for improving the look of hyperpigmentation the advantage of this combination for someone who has acne is that you from the salicylic acid but the mandelic acid also kind of smooths out the surface of the skin allows for better penetration of other active ingredients that you may have and helps with clearance of post acne marks so this product is really good in that sense it use it up to twice a day but of course if you at night you you know you wouldn to use them together as i earlier in this video you don use any form of topical vitamin a along with mandelic acid or salicylic acid which this has free of fragrance and again a very short ingredient less all right that guys found this video helpful i did want to update you guys on my hair i know that sounds random but um in terms of i get questions about an oily scalp and you shampoos that i recommend for an oily scalp have salicylic acid it good for oiliness and it can exfoliate some of the flaky stuff away and it anti-inflammatory and i wanted to update you guys i trying out this new shampoo i mentioned it in a video recently but if you missed it it is by garnier it fructis pure clean hair reset this is their rebalancing shampoo for people who have this is greasy hair and scalp if you have oily hair i think you will like this it is good for not only controlling some of that oiliness but it has benefits for dandruff and it also has a charcoal in it which can kind of help absorb some of that oiliness of course it does have fragrance as do most shampoos and conditioners the other thing i really like about this is it does not have methyl isothiazolino and that preservative that and conditioners that people frequently become allergic to so i liking this i amount and i wanted to update you guys on that and the conditioner i using

about mandelic acid a big thank you to walmart for sponsoring today you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don i [Music] foreign	Success
AZELAIC ACID IS UNDERRATED IN SKINCARE *WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW*	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4By-S9xY4h8	Dr Day	you want to talk about an underrated skincare ingredient basolic acid let get into it in this video do a deep dive into the benefits of this magical ingredient what the heck is as like acid azelic acid is a compound that naturally present on your skin and in the foods that you eat there yeast that lives on everyone hello called malassezia I didn azelic acid azelic acid it is a tyrosinates inhibitor tyrosinase is the enzyme in our skin responsible for pigment production it can go into overdrive as a result of inflammation irritation excessive sun exposure and ingredients that put the brakes on that can help fade dark spots acelaic acid is anti-inflammatory it antibacterial and can lower the amount of bacteria within the pore that contribute to acne azelic acid can help inhibit Division and differentiation of keratinocytes all of that is a bunch of jargon to say it can help cut down on clogging of your pores it can help cut down on the formation of blackheads and whiteheads and it it can smooth the surface of the skin so where might one find this magical ingredient here in the U.S we have prescription azoic acid which goes by the brand names azalex and phenicia but you can also find it in a variety of over-the-counter cosmetic products now I know a lot of you guys who live in other countries you prescription strength stuff over the counter without a prescription oxalic acid is a treatment for acne rosacea melasma hyperpigmentation and it shown promise for treating perioral dermatitis comment below and if you ever had that it periorificial dermatitis if you have acne it can help cut down on the number of inflamed acne spots because of its comedolytic properties reduce the formation of comedones blackheads and whiteheads because it and lowers the burden of the acne causing bacteria acute bacterium acnes it mediators are a big driver in acne formation in my mind one of the key advantages of azelic acid for acne is that not only is it a good acne treatment but it also is an inhibitor of tyrosinase as I said earlier and that means it post acne dark spots this is especially valuable for people who have a deeper skin tone that hyperpigmentation so you benefits for the price of one now I mentioned azelic acid is anti-microbial it in my mind of azelic acid over the other treatments that we often gravitate towards to Target that bacteria is that that bacteria will not develop resistance to azelic acid a lot of patients who use azelic acid for their acne they actually report that their skin feels less greasy now there doesn appear to be any mechanism to explain this azelic acid doesn impact the production of oil but people do find that to be the case around one to two months into using it another advantage of azelaic acid for really any condition but here we acne is that it can be used alongside other treatments it can be used with benzoyl peroxide it can be used with retinoids salicylic acid Alpha hydroxy acids you name it you can use it alongside azelic acid it can be used alongside pretty much any ingredient provided you tolerate the combination how good is it though for acne it pretty good I wouldn as many of our other treatments but again it can be used alongside many of our other treatments it is much better than Placebo meaning nothing some studies suggest that it is as good as 0.05 percent tretinoin five percent benzoyl peroxide two percent erythromycin and even oral antibiotics but studies don world issues and they only look for a limited time so all that to say it effective but I wouldn the only thing that you need another major advantage of azelic acid is that it is safe in pregnancy and during breastfeeding some acne treatments are not provided you tolerate it you can use it as long as you want to you don to take a break from it it is safe to use long term let rosacea rosacea a lot of you guys have and many of you also have its cousin perioral dermatitis azelic acid is well tolerated by people with rosacea overall although it can be a little irritating and it can reduce the burden of those inflamed red bumps that happen in rosacea and those inflamed red bumps that are painful and uncomfortable in periorficial dermatitis moving on though to hyperpigmentation and melasma one of the advantages of azolic acid is that it doesn skin now if you have freckles or moles azelic acid is not going to tackle those it is effective however for improving hyperpigmentation that has been brought out by chemical irritation physical irritation or post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation meaning you had something like a pimple a bug bite and it healed with a dark mark azelic acid can help improve that and it promise for being effective in the treatment of melasma although melasma is a very complicated condition it often requires multiple different treatments it almost think of it think of melasma as a chronic skin condition and azelic acid certainly can help but as a standalone it whenever we hyperpigmentation or melasma you definitely need to be protecting your skin from the Sun in order to get the best results because those UV rays they are a major driver for hyperpigmentation so that all sounds fantastic what are the downsides of using azelaic acid well you can have some local side effects it can be drying especially in the beginning it can be irritating especially in the beginning you can have symptoms of burning stinging itch redness when applying it it be applied twice a day but because of the potential for these adverse effects oftentimes it it once a day for the first one to two weeks of using it and then gradually increase to twice daily as tolerated the side effects of dryness irritation sensitivity burning stinging itch tend to subside after around four weeks if not earlier and not everybody has these side effects the dryness and irritation that people do develop with azelic acid if they develop it pales in comparison to the retinization process that we talk about with topical retinoids so if you didn scared of that peeling that doesn really happen with azolic acid I often get the question does azelic acid cause purging what the heck is purging purging is wherein when you first start an ingredient that increases cell turnover it can bring out acne underneath the surface of the skin or it sometimes we see that with topical retinoids in theory azelic acid could do that but uh no it really doesn it exfoliant and for this reason think about it it tolerated and used and shown to be effective and is effective for one of the most sensitive skin conditions rosacea who should not use azelic acid well the prescription strengths of azelic acid they types there 15 azelic acid gel and a 15 azoleic acid foam if you are allergic to propylene glycol then you cannot use these they all have propylene glycolin which helps with penetration stability it humectant has hydrating properties [Music] for the most part it tolerated so I mentioned that you can get azelic acid by prescription at least here in the states or you can buy it over the counter at weaker strengths so which one should you go with which one is better well truthfully the research on the benefits of azelic acid they all done using the prescription strength forms the 20 and the 15 percent now that that you buy over the counter without a prescription is not going to be beneficial I just can extent it of benefits that the prescription stuff has if you have a skin condition rosacea hyperpigmentation melasma acne perioral dermatitis you to your dermatologist about the best treatment azelic acid can be discussed now if you are interested in the benefits of azelic acid from a cosmetic standpoint you like the idea of smoother skin you like the idea of maybe helping to fade some post acne dark marks you like the idea of something that to help with blackheads then I would say the over-the-counter soft is more than reasonable it I can however it effectively gets into your skin the prescription azelic acids so you roughly 3 three percent of the drug that is applied to the skin actually gets absorbed it the gel which makes sense gel Vehicles tend to have better penetration of the active in comparison to creams that why the gel you can get away with a lower percentage but to what extent the stuff that you buy over the counter it going to vary a lot one product that I do have a lot of confidence in because I Choice azelic acid booster as a reminder YouTube has this new feature if you click the little bag icon you can see more details so I Polish Choice booster is in their catalog so you can look at it if you want anyway the Polish Choice booster it has azelic acid 10 percent and uh it also has salicylic acid and licorice root so good for hyperpigmentation and good for acne I feel as though the penetration has to be reasonable with that but I don any studies to back it up there are a lot of other azelic acid products on the market if you find that the polished Choice product is too irritating maybe a very sensitive skin especially those of you with rosacea then try the ordinary azelic acid suspension that option my issue though with the over-the-counter stuff is that we really just don percentages are actually effective and B there from Brand to brand and formulation to formulation in terms of the relative penetration of the active ingredient so I always question like is the azelic acid in this product actually getting into the skin I feel pretty confident that the polished Choice one is again it acid in there helps it penetrate better that I do find it to be a an effective product but the efficacy observed with that could also be related to other ingredients in the product the salicylic acid and licorice root so how exactly do you use these they used twice a day now as a reminder because they can be drying and irritating it just once a day for the first few weeks while your skin gets used to it and those then those irritating side effects subside you can increase to twice a day as tolerated now the 20 cream you going to want to First wash the face and then Pat it dry and apply a pea-sized amount to the entire phase sparing near the eyes after you apply it you to wash your hands and you want to make sure that you don your eyes or in your mouth because it can cause eye irritation so that we tell you to wash your hands afterwards and to not get it around your eyes you can use it in the morning and you can use it in the evening after you apply it it has dried you can put other stuff on top of it you can put sunscreen on over it you can put makeup on over it and if you are using other stuff like tretinoin you can use that either before or after applying the 15 finatia gel is very similar process clean face pat dry apply a pea-sized amount sparing around the eyes wash your hands afterwards use it morning and evening as tolerated and you a note about the foam that phenicia foam you want to make sure you shake the can first and another note about the Phoenician foam the propellants in it are flammable so do not use it and you flame because it could explode so using it one to two times a day is fine here the thing you can use it more frequently than that if you those of you who have acne applying it three to four times a day if you highly motivated may actually help with penetration into the acne bumps again if you tolerate it it can be irritating can be drying and sting and be uncomfortable if that hard it person to person in terms of how people tolerate things but yeah that rundown of azelaic acid as a reminder safe to use in pregnancy safe to use with breastfeeding it treatment for acne and that IT addresses the bacterial component the inflammatory component the comido formation double duty with acne because it also helps ward off post acne dark marks it hyperpigmentation post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation it rosacea and it dermatitis and you with other products any other ingredient you can use alongside azelic acid it doesn I exfoliant because it does it does help to smooth the skin surface so it is a very mild exfoliant be careful if you do want to use it alongside other exfoliants it may that combination may end up being just more likely to cause irritation for you but it that you can like salicylic acid or lactic acid or glycolic acid it just might be more irritating you might want to go a little bit more slowly with adding those things into your routine in my humble opinion for whatever it cream or phenacea the 15 percent gel need to become available as over-the-counter medications here in the U.S because I really see no reason why these should not be over-the-counter medications I don need a prescription to use these we have many other over-the-counter medications that are potentially more likely to have adverse effects than azelic acid it very versatile it has multiple benefits it directed but yeah I just find that like getting phenaceous all over the counter I feel like they could sell it similar to how they sell adapalene relatively affordable evidence-based treatment that would be accessible to a lot of people then the drug stores could have generic versions yeah it would be great it would really be helpful let me know in the comments have you ever used the prescription strength azolic acid or do you use the over-the-counter cosmetic acidic acids there are a lot of them these days let me know if this is an ingredient that you have incorporated into your routine or we video was helpful to you guys on the end slide I on the newer acne medication when Levy so check that out if you has acne and you want to learn more about that treatment but that have to say today about azelic acid if you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe I bye foreign [Music]	Success
PORE SHRINKING TREATMENTS THAT ACTUALLY WORK ?? Dermatologist @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsDSJc-GO8s	Dr Day	well hey guys in today going to be talking about treatment options to improve the appearance of enlarged pores everything from topical treatments all the way to all the different types of lasers that can improve the appearance of pores there are three main factors that contribute to the appearance of enlarged pores increased oil production from the associated sebaceous gland loss of elasticity surrounding the pore third is the size of the hair follicle now there are a ton of things that can affect these three factors with age we lose elasticity in our skin and that contributes to dilation of the poor opening the second of course is genetics third is hormones which influence the rate of oil production and that may be influenced by say the menstrual cycle maybe a certain underlying endocrinologic disorder like polycystic ovary syndrome males tend to have oilier skin and more prominent pores ethnicity can influence pore size as well and sun damage UV rays from the Sun they damage the deeper layers of the skin you lose that supportive framework along with elasticity and that leads to dilation of the poor opening let medications isotretinoin otherwise known as Accutane arguably the most potent inhibitor of sebum production and as a result you can appreciate diminished pores patients who take Accutane and they may also derive benefit from layering on some different procedures to further improve the appearance of pore size intense pulse light can improve collagen production in the deeper layers of the skin it can thicken the epidermis so those two things really can help keep that poor opening quite narrow it also can improve discoloration pigmentation and it improves skin texture the appearance of enlarged pores can significantly be improved by just intense pulse light alone but intense pulse light plus isotretinoin gets you even further benefit likely because intense pulse light is helping to stimulate collagen and epidermal thickening whilst isotretinoin is helping to cut down on that increase oil production those two factors together really help in diminishing pore size another add-on for those who have been on Accutane and appreciated some improvement in Pore size is the 1565 nanometer non-ablative fractional laser this emits in wavelengths that Target the sebicide so those are the cells that make up your oil gland and it destroys them ultimately giving you even more results in terms of improving the appearance of pores but you also have oral contraceptive pills specifically combined oral contraceptive pills that have an estrogen component you see estrogen has a negative effect on sebaceous gland activity and being on combined oral contraceptive pills those which include an estrogen component can certainly help to improve the appearance of pores diminish oiliness and it also helps with the hormonal component of acne another oral medication that targets the hormonal component of acne which also can diminish the appearance of pores and spironolactone it has a anti-androgen effect and ultimately that output from that sebaceous gland of these three medications that we talked about I have more videos that go into detail all about side effects check those out if you want to learn more about these medications I have a video all about the best types of birth control pills for acne moving away from oral medications let topicals things that you put on your skin gotta give a shout out to retinoids prescription retinoids like tretinoin or tazeratine or the over-the-counter adapalene these can certainly help diminish the appearance of pores simply by helping the cells that line the pore behave more appropriately to reduce poor clogging you see when you get poor clogging that inevitably is going to dilate the poor appearance and that plug when it gets exposed to air it oxidizes and turns black that blackhead otherwise known as an open comedone retinoids they certainly can help minimize the formation of those ultimate certainly that has the effect of diminishing the appearance of pores and poor size then you have azoleic acid I recently did a video going into detail regarding the benefits of azoleic acid it everyone treatment for not only acne but hyperpigmentation and rosacea and it very mild exfoliant people who use topical azelic acid they do find that their skin feels less oily and they often will appreciate an improvement in the appearance of pores there research however on azelic acid specifically for improving the appearance of pores but it something that you can observe with azelic acid then you have salicylic acid an over-the-counter acne medication commonly referred to as BHA or beta hydroxy acid and this is a great ingredient for tackling pores because it actually localizes within the pore to exfoliate it but here that pops up everywhere or that you certainly should give it a try because it niacinamide niacinamide I on it washes creams serums shampoo conditioner countertop spray it ingredients as I joke about it it great for hyperpigmentation redness it good for the Skin Barrier it can help reduce trans epidermal water loss ultimately keeping the skin more hydrated but it improve the appearance of pores and to help diminish oiliness possibly because it ingredient though that does not get any air time I just don many products and that is kinetin this is a compound that is actually a plant growth hormone it applied topically it has been shown to diminish the appearance of pores particularly in conjunction with niacinamide again how that works hard to say probably because it and it likely has anti-inflammatory effects it thought to possibly inhibit the formation of advanced glycation and products and if you recall from my videos Advanced glycation and products they are part of the aging process and that wrinkle formation actually is the accumulation of advanced glycation and products there kinetin may help in inhibiting glycation probably because it may help in inhibiting that so that another possible mechanism and the downstream effect of that with regards to pore size is going to be that it helps in that support around the pore to prevent dilation which happens largely as a result of sun damage and the aging process Alpha hydroxy acids these are a little different in comparison to salicylic acid and that they are not so oil loving so they don go to the poor per se Alpha hydroxy acids they do have some benefit for the deeper layers of your skin they can improve collagen in the supportive framework so possibly that is a key aspect of how they may work again there terms of improving the appearance of pores but there is some research to suggest that Alpha hydroxy acid peels can lead to Improvement in Pore size moving away from things that you put on your skin to energy based devices like lasers now in the realm of lasers you have ablative lasers which actually destroy the top layer of the skin in a controlled fashion the epidermis and then you have non-ablative lasers which bypass the epidermis and just Target the deeper layers of the skin less downtime the way fractional CO2 laser works is it ablates the epidermis and it heats the underlying dermis to create micro thermal treatment zones that stimulate healing and recovery and regeneration and repair Pathways that lead to Improvement in collagen and CO2 laser because it collagen and and the dermal architecture ultimately that will smooth out and diminish pore size another fractional ablative laser is the erbium yag laser now in contrast to the fractional CO2 laser this one is a little bit more superficial in terms of the thermal treatment Zone but it certainly can in a very similar way improve pore size as well by stimulating those collagen Pathways but both procedures are ablative lasers meaning they do create destruction in the epidermis so there going to be some down time with that but then you also have fractional non-ablative lasers that heat down in the dermis to stimulate collagen production and improve elasticity ultimately that supportive framework around the pore an example of one of these lasers is the Q switch 1064 India laser then there nanoblade a fractional 1440 nanometer laser effective for diminishing the appearance of pore size it creates little micro injury zones in the epidermis and the dermis to stimulate healing and repair ultimately that going to improve collagen and elasticity as a reminder there research in terms of improving pore size then you have something called The Q switch in diag laser that actually can improve pore size but it seems it real potential seems to be in improving oiliness and that great effect maybe in a younger demographic where the main issue is oiliness governing in large pore size whereas for an older patient or somebody who just has a lot more sun damage and destruction of that deeper layer a fractional CO2 resurfacing laser is likely going to get them better results in terms of diminishing pore size you also have ultrasound ultrasound works by creating little Foci of coagulation on tissues and the end result is stimulation of collagen production and elastiogenesis feeding into that supportive framework aspect of things now I frequency radio frequency actually can improve pore size it can Target uh the supportive framework and improve collagen but it also can reduce sebum output oil output so you get two mechanisms from one treatment so those are the energy-based devices but one treatment that I actually have a video talking about in in detail but we going to revisit it it actually be pretty effective for diminishing the appearance of pore size and the way it it inhibits the acetylcholine receptor on sebicides those are the cells that make up the oil gland and the end result is less oiliness so you get Improvement in Pore size by virtue of targeting the oil production piece of things that acetylcholine receptor on the oil gland it that cell and that oiliness but Botox inhibits that receptor puts the brakes on that signaling and you get less oiliness and you may be wondering like okay I get botox for wrinkles you certain specific areas but you pores everywhere how exactly are you going to pursue BOTOX for diminishing the appearance of porch well there called micro Botox or meso Botox basically involves taking Botox and dilute strengths diluting it out and injecting micro droplets into the more superficial dermis and this actually can have an effect of not only diminishing pore size but just smoothing out the skin surface it improves skin tone skin texture seborrhea but it actually lasts anywhere from three all the way up to seven months okay so that information we just covered where do you go from here in terms of improving the appearance of pore size I suggest seeing a board-certified dermatologist for evaluation no single treatment is going to be right for everybody and when it comes to diminishing pore size appearance you probably get best results with a few different treatments or you might again it person to person if you have acne I of course suggesting a board-certified dermatologist but the oral medications that I talked about as well as many of the top topicals that we talked about they are actually acne treatments taking a step back though another way to think about this is by age for a younger demographic that still has good collagen and good skin elasticity you may want to lean more into things like the topicals that we talked about and then if there acne the oral medications targeting the acne isotretinoin oral birth control pills especially if there is a hormonal issue going on that important for women at least especially if you have an underlying endocrinologic disorder like polycystic ovary syndrome then for sure oral contraceptive pills and or spironolactone both of those are going to address the sebum production which is ultimately going to help improve pore size and then the meso Botox is something that has become popular in younger people just seeing an overall Improvement in skin tone texture smoothness now for an older demographic the oiliness piece of things may not be really what is driving the prominent pore size at all you know with age we don of uh prominent pores in an older demographic it sun damage age-related loss of collagen elasticity in which case sure niacinamide and topicals may be beneficial but here really what you looking for are energy-based treatments that address the sun damage like fractional ablative laser CO2 resurfacing possibly radio frequency because again it does have the benefit of not only improving oiliness but also improving collagen maybe ultrasound energy-based devices all right y that for enlarged pores I hope this was informative to you having prominent pores that nothing to be ashamed of if it bothers you seriously cosmetically and you motivated to pursue something to to change it that to change it and don have to change it you know marketing and ads and things always throwing poor blurringness and all of the filters that people use on social media I think people feel really horrible if they notice a poor and trust me it hundred percent normal to have pores and don like you have to pursue things to change them these are merely the options that are available if you are seriously bothered by their appearance I hope you guys really enjoyed this video you don want to miss this next video that I going to link on the end slate it about how isotradinoa and Accutane can have anti-aging effects so definitely check that out but if you guys like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and

Top 5 Reasons YOU NEED TO USE SNAIL ?? Dermatologist @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prsjN7r6gDc	Dr Day	is snail muin actually worth all of the hype in today talk about five benefits of snail muin and skincare by the end of the video you should have a good idea as to whether or not it is worth incorporating this trendy ingredient into your skincare routine muen is just a term for a class of compounds that are proteins with sugars attached to them and muin is the main component of mucus gland secretions which coat delicate epithelial surfaces to protect them from microbial and physical damage animals produce mucin to protect these delic surfaces and snails produce very large quantities of mucin snail mucin has been harvested and compounds within it identified and it is of interest for a variety of biomedical applications the number one benefit of incorporating snail muin into your skincare routine is simply it is very hydrating it is rich in humectants peptides hyaluronic acid these things act in your skin to improve water retention especially in the stratum corneum Improvement in water retention helps support barrier health and allows your skin to protect you better from the outside world it helps reduce irritation it helps reduce dryness optimizing water content in the stratum corium also improves skin texture by facilitating better Skin Barrier turnover as the enzymes in your skin need water to function optimally but the other aspect of snail muen that makes it of particular interest for hydrating and moisturizing the skin is that it is very slimy it certain extent has a lot of visual appeal at least in marketing but if you that it has this effect of almost cloaking your skin in a thin film that is deeply hydrating some people do not care for this texture but it does in fact envelop your skin and what is almost like a nice hydrating hug and this acts to help reduce water loss from the skin while not being heavy or greasy and while still allowing for good evaporation of sweat so you don overheated but all that to say snail muin is not the only humant based thing in the skin care game hyaluronic acid is readily available in numerous products without requiring snail filtrate peptides are a diamond doen these days then you have glycerin which is a very inexpensive hydrating humectant to help improve water content in the skin to what extent snail muan is any better though than these other humant that are readily available on the market remains to be determined now many of the studies using topical snail muin for the skin do compare it to a control vehicle and show Improvement above and beyond the control vehicle but still to what extent snail muen compares to other humectants that are readily available in skincare it hard to say for sure ultimately it probably boils down to the formulation overall but it mind that it Market snail M because it bizarre it a Fascination aspect to it but objectively speaking to what extent it any better than any other humant I think we really do need more research so don get too swayed into thinking that this is going to be a GameChanger it may make no difference in your skincare routine another ingredient that I think could compete with snail mu depending on the product formulation is something called polyglutamic acid I have a video all about this ingredient and I like it too because it that kind of slippery consistency to it that cloaks the skin and reduces water loss without being heavy or greasy I would really love to see some comparisons between polyglutamic acid and snail muin to see like I don maybe they suspect perhaps that experienced products with polyglutamic acid they do have that slippery slimy cloak your skin Effect one thing about polyglutamic acid like snail mucin is I do think that these are more costly ingredients for manufacturers and maybe more difficult to Source all that to say yes this ingredient is hydrating yes this ingredient offers the potential to smooth out your skin surface diminishing the appearance of fine lines but to what extent it is any different than any other hydrating ingredients I do think objectively um it steps back and really critically evaluating what is available on the market in terms of other things that might offer you those benefits but there muin to any of these others in a really rigorous fashion to say which one really is best Advantage number two of snail m in skincare is it has been investigated for uh its effects on wound healing your face is not a wound but whenever we hear wound healing it offers the potential for regeneration maybe leaning more into an anti-aging benefit for helping improve barrier turnover smoothing Out rough texture you know as we get older our skin does not turn over as efficiently so you know there interest there or you know if you a situation where you have used Too Many skincare products your barrier is disrupted you have a lot of irritation you need some healing you need some recovery Maybe something with wound healing properties could help you out one of the most noteworthy aspects about snail muin for wounds is that it has antibacterial properties snail muin from certain species of snails have antibacterial compounds in them that are of great interest in wound healing because wounds quickly become colonized by bacteria that create a lot of inflammation and further slow down the healing process and complicate the wound requiring antibi iotics and a serious issue in healthcare right now is antimicrobial resistance basically the bacteria the microbes they become resistant to the treatments that we have so there is a push there to innovate and develop new approaches to targeting these pathogenic creatures as they can often quickly develop resistance not only do wound infections create a lot more inflammation but they lead to swelling and when the tissue swells the new healthy cells they are not able to migrate into the wound bed as efficiently so that really leads to slowing down of the wound healing process and complicates things bacteria like staf cacus eoli enus Proteus clella these bad boys can really cause a lot of problems for patients who have chronic wounds chronic wounds are not rare they are actually very common there are medical clinics all over the world that specialize in just treating wounds requires treatment from multiple angles utilizing multiple Medical Specialties and antibiotics frequently crop up as something that is necessary due to the infection but again the bacteria that often colonize these wounds they readily become resistant to the antimicrobials that we have necessitating alternative approaches to targeting these infections a compound in snail muin from some snail species is a casin and this has been shown to kill gram positive and gram negative bacteria the other scenario iio for which snail M has been shown to be beneficial for healing is in the setting of something called acute radiation dermatitis that patients develop who are getting radiation treatment for their cancer and radiation dermatitis is a lot like a burn therefore things that help with healing and Recovery you know likely going to help that snail musin has been shown to help uh with radiation dermatitis and it because snail muin has antioxidants in it and can help improve the antioxidants in your skin uh acting through super oxide dismutase and glutathione transferase and antioxidants are necessary for combating free radical damage that leads to slowing down of the healing process we don wounds on our skin but other epithelial surfaces like our gut can get wounded like a peptic ulcer a gastric ulcer and snail muin taken internally has actually been shown to be promising for healing and recovery of G gric ulcers it stimulates the proliferation of fiber blast which is a necessary aspect of wound healing snail M has also been shown to lead to better clinical outcomes after laser treatment for cosmetic reasons namely showing a reduction in side effects like redness burning and stinging but if you are someone shopping through Target Sephora Ulta Walmart the drugstore and you see snail muin you know you shopping for skincare you probably don have one of these medical conditions that there right like you don chronic wound so to what extent these studies and and these biomedical applications apply to the everyday consumer that important to keep in mind benefit number three falls into the territory of you know anti-aging but by that I mean Improvement in the appearance of wrinkles is it actually going to remove wrinkles is it actually going to improve collagen production who knows that has not been examined a research study demonstrated that participants who applied snail muin around the eyes daily for 12 weeks showed a significant Improvement in the appearance of wrinkles compared to Placebo and Placebo was used on the other half of their face so they did the snail to one eye and the placebo to the other and by the end of the study there was a statistically significant Improvement in wrinkles with the snail compared to Placebo so there a control there for just the benefits seen to wrinkles with just consistent moisturizing and importantly the Improvement in wrinkles was sustained 2 weeks after stopping using the snail muin they didn does suggest that it has some lasting Improvement in the appearance of wrinkles now whether or not that is mediated through changing your collagen elastin in the skin or simply sustained hydration which can have a wrinkle smoothing effect that has not been demonstrated this study just looked at wrinkle appearance they didn go in and measure collagen they didn actually take biopsies and measure any changes in skin thickness in in that way possible benefit number four is one that has only been shown in cells in a dish and that is it has been suggested that compounds in s muin may have an anti-tumor effect namely on melanoma cells what that means though for you a consumer putting it on your skin it means nothing unless you dish I would not hang my hat on anything about this being anti- tumor anti-skin cancer it is really interesting though that for melanoma cells in a dish uh snail muin does appear to have some very um promising effects on melanoma cell biology that in theory later on down the road would be really interesting if we could translate those to human use because melanoma is a very deadly skin cancer that often is treatment resistant we do have better treatments these days than we did you know 20 years ago allowing patients to live longer but the disease is quite deadly and it can be treatment resistant so there need to always be innovating and looking to other ways to approach treatment just like bacteria can become resistant cancer can be resistant to treatment so that same pressure is there compounds and snail muin are promising for anti-cancer potential but when you hear that don on your skin is going to have any sort of anti-cancer benefit for you it certainly not anything that protect you from melanoma or skin cancer the best thing that you can do to protect your skin from skin cancer is to protect it from the Sun and not go in a tanning bed now the final benefit of snail mucin is it is very promising as a vehicle for better drug delivery whether that be topical medications that you use to your skin to treat a skin condition or whether it be something that you take by mouth to treat a medical condition where you need better absorption of a medication snail muin is really of interest in Pharmacology as a as a drug delivery system any medication that is going to be absorbed through the mucosal tract snail muin is really of Interest repairing that uh to to allow for better delivery for example if you are taking a medication that needs to be absorbed through your digestive tract well that that is that is you know a place where maybe snail muin is promising it allows for better diffusion into mucosal surfaces so those are five benefits of snail muen as it literature for you know mostly showing promise down the road for biomedical application but again more research is needed so all I to say like should you incorporate this ingredient into your skincare routine it and it does offer the potential to improve moisture content it does offer the potential to smooth out the skin surface which can have a wrinkle smoothing effect can also improve the appearance of pores simply by hydrating the skin when the skin is plumped up pores appear less obvious personally I can attest to those outcomes I see them myself when I use snail muen in my skincare routine it definitely works in my experience my subjective experience it definitely works snail muen can be used with any other ingredient it going to negatively impact other ingredients it could be used with prescription medications provided you tolerate the combination in theory pairing things alongside snail muin May enhance penetration of certain ingredi ingredients which can be a good thing or it can be a bad thing when you have enhanced penetration of things maybe you get better results but you also may increase the risk of irritation some people do develop irritation from snail muin nothing can predict if that to happen for you but if you snail muin and you found it irritating probably not worth it for you to continue trying to give it a try there so many products out there with humectants and hydrating ingredients stick to something that works for you you having snail m in your routine I hear people on social media especially over on Tik Tok singing the Praises of snail M and they make a lot of claims that I have to side eye and clarify to you guys first of all snail muin is not a treatment for acne some people claim you know oh this cleared up my skin it is moisturizing it is hydrating and moisturizing the skin is very important for people with acne because they do have a Skin Barrier problem often that can lead to more inflammation in the skin and worse in the acne uh and a lot of acne treatments are very drying and irritating so moisturizer use in general is is encouraged for people who have acne the lightweight consistency of of snail mucin may be preferable for people who have acne and oily skin because again it doesn it keep in mind it treatment um in theory you know the antibacterial effects the anti-inflammatory properties in snail muin they may help with acne wouldn surprise me but just know it proven acne treatment the other hyper round snail muin that I hear that is not correct is that it will treat a scar it will not in theory it may help reduce scarring because it but there and it certainly will not remove an existing scar many people on social media also confuse scar with postinflammatory marks whether it be post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation post-inflammatory redness or post-inflammatory hypopigmentation those three things are not scars so I do think some people find that using snail muin over time improves the appearance of those things but those things do often times resolve on their own so don thinking it is the solution for these yes moisturizing is helpful in these conditions to reduce irritation to protect the skin from irritants but snail muin is not going to go in and reverse these things there snail muin as it stands now that is has been established that addresses hyperpigmentation there it that is necessarily going to go in inhibit tyrosinase or you know prevent the spread of melanin to the surrounding skin to address hyperpigmentation in any way so don that anything that is very hydrating to the skin whether it Beil muin hyaluronic acid glycerin peptides anything that hydrates the skin and improves the moisture content in the skin it has this effect of light scattering which improves skin luminosity and overall skin tone and can subtly diminish the appearance of dark spots but as soon as you stop using the ingredients the skin loses that moisture the dark spots they ever go away take home points snail muin it there is evidence to suggest that it has value in skincare um and a lot of people truly do see benefit using it but if you don you find it irritating there are many other hydrating ingredients out there I have a lot of videos on this channel about things like polyglutamic acid hyaluronic acid peptid so check those out you you can put off by the texture uh the skincare Market the skincare industry is packed with plenty of other options to hydrate and smooth the skin so you know don don plenty of other things to buy out there I been sponsored by them but I do use their snail products and I genuinely see a market Improvement in skin suppleness smoothness and hydration when I use them uh so those would be my go-to recommendations but if you want to know how like their Essence compares to uh peach slices another snail product on the market on the ins slate I link up my review of those two comparing and contrasting them in terms of texture and performance and ingredients so check that one out if you you are looking around for snail uh but if you guys like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen And subscribe I to you guys tomorrow bye [Music] a	Success
*BEST* PRODUCTS FOR CLOSED COMEDONES | Dermatologist	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq-AyaIjEM0	Dr Day	how the heck do you get rid of those pesky little white bumps called closed comedowns that pop up on your forehead Elsewhere on your face and body in today with you my top tips and tricks for clothes coming downs I going over what you should avoid if you deal with clothes coming downs and make sure you watch to the end because we going to be talking all things skincare ingredients and the top five skincare products for clothes coming Downs what exactly is it closed combing down closed comedones are commonly referred to as whiteheads that happen when your pores get clogged up with a combination of oil and skin cells that get stuck together some people have a genetic tendency towards oilier skin their skin just makes more sebum and of course sebum oil production is also influenced by your hormones but when it comes to closed comedones one of the main driving factors is the cells that line your pore they kind of don as they could and they get stuck together in a little plug that combined with the oil leads to a whitehead now if you deal with blackheads don of this video because you surprised to learn that the tips and tricks that apply to whiteheads also apply to blackheads blackhead is basically the same thing as a white head the only difference is that that little plug gets exposed to air and turns black and that is what distinguishes a blackhead from a white head comedones are typically painless they don sometimes they look straight on at your face but if you turn to the side you can see little bumps comedones are a skin lesion that constitutes acne now there are different types of acne some people have acne that is very inflamed painful cystic and they get these large nodules whereas other people have acne that is purely comedonal comedonal acne is hormonal acne why all acne is hormonal if you remember back to the beginning of the video when I explained why you get these part of the reason has to do with oil production guess what governs oil production hormones so even if you don have big inflamed cysts there is a hormone tonal component comedonal acne can get a lot worse around your menstrual period if you become pregnant or during menopause because the hormones change in some cases very oily hair care products can aggravate the formation of comedones especially on the forehead and the sides of the face so if you use products in your hair that are like styling mousses and gels and things there is some idea that they get on the skin and form a film that further perpetuates comedone formation one thing that you will hear frequently recommended to always choose non-comedogenic products but I have to tell you there science behind this claim that products are comedogenic the majority of studies that we have on comedogenic ingredients comes from rabbit ear models where it very unrealistic and those ingredients don comedogenic in real world use skin care products May exacerbate comedone formation but there product that predicts if that is going to happen or not when it come comes to skin care products that aggravate this Condition it being said you may prefer products labeled as non-comedogenic because they do tend to be a lot more lightweight in consistency and not feel oily or greasy on the skin and as I said a lot of people who have comedonal acne they have an oil or skin type these products tend to feel a lot more comfortable to them in the literature you association between a more stubborn acne and higher consumption of either skim milk and or whey protein but many people consume milk skim milk dairy products whey protein and have no issue with acne and their acne is not any worse or better eating these Foods or leaving them out I say more research is needed because there are some possible compounding factors in these Association studies that need to be further teased out Association does not prove causation the other dietary factor that plays a role in acne likely is the consumption of processed refined sugary carbohydrates that never eat the these foods but they may play a role especially if that constitutes the bulk of your diet because these foods do lead to an increase in insulin wine growth factor and they are inflammatory insulin-like growth factor is a hormone that can lead to more oil production if you have been subsisting off a processed junk you know regardless of acne or not it not the best thing for you and introducing more Whole Foods into your diet you may notice an improvement although honestly you may not diet studies and acne we need more research the other thing you want to avoid if you have comedonal acne is picking squeezing or attempting to extract closed comedones you anything out and you bring a lot more inflammation and that going to put you at risk for scarring and for worsening of your acne as a whole some comedones are amountable to extraction typically after a patient has already been using a topical or oral medication that is comedolytic and softens the glue between the stuck together skin cells in the pore and at that point once everything is soft then it but I always suggest strongly that you leave that up to the hands of the professionals because the last thing you want to do is scar yourself how do you tell the difference between closed comedones and fungal acne fungal acne is a popular term for something called pitterosporum folliculitis and you right it can look similar to comedonal acne pitterosper and folliculitis in contrast to close comedones has nothing to do with the formation of a plug in your pore but rather it is due to inflammation in the hair follicle caused by malassezia yeast the way to tell the difference between closed comedones and fungal acne is to first and foremost see a board-certified dermatologist but some Clues are that when it comes to closed comedones are typically painless and they are not itchy whereas fungal acne AKA pitterosperm folliculitis is typically very itchy pitterosperm folliculitis you red it she bumps that all look the same or whereas close combinones are skin colored and they painless with comedones in general you may also have open comedones blackheads with pitterosperm folliculitis you not going to have blackheads however be aware that some people especially if you live in a humid tropical environment or you have maybe been on a medication that weakens your immune system some people actually can have both at the same time but again leave it up to the professionals to figure out what exactly you have going on don own diagnostician you probably clicked into this video because you want to get rid of closed comedones how do you get rid of them nothing is going to get your results overnight fast it takes time it takes patience it takes consistency one of these may do it for you or you may need to use one or two alternated in your routine or paired together we get into all that in a moment but many people can clear their comidonal acne and prevent recurrences by staying consistent with a skin care routine that involves products that they buy over the counter without a prescription FDA approved acne medications that you can get without a prescription salicylic acid salicylic acid is an ingredient that loves to get in your pore and it goes in there and it dissolves the glue between the sticky skin cells in the pore that plug it helps break that up and it also helps calm down some of the inflammation now there are a variety of different forms of salicylic acid gels creams lotions moisturizers leave on products I also am a fan of just introducing a salicylic acid cleanser now recently I did a video all about the benefits of salicylic acid face wash one of my favorites is the CeraVe acne control cleanser it has two percent salicylic acid and is fragrance free this also has niacinamide which is helpful for reducing oxidation of sebum and it also has hectorite clay which is going to help absorb some excess sebum from the surface of the skin and from within the pore and then as you rinse off the lava other that that goes down the drain now this product you can introduce into your routine using it one to two times a day as tolerated morning and or evening depending on how you tolerate it many people tolerate using it twice a day just fine whereas for other people that may be too drying you may want to do it just once a day lather it to the entire face sparing around the eyelids because it can be very drying around the eyelids leave the lather on the skin for a few minutes let it really soak in and then rinse it off through something known as co-asservation the salicylic acid in this can be left behind on the skin surface while the other cleanser ingredients are rinsed off along with the oil on your skin so this is a great option and a great place to start some people can clear up and prevent their closed comedones just doing that but that the case for everyone the second ingredient that is great for comedonal acne is a retinoid over the counter you can buy adapaline which is FDA approved for acne and a comidone is part of acne different gel is a brand name but a lot of other brand names out there brand name options even most of the drugstores these days now have their own generic version of adapalene any of those is going to be just fine I just happen to have different gel here now this works different from salicylic acid this is a retinoid so it gets into the skin and it binds to receptors to influence how cells that line your pore behave so that they mature more efficiently and you stop getting those plugs you stop getting those comedone plugs some people are able to use a retinoid like differing gel at night time and that alone helps them to clear up their comidonal acne whereas other people benefit from having this in the evening and also maybe incorporating a salicylic acid face wash one to two times daily I can predict for you what best but I just know that these are options your dermatologist Also may prescribe you a retinoid so if you know depending on your insurance that may be covered by by your insurance so you don for adapalene gel which you can buy over the counter that include tretinoin which I have a lot of videos on tizeritine which I have videos on then there triferitine which I also have a video on so check those out if you want to learn more about all the different types of retinoids out there but yes a retinoid really can help with comedones and you approved retinoid for acne that you can use for closed comedones adapalene but adapylene and other retinoids as you know are not recommended to be used during pregnancy they breastfeeding but not pregnancy check out my video on retinol and pregnancy I go into the reasons why in that video but there you know it you pregnant so I often get questions what an alternative to retinoid for closed comedones now you can use salicylic acid face wash in pregnancy providers you just using it to a small area like your face or maybe your upper chest but retinoids are not so what alternative to a retinoid a really good ingredient for closed comedones is actually azelic acid azelic acid you can buy over the counter or you can get with a prescription the prescription stuff is stronger the research that we have backing up azelic acid as a comedone buster is using the prescription stuff but you can get good results using the over-the-counter stuff one of my favorite azelic acid products is from the ordinary their azelic acid suspension I also like this product from Polish Choice the 10 azelic acid booster with licorice root you can use azelic acid in your morning routine and or in your evening routine technically you could use it three times a day if you wanted to it can be drying it sting but otherwise it tolerated it for rosacea and it ingredient for hyperpigmentation so it has multiple benefits another option that is pregnancy safe for tackling closed comedones is Alpha hydroxy acids Alpha hydroxy acids include things like glycolic acid lactic acid mandelic acid now in contrast to salicylic acid Alpha hydroxy acids don pores if they comedones salicylic acid but they definitely can reduce comedone formation but they definitely exfoliate they dissolve the glue between the sticky skin cells here of from Neutrogena it Boost glycolic acid overnight peel it fragrance free it has hyaluronic acid which actually may help enhance the penetration of the glycolic acid check out my video though on salicylic acid versus glycolic acid I go into more details there about formulation and you know how they really differ so you going to want to watch that if you want to learn more about these ingredients and then last but certainly not least when it comes to treating acne you cannot forget benzoyl peroxide benzoyl peroxide is comedolytic so it cut down on closed comedones it anti-inflammatory and it helps reduce the burden of cutie bacterium acne that acne so it it tackles many aspects of acne including comedones the problem with benzoyl peroxide is that it can be a very drying and irritating but benzoyl peroxide formulations have come a long way they they were this is one from Neutrogena that I it this has 2.5 percent micronized benzyl peroxide the micronized benzoyl peroxide is what helps us be less irritating basically smaller particles of benzoyl peroxide they get into the pore more efficiently they spread out on the surface of the skin more efficiently so they irritating and they do help tackle closed comedones I have a whole video on how to use this by the way so you going to want to check that out if this is something that you are interested in incorporating into your routine I link it down below in the description box but one thing you need to know about benzoyl peroxide is that in addition to being drying and irritating the leave on on forms like that they you know if they come in contact with Fabrics like this black blazer I bleach them so that careful about but you can have benzoyl peroxide in your routine one to two times a day as tolerated while some retinoids are not stable in the presence of benzoyl peroxide adapylene which you can buy over the counter again without a prescription is so you can use adapalene and then you can use benzoyl peroxide together for acne no problem although the combination can be more drying and more irritating than either on its own it may be a bit overboard for purely comedonal acne but for some people it may be what they need to get the results that they so that with you all about for today regarding closed comedones they are a common skin concern comedonal acne and remember if you have blackheads everything I video applies to you too same products same tips same things to avoid all that salicylic acid face wash can really go a long way in terms of helping clear up and prevent closed combing down so on the insulate I All About salicylic acid face wash you to give lots of tips and tricks for introducing this ingredient product family into your routine but if you guys like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don I foreign [Music]	Success
Do Anti-aging Serums Work?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdZyIQV_4rg	Dr Day	hi guys today let antioxidants what are they why are they in everything do you need them or are they just a scam antioxidants frequently pop up across all types of skin care products and cosmetic lotions creams toners Essences sunscreens body washes oh and they antioxidants are substances that combine to neutralize reactive oxygen species preventing oxidative damage to tissues throughout your body that would otherwise contribute to premature aging including of your skin what are reactive oxygen species reactive oxygen species is just an umbrella term for derivatives of molecular oxygen and guess what they are perfectly normal part of your biology however when there are too many reactive oxygen species it can be very taxing to tissues because they generate a Cascade of negative consequences and that is referred to as oxidative stress now your body has systems built in place to handle free radicals but with age those systems can become depleted oxidative stress is when you have excessive reactive oxygen species this can damage DNA proteins lipids and Lead tube cell damage and cell death antioxidants reduce free radical damage preventing damage at the cellular level within the skin they inhibit the inflammatory Cascade that damages the epidermis and the dermis including your collagen leading to premature wrinkling but it oxygen species bad antioxidants good again reactive oxygen species are a part of normal human biology and you want some of them on board because they are beneficial for maintaining homeostasis balance it antioxidants they can be helpful in the situation of oxidative stress but you have to have the right amounts they have to be present in the right place at the right time unfortunately Nuance is frequently lacking in many conversations online regarding free radicals oxidative stress inflammation and antioxidants you want a little bit of inflammation a little bit of stress in the body it is a good thing and it actually is correlated with longevity there behind this and it again your body has its own systems for handling free radicals these include superoxide dismutase catalase and glutathione peroxidase many factors can influence the balance of reactive oxygen in species in the skin leading to oxidative stress ultraviolet radiation not only generates reactive oxygen species by damaging proteins and lipids in the skin but it also depletes your Skin antioxidant systems in addition to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun you also have visible light visible light which is a light that you see with your eyes is responsible for about 50 percent of the reactive oxygen species generated when your skin is exposed to sunlight smoking and alcohol consumption further tips this balance over the edge favoring oxidative stress smoking and alcohol are behaviors that deplete the antioxidant systems in your skin and generate a lot of inflammation and environmental exposures like pollution can create a Cascade that leads to oxidative stress pollutants are particulate matter from pollutants they cause lipid peroxidation in the top layers of the skin and that generates a Cascade that can lead to premature skin aging but also just Skin Barrier impairment and leaving you more prone to skin problems distinct from sun damage you have glycation in the skin which is essentially sugars binding to proteins in the skin this process leaves the collagen in elastin in your skin stiff and contributes to wrinkles as well as free radicals that generate more inflammation with age your skin Thins and the levels of antioxidant systems in the skin if you will begin to decline so your skin with age becomes even more vulnerable to environmental stressors that generate reactive oxygen species you become more vulnerable to oxidative stress also your diet can influence to a certain extent how well your skin is able to handle reactive oxygen species diets rich in fruits vegetables nuts seeds legumes there these these types of foods can help your skin overall in handling reactive oxygen species oxidative stress in the skin can aggravate a number of underlying skin conditions including acne atopic dermatitis hyperpigmentation for example post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or melasma the discoloration of the skin from these conditions is made much worse by environmental exposures that lead to oxidative stress at this point in the video then you shoot I antioxidant skin care then I mean why not right like our skin can only do so much for us you just said that with age these systems start to decline and you know underlying skin conditions that I might be dealing with couldn sounds appealing right it sounds appealing however there are a lot of limitations that you have to factor in when it comes to antioxidants in the skin it here going to put it on my face and it going to help me out 100 guaranteed in some way shape or form so it must be worth it there are a few reasons why antioxidants may be completely useless whether it be applying them to your skin or taking them internally say from a supplement reactive oxygen species affect different Pathways in different situations because of this the antioxidants that you put on your skin or taken internally they may be either a redundant or completely useless for that particular pathway the other reason is the choreography is out of sync with the music in other words reactive oxygen species being generated in the Target tissue in this case the skin they may not align with the antioxidant in terms of when it is delivered to the skin so for example maybe you sunscreen with antioxidants in it in the morning but by the time that free radicals are being generated maybe that antioxidant has already you know been a bystander in some other reaction and it wanting it to be it you know not in the right place at the right time in other words the third and probably more pressing issue is bioavailability do the antioxidants even get into the skin do they even get there to an appreciable level whether it be putting them on the scan or importantly taking them in in supplement form a lot of research on different dietary antioxidant supplements for example suggest that they don to your skin so it may be just that we need to work on formulations likewise antioxidants aren stable in skin care products and antioxidants in skin care products they are under the umbrella of what is referred to as a cosmetic ingredient so they therefore the antioxidants in one Brand good whereas another Brand may not be formulated well enough to really affect much change and as a consumer there which ones are good and which ones aren doing comparison studies on their formulas we just buy them in good faith that they are getting in and doing something for us and because the benefit of antioxidants and skin care may not be something that you visually appreciate you really are operating on good faith that they are doing something I pointed this out before and my personal skincare routine I do use a variety of products with antioxidants moisturizers sunscreens serums and many of them I not sure if it because while it impacting me it microscope all the time and I constantly taking biopsies out of my skin to reassess the collagen quality in my skin if I did that and I with scars and what a mess that would be so we we just don if topical antioxidants are doing anything and in addition to the formulation the bioavailability you also have to factor in the dose you need the right dose just the right amount of antioxidants to really address the issue too little probably not going to do anything too much maybe a bad thing for example research looking at dietary antioxidant supplements actually shows an association with an increased risk of certain types of cancers with certain oral antioxidants in in supplement form and we don the optimal dosing morning evening two hours before two hours after when should these be applied right before you go to bed question mark and what antioxidant should you choose for What scenario for example if you live in a city and you commute in traffic you lot of pollution maybe there antioxidants that would benefit you whereas other antioxidants may be better suited to somebody who is going to spend their day surfing outside exposed to a lot of UV you know maybe they antioxidants or maybe you is trying to fade hyperpigmentation maybe there are certain antioxidants that are going to more specifically address the oxidative stress that leads to pigment production and when you know the the timing of application and again formulation formulation formulation we need good studies to come to a consensus for these different antioxidants as to what the best formulation is for optimal bioavailability making sure it actually gets in because these are cosmetic ingredients you know we don what we and last but not least more does not necessarily mean better I don that throwing antioxidant after antioxidant after antioxidant on things is going to put out the fire of possible damage I do think antioxidants in skin care products have the potential to be very beneficial for your skin for a variety of skin outcomes but I would not lose sleep over trying to introduce them into your routine trying to pick the best one or really wondering what is the best one it no dermatologist can point to an antioxidant on a shelf and say this is the best for example a lot of dermatologists might solve included when it comes to recommending vitamin C serums will point to the SkinCeuticals ferulic one because it does have some good research showing that it actually gets into the skin and affects change but we don showing like how it compares to any other formula on the market maybe there better no one actually going to know that in an objective way they guessing or have their own personal biases it may actually be that rather than having a high dose of an antioxidant smaller doses of multiple different types of antioxidants cocktailed together in a formula optimized for bioavailability and for your specific needs are actually much much better than just Mega doses of any one antioxidant and last but not least what about dietary supplements with antioxidants the recommendation I would give you is to stick to Foods as your source of antioxidants it seems as though antioxidants from your Foods that vegetables nuts seeds I mean almonds are packed with vitamin E that actually I want to do a video as a side note comment below and if you would like to hear more about almonds and their benefit for skin health because I think they you might be surprised to to learn what what benefits can be had from incorporating almonds into your diet provides you don allergy to them anyway guys that I I wanted to talk about for today video regarding antioxidants because it Time and Time Again across all of my videos you know this has antioxidants this has antioxidants but I really want you as a consumer to understand there are serious gaps in knowledge when it comes to antioxidants not to say that they that and keep that in mind when you are you know making decisions about what to buy all right y this video speaking of what to buy on the end slate I video where I go into the drugstore and I shop with you guys and we talk about drugstore products with antioxidants you that one next but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow bye [Music] thank you [Music]	Success
Eat This Every Day To GET RID OF WRINKLES NATURALLY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOhGsFVVmaQ	Dr Day	if I were to tell you there is a food out there that you could be eating to diminish the appearance of wrinkles you right well if so you have clicked into the Right video because that is exactly what we this video don this is not going to be one of those videos it because diet is a lot more complicated than that when we skin it is a very large organ and it is responsible for protecting you from the outside world from all of these environmental aggressors that would otherwise kill us on a day-to-day basis you have your skin to think as a shield against all that nonsense plus it keeps water in your body when your skin as an organ system fails it is life-threatening so it is a lot more than cosmetic aging is a process that is unavoidable it is part of life and it involves the accumulation of damaged macromolecules as well as reduction in the ability of tissues to renew part of the natural aging process you get a gradual loss in structural integrity and functional abilities of a given organ system so whenever you think about skin aging you need to approach it with the mindset of preserving function and form as long as possible because you want that barrier healthy you can think about the causes of Aging in two categories things that are internal to you that you really can like your hormones your genetics metabolism and then things that are sort of external to that extrinsic in the case of your skin ultraviolet radiation from the Sun pollution infrared radiation your diet your nutrition lifestyle factors like drinking alcohol smoking don a reasonable diet and balance nutrition as a measure for preventing aging and prolonging one nutrition is closely associated with skin Health when you have a crappy diet it shows up on your face foods can can be a source of functional anti-aging ingredients and don food as one particular anti-aging ingredient but rather you know maybe a package of potential beneficial compounds and ingredients how might nutrients and foods help our skin out and slow the aging process they can do this through one of three ways when you eat a food it is digested in your digestive tract and absorbed in that anti-aging ingredient can make its way to the skin and serve as a precursor for essential components of the skin they may make their way to the skin and help to minimize reactive oxygen species cutting down on the burden of oxidative damage in the skin that would lead to DNA damage oxidation of lipids that are critical for that barrier function in the epidermis furthermore these anti-aging ingredients from your Foods may also help to enhance your Skin natural antioxidant systems the enzymes there that need to deal with oxidative stress the right food the right nutrients the right anti-aging ingredients from your diet may help those things work better third anti-aging ingredients from Foods may actually serve as cofactors for enzymes that are necessary for how your skin handles and copes with and compartmentalizes environmental stressors that would otherwise age Ed all right now that I have told you all the ways in which anti-aging ingredients from your foods can benefit your skin what food should you consider introducing into your diet provided you don to it almonds almonds are actually rich in vitamin E specifically Alpha tocopherol vitamin E is a fat soluble vitamin it incorporates into the lipid membranes the fats around skin cells it incorporates there and it sits there ready to fight off those reactive oxygen species that would otherwise damage lipids outside of the Dermatology literature almonds is a source of vitamin e having good track record for improving one blood and having a cardio protective effect there milligrams of alpha tocopherol in a 50 gram serving of almonds it almonds give or take but it doesn stop there the vitamin E it cytosterol which is a plant sterol almonds also have squalane manganese magnesium they protein and they also provide fiber and if you didn diet or the Western diet is fiber penic and and we really do not get enough fiber in our diet most Americans at least are fiber penic almonds are a good way to introduce fiber into your diet fiber is really important for our good gut health and almonds are a good source of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and when it comes to your skin lipids are you know vital you know lipids are necessary for barrier function and preventing trans epidermal water loss as well as minimizing the penetration of irritants into the skin and potential infectious microorganisms speaking of skin the skins and the almonds are rich in phenolic and polyphenolic compound the research on the benefits of all incorporating almonds into your diet it limited to the Dermatology literature and for skin and wrinkles it shown in studies looking at cardiovascular health it reduce markers of inflammation and chronic stress and people who are otherwise healthy as well as people who have type 2 diabetes and in people who smoke if you remember back to my video on you know all the ways in which smoking is bad for your skin remember it wipes out all sorts of antioxidants and really leads to premature aging of pretty much every body system consuming almonds has also been shown to have a positive impact on one profile what does the research actually show are there any studies to look at like eating almonds for anti-aging as you can imagine dietary studies are very hard to do but there are some kind of decent ones out there showing some benefits for the skin and 2019 there was a prospective investigator blinded randomized controlled trial looking at the impacts of consuming almonds in post-menopausal women they looked at 28 women who had Fitzpatrick phototype either one or two the Fitzpatrick photo types basically are a way to label you in terms of how your skin responds to ultraviolet light Fitzpatrick one and two are paler skin types whereas five and six very deep skin tones it goes one through six but in this study the women were randomized to get 20 percent of their daily caloric needs from almonds or from a calorie match snack the investigators did not know who was getting what they ate either their almonds or their snack every single day for 16 weeks and the investigators looked at facial wrinkles sebum production and trans epidermal water or loss which is a marker of barrier function at the end of the study photographic evaluation of their wrinkles showed there was a nine percent decrease in wrinkles compared to Baseline in the group getting almonds oil production which is sea bomb was unchanged throughout the study why were they looking at sebum AKA oil anyway if you congratulations people who have oily skin they tend to have fewer wrinkles it wrinkle protective effect so they were thinking like maybe you know eating almonds might have some impact on sebum and you know we want to be able to correlate any change in sebum to any possible positive effect that we see on wrinkles but really there was no change in sebum production now they didn at the lipid composition of the sea bump so that may have been a factor actually those people eating almonds maybe their sebum had a healthier lipid composition interestingly there were no differences between the two groups and transaction dermal water loss so eating almonds didn barrier function or oil production but the Almond group had quite a decrease in wrinkle severity and wrinkle width how many almonds were they consuming 59 grams that have gotten away with less possibly do you need to be eating 59 grams of almonds a day to get this effect more research is needed in 2021 kind of a similar study was done this was a prospective randomized control trial again post-menopausal women of Fitzpatrick phototype 1 and 2. again 20 of their daily calorie needs coming from almonds or from a calorie match snack this time they looked a little bit longer 24 weeks similar to the first study at both 16 and 24 weeks the Almond group had a significant reduction in wrinkles compared to Baseline whereas the control group did not another thing they looked for in the study it was pigment and the Almond group had Improvement in melanin in pigmentation compared to Baseline this is very interesting because vitamin E is known to help protect the fatty membrane of the melanocyte that is the skin cell responsible for making pigment vitamin E is also known to increase glutathione which is important for fighting off oxidative stress that would otherwise contribute to pigment production and vitamin E may have an inhibitory effect on tyrosinase which is the enzyme that is responsible for pigment production there was no difference in sebum production in the Almond group interestingly though the control group who is getting a calorie match snack they actually had an increase in Sea of them when they went back and looked at the snacks and they compared the nutritional information turns out the control snack group was getting about eight grams more of sugar a day compared to the Almond group so the researchers thought well maybe it sugar in the control group that leading to the increased sebum production because I pointed this out before on how sugar impacts our skin but it can lead to an increase in something called insulin-like growth factor which is a hormone that plays a contributory role in oiliness so that may be what led to that which is interesting we do have an interesting study from 2021 looking at healthy Asian women ranging in age this time anywhere from 18 to 45 years of age so not just post-menopausal women this study was interesting in that it was looking at specifically at how incorporating almonds into one might impact how well your skin handles the environmental aggressor that is ultraviolet radiation in this study the participants were randomized to get either one one and a half ounce almond snack a day or a pretzel snack a day which was um slightly fewer calories 200 calories compared to the almonds were 246. anyway they ate their respective almond or pretzel snack every day for 12 weeks and they looked at something called the minimal erythematous dose the minimal erythema is dose think of it as a packet of UV that would begin to damage your skin how much is going to take to start to damage your skin so you can imagine the better equipped your skin is to handle UV the higher that dosage is going to be at the end of the 12 weeks the group eating the Almond snack every day their minimal erythema as dose had increased that was not observed in the Pretzel group when they looked at different qualities of the skin and the Almond group there were no differences in skin roughness melanin skin hydration or sebum in the Almond group or the Pretzel group there was no change this study though is interesting in that it suggests that daily consumption of almonds may have a protective effect in helping your skin to to be better equipped to handle UV radiation contrast to the others this study was looking at Fitzpatrick phototype two through four so deeper skin tones in this in this particular study these studies are promising what are some of the limitations though the limitations with the studies are kind of just looking in the short term 16 weeks 24 weeks we our lives how many days of our lives do we need to be eating almonds to be getting a protective effect you know does it does it Peter out at some point uh does it does the benefit you know kind of plateau after a while and then that maintained who knows I suspect not but more research is needed the other thing these studies didn might be the effects on wrinkles of consuming almonds that have either been soaked or blanched which are things that can actually increase the amount of available vitamin E from the almonds so maybe you could get away with fewer almonds if they these studies did not include smokers these studies also the participants were told to avoid High antioxidant High polyphenol foods like strawberries they were also told to avoid nuts nut milks they can take any antioxidant supplements and they also could not be using many types of skin care products like for example no antioxidant serums and so very very minimal of any skin care products that they use so the researchers were trying as best they could to cut out some background noise so that they could focus on just the effects of the almonds but you know that any kind of study honestly so rather than investing in expensive skin care serums and the like should you just you know spend more money at the grocery store and buy more almonds because hey let expensive like I said you can underestimate the power of a reasonable diet and balanced nutrition but does that mandate everyone be consuming almonds no if you hate almonds you allergic to almonds I could get these things from other Foods as well all right guys so it sounds like almonds are a promising food we sort of already knew this they have a lot of ingredients in them that can have benefits to your overall health and your skin will just kind of be a window into those benefits uh but you know have reasonable expectations don eat a bunch of almonds if you don them certainly don allergic to them or they you know you have some sort of intolerance I personally think eating almonds is a lot more fun than putting on a vitamin C serum but to each their own and arguably you know if the vitamin C serum that you getting into the skin one might postulate that you might have additive benefits all right guys let me know in the comments though do you plan to incorporate almonds in your diet or are you already an almond fan I love them and as a matter of fact in preparing for this video I went ahead and reordered some almonds from the Amazonian uh I hope you guys enjoyed this video now on

Don't Sleep On Benzoyl Peroxide! The Must-have Ingredient For Your Skincare Routine	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hkpw4zUmVg	Dr Day	nine reasons to use benzo peroxide I bet you didn as a board certified dermatologist I huge fan of benzo peroxide and frequently recommend it for the treatment of an array of different skin conditions benzo peroxide helps cut down on problematic bacteria that can lead to skin problems benzo peroxide also is mildly carotic meaning it helps to a certain extent with exfoliating the skin and breaking up clogged pores so the number one use for benzo peroxide which I well is an acne treatment benzo peroxide is bacteria cidal against the acne causing bacteria cue bacterium acnes what that means is it can substantially reduce the burden of this acne causing bacteria and ultimately helps to clear up and prevent breakouts because benzo peroxide has that carotic effect as well it can help cut down on the clogging of pores that lead to blackheads and white heads otherwise known as closed and open Comey dones Beno peroxide also has mildly anti-inflammatory properties which make it effective for the treatment of acne one of the huge advantages of incorporating benzo peroxide into an acne treatment plan is that if it is used alongside either oral or topical antibiotics which are frequently used first line in the treatment of acne it can help cut down on the risk that the bacteria on your skin become resistant to those antibiotics which is amazing recently I did a video All About antibiotic resistant resistant bacteria and strategies to avoid this serious issue which can lead to many problems so check that out if that is of interest to you but benzo peroxide applied topically whether it be in a wash or leave on form is an effective ingredient for reducing this risk furthermore benzo peroxide when used in conjunction with other acne treatments such as topical adapalene a retinoid FDA approved for the treatment of acne can actually help those ingredients work even better so for example adapalene alone versus benzil peroxide alone versus combining the two you get better results with the combination than you do with either ingredient alone so they work well together there topical that includes both ingredients combined together in one topical making it easier to use you may be aware of this it aside what else is this ingredient helpful for this may come as a huge surprise to you it the stereotypes you may have about how this condition is approached but yes benzil peroxide can actually be very helpful in the treatment of rosacea now rosacea I know you guys are thinking what that condition and benzo peroxide is drying it can be irritating how the heck is someone with praa supposed to use benzol peroxide well it can end up being very helpful in reducing the number of the little bumps that come about with rosacea the papules the red bumps that can be filled with pus benzo peroxide may also to a certain extent offer benefit in reducing the burden of Demodex mites on the skin surface whether it be the mites themselves or the little bacteria that live in association with the mites benzo peroxide may also be working against those things to help control the rosacea if you aren bacteria associated with them do play a role in rosacea pathogenesis meaning the underlying root causes of this sensitive skin condition with bouts of flushing and blushing as well as red papules and pules but how do you get around the side effects of dryness and irritation for somebody with rosacea well we have a newer prescription topical form of benzo peroxide brand name is epsol it encapsulated benzo peroxide basically the benzo peroxide is suspended in these little silica shells that allow it to be slowly released onto the skin surface mitigating dryness and irritation it also allows for the benzil peroxide to be better localized within the pore due to the small size of the individual particles and it allows for depositing this ingredient on the skin for efficacy while minimizing the dryness the irritation that can come about as a result of benzo peroxide now over the counter you can buy benzo peroxide without a prescription it comes in a variety of different forms you have Lon products you have short contact therapy approach with a mask meaning something you put on leave on for a defined period of time and then rinse off and then you have face washes wash forms where you just lathering very short contact with the ingredient and then you rinse it off the skin any of these forms can be effective but when we rosacea specifically you might find that you tolerate a wash form much better than a leave on product it that leave on products that you buy without a prescription are off the table formulations of benzol peroxide over the years have come a long way and there are many excellent options out there that are much less irritating for example I often recommend the Neutrogena stubborn acne am treatment it benzo peroxide it tends to be a lot less irritating in comparison to other formulations out there um but is as effective all right moving on this is something I know a lot of y all deal with when it comes to removing hair and that is ingrown hairs full-blown condition known as pseudo foliculitis Barb basically as you cut the hair or remove the hair it grows back with a sharp point and it curves down and pierces the neighboring skin as it grows it grows down into the skin that it is pierced in your skin is like what the heck get this hair out of here cuz hair is not supposed to be in just random places in your skin it to be in your hair follicle hair outside of the hair follicle in the skin is like get this out so your body mount a foreign body reaction to that hair and that can lead to these very painful pimples that can scar they can ooze they can drain very uncomfortable topical benzo peroxide is very helpful in the treatment of pseudo foliculitis Barb that coupled with changing up hair removal approaches and the way that you shave and the way that you remove hair using different techniques all can help alleviate pseudo foliculitis Barb benil peroxide will help cut down on the bacteria on the skin surface that flare up the painful nodules it so it may help with keeping those hairs out of the skin and if you what are some good techniques and approaches to minimizing ingrown hair formation check out my video on tips and tricks for preventing ingrown hairs because there are a lot of little things you can change up will make a huge difference in ingrown hair formation number four is going to come as a surprise to you maybe you of this because it anyone really talks about at all but trust me a lot of people deal with this it hypomelanosis a lot of adults teenagers if you have a deeper skin tone you start developing this you might freak out and think that you have Vitiligo but what is it exactly it little small oval hypopigmented flat spots hypopigmented meaning your skin is much lighter than your background normal skin color so as you can imagine this freaks people out they think they developing full-blown Vitiligo it interesting it tends to happen on the trunk primarily very rarely it can extend to the arms and the neck and for the longest time we had no idea why this was happening now in a lot of cases it eventually just goes away on its own within about four or 5 years but for some people it persists and persists and persists if you have it there chance you want to get rid of it so we did a little sleo thing and come to find out guess who is playing a role in this and is identified in these lesions the acne causing bacteria ctie bacterium acnes yes that with this condition there no pimples there no black heads they heads instead the acne causing bacterium seems to be initiating some sort of series of events that suppresses pigment production the reason we know it bacterium acnes in these spots is that we can take a special tool called a woods lamp Turn the Lights Out turn this light on and shine it over the spots and the spots flues this red color and that is indicative of cutie bacterium acnes the acne treatment benzo peroxide which we talked about being effective for acne and that it reduces the burden of cutie bacterium acnes on the skin guess what used as a body wash to these areas or even a leave on version if that something you help get rid of this speaking of leave on forms one thing you have to understand about benzo peroxide that limits a lot of people using it is that if you leave it on the skin and your skin comes in contact with Fabrics it will bleach those Fabrics which is a nuisance especially when we your chest or back for example you don want to have a product that is going to bleach your shirt so in that case I think using a wash form that you use in the shower is a much better way to take advantage of this ingredient for this condition without destroying your clothing just lather it on your skin while you want to leave it on the skin for a few minutes and then rinse it off number five is hydradenitis supurativa this is an inflammatory skin condition that starts at the level of the hair follicle the hair follicle for whatever reason is predisposed to get getting uded blocked up and you then develop this painful nodule that can drain it can join together with other inflamed nodules forming a full-on sinus tract that drains these painful boils and nodules draining sinus tracts tend to involve the areas in the underarm area under the breast in the abdominal folds between the buttocks the thing about this Condition it the problem with this condition is that it sets the stage for impaired skin barrier function you have these nodules and what comes along are bacteria that form what are called biofilms the bacteria then drive more inflammation that ultimately aggravates the hyr antis ativa not surprising we do use a lot of antibiotics to treat this condition again not because it antibiotics do have anti-inflammatory Properties Plus there is likely some element of a bofilm going on further driving the condition benzil peroxide however can be very useful in cutting down on the formation of these bumps as well as helping to get rid of existing ones now when used in conjunction with antibiotics just as with acne it will help cut down on the risk that those antibiotics lead to bacterial resistance which is huge but remember benzo peroxide is also carotic and it is anti-inflammatory all of these things are advantageous for hyrus suppurativa so if this is something that you are struggling with you know that benzo peroxide which you can buy over the counter without a prescription either in a wash or leave on form can be very helpful for htis ativa in terms of cutting down nodule formation and flares that being said this is not a standalone treatment you just with benzo peroxide but it definitely a starting point and it plays a supportive role in an overall treatment plan number six is actually something that I really hope none of you deal with but um maybe you it pressure ulcers otherwise known as decubitus ulcers pressure ulcer is exactly what it sounds like prolonged pressure on the the skin starves the skin of oxygen and the skin kind of dies off almost like a little heart attack and you get an ulcer this is a huge problem for people who are immobilized in bed say in the hospital the Intensive Care Unit or in a nursing facility patients in these circumstances require somebody to be there to move them in the bed in a scheduled fashion so they not laying on any one particular area for a prolonged time these ulcers actually are a source of morbidity and mortality meaning further health problems and subsequent death because they open up the individual to the risk of serious infections that can get into the bloodstream and be life-threatening benil peroxide actually can be very effective in the approach to managing decubitus or otherwise known as pressure ulcers because a it is antibacterial so it cuts down on those bacterial biofilms that impair healing it also encourages the formation of what is called granulation tissue and subsequent epithelial ization of those ulcers meaning basically helps push things to closing up more readily so yeah it can be pretty helpful for those pressure ulcers number seven is foliculitis foliculitis is a tricky condition of the hair follicle fools a lot of people that think they have acne but it foliculitis is just a medical term for inflammation around the hair follicle and there are tons I mean tons and tons of different types of foliculitis it can be an infection or it can be a primary skin condition affecting the follicle but the way it presents often times are well basically pimples as well as little pus bumps can be a painful a lot of people are predisposed to a type of foliculitis called bacterial foliculitis due to infections with staff bacteria now I have a whole video on foliculitis I need you to watch that video If you deal with it because requires kind of a different approach but guess who is helpful in the management of bacterial foliculitis benzo peroxide yes that correct it reduces the burden of bacteria on the skin in a safe way a way in which we don these bacteria becoming resistant to it because resistance to benzo peroxide by the bacteria is just not a thing so it great and it help get in there into the pores and into the hair follicle and help kind of unclog that infectious mess a lot of people are predisposed to recurrent outbreaks of bacterial foliculitis with sta bacteria because they colonized with problematic strains of the bacteria especially like in their nose for for example and so benzil peroxide can be really helpful now a lot of people deal with bacterial foliculitis on their scalp lots of hair follicles on our scalp and they too can lead to a bacterial foliculitis now that being said benzo peroxide can be used in the scalp however it will bleach your hair so it number eight is one I talk about a fair amount and recommend when people are asking me about controlling body odor benol peroxide can be really helpful in cutting down on body odor when used under the arms in skin folds because again cuts down on the bacteria that would otherwise break down sweat and contribute to Mal odor it is a great deodorizing ingredient in that regard it doesn help cut down on Critters that break down sweat and contribute to odor not just body odor but also foot odor I mean feet are part of your body but a lot of times when people are asking about body odor they the underarm area but feet can be Mal odorous and benzil peroxide is great speaking of malodorous feet the final condition for which benzil peroxide is going to be your friend is a foot condition called pitted katalis this is something that people who work standing up in shoes that don circulation who sweat a lot are young athletes who maybe are not changing their socks frequently it in teenage boys actually um they develop a bacterial skin infection on their feet with a type of bacteria that creates these little pits hence the name and the reason it does that it creates little pits in the skin because the bacteria produce an enzyme that digests the Keratin proteins and lead to those little pits and in doing so they release these sulfur compounds that are rather malodorous I mean very very foul smell the feet kind of have this slimy appearance to them and the treatment is a topical antibiotic to get rid of that bacterial infection benzo peroxide can be very useful as a foot wash for helping to clear this up and prevent recurrences when you wash your feet with benzol peroxide don bottoms of your feet wash in between your toes your toes trap bacteria and dead skin cells and moisture and can actually lead to something called an interweb space infection and benzo peroxide can be helpful and cutting down on the risk of that as well all right guys that all of the ways in which benzo peroxide might just be what you hope this video was informative and educational now back in April there was quite a bit of noise being made with regards to detection of benzene and benzol peroxide so if you about that on the inss Slate I to link my recent video all about this topic I want you to watch that video um and it answers a lot of your questions so I will link that on the end slate and if you don it once I go away and you thumbnail to a video if you just click on that thumbnail it will take you to that video anyways guys I hope you enjoyed this one if so give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe I bye [Music]	Success
Glycerin Vs Hyaluronic Acid | Which One Is Better For Your Skin?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgTg7PpRWOQ	Dr Day	glycerin versus hyaluronic acid which one is better for your skin Mike drop it doesn the subject of intense debate online all of the time and I simply do not understand why they get so much attention why we fight over these two ingredients so dang much what is the deal well they are humectants humectants are ingredients in moisturizing products that help to improve water content in your skin which is great all right let talk about glycerin it is a colorless odorless liquid and it is a humant it again helps to impart better water content in your skin depending on the concentration of Glycerin in a formula it also can create a thin film on the surface of the skin that reduces water loss and protects the skin against irritant so it offers many benefits directly and then indirectly by increasing water content when the stratum cornum the outermost layer of your epidermis becomes dehydrated as can occur in a variety of different skin conditions maybe you skinc care products you have an impaired barrier you becomes dry or it also I happens just as a age related phenomenon we start to not have the optimal water content we irritation so using moisturizing products moisturizers that contain humectants as they do that can improve water content and get things back on track to being smoother more hydrated and ultimately what that does for you cosmetically is it plumps up the skin and it leads to smoothing out of fine lines and wrinkles when the water content in Your Skin Barrier is optimized the use of humectant whether it be glycerin or any of the others out there what happens is the natural turnover processes of the epidermis they go along a lot more smoothly when the water content drops the enzymes necessary to maintain the normal exfoliation processes and barrier function they don you get a buildup of dry rough skin when water content is teed up well guess what everything starts moving along a lot more smoothly and speaking of more smoothly you get smoother more hydrated more glowy radiant skin that the benefits of Simply using a moisturizer regardless of the ingredients additionally using glycerin in your skincare products helps to strengthen the Integrity of Your Skin Barrier it helps to improve the orientation of the lipids in the Skin Barrier and ultimately that helps not only with reducing transepidermal water loss but also limiting penetration of irritance now when it comes to glycerin specifically the overall formulation makes a huge difference like the glycerin is so widely available if you are using skincare products glycerin is hitting your face okay it without saying it things here percentages you know it offset some of the drying effects maybe of some ingredients and it can enhance penetration of certain ingredients which can be a positive it can be a negative it can be a positive and that you get better results can be a negative and that you get more irritation but when it ranges anywhere from 20 to 45% the product can claim to be a skin protectant so it can make a drug claim several months ago I discovered a new product from L Ro POS their cop plast gel now I balm a skin protectant with dimethicone but they came out with a gel version that instead of being a dimethicone skin protectant is a glycerin skin protectant and it has a high percentage of Glycerin it creates a nice protective hydrating film on the skin surface that for me personally I find really performs well well around the eyes highly recommend this around your eyes for a limiting penetration of things into eyelid skin that can be irritating if you with dry irritated eyelids this is a great option it doesn doesn be used anywhere truthfully it protectant so it it with a different ingredient so they have a different feel a different consistency and so consumers are going to pick and choose what they like better doesn necessarily mean one is better than the other it want to use but glycerin as a skin protectant is fantastic once you get water content optimized via that htin action well you also get Downstream benefits in the realm of Skin mechanical properties you get improved elasticity smoothness overall epidermal thickness improves via hydration I mean your skin just starts looking better at high concentrations such as what is found in a skin protectant glycerin can be bacteriostatic meaning it limits bacteria in a wound this is really valuable for healing cuts which glycerin as a side note is great for its wound healing properties and this is one way in which it does that I already kind of mentioned this but it really helps with skin renewal because again optimizing water content things just move along a lot more efficiently the barrier turns over you just get healthy fresh skin and a reduction in that buildup of dry rough skin texture ultimately that leads to skin that is not only smoother but less prone to irritation you have better barrier Integrity woohoo so what deal with hyaluronic acid then well hyaluronic acid is abundant in your dermis the deeper parts of your skin that interest when we are discussing wrinkles it is the dermis and you hyaluronic acid in there but you also have some hyaluronic acid hanging out in your epidermis plays a key role in hydration there as well guess what with age hyaluronic acid starts to decline in our epidermis contributing to overall dryness applying it topically can help replenish moisture woohoo similar to other humans not only is hyaluronic acid widely found throughout your skin but it because of its water binding abilities it is very hydrating it helps lubricate here is where a lot of the nitpicking getting to sciencey goes down when it comes to hyaluronic acid so you high molecular weight hyaluronic acid and you have low mole ular weight hyaluronic acid and depending on which of these is included and a combination of them can be included in a given product it can influence how the product performed and its overall properties High molecular weight hyaluronic acid much larger in size can create this sort of thin film on the skin surface that contributes to the visico elastic properties of a given product allowing for nice spread on the skin and for reducing transepidermal water loss but then there is low molecular weight hyaluronic acid as well it can trickle down a little bit deeper into the skin helping with water content and so a lot of what I have come across online you find people worried that the low molecular weight hyaluronic acid or hyaluronic acid in general there seems to be this idea that it is pro-inflammatory and I hate to break it to you but this is not giving you the full picture of topical hyaluronic acid hyaluronic acid is really really really important in wound healing so wound healing say from a cut or a surgical incision it goes through different stages and a vital aspect of wound healing is the inflammatory stage where inflammation comes in to orchestrate proper and efficient wound healing without inflammation you cannot heal cuts and scrapes and low molecular weight hyaluronic acid plays a role in that hyaluronic acid high and low molecular weight actually can reduce inflammation in the skin why well because of all of the same things that glycerin can do when you optimize water content and skin outermost layer you improve barrier function you limit penetration of irritants and the list goes on and on and this has actually been demonstrated clinically there clinical evidence in people objective clinical evidence in people that applying hyaluronic acid to the skin is inflammatory everything clinically oriented that we have says the opposite we have evidence that topical hyaluronic acid helps with the irritation the inflammation of atopic dermatitis an inflammatory skin condition it helps it doesn dermatitis helped by low molecular weight hyaluronic acid applied to the skin in form of a reduction in inflammation not an increase so doesn add up at all clinically that hyaluronic acid is inflammatory whether it be high or low molecular weight High versus low molecular weight will all just kind of come down to how a given product performs on your skin in terms of texture um it may be you know leaning more depending again on how it is formula overall as far as other ingredients it may lean more towards you know helping to reduce water loss it may lean more towards helping with hydration in the deeper parts of the epidermis but uh I think people get way too hung up on this way too hung up on it hyaluronic acid appli topically can be quite robust actually at reducing wrinkle depth I personally observe this on myself all the time it for moisturizing the skin as a a great bang for for your bu just using a moisturizer plumps up the skin surface you get a reduction in fine lines and wrinkles just by space filling up to 40% including with low molecular weight hyaluronic acid some of the some of the randomized control trials looking at hyaluronic acid topically I talking about filler that you inject down in the dermis we putting it on your skin the studies using low molecular weight hyaluronic acid had some of the most striking reductions in wrinkle depth hyaluronic acid applied topically has also been shown to have a variety of benefits postprocedure what do I mean by that we needling we these procedures when patients apply a topical hyaluronic acid they have guess what better healing better outcomes so at the end of the day which one is better it doesn that you like don science behind glycerin versus hyaluronic acid they improve the water content in your skin and all the benefits that come with that you can get from either ingredient or or you can get from a product that has both which news flash a lot of products have both pmo not a product but a prescription topical for the treatment of acne Al trano lotion formulated with both glycerin and hyaluronic acid helps patients with acne tolerate tro and better because it formula it helps reduce the dryness and irritation that comes along with troin what are the downsides of using these ingredients like why do some people have issue like what what is going on well one possible explanation I kind of hinted at this earlier in the video is the fact that well humectants improve water content in the skin that ultimately allows for better penetration of things so you may be getting more irritated by something else that you were using along with these hydrating ingredients so keep that in mind I love glycerin in my skin care I also love hyaluronic acid I genuinely see benefits in my skin using either ingredient and often times I using both of them to together now if you find a product is irritating to your skin don I wouldn any one of these ingredients and assume that it is that when we get older our skin is not as efficient at at retaining water that dryness and irritation some people like myself too you know their their skin conditions like atopic dermatitis acne rosacea all have poor barrier function and that contributes to disease flares and symptomatology moisturizers can truly benefit that you don pick and choose you don there wondering which one is better for you all right guys that to talk about in today this was helpful to you all if you enjoyed it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen And subscribe I to you guys tomorrow bye [Music]	Success
The Truth About Glutathione For Skin Whitening	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVRsn9um4LQ	Dr Day	what is the deal with glutathione for skin whitening does it actually do anything or is it just a big hoax that what we video what the heck is glutathione well it is a peptide naturally produced by the cells in your body and it functions as an antioxidant it helps fight against reactive oxygen species which otherwise damage DNA RNA proteins lipids in cells throughout your body lead to cell death as well as premature aging and contribute to inflammation throughout the body can aggravate and be a part of many disease processes glutathione also inhibits melanogenesis AKA pigment production so of course it is of interest for dark spots hyperpigmentation melasma and just general skin lightning glutathione can be delivered topically meaning something that you apply to the skin it can be taken orally but one very popular way of administering glutathione is an IV drip you will come across Med Spas all over the world who tout all of these claims about the benefits of IV drips containing glutathione for skin and overall health while our body naturally makes glutathione production of glutathione does decline with age so there is some thought that perhaps in older adults with certain underlying health problems that perhaps glutathione supplementation may have some sort of protective role although more research is needed lower levels of glutathione in the body are also associated with a variety of states of poor health but what about in terms of skin so there are two trials looking at Oral glutathione for the skin they both use 500 Mig a day of glutathione one of them is a supplement that you ingest the other one is a lozen that you dissolve in the mouth the absorption of glutathione from the gut to get to an appreciable level throughout the body is very challenging by allowing it to absorb in your mouth and the mucosa in your mouth you get better levels so the one looking at the pill that you ingest 500 Mig a day this was a randomized double blind Placebo control trial of 500 Mig a day of glutathione versus placebo and after 4 weeks there was a statistically significant reduction in the melanin indices and those using the glutathione supplement taking the glutathione supplement versus those doing the placebo there looking at 500 Mig a day of glutathione lozes this particular study looked at 30 healthy Filipino women ranging in age from 22 to 42 with Fitzpatrick phototypes four and five and this study likewise showed a statistically significant reduction in melanin indices compared to Placebo these are small studies they have limitations and again they other words more research is needed but what about the IV glutathione like I said it to absorb the digestive tract to lead to appreciable increases in um body glutathione so what about administering it through an IV as is Po popularized among all of these you know sort of Med Spa we only have one study looking at this it looked at 50 healthy Pakistan women was open label Placebo controlled 1200 MGR injection versus normal saline they were getting these injections twice a week over eight weeks instead of melanin indices this particular study looked at something called the tailor scale which honestly is a lot more subjective the group getting IV glutathione showed 37.5% in Improvement in their tailor scale which was significantly greater than those getting just normal sailing however they continued to reassess this and after about 6 months that had dropped to 6.2% so it doesn leads to any sort of sustained benefit importantly in this study there were some serious adverse side effects that happened to some people namely problems with their liver some people had elevation in their liver enzymes which is not good one patient had an anaphylactic reaction what about applying glutathione to the skin well a study that looked at 30 Filipino women over 10 weeks of applying a 2% glutathione lotion twice a day this particular study did show a temporary skin lightning effect with topical glutathione of all these studies that we have that I and oral glutathione in the studies were not associated with any sort of adverse effects it was only the IV that had you know worrisome worrisome consequences es like I said IV glutathione is a something that Spa IV clinics lots of claims made about it but some serious side effects have Arisen in people getting these um IV infusions of glutathione namely problems with thyroid also kidney problems uh serious drug rashes some people have developed abdominal pain and then because of the way they are administered in these Med Spas maybe there might be a poor injection technique and there are cases people getting like more serious infections from these infusions so while it simply don time remains inconclusive as to what degree this is actually going to be beneficial for anyone overall there are many problems with IV glutathione first of all just an overall lack of published high quality studies to demonstrate efficacy second of all there is no established effective dosing you know these clinics will claim a certain dose is the best but that really hasn substantiated in clinical trials how long do you need to take it it would appear from the study that we do have that you need to get these infusions in definitely in order to maintain whatever benefit you see from them and the infusions are not inexpensive the infusions are not FDA approved or regulated and the FDA of the Philippines actually cautioned against these where does that leave us now I would say in my opinion if you are intrigued by glutathione I think it a skincare product and as as far as taking a dietary supplement while the research that we do have doesn that that is necessarily harmful you may just be wasting your money due to poor bioavailability will applying it to the skin make any difference honestly it going to boil down to the product overall this is an ingredient found in cosmetic products meaning it is not a medication so there of heterogenity out there in terms of different products could or could not be formulated to actually lead to meaningful effective concentrations to the skin or any sort of clinically meaningful effect that you might appreciate I mean we really don know what the best dose of topical glutathione is going to be to have any effect on hyperpigmentation or on you know just overall skin tone topical glutathione does appear to be helpful for improving just the overall appearance of the skin and in my mind a theory I have is that maybe some of the benefits that people appreciate from topical glutathione have nothing to do with it acting as an antioxidant and inhibiting melanogenesis but simply due to the fact that it peptides applied to the skin can end up actually being pretty hydrating when you improve water content in Skin outermost layer skin tone overall appears a lot brighter um and you may note diminishment in the appearance of dark spots just through light scattering if glutathione does work how is it working to improve dark spots well again it anti-inflammatory and anything that drives inflammation in the skin such as sun exposure or exposure to environmental aggressors certainly can lead to an upregulation in pigment production worsening hyperpigmentation but glutathione also can inhibit tyrosinase the enzyme responsible for producing pigment what with glutathione well one that comes to mind that I think is a good product because I have used it myself um is a karx product it is their dual chambered snail Essence with glutathione remember I reviewed that what was it a year ago at this point already that has uh the snail muin which is very hydrating helps with elasticity I mean I love snail mucin it also has uh glutathione and it has niacinamide now interesting thing uh to combine glutathione with niacinamide makes some practical sense because like I said glutathione is an antioxidant it tyrosinase inhibitor niacinamide on the other hand also an antioxidant also anti-inflammatory but niacinamide doesn stops the spread of those pigment packets to the surrounding cells so you have two ingredients that may be helpful for hyperpigmentation working in different ways so together you to get better results than using either ingredient alone or that being said the glutathion in the product may not really be that effective per se for dark spots and the nicomide might be doing all the heavy lifting niacinamide is good for the moisture barrier keeping skin hydrated reducing uh penetration of things that are irritating that would otherwise aggravate hyperpigmentation but glutathione you know it so it may also be helping with the moisture content in Skin layer allowing for the enzymes that maintain barrier function to do their thing better or or I already know for me personally that I get good results whenever I use snail muin because it very hydrating and again hydrating things help with light scattering just brighten up your skin tone overall so that may be what benefits that I see using that product and if you that while I really liked it and thought it was good I didn much above and beyond what the snail Muse in essence which I adore um offered and that product doesn glutathione so long story short is glutathione worth the hype well I think it definite supporting role in a dark spot corrector because again it some of the mechan is Ms of pigment production by itself as a skincare ingredient it may be underwhelming but when combined with other effective ingredients targeting the pigment pathway you may get more striking results the research on oral glutathione for skin lightning is very very limited um more research is needed to say if that is a worthwhile Pursuit and given what we know about it issues with absorption again you may just be wasting your money and I think people are under the assumption that supplements are like some wholesome category but they certainly can end up having side effects supplements are not regulated like drugs so there getting is actually what they claim the product contains some supplements have been found to be contaminated with things and supplements may contain ingredients that interact with medications you might be taking so you definitely you know have to be conscientious I would say stay away from the IV glutathione as it stands now uh given that people develop pretty serious side effects from that or can uh we don studies showing that it effective so for me it y the comments though have you tried any products with glutathione what was your experience all right guys that about wraps up today glutathione for the skin I hope this was informative and answer the questions that you all have if you enjoyed it on the end slate is going to be my recent video All About th all so you to want to watch that one next especially if you are at all interested in dark spots hyperpigmentation but if you guys enjoyed this one give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don I [Music] oh	Success
Why Is Eucerin Gatekeeping Thiamidol Anti-Pigment Serum?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KEeObwrRWU	Dr Day	you guys have been asking me please do a video on thodol so let fact like three almost four years ago I feel uh I bought several skin care products with thodol tried them out with the intention of making a video on it their products were horrible uh could not stand using them gave me a headache irritated my skin and so I just kind of shoved them to the side got caught up with other things and here we are three or four years later I was in the process of moving came across these bottles and thought I need to make that video what the heck is th amadol anyway it ingredient that is basically owned by beersdorf the corporation behind usin aquafor and many other skincare Brands thodol is something that is found in products marketed as dark spot correctors it helpful for hyperpigmentation dark spots even melasma as well as post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation which if you is basically anytime you have an inflammatory skin condition or process going on in the skin skin injury it can heal with a dark mark and people who have deeper skin tones this is especially an issue so thiamidol actually shows promise in clinical studies on actual human volunteers not just cells in add dish for post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation as well as melasma now melasma is sort of another Beast it is more than just hyperpigmentation there the hormones feeding into it there blood vessels that bring in inflammation and it melasma occurs on sun-exposed skin usually the face characteristically has these sort of angulated borders so we not talking like little discret round oval patches of discoloration but rather more large rectangular type patches but the ingredient suffices to say has been studied for post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and melasma so whether or not it who knows because because Mike drop this is a cosmetic ingredient so you going to find robust clinical trials now there are actually some clinical trials with this ingredient albe it uh we don have more data on it than some other ingredients that pop up but it not a ton so thiamidol is actually just a name that beers door presumably gave this compound because it easier to say than what it really is and that is isobu tholil resourc andol it is like many pigment correcting ingredients a tyrosinase inhibitor when it comes to making pigment normally and abnormally you are thinking about the production of melanin that is the one of the main pigments in our skin and that is what is is playing a role in hyperpigmentation post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation melasma so accumulation of abnormal amounts of melanin that is what you are trying to intervene on and to prevent those dark patches and that happens under the guidance of an enzyme called tyrosinase and so many ingredients that Target dark spots hyperpigmentation are tyrosinase Inhibitors now the gold standard for treating hyperpigmentation it hydroquinone hydroquinone does in fact inhibit tyrosinase and it has a few other side mechanisms as well hydroc canone while it cannot be used longterm you need to take a break from it because it actually can cause rebound worsening hyperpigmentation it can cause quite a bit of irritation uh and there are ways around that but it can be irritating and again anything that skin will worsen hyperpigmentation and there is a concern of a rare condition called pseudo ochronosis now when you are getting hydrocone under the supervision of your doctor you know they so this isn someone who gets high potency especially hydroquinone from other sources and DIYs it themselves you know that risky situation for Adverse Events all that to say you don necessarily be using hydroquinone every day for the rest of your life it going to be the best approach for controlling the dark spots it something that you use to get results and you wean off of it and bring in somebody else that is better and so this thiamidol a cosmetic ingredient shows promise it inhibits tyrosinase and there of patients who have melasma they had patients with melasma use thodol twice a day or they had the patients use hydrocone once a day and guess what the thodol was just as effective as the hydrocone uh so that again this is small study not like super robust but it suggests that yeah this would be a great option for transitioning someone over to something that could be used longterm safely uh with regards to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation remember I told you this is an issue that people who have deeper skin tones tend to deal with so this particular study looked at patients who have uh Fitzpatrick phototype 5 if you phototypes basically it that we in dermatology use to describe how an individual skin react to ultraviolet radiation so people who have Fitzpatrick photo type 5 they have a deeper skin tone and they they don burn easily so anyway the Fitzpatrick photo type 5 patients with post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation they had them apply thiamidol again twice a day uh and there was a statistically significant decrease in the hyperpigmentation compared to just vehicle alone so vehicle Alone um what that means is basically the cream without the tham all we don of information on how it compares to hydroquinone yes there is a one study looking at it in comparison to hydroquinone from melasma but remember that was small and we just need more information so it this will go for any individual or how it compares to any of the other tyrosinase Inhibitors out there does it do even better if you combine it with something like niacinamide which isn tyrosinases inhibitor but rather gets in the way of the spread of pigment packets from the melanite to the neighboring keratinocytes or uh what about coic acid you know it chelates copper it tyrosinase inhibitor but it has a very specific way of doing that copper is necessary for the function of tyrosinase as a reminder I have a video recently all about the warning signs of copper deficiency and it certainly is a situation where if you don copper which is super rare okay so don go self- diagnosing oh my gosh I am I copper deficient no um anyway anyway copper key for tyrosinase mess up how copper gets utilized by tyrosinase tyrosinase won essentially an inhibitor that is how koic acid Works well if you added koic acid to this um and you kind of get two hits to the tyrosinate slightly different ways is that going to give you even better results these are the kinds of things that would be really nice to study to research but we don data on that it US kind of hard to come byy skincare products that contain this I purchased three productss from userin that have thodol they actually have a ton of products with thodol but they are not sold in the US I bought the anti-pigment day cream SPF 30 the anti-pigment night cream and the anti-pigment Dual serum uh the Dual serum also had sodium escorial phosphate that vitamin C that may help ward off oxidative stress it would also contribute to inflammation and hyperpigmentation these products were horrible when I say they specifically talking about the fragrance and I you know I try and hold off on ranting about fragrance in my reviews of things because I know some people are perfectly fine with fragrance you know while it not everyone is bothered by it people come to these videos wanting information on the products so they don to hear me complain about the strong scent but when I tell you like it was bad to the point where it was too head it really gave me a bad headache and I was like no I you know I I there them and then like I said I kind of forgot about them the sunscreen too I was really disappointed was such a letdown with a strong fragrance because when it comes to dark spots melasma you really need to be aggressive with the sun protection given this is an ingredient that in the studies was used to sometimes four times a day but for the most part twice a day I think having the ingredient in a night cream and then an in the ingredient in a sunscreen I think it is a a nice I think it to have that because a lot of people you know they run into issues layering products with their sunscreen in the morning routine if you can have a sunscreen with an active ingredient that actually delivers the active ingredient in a meaningful way that is a concern with sunscreens that have actives is you know sunscreens form a film is that film limiting penetration of activ but if it you just have one product that sun protection it has as well as the thiamidol for the morning routine and then you have another product for your evening routine that is the moisturizer or the serum whichever you whichever one you would want to use so UST has a lot they also as a side note have a body product with thodol so this is something you might pursue for post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation on the body Nivea has a product it um and I only learned about it like a few weeks ago from one of my followers over on Instagram was like did you know that this other product exists with damal I had no idea it luminous 630 they have several products in this line as well have not tried them they do have fragrance don it one so I went down the rabbit hole in preparation of this video trying to find skin like I was thinking that surely this ingredient must be in something in the US market um the the um brand that has so generously decided to include thodol La prair uh yeah they laprairie white caviar do do you know how much this is $460 $460 for a serum uh they also have a I think a cream as well but the the the serum the essence whatever they $460 yeah um no move on there are drugstore products with you know pigment targeting ingredients that would be you know a lot more reasonable nobody should be dropping four six unless you want to you know you like that kind of stuff you like the bottle the packaging you want the Lux experience the luxury skincare by all means but I am not going let you need in order to improve hyperpigmentation all right so let just get that out of our heads right now no one needs to be spending that kind of money on a skin care product for dark spots hyperpigmentation you would be better served seeing a dermatologist getting uh you know cereal peel peels or any other number of um interventions that could be offered um as well as prescription topical so I I say that skip now the one product that really really looked promising um from a brand I bobai sunscreen extra lightning gel SPF 50 fragrance free this is a fragrance-free chemical sunscreen I had it in my head just seeing it and reading the ingredient list this looks promising in terms of a consistency of a a sunscreen that people will like and that it seemed like it was one that was unlikely to be as greasy as some of our American sunscreens um you got to go to Egypt to get this I guess because it an Egyptian uh it comes from Parkville pharmace I that anybody who watches me from Egypt is this a sunscreen that you have please let us know that personal journey of trial and error with thodol I gave up after my horrible experience with the euin anti-pigment line uh I would be interested to try the Nivea 3 630 I want to call it 360 Nivea luminous 630 products even though they too have fragrance maybe it not going to be dropping 460 for the white caviar which does have fragrances side note I other day I did a video all about uh L melab B3 serum sunscreen of course they have a face wash version of it as well um how does that compare to this who knows who knows if you recall from that video if you missed it micil is an ingredient that was developed by L and it works not like a tyrosinase inhibitor but rather it gets in the way of the incorporation of the melanin precursors into melanin in other words if beers dworf and L collaborate which will never happen to create one product that has both ingredients that would be something really promising because when it comes to targeting discoloration dark marks hitting multiple arms of the pathways that lead to pigment production that is that is the name in the game that really where you start to get results uh and so I think that even throwing coic acid in there Co kelate copper to really hit that tyrosinase even more I think that great leave out the fragrance though these Brands I know I I personally don care for fragrance it is but when it comes to formulating a dark spot corrector these companies that have large R&D right like beersdorf L uh they they put a lot of money into developing these really cool novel ingredients uh doing actual clinical studies on them with actual patients who have in in this case you know actual clinical disease Pathways going on melasma post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation demonstrate efficacy demonstrate safety and then they go back to to the company and they formulate products with this very very strong fragrance which is is likely to be more irritating to people in the long run and again anything that makes the skin irrit irritated is going to worsen hyperpigmentation so not to say that it like I don ruining it for a lot of people who are going to be irritated by that and potentially have their hyperpigmentation worsen I find it interesting that Eucerin has had this ingred beer DF excuse me has had this ingredient for so long long yet hasn too many products here in the US anyways guys that on the insulate uh I melil video you can watch that one next if you missed it but if you guys like this video go ahead and give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don I [Music]	Success
The Truth About Tranexamic Acid Serum	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grb3zhGfRus	Dr Day	does tranexamic acid in skincare even work or is it just a big scam I really feel as though this is something we need to talk about more in depth so that you guys don your skincare routines and add things that may or may not do anything first of all what the heck is tranexamic acid it lysine used for decades in decades since like the specifically it menaga which is the medical term for well heavy periods but come to find out given orally like a pill that you take by mouth tranexamic acid is actually quite helpful in treating a skin condition where you have hyperpigmentation and that skin condition is known as melasma and I have a lot of videos about melasma on my channel so if you deal with it you need to check those out so you have more insight into what hyperpigmentation as well as an increase in abnormal blood vessel formation all triggered by hormones irritating things and UV exposure from the Sun as well as visible light from the Sun but why might a drug used to treat bleeding work for malasma in your epidermis at the very bottom layer of your epidermis the epidermis is the top part of your skin at the very bottom part of the top part you have uh skin cells called keratin aides those keratin aides have something called plasminogen which is the target for tranexamic acid now in contrast to its mechanism for stopping bleeding here it it turns out a big reason why hyperpigmentation is driven by UV exposure is the activation of this plasminogen via keratinocytes that leads to the release of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandin and lucat trines that subsequently trigger increase in melanogenesis AK pigment production underscoring a hyperpigmentation this is not only an issue for melasma but also for other types of hyperpigmentation like post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation those dark marks that might be left behind on your skin after say acne heals or a bug bite heals so tranexamic acid interrupts that and basically Works to stop UV mediated hyperpigmentation by preventing the increase in prostaglandins and lucrin so Asma in particular responds well to oral tranexamic acid as well as introducing it directly into the skin via like micro needling or some other sort of delivery system where you are basically injecting it into the skin locally but some people are not going to be good candidates for oral tranexamic acid it may not be tolerable or feasible to have it injected in so can it actually work when you just apply it to the skin if you just just look at the structure of tranexamic acid you skeptical if you know anything about chemistry it actually going to get in it depending on how it skincare products it may not reach a meaningful concentration where it needs to be to suppress UV mediated increases in pigment production but we to try things anyways so there are several clinical studies out there not a ton okay not a ton looking at different formulations of topical tranexamic acid 3% tranexamic acid cream applied topically for 12 weeks 5% tranexamic acid gel applied topically for 12 weeks 3% tranexamic acid solution applied for 12 weeks 5% liposomal tranexamic acid applied for 12 weeks and then a 2% formulation applied again for 12 weeks you done 12 weeks which is good to have some consistency um of all these studies I just mentioned the results are varying some show promise for improving melasma when applied topically others show no effect so the results are variable and really what it tells us is that we have to strongly take into account the overall formulation now I pointed this out in my other videos before but when it comes to treating hyperpigmentation malas Asma specifically but really any type of hyperpigmentation rarely is it going to be the case if at all that it is a single best treatment to get rid of the condition usually especially with melasma almost always it approaches using topicals that combine different ingredients that Target different aspects of what leads to hyperpigmentation and in the case of melasma also address that underlying vascular component there also energy based devices like lasers light based devices that may be employed chemical peels and then of course we cannot neglect aggressive sun protection especially for melasma so to say is tranexamic acid worth it for hyperpigmentation melasma just in terms of improving the pigment issue the hyperpigmentation it really all depends on what else you key speaking of formulation a product can contain other ingredients that Target other aspects of the pigment producing Pathway to augment the chances that you notice an appreciable difference in dark spots as well as ingredients that enhance penetration as well as enhan skin cell turnover things like lactobionic acid a polyhydroxy acid or mandelic acid or salicylic acid but what if I told you that topical tranexamic acid doesn increase pigment production and benefits may be obtained outside of solely reducing melanin pigment abnormal melanin pigment production um because when it comes to discoloration a lot of people laser focus in on on the pigment but there can be overlying skin changes and other background skin changes going on that lead to an overall appearance of discoloration and addressing those things leads to a brightening effect things like dull skin as well as background redness that in some skin tones especially when overlapped on top of hyperpigmentation can look more like discoloration tranexamic acid bya inhibition of something called par 2 actually can improve barrier function and this has specifically been examined not for melasma or hyperpigmentation but rather for rosacea a condition characterized by increased sensitivity to things that come in contact with the skin and a background problem with the Skin Barrier so remember our barrier um the outermost layer of our skin it serves to limit penetration of things that are irritating people who have rosacea they have a bit of an impaired barrier and they have other things going on in their skin that make them very very sensitive topical tranexamic acid can actually improve barrier function offering symptomatic relief for people with rosacea from the symptoms of burning stinging sensitivity as well as redness things that address barrier function not only are going to be helpful for rosacea but they also can be helpful for molas and hyperpigmentation because things that are irritating to the skin can aggravate hyperpigmentation as well tranexamic acid Works also to inhibit angiogenesis new blood vessel abnormal blood vessel formation reduces vascular endothelial growth factor necessary for these you know dilated blood vessels to come in and form and it also reduces facial redness because it reduces certain inflammatory markers so topical tranexamic acid actually may be beneficial not just from the perspective of improving hyperpigmentation but also redness and barrier function by improving barrier function it can help with improving overall skin tone a lot of people get hung up on skin lightening reduction in melanin pigment but a lot of what might also benefit them is skin brightening which skin brightening differs from skin lightening in that it an overall Improvement in skin Radiance luminosity and that can come about as a result of an improvement in barrier function and moisturization of the skin overall clearer um and more even skin tone just by light scattering and a reduction in inflammation that leads to redness so that really think about it hyperpigmentation it it is helpful for barrier function but we do still have that issue of optimal formulation penetration does it actually get in and do what it really striking case study of one patient we rosacea and now inappropriate use of strong steroid creams on the face can actually cause um a type of rosacea called steroid rosacea where you can get persistent facial redness dilated blood vessels that on this woman report tranexamic acid is something that is given to stop bleeding and comes in a little vial a liquid they they made a 10% solution of tranexamic acid from that so you know not a skincare product that you buy in the store um gave it to the patient in a little plastic container that was protected from light told the patient make sure you store this at room temperature it stable for 90 days had the patient get a cotton swab dip it in the solution and apply it to the skin twice a day look at the Improvement that this individual got so that love to see this pursued more because tranexamic acid is a really cheap drug inexpensive drug if you could just do this and give it to a p you know if your doctor would be willing to try this out either for redness or for hyperpigmentation it compelling as a potential easy coste effective therapeutic modality so all of me telling you oh yeah formulations really important for penetration and everything this patient got good results just dipping on into the uh 10% solution and smearing it on with a cotton swap it topical and will tranexamic acid is generally well tolerated which is important because whether it be rosacea or hyperpigmentation anything that is irritating can worsen either of those conditions making the redness the dark spots much worse so where does topical tranexamic acid fit into this thing is it something that you should consider introducing into your skin care routine well you know if it fix it but topical tranexamic acid may may okay offer some improvement not just in hyperpigmentation whether it be melasma or post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation but also may help calm down redness and may help with your moisture barrier if you deals with a lot of facial redness irritation you may find actually that topical tranexamic acid is very soothing right it cuts down on things like Incan 6 and it has an anti-inflammatory effect and it may help with your barrier function limiting penetration of things that are irritating into the skin I think it is a compelling topical for people who deal with post acne marks whether it be redness and or hyperpigmentation it out there it for these things but it it is an option and it is available there are a few products on the market that use tranexamic acid one of them I reviewed a few years ago for you guys from Polish Choice their discoloration Repair Serum this has 3% tranexamic acid but it also has 5% niacinamide so as it turns out you guys already know who watch a lot of my videos niacinamide like tranexamic acid is a good ingredient for dark spots redness the moisture barrier uh reducing sensitivity it things that tranexamic acid may do depending on the formulation iCal niacinamide has a lot more research supporting that it does so I like that that said about treating dark spots hyperpigmentation it one ingredient having multiple ingredients in there that Target different arms of the pigment pathway really can lend better results and niacinamide specifically works for hyperpigmentation because it slows down the spread of those pigment packets that are produced in the melanocytes to the neighboring keratin sites so that totally different from how tranexamic acid is going to be working for dark spots tranexamic acid is going to be working for dark spots by hopefully making its way down to the junction between the epidermis and the dermis targeting the plasminogen pathway in those keratinocytes suppressing UV from the Sun mediated uh increases in prostaglandin and lucat Trine that lead to melanogenesis and hyperpigmentation so totally different mechanisms they complement one another so I like that now the discoloration defense serum also has uh biku which is an antioxidant that may also help along with these things in combating inflammation in the skin it marketed as a discoloration defense serum but overall I think it good option for people who deal with facial redness and are simply seeking a serum that may help improve overall skin skin Radiance and E even out one tone like all of Polish Choice products it lightweight lotion you apply it maybe as a first step in your morning or evening skincare routine after cleansing to skin while it can help maximize penetration of ingredients um they they penetrate better on damp skin allow it to absorb fully and then apply sunscreen if you wearing it during the day or and or a moisturizer on over if you like in the evening but this particular product is $55 is there a less expensive alternative well one that I have tried out that is is a good one that I would also recommend comes from the brand minimalist they have a tranexamic acid three a 3% tranexamic acid serum um that is like less than $12 in addition to the tranexamic acid this particular serum has mandelic acid which can help smooth out the skin surface and allow for better penetration of that tranexamic acid it also has 0.5% cyc acid um which is good for exfoliating the pores but also works well for helping to improve hyperpigmentation it has some anti-inflammatory properties to it so overall this particular serum I think is especially good for people who have post- acne redness post- acne dark marks but it might also be helpful for people have rosacea and I know what you thinking like yeah but mandelic acid salicylic acid certainly those are completely off the table when it comes to rosacea right like we to use stuff like that and that true yes people with rosacea do have exquisitly sensitive skin and exfoliating acids like salicylic acid and even mandelic acid possibly can end up being too irritating but they also can be beneficial for rosacea because they can help cut down on deodex mites which are a big problem with rosacea so they may also help in that regard smoothing out the skin surface and with consistent use that ultimately helps with better barrier function provided you tolerate which with rosacea is going to be a very individualized outcome so that has oat kernel extract in it which is very moisturizing hydrating and soothing and it has um sodium hyaluronate the salt is of Hy IC acid which is hydrating so those things alone are are definitely also going to complement potential benefits to the moisture barrier from tranexamic Acid um and ultimately help out with just evening out skin tone so those are two options right there all that to say it expectations with regards to Tropic tropical with regards to topical tranexamic acid it it it it shows promise but more research is needed I think it tolerated ingredient though so it makes sense that a lot of people appreciate Improvement in skin tone using it there effective when given systemically to treat melasma and this may be you know TR topical tranexamic acid is kind of viewed at least for melasma and hyperpigmentation as an option maybe as a bridging therapy because you know things like hydroquinone which is the gold standard for melasma we don to continue that indefinitely and it can be irritating so we like to bridge the person onto something that a maintenance treatment and then come back to hydroquinone if we need to and so during those bridging time periods tranexamic acid topically may be an option especially if the patient is not able to take systemic tranexamic acid that you know it to their medical history the other thing about setting your expectations is to know that with melasma and rosacea these are chronic skin conditions while these products ingredients treatments modalities Etc do help in um improving symptoms and controlling they don and so you always have to be babysitting these conditions they don they they typically come back and it requires you to always be on you know two or three steps ahead whether it be melasma whether it be uh rosacea whether it be post acne dark marks or red marks sun protection is key UV rays drive a lot of of these issues not the only cause of these problems not the only contributing factor but a big one and one that you always need to be be on top of and mindful of in order for any of these things to offer any sort of benefit and to prevent the conditions from worsening and or recurring more frequently all right y was informative to you all regarding topical tranexamic acid where we as far as what it helpful for the limitations setting your expectations knowing it oneandone this is the best the worst but likely plays a supporting role and explains why a lot of people do in fact note Improvement in their skin when using it if you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen And subscribe I guys tomorrow bye he

*BEST* Shampoo For Psoriasis | Dermatologist Recommended	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDh8jOSiT7o	Dr Day	if you have scalp psoriasis this this right here is the video for you today I three shampoo recommendations for scalp psoriasis as a board certified dermatologist psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory health condition that affects you internally and it also affects the skin now it can affect the skin in a variety of different ways typically you have these red erised thickened areas of skin with an overlying white flaky scale and it can and often does itch psoriasis can appear on your skin a variety of different locations commonly it appears on your elbows your knees your lower back behind your ears and it frequently involves the scalp some people might initially confuse it for dandruff they can look very similar and they can actually overlap but typically scalp psoriasis differs from dandruff in that you have these very well demarcated well-defined raised red thickened areas of skin with this overlying white flaky scale psoriasis while it it can come and go it can flare when you get sick when you can flare with certain medications it can flare with certain underlying medical conditions depending on the severity of your psoriasis the shampoos I video May really really help control the psorasis in your scalp or it may be something that plays a supporting role and you need of course other treatments when you take care of your scalp as someone with scalp psoriasis you need to know a few things about shampooing that are going to make or break whe whether or not you have success with these shampoos first of all when it comes to shampooing remember medicated shampoos in particular are scalp directed products these are meant to go on your scalp not on the ends of your hair they that out because the shampoos I to be recommending in this video they are on the drying side if you go lathering them to your ends not only are they not needed there but they to leave the hair dry brittle unmanageable prone to Tangles so direct these shampoos to the scalp always follow the instructions of a given shampoo when it comes to how to use it some shampoos in fact all the shampoos in this video will explicitly tell you leave the shampoo lather on the skin surface for a few minutes before rinsing it out the reason this is so important for psoriasis is that the areas of psoriasis in your scalp they consist of skin that is thickened it doesn stuff up in the same way that not psoriasis affected skin does so that contact time is very important for the scalp psoriasis in particular after you let that lather sit on the scalp for a few minutes then rinse it out make sure you rinse it out completely you don need a large volume of shampoo to get all of the scalp so don ton in your palms and lathering it up because that rinse out you increase the chances that you leave behind some shampoo residue and that can be irritating to your scalp after after you rinse it out then you going to want to take a conditioner of your choosing I conditioners in today because we are talking about scalp psoriasis conditioner is not a scalp directed product so pick a conditioner that works for your hair type after you rinse that shampoo out direct the conditioner to your strands conditioner will help to improve the manageability of your hair and cut down on dryness and brittleness that might result from using one of these shampoos leave the conditioner on the ends for as long as the given conditioner instructs you to and then rinse it out completely the other thing this is this is so important okay I know you shampoo recommendations you can the gun though okay you can the shampoo recommendations without knowing this most important thing when it comes to taking care of your scalp psoriasis this is going to be a game Cher for you you have got to avoid scrubbing I know I say that in a lot of videos don at the skin but it why psorasis is a condition that exists something known as the ker phenomenon or the isomorphic response basically anytime there is trauma rubbing excessive friction skin injury that actually causes the psoriasis to come out okay so if you go scrubbing if you try and pick pickpick that flaky stuff off it psoriasis initially it might look good but really what it gasoline on the fire so to speak of your psoriasis and making more of it come out also be mindful in your day-to-day life what kind kind of stuff you are doing to your scalp could be aggravating your psoriasis as well are you wearing a tight hat that puts a lot of friction noticing you breakouts where the Hat rubs yeah isomorphic chimerization avoid really tight hairstyles that put a lot of traction on the scalp tough on your skin that stay away from heat styling don really hot blow dryers that can definitely aggravate your psoriasis in your scalp all right now that you have those pointers what shampoos are there that can help this out you some of these shampoos overlap with well anti- dander shampoos because again kind of as I suggested at the beginning there can be some overlap between the two first one mg217 medicated colar conditioning shampoo colar is very helpful for psoriasis it anti-inflammatory it alleviate the itch and it also helps kind of suppress the abnormal proliferation that is occurring in the cells of the psoriasis spots like I said the skin there is thickened you may not notice that just by looking at it but if you run your hands over it often times you can feel it is raised up cuz the skin cells in those particular areas they dividing abnormally and colar to a certain extent can help normalize that ultimately that psoriasis quite a bit may even thin these areas out which is really good because them being so thick makes it more challenging for your psoriasis medications if necessary to penetrate things that you put on the scalp that have been prescribed by your dermatologist to treat your psoriasis now the downside of using a colar shampoo if you they smell okay colar is not not a pleasant Aroma this particular colar shampoo does have fragrance okay so if you for you but it you use this shampoo massage it into the scalp let the lather sit on there for a few minutes and then rinse it out how often do you use this shampoo do you use it every night no just use it two to three nights a week now I often get this question after I rinse it out do I need to use another shampoo can I use my regular shampoo you can but it necessary and it may make your hair in the long run even drier I would stick to using this 2 to three nights a week the nights that you use it I would just use this as your shampoo I wouldn another shampoo now you any shampoo that you want on the non medicated shampoo night but if you use this leave the lather in the scalp for a few minutes then rinse it out and then shampoo with another shampoo you might find that this ends up drying out your scalp and your hair it can two neutrogena is a 3% salicylic acid shampoo and I know what you recommend that for dandruff yep I do it dandruff and people who have an overlap between the two AKA sio psorasis so salicilic acid you know a lot about already from my acne videos it is an exfoliant and it loves oily surfaces nothing is oilier than a scalp scalp has the highest density of oil glands of anywhere on your body so salicylic acid if you that for it helps to remove scalp buildup to exfoliate the scalp it also has anti-inflammatory properties that can directly help the psoriasis spots salicylic acid is exfoliating so it will help to smooth out and get rid of some of that flaky buildup that limits penetration of your psoriasis medications how do you use this again a small volume lather it into the scalp let that lather sit on the scalp for a few minutes while you and then rinse it out after you rinse it out follow with the conditioner the nice thing about this particular shampoo is that it is free of fragrance so if you option how often do you use it to maybe three times a week at most on the other nights you are free to use whatever shampoo you want number three dermarest psoriasis medicated shampoo plus conditioner now this is very similar in a sense to what we just talked about with the Neutrogena shampoo and that it is a 3% salicylic acid shampoo this one addition to 3% salicylic acid which can reduce the flakiness and can also help calm down inflammation in the scalp remove scalp buildup it also has something called zinc PCA which is moisturizing soothing and anti-inflammatory this is also one that you might want to try if you who has a drier hair texture it little bit more moisturizing hence the plus conditioner for the roots of the hair how often do you use it 2 to three nights a week and again you use your regular shampoo on the nonmedicated shampoo nights for some people these shampoos are going to be enough to really help clean clear up the psoriasis but for the vast majority of people with psoriasis they likely going to need a medication that is prescribed to them to control the psoriasis further so these shampoos while they can be very helpful they often play a supporting role in managing the signs and symptoms of psoriasis the other thing that I suggest when it comes to using these medicated shampoos is take it a little bit further if you really want to get the most out of them and that is especially if you have a lot of hair or you know long hair is to go ahead and part your hair into sections and apply the shampoo to the scalp section by section so you really can get it directly there on the scalp as opposed to just going in and kind of rubbing it all around okay that is another way to really really really get good distribution and then the other tip I have for using these is when you the shower you know it default to shampoo our hair upright but consider flipping your head over and getting the lather to the back of your scalp it lot of hair you have long hair tilt your head from side to side to really get the sides of your scalp and behind your ears vertex crown of your scalp all surfaces not just not only is this a good habit to get into for using a medicated shampoo it into for using your regular shampoo for the purposes of cleaning the scalp when you use your regular shampoo for washing your scalp really the goal is to remove oiliness okay because again there are a ton of oil glands up there and so by making sure that you get that shampoo lather and again you don shampoo by making sure that you get it to all surfaces of the scalp it really can help cut down on scalp oiliness as well like oily greasy hair sometimes that the shampoo over the scalp sufficiently all right guys so that top three medicated shampoo recommendations for scalp C now if you want to know more about psoriasis on the insulate I link one of my more recent psoriasis directed videos so check that one out next if you missed it but if you

Get Rid Of Toenail Fungus With These 4 Easy Home Remedies	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epSKZ5eln4Q	Dr Day	home remedies to get rid of toenail fungus that actually work yes I am filming this video I know I have a bit of a reputation as being one to come on here and poo poo home remedies and natural stuff tonal fungus is a pain quite literally it can be painful to have tonal fungus if you have diabetes pore circulation a weakened immune system it actually can put you at risk for little infections as well other infections that can end up being quite serious so it with but let me tell you treating tonal fungus is is tough uh for a few reasons where it is up in the toenail is actually difficult to access with topical medications that times oral medications are needed to clear it up it comes back over and over again cuz the little fungus can be pretty hearty tonial fungus can be caused by dermatophytes most commonly a troyen rubrum or sometimes troyen mighties but also can be caused by Canada yeast now let get-go these things there are research studies to support their efficacy but they tonal fungus they may help clear it a bit and if you are using topical or oral medications they may help those things work better for the most part these things have been shown to in some cases be as effective as certain antifungal treatments but for the most part they have not been compared to the most evidence-based treatments that we have so keep that in mind okay expectations are key I would never tell somebody to rely solely on these things I would encourage medications about 133% of the general population deals with toenail fungus and here it the toenails end up looking bothers people it they grow kind of slowly takes 12 to 18 months to grow out your toenails but when you have a toenail fungus the TOA nail fungus actually slows down the rate of nail growth even further so it journey okay it do at home though to help clear it up simple effective home remedies this one am like stay away from that tea tree oil well tea tree oil is an essential oil tea tree oil is not one single entity there in tea tree oil and there can be a lot of variability from batch to batch of tea tree oil season to season Etc but there is a randomized double blind study that compared tea tree oil applied to the Nails Plus debed M with um an antifungal 1% clol plus deedman so deedman is them going in there and scraping out some of the fungal stuff from the nail um after 6 months of doing that the tea tree oil group got just as good of results as the clol group now clol isn tonal fungus but in this case they were equal when it comes to tea tree oil though you got to be careful don go out and buy tea tree essential oil and go paint it on there because it can cause a burn it contact dermatitis but they do sell toenail products foot creams with tea tree oil I would suggest using those if you a huge fan of Carousel foot ointment Carousel makes a tea tree oil nail lacquer here a tea tree oil in it but it also has Ura Ura is really good for supporting the needs of a toenail afflicted by dermatophytes because it helps cut down on the scaly flaky stuff that is essentially food for the fungus it hydrates the nail and improves the health of the nail and ultimately it also helps improve penetration of nail treatments whether it be the compounds in tea tree oil or other topical antifungals that you oil compounds are known to be antibac bacterial toenail fungus is not a bacterial infection it is a fungal infection we it is the best thing but it something that you could try at home that is somewhat evidence-based not robustly evidence-based but there is some research there keep in mind contact dermatitis to tea tree oil definitely happens more common if you just got the pure oil and painted it on there but can happen from tea tree oil and products as well so just keep that in mind allergic and irritation reactions are possible so be aware of that but otherwise it safe intervention this next one we can talk about it but man ozonized sunflower oiles reacting ozone 03 with sunflower oil and this turns into this kind of oily petroleum jelly esque concoction and apparently in Cuba this is something that is used to treat tonial fungus and there research to support its Effy so I actually had never heard of this I only learned about it in preparing for this video so I went on Amazon as one does looking to Source things to try out and I found ozonized uh sunflower oil from this brand puro3 clinical studies showed that it was actually better than an antifungal called ketoconazol and that the toenails remain clear for 3 months relapses are common but at least out to 3 months there appear to be no relapses with this ozonized sunflower oil so I went on Amazon and I bought ozonized sunflower oil from this brand pure3 in order to use this you want to apply it to the toenails under the nails and between the toes as well the little spaces between the toes because these fungi they can take up shop in the spaces between your toes if you use it daily you may see your toenails turn a corner that being said it um it was described as petroleum jelly like but it this stuff has the most off-putting odor I have ever encountered um when you first open it up and smell it it that offensive but it really really lingers it Aroma kind of makes you feel like you really nauseous and about to vomit it it makes I can this metallic like Aroma to it that makes me feel very nauseous so buy or beware if you want to try this out it stinks it smells really like now if you have toenail fungus put some gloves on and put it on with gloves that way you don your hands and also you reduce the risk of transferring that toenail fungus to your hands the third less foul smelling intervention that is is another mind blow is Listerine Listerine original the gold one specifically they have a like Listerine I mean it can have to have like 75 different iterations of Listerine get the original one the gold one it called thol in it which is actually anti-fungal and this has been shown to really help with toenail fungus how do you use it you want to do a foot soap you want to fill a basin with the gold listerin to a point where you can submerge your toes and have your toes be covered and your toenails be covered you want to soak in that for about 15 minutes do this 3 to four times a week and it really can help in reducing onicomicosis last but not least is vix Vapor Rub I know shocker similar to Listerine it also has menthol and camper and oil of eucalyptus those things may also offer some antifungal benefit as well take a cotton swab dip it in the vix Vapor Rub and paint it on the nails and then apply it around the nail under the nail really get like good coverage and do this daily after several months you may see your toenails turn a corner so those are some home remedies the other tip that I have is keep your toenails trimmed short if you particular because that will help with the growth you know you want your nails to grow out to clear out that infection and again that them cut short if your toenails are long and they have that mechanical trauma of the nail banging into your shoe it actually slow down nail growth furthermore the longer the nail the more territory for that fungus to thrive so make sure you keep your nails trimmed short that really help a lot also try and keep your feet dry change out of sweaty socks frequently because fungus thrives in a moist humid environment make sure that your shoes fit well that you getting a lot of friction which creates more irritation and moisture and creates a more favorable environment for that foot fungus and toenail fungus don share your shoes or socks with other people cuz you can transfer this to them all right guys so so those are some home remedies for tonal fungus if you want to give them a try they do have a little bit of research to back them up but again don expectations going in and it requires patience because toenails in general they are a slow growing Beast not to mention they are harboring onicomicosis it video was informative I have a video on how to get rid of athletes foot foot fungus same Little Critter but maybe it going to put that video on the ins slate watch it next because if you have toenail fungus there that you could also have foot fungus so watch that one next but if you guys like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen And subscribe I to you guys tomorrow bye [Music]	Success
3 Stretch Mark Creams THAT ACTUALLY WORK	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9xcO0hT2lI	Dr Day	let know I but rather people are searching online what stretch marks how to treat stretch marks how to remove stretch marks how to prevent stretch marks in pregnancy very very popular set of Search terms so here we are talking about stretch marks why do we get them in the first place a stretch mark is kind of like a type of Scar happens in the deeper layers of the skin essentially the dermis the collagen and elastin for whatever reason and some people can stretching or shrinking of the skin that can happen when you put on a lot of weight when you go through a growth spurt pregnancy or with bodybuilding for example when you put on a lot of muscle mass all at once also some people who use steroid creams for a prolonged period of time inappropriately I should say or take oral corticosteroid medications such as prazone also can develop stretch marks as a negative side effect basically the abrupt change the stretch or the shrinkage causes the collagen and elastin to sort of rupture and as the skin heals it leaves behind while a stretch mark initially as this is happening you have a line that is red or purple raised but with time it turns white and sinks down below the surface of the skin now not everyone develops stretch marks it the draw some of it may be related to hormones but a lot of it probably has to do with good oldfashioned genetics it really important to keep that in mind because if you there will come a point in your pregnancy where you maybe friends and family and cousin Kathy is going to start yapping in the background about how she used almond oil from head to toe for all seven of her pregnancies and never once got a stretch mark well Chatty Cathy I hate to break it to you you were not going to get stretch marks to begin with regardless of almond oil okay so just ignore Chatty Cathy in the background remember stretch marks some people get them some people don creams out there that claim to be helpful for stretch marks but there really not great solid research on these different creams and lotions to substantiate many of their claims like any scarring process stretch marks are permanent however there are some ingredients that seem to be helpful for improving the final appearance of a stretch mark If started early on specifically if started when the stretch marks are in that red to purple raised period of time now a big part of why these ingredients might be helpful may come down to Simply the act of massaging a lotion on the skin so if you any lotion or moisturizer that probably going to help honestly maybe by moisturizing and massage you help improve blood flow you help improve skin elasticity so your skin is better able to accommodate the change in stretch or Shrink and of course these things don work overnight you need to apply them daily for weeks and weeks in order to have a true impact there are many popular remedies like cocoa butter Vitamin E oil shea butter and again there research to actually support that these things work but if so and so claims that they were the thing that prevented them from getting stretch marks throughout their pregnancy just remember what I told you some people won marks regardless of what they do but not all hope is lost in two large studies applying hyaluronic acid to the skin early on daily seem to help significantly improve the final appearance of stretch marks great what a good hyaluronic acid honestly go into the moisturizer section and just gesture broadly and you hyaluronic acid is a pretty common ingredient in moisturizers of course you could probably use a hyaluronic acid serum maybe that might be more effective but we don studies comparing different types of products out there a hyaluronic acid body lotion I frequently recommend is the Neutrogena Hydro Boost hyaluronic acid body lotion frag or body body gel cream it your bathroom whatever body lotion that you have read the ingredients if you see sodium hyaluronate which is a salt of hyaluronic acid Bingo use that the other ingredient is prescription tretinoin troin is a topical retinoid FDA approv for the treatment of acne it to treat um fine lines and wrinkles um however in one study applying trano and cream to early stretch marks daily for 24 weeks seem to make a difference in their final appearance um whereas people who did not apply I tro and their stretch marks grew in size as the skin you know continued to stretch so it seems to maybe have a stabilizing effect but the key thing with either ingredient is you have to use them early on in the process once the stretch marks turn white and fall down below the surface of the skin no cream lotion is actually going to address them at that point troid is a retinoid and it prescription medication there are other retinoids and they retinols and retin alides those likely can be beneficial as well but we don have the studies behind them I frequently re recommend the um Gold Bond AG renew retinol body lotion I think it you marks or improving the trajectory of stretch marks once they start forming early on a word of warning though if you are contemplating pregnancy or you are pregnant and you stretch marks you cannot use tretinoin or other retinoids or a retinol or retin aldhy those are not recommended during pregnancy so stick to hyaluronic acid that is safe in pregnancy as far as preventing stretch marks another ingredient that shows promise is cantella cantella is a botanic extract and it may contain hyaluronic acid naturally which is why it seems to um show promise at least for preventing stretch marks now what with cantella I always recommend the L Ro POS coplas balm that would be a good option but you may find um a moisturizer that you like better with cantella it is a popular ingredient in many Korean skincare products if you use these ingredients consistently and you don find that they make any difference or you are going um don or lotions for stretch marks because you that point however there are some cosmetic procedures that can improve the appearance of stretch marks again these things work best when started early in the process rather than once the stretch marks go white and fall below the surface of the skin what are some good options for attempting to improve the appearance of existing stretch marks chemical peels can actually make a difference some chemical peels depending on the depth can help improve collagen production in the deeper layers of the skin CO2 laser resurfacing is also an effective option as is microderm abrasion there and ultrasound and micro needling and radio frequency micro needling which can help quite a bit actually so there are a few different procedures that can help improve the appearance of stretch marks in many cases to get the best results from these procedures more than one procedure may be needed but suffice it to say in office procedures are going to lead to substantially more dramatic effects compared to any cream or lotion out there speaking of cream or lotion I do want to point out that you can use a sunless tanner to camouflage the appearance of stretch marks um sunless tanner will help camouflage white stretch marks so that often recommend people to consider um in contrast I do not recommend trying to get a sun induced tan um not only will that not make a difference because the scarred area is not going to tan that the white part of the stretch mark is not going to tan um so that useless plus it impair healing and you know age the skin put it at increased risk for skin cancer so don bed God forbid or going out and laying out in the sun to try and tan your stretch marks but a sunless tanning product with dihydroxy acetone actually can camouflage them what about silicone scar sheets do those work there any research to support that silicone scar sheets make a difference I suppose you know if you if started early on in the process that might actually in theory make a difference knowing what we know about how those work to cut down on frictional forces on the skin but we don studies to support that they do anything what about trying a micr needling tool at home um I already mentioned that micr needling can be helpful for stretch marks however the most of the at home tools the depth is not great enough it unlikely to do much and I always caution against at home micro needling due to the greater overall risk of infection even when you are very diligent about cleaning the tool is still a possibility as well as foreign body reactions so I don but uh and again many of the at home tools are not appropriate for getting results from your stretch marks all right guys that to stretch marks there with them there with the wanting to prevent or remove them I hope this video was helpful and informative and answered your questions with regards to stretch marks if you guys liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen And subscribe I to you guys tomorrow bye [Music]	Success
Is Betadine Worth Using? Find Out Here!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w1BzT51PKw	Dr Day	what is it about the internet what is it about the internet they something simple straightforward borderline intuitive like really didn need a lot of coaching on this wasn even asking for a tutorial the next thing you know there steps involved there about how if you don you 17 of course there got to buy and try whether it be as basic as drinking a glass of water all the way to these everything shower routines which let me tell you they gotten out of hand people are using not one not two but like three four body washes antibacterial soaps they putting stuff in the private parts that does not need to be there okay what do you guys doing are you cleaning sewers for a living trust me you dirty these over-the-top hygiene routines tell me why people are now reaching for Betadine surgical scrub which is what we today all right it be me ranting although there that why are people reaching for a topical antiseptic used to prep the skin in surgery why are we using this to our face to our face should you be doing this maybe maybe actually despite all my negativity maybe people on Tik Tok are actually on to something like of course over there they know more than any dermatologist could possibly know well here name 48 topical antiseptic that contains povidone iodine like if you walk into Walgreens CVS Walmart Target or wherever you shop you pick up the bottle and you turn it around you poone iodine what the heck is that well iodine is the active antimicrobial agent in this povidone is a synthetic um ingredient that just kind of serves almost like think of it as like a raft for the iodine it carries it and releases it onto the skin it the doing doing the work it of PL a supporting role in getting the iodine where where it needs to be it sort of slowly releases it onto the skin and honestly when it comes to a topical antiseptic to use before surgery before they make the cut all right they want the skin as clean as possible before they cut into you because the last thing anybody wants is a little is a little piece of ecoi on there all right cuz you were one of those who went to the bathroom and didn hands that well and you scratch your stomach and you got you got some Cola forms on there no biggie all right you if they go cut in there and then all of a sudden that really don get it as clean as decontaminated of any Little Critter possible and beta Dy surgical scrub I mean it surgical scrub for a reason it for prepping the skin prior to surgery also also a lot of Critters form what called biofilms like like it just the bacteria on there they they dare you I dare you to try pseudomonas for example is notorious for creating these really nasty biofilms and if you you know it surgery but like these are not really things that are probably going to be an issue for you but if you the ICU your immune system is weak and you know people are coming at you all day putting tubes inside of you cutting into you putting stuff up your nose you know we really need to be making sure stuff is as clean as possible including you know your skin and and as many antimicrobials often are Betadine poone iodine is anti-inflammatory too so you kind of get a two for one there not only clearing out the bugs but you get a little C speaking of calm that can feel because poone iodine as an antiseptic it is amazing because in contrast to other things the bacteria on the skin are not going to emerge as resistant which is a real issue particularly when we critically ill patients in the hospital that steps use reagents ingredients Etc that hopefully get around that not just when we so great you know dermatologists we do surgeries we anesthesia and taking organs out but we do local skin surgeries but we also dip on into that outside of surgery outside of cutting the skin it wound healing cuts that are already there and we want them to close up wounds when you have a wound that like the ultimate example of an impaired skin barrier right it in and bacteria yeast they love that the micro Flora is just going all wonky and the biofilms are filming they a film on wounds bofilm formation is intense and and uh topical poone iodine Betadine can penetrate the bofilm that great that there advantages no antimicrobial resistance penetrates biofilms broad spectrum has that little anti-inflammatory perk and is generally pretty well tolerated overall outside of infection prevention and wounds we also use it for different skin conditions like uh you remember from my video on why your feet stink and you why your feet stink uh you didn it cuz you didn you you didn well they might and you could be missing out on an opportunity to correct that had you only watch the video if you watch the video those of you in the front of the class you are you already there with me you there like yeah I got it pitted Keralis it and the bacteria they break down the Keratin proteins in the skin and create these little pits in the bottoms of your feet and in doing so they release these sulfur compounds which make for an odor that so that might be a situation where your doctor might tell you to get a little Betadine surgical scrub and clean the bottoms of your feet also talk about this in my video on uh what diabetes does to your skin or side effects of obesity on the skin we talked about this toe web space infection yeah um beta dine surgical scrub can be helpful in that situation but also also people who deal with the follicular occlusion issues often can come in thre Hydra antis supera you get boils usually under the armpits in the abdominal folds under the breast between the butt cheeks in the groin area sinus tracks Under the Skin basically like a little pipe that forms gets filled with inflammatory milu painful tender drains fluid that can be malodorous Betadine surgical scrub can help cut down on the bacteria that aggravate that condition and also the anti-inflammatory properties related to hydradenitis ativa is another condition which I will be having a video on coming up probably in the next couple of weeks or so so make sure you tune in for this it cyst basically it lower back Betadine surgical scrub not going to cure these things but it part part of the management plan for a lot of patients with these also another related condition on the scalp kind of like hyr Superior TAA is something called dissecting cellulitis you get these sinus tracts and then eventually you can get hair loss there so why are people who don infection you know not cutting out their own organs why are they reaching for Betadine surgical scrub like in their shower routines is that something we should be doing well you might find that if you use it under the arms to the feet it really helps with odor cuz it antimicrobial cuts down all the burden of bacteria in these areas that break down sweat and contribute to odor so that is one reason why people might be intrigued to use it that being said I talked a lot about on this channel using benzo peroxide an acne ingredient in the same manner that to to get around the odor thing but what about for acne truthfully long long ago a lot of dermatologists did sometimes recommend patients to use Betadine surgical scrub on the face for their acne because it is effective against the acne causing bacteria CU bacterium acne so yeah it can recommend for the most part people use that it acne and we have benzo peroxide which is a lot better of an option why while Betadine surgical scrub is generally well tolerated it can cause a pretty intense for some people irritant contact dermatitis beta dine can be in some cases pretty irritating like blistering rash so there intended to be used to the skin daily in an unlimited fashion it the instructions on beta D it says to use it for like a week at a time so you really shouldn as part of your shower routine also you could be allergic to it although that is really really really really really uncommon beted dine surgical scrub comes out this bright orange kind of rust color appearance so it messy if it gets on stuff it what happened there fortunately it doesn it out of fabrics it does have iodine in it now I don this is super rare you report of it here and there because it has iodine depending on where you using it the nature of the skin it is possible that you absorb too much iodine and that so there has been a case report of a guy who was using Betadine surgical scrub for actually quite a while for his acne to his face every single day no problems for quite a while and at one point ended up getting in too much iodine into the body and having problems with the thyroid as a result if you use this here and there as directed your doctor recommended it it but it because while it because we everybody and their mother use Betadine surgical scrub daily for all of these various in aundry reasons that someone on the internet might claim you should use it all in all it antiseptic very very useful in the medical setting can be helpful for a variety of skin conditions skin concerns wound healing hydradenitis dissecting cellulitis recurrent bacterial foliculitis even helpful as an adjunct in the treatment of a ringworm can genuinely help acne but is not acne treatment and you shouldn over-the-counter acne treatment benzo peroxide is a much better more evidencebased acne treatment that also will help cut down on cutie bacterium acne bacteria all right guys that I wanted to say in today regards to Betadine surgical Scrub but another way in which Betadine surgical scrub can be pretty useful is as a gargo for sore throat not meant to be used every day and definitely only you know when you get a sore throat in fact beta even makes a throat gargle calming down a sore throat clearing up some of the bacteria back there the inflammation anyway I hope you guys found this video useful comment below if you heard of Betadine surgical scrub I hope this video was informative to you all now on the end slight I my video all about another topical antiseptic you may have heard about called chlorhexadine AKA HIIT cleanse so watch that one next if you missed it and are interested in it but if you guys like this one give it a thumbs thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don I [Music]	Success

And chances are you might develop or encounter a variety of skin issues for which people are going to be like, just use calamine lotion. Slap a little calamine lotion on that. problems tend to be those of the ilk that calamine lotion is suggested as the ultimate [Music] remedy. What exactly is calamine lotion? What is it used for? How do you use it? What are the downsides of using calamine lotion? We into this summer skin care first aid staple. Calamine lotion is a shaker lotion. It calamine mineral, which is zinc, as well as glycerin, water, calcium hydroxide, and bentonite clay. There are many benefits to using calamine lotion for the skin. It helps to dry out the skin. So any kind of skin rash that is oozy, weepy, calamine lotion might be a suggested remedy. Calamine lotion also has a cooling effect because as the water in calamine lotion evaporates off the surface of the skin, evaporative water losses help to draw heat away, cool the body. It also has aringent properties, anti-itch properties and antimicrobial properties. Plus, it creates this kind of protective barrier on the skin surface. One of the advantages of just plain calamine lotion is that it can be applied to a large surface area. Calamine lotion has been used for a very long time. It pregnancy, breastfeeding, in children, and in infants. Although, although with a caveat that you have to be really careful and check the ingredients because what I bland calamine lotion. But another perk I suppose of calamine lotion is that there are other formulations out there that add certain ingredients like benzicaine promoxane menthol camphor for example. Who has ever heard of caladril? Caladril is basically calamine lotion with promoxin a topical anesthetic and campher which can have a soothing effect but you have to be careful. These are not something that you would necessarily want to use in an infant. Always clarify with your child safe for you because basically there are calamine lotion versions out there that have other ingredients. But bland calamine lotion is very safe. What might it be used for? Well, you people, as the song sings, recommend it for those poison ivy, poison oak rashes because they are super itchy and they tend to ooze and weep. Oh, it very uncomfortable. The drying properties of calamine lotion are desirable to dry up that fluid and it has the anti-itch effect. Plus, it cooling. So, that cooling sensation helps to calm the poison ivy discomfort quite a bit. Many people also suggest calamine lotion for a condition known as milleria, which is fancy medical speak for, you guessed it, heat rash. Now, I have a video doing a deep dive on heat rash. There variants of heat rash. It is a condition due to blockage of the sweat glands. You get these little itchy bumps. Common in the summer months, especially if you wear clothing that doesn good circulation of air over the surface of the skin. The sweat glands become plugged up. You get this very itchy little bumpy rash. But because of the cooling effect of a calamine drying lotion, it actually can be quite soothing. One of my personal favorite uses for calamine lotion because I deal with this off and on is for that itchy hand rash commonly referred to as pmpilix or dishy hand eczema. This is so insufferable to cope with and I already know I already know a lot of you guys deal with this because of my videos on dishydrotic hand eczema with all my tips and tricks because of the drying effect. It helps to kind of suck out that fluid that is bubbling up to the surface in those little water blisters that form on the sides of your fingers. Plus, it helps calm down the itch quite a bit. So, it can be really helpful for disyrotic hand eczema, which as a side note, often times for many people tends to get worse in the summer months because it is triggered by sweat, the heat, the humidity, the sweat, sweaty palms will bring out those little annoying itchy water blisters. And boy, is that ever miserable. Speaking of summer or skin issues, bug bites, bug bites, bug bites, itchy, oozy. All you want to do is scratch, scratch, scratch. But as you guys already know from my videos on bug bites and itch, anytime you scratch something, feels really good, but it creates a worse situation for you. It leads to the release of little itch signals that sort of potentiate the problem, make that itch more stubborn to heal, to go away. Not to mention when you scratch, you can introduce bacteria into that bug bite or area of impaired skin. You can develop what infection on top of that. Not fun. So, calamine lotion, it kind of draws out some of that inflammatory exodate out of the bug bite, shring it, flattening it. Plus, it creates a little bit of a film on the surface and soothes the itch. A lot of people will turn to calamine lotion for a sunburn because of the soothing and cooling properties provides some symptomatic relief. However, it not necessarily my favorite option for a sunburn because you do end up with an impaired skin barrier and it might be a better option to apply just a lightweight hydrating lotion. Calamine lotion is not the least bit hydrating. So, it preference, but if you find that that provides you some comfort, some symptomatic relief. We talked about dishydic hand eczema. Dishyrosis can also happen on the feet. As a reminder, you get those little itchy blisters. But there is a dishyrosis mimicker on the feet. I mean it mimics a lot of things and that is athletes foot. Tineia pedus a fungal infection of the feet between the toes. I mean super itchy. Calamine lotion can actually be very helpful there. It fungus. You still need to have the fungal infection properly treated. However, it will offer symptomatic relief against that itch, dry up some of that weepy, uzzy fluid that is just quite miserable. Also helps absorb some sweat from the surface of the skin, which ultimately is going to help your cause out as well because trapping of sweat on the skin. It merates the skin. It just allows for a more favorable environment for that fungus to thrive and jive and wreak havoc on your feet. Now, something that children don thanks to vaccination, but I had it as a child. Let me know in the comments if you had it. And that is the rash of chickenpox. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. I remember this being quite itchy. Although I like to brush my shoulders off as an attopic because it really didn was already so used to dealing with the itch of attopic dermatitis. That chickenpox for me was just like another day in the life. And the only difference was I got to stay home from school. So chickenpox very itchy. You don scratch them. They can scar. Also though, those of us who have had chickenpox, we can have that little virus wake back up in our body and get a uncomfortable rash on one side of the body. Different areas can be affected. It video all about shingles. Give you a lot of tips and tricks in there. We talk at length about it, what to know, what to avoid. So, watch that because shingles, it is nothing to mingle with. But the discomfort of shingles rearing its head can be alleviated with a little calamine lotion. What are the downsides of using calamine lotion? It has downsides for sure. It means it can dry your skin out quite a bit. The annoying thing about calamine lotion is while it seems like on the surface a great option for a lot of issues that crop up in the skin folds like under the breast for example you can have weepy uzzy rashes related to candida yeast boils. The problem with calamine lotion in the skin folds like under the arms, under the breast, and the abdominal folds. It say you can unfortunately, it often gets this like very gritty texture to it in those areas and ends up being quite abrasive, which ultimately can aggravate your cause for sure. Also, calamine lotion doesn out well for everyone. Some people find it very irritating and it just ends up jeopardizing the healing process for you. Then there not something that most people want to be sporting during the day. And what happens too that you need to be mindful of when you use it is that as the water evaporates and it it it powdery residue left behind, it has that drying effect, but sometimes the powder um comp the powder itself clumps together and like I said, can be abrasive. So, you need to be careful if you use it and then choose to apply it again throughout the day because you can use this multiple times a day. And we get into how to use it in a moment, but you want to make sure that you take like a damp cloth and cleanse the skin of that older residue because what can happen is you go on, you put a fresh coat, if you will, calamine lotion on top of the old dried up calamine lotion. Well, as you very abrasive, that old powdery residue behind. So, that mindful of. And then one of the things that can happen too with calamine lotion, it powder can settle out quite a bit in the bottle and create this sediment at the bottom, which is fine for the most part. You know, you just shake it before use and it goes back into the suspension just fine, but over time it can form this kind of cakey clump down at the bottom of the bottle, which seemingly never goes back in. A well- formulated calamine lotion, that but it might be something that you encounter, especially if your calamine lotion has been in that first aid kit for the past decade. It to get a new one. Calamine lotion fortunately is very inexpensive. You can get it for a couple of bucks. Now, how do you use calamine lotion properly? What lotion? Kind of depends on what it is you make sure the skin is clean, doesn have any dirt or residue because it it will create a film on the surface. You don irritating dirt residue. So go ahead and clean the area first with a damp cloth, a little dilute soapy water. Pat dry the skin and apply the calamine lotion directly to the area of concern. If you have a bug bite, you can just apply the calamine lotion with a cotton ball or a Q-tip. Just paint it on that bug bite. You don all over a wide area. The nice thing about calamine lotion is you can reapply it throughout the day for symptomatic relief. Now, what are some things to keep in mind with calamine lotion? It it doesn one thing to also be mindful of. What if you well with calamine lotion? You find it irritating, but you might end up getting poison ivy. You want something else in your first aid kit that does what calamine lotion does, but not going to perhaps irritate you. Although, anything could irritate the skin. I suggest as an alternative calamine lotion. What I personally prefer and find myself recommending a lot more is a product called Donuros. Dumber is aluminum acetate powder that you reconstitute in tap water and you can apply to areas where you have itchy uzzy rashes either with a washcloth or you can apply you can do like a soak. Really helpful as a matter of fact for athletes foot disydic hand or foot eczemas. great alternative. Excellent for poison ivy and I find myself recommending that a lot more. Doesn leave that chalky residue on the skin. It to do as far as a drying solution, but overall it here about cuz I think this is one of the reasons why a lot more people these days are searching out calamine lotion is a lot of people on social media are singing the praises of using calamine lotion on the face as a makeup primer. They swear it makeup primer. And I can totally see how that would be the case because it is a drying lotion. So, it helps to dry up oily residues on the skin surface. For people with oily skin, this is definitely going to help your makeup stay on, go on a little bit better because excess sebum on the skin surface, it does lead to, depending on the makeup that you technique and all those kinds of things, it can break up that makeup residue and lead to clumpy islands of makeup floating all over your face. So, that makes sense. However, calamine lotion can be particularly drying um to the entire face. It be used that way. Although, like I said, you can use it to enlarge surface area. So, it can see how that works, but it something I would recommend. I would instead recommend choosing a makeup primer that is formulated to be used on the face with more moisturizing ingredients. Remember, if you have oily skin, oiliness does not equal moisturized, and moisturizer does not create sebum, does not create oil. So, don instead suggest like a siliconebased makeup primer. All right, y what I wanted to say with regards to calamine lotion. It over-the-counter remedy for itchy, uzzy, weepy rashes, skin discomfort. Always read the ingredients first, especially if you to a large surface area to young children. Bought plain bland calamine lotion. Super safe. Has been used for a long time. All right, y was informative. With summer coming up, I searching out information on how to heal a sunburn. I here. If you my video on how to get rid of a sunburn. If you don you say, still get burnt. how to prevent sunburn. Because there are a lot of little things that you might be doing that are making you at greater risk for a painful, miserable sunburn. So, check some of those videos out. I description box. But if you like this one, give it a thumbs up. Share it with your friends. And as always, don forget sunscreen and subscribe.

The Best Skincare From Gold Bond	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJj2fPIAdlI	Dr Day	well hey guys today I sharing with you some of my all-time favorite moisturizers from Gold Bond y Bond moisturizers all of the time and I thought it would be fun to do a Roundup of some of my favorites coming in at number one is the Gold Bond pure I think this is one of the first Gold Bond moisturizers I ever tried out instantly fell in love it is a fragrance-free face and body lotion super lightweight hydrating excellent for dry sensitive skin it has ceramides it has panthenol it has niacinamide which is good for the moisture barrier also good for redness hyperpigmentation it also has grape seed oil and emollient that softens and Smooths dry rough skin and it has gluconolactone a polyhydroxy acid which is not only hydrating but gently exfoliates dry rough buildup in contrast to some of the other Gold Bond moisturizers there this formula I love petrolum it excellent at reducing transepidermal water loss but some people find they don based products feel on their face so if that one out it skin rosacea acne prone skin really it an allaround excellent head to toe moisturizer for pretty much any skin type coming in at number two is the Gold Bond healing sensitive now this is another one that people people who have sensitive skin rosacea it in contrast to the gold bom pure one thing I want to point out about this is it does not contain niacinamide and I drawing your attention to that fact because I know some of you do not get along well with NI cinnamide it excellent ingredient provided you tolerate it this product in contrast to the gold bomb pure does have petrolatum which I love I don overall feels greasy or heavy but I did want to point that out it also has Ura in it which is good for hydrating the skin and improving rough dry skin texture does not have ceramides but rather oat kernel extract love anything oat derived hydrating moisturizing soothing and contains anti-inflammatory compounds called avenanthramides this product has shea butter in it which is excellent at reducing transepidermal water loss and moisturizing the skin for me personally I don difference between the gold bom cure and the Gold Bond healing sensitive in terms of just how they feel look on the skin and their overall performance but they do differ in the types of ingredients that they have and like I said if you sensitive to niacinamide then you might want to go with the healing sensitive whereas if you want to use Nia cinamon in your skincare routine try the gold Bon pure one of the more popular lotions from Gold Bond is their diabetics dry skin relief now this is marketed as a body lotion but truthfully I on my face and I love it it has Ura in it as do most Gold Bond moisturizers which again is really good for improving dry rough skin texture as we age our Skin moisture to stay hydrated declines our Skin Barrier function is not as optimized as it once was and Ura is an excellent ingredient to incorporate into your routine because it present in your skin as a natural moisturizing Factor it can help with improving the water content in your stratum corn and ultimately that really helps improve the natural turnover processes limiting the buildup of that dry rough skin texture now it for diabetics who tend to struggle with a lot of dry skin especially on the lower legs some patients with diabetes you know they have uh sores on their lower legs which I other videos all about the skin signs of diabetes they spots and so they have a lot of issues with the Skin Barrier which allows for the penetration of more irritating things and a tendency to develop allergies more readily to moisturizers and things of that sort but they also need help with hydrating the skin and maintaining the Skin Barrier so I like this product because it is free of fragrance but has a overall nice uh texture and ingredient profile to support the needs of hydrating diabetic skin all that to say you do not have to be a diabetic to use this it is excellent this next one I love love love love because it is a medicated lotion for people with eczema um eczema is an umbrella term for a variety of different skin conditions but one of the most common is atopic dermatitis where you have an impaired skin barrier as just part of your underlying makeup and a tendency to develop these itchy rashes that come and go can be triggered by all sorts of things like stress changes in the weather Etc and a main stay for controlling atopic dermatitis is consistently moisturizing but it condition in which you can easily develop allergy to various ingredients in different care body care products skin care products anything that comes in contact with the skin but an ingredient that I already hinted at loving that I find to be especially great for people who have atopic dermatitis eczema prone skin is colloidal oatmeal it monograph as an over-the-counter skin protectant and it doesn cause the stinging sensation that a lot of moisturizing ingredients can cause on eczema prone skin especially when you are in the midst of a flare up so not only does a colloidal oatmeal soothe hydrate deliver anti-inflammatory compounds but it actively protects the skin which is important for people who have a topic dermatitis so all that aside you don enjoy using this works well on the face on the body this also has a peptide palmoil hexapeptide 12 which can be very hydrating now like the gold bom pure this has ceramides which um for people again with atopic dermatitis they tend to have a uh deficiency in camide production which are the lipids that make up Skin layer and that underscores Their Skin Barrier issues applying ceramides to the skin can help improve the Skin ceramides and get things back on track for improving barrier function now in contrast to the gold bom pure which as a side note would also be a great option if you have eczema prone skin um but in contrast to the gold bomb pure there no niacinamide in this either so if you definitely consider this one um I point that out because niacinamide as a side note is also a great ingredient for people who have atopic dermatitis provided they tolerate it because applying nicomide to the skin can help cut down on inflammation and also improve the production of integral components of the Skin Barrier so it good ingredient unless of course it irritates your skin in which case you want to avoid it and the Gold Bond eczema relief um would be a great option for you Gold Bond also makes the eczema relief in a hand cream that I adore it has a colloidal oatmeal in it but it also very fast absorbing it so if you are someone who deals f with hand eczema I suggest getting a tube of that and carrying it around with you anytime you have to wash your hands apply that moisturizer again like everything I video fragrance free all right moving along to a product that is marketed more for people who have mature skin it is the age renew crepe corrector body lotion now this is a richer formula it not it can use on the face um and in my experience it works well on the face but I do find it a little heavy on the face um again it has Ura so crepe corrector you know with age and the decline in barrier function and a tendency more now than ever as you get into those you know postmenopausal for example years if you of course you have underlying volume loss as well loss of the uh dermal supportive framework components you have redistribution of fat and all those things play a role crepiness but the surface of the skin can also kind of look wrinkly crinkly crepy just because it much bang you get for your buck just using a basic moisturizer I mean it really goes a long way I mean it really can rejuvenate the appearance of the skin it doing it consistently just helps maintain barrier function so this would be a great option like I said it is a richer formula in addition to the Ura it has um Omega fatty acids which may help in replenishing some of the lipids it also has um botanic derived ingredients such as watermelon fruit extract apple fruit extract and lentil fruit extract now if you you may be more likely to develop an allergy to these types of botanic ingredients but they do offer some anti-inflammatory benefits and perhaps cut down on oxidative stress speaking of cutting down on oxidative stress one reason I really like this is it has one of my favorite topical antioxidants UB quinone otherwise known as co-enzyme Q10 co-enzyme Q10 is part of your Skin antioxidant systems helps with dealing with the onslaught of environmental aggressors from UV rays pollution visible light infrared radiation um but of course all of those things can deplete our Skin making it so that we have an excess of free radicals that cause um free radical damage to the lipids proteins and DNA in our skin and contribute to the aging process um applying antioxidants to the skin may help to lessen that overall burden as well as help with inflammatory skin conditions the problem is a do antioxidants actually get into the skin B are we really putting them on at the right place at the right time one of the reasons I like Ubbi quinone is that it actually has a good chance of getting into your skin and it tolerated so so I think this is a great option and you know you don spend big bucks on skin care to get antioxidants to get peptides to get cosmetic ingredients cuz these are not drugs remember although colloidal oatmeal is on the FDA monograph I digress um to get evidence you know to get cosmetic ingredients that have a decent body of evidence suggesting they can improve the visible signs of skin aging and help maintain and promote overall skin Health you don spend big box and these moisturizers from Gold Bond really illustrate that in my opinion all right speaking of anti-aging and you know Decline and barrier function maybe wanting to lean into a richer formula the radiance renewal hydrating cream it has ceramides it has Coco seed butter it has panthenol it has glycerin and it has gluconolactone so remember the gold bom pure had gluconolactone this does too gluconolactone is a polyhydroxy acid it hydrates and it very gently exfoliates it kind of helps keep things on track but is easy to tolerate if you have very sensitive skin generally speaking um this product in contrast to some of the others that I the richest of textures um it has coconut oil in it which gets a bad wrap but truthfully is evidence-based for helping with people who have atopic dermatitis is it also has petrolatum in it which is good for reducing water loss and helping with barrier function now it is fragrance-free but it definitely has an aroma to it maybe from the cocoa butter it like it smells like cocoa butter um so if you have some Nostalgia fond memories of the aroma of cocoa butter I really think you will like this a lot and it also has magnesium and scorel phosphate that vitamin C is an antioxidant with a track record of improving the signs of skin aging however the big question mark is always is it stable in a formula and can it actually get into the skin now magnesium and scal phosphate is stable and has decent skin penetration the question is how good is it in comparison to ascorbic acid um which is like The Golden Child of the vitamin C of anti-aging how good is it in comparison to that probably you know it doesn it in defending against free radicals so love that one and then last but not least I mean should come as no surprise to you guys because it was like a 2023 time goes by so fast all this talk of anti-aging and like 6 years elapses in the blink of an eye okay the age renew retinol overnight body and face lotion now this is a lighter weight consistency overall but it formula comfortable to wear on the face and the body now this is a retinol product so retinol can improve the visible signs of sun damage such as dark spots skin yellowing fine wrinkles and with consistent use may help to improve collagen production in the deeper layers of the skin having a wrinkle smoothing effect retinol in contrast to prescription forms of topical vitamin A has to be converted to the active form in your skin so your skin needs to do some work on the ingredient but it certainly can benefit your skin and improve the overall appearance of the skin um so I really like this myself because it helps with of all of these I most drastic impact in my personal experience using it um the most drastic impact in uh changing the trajectory of rough and bumpy skin so if you have keratosis pyloris consider this one it really good this product in contrast to the others that we should not be used in pregnancy because of retinol retinol is just an ingredient that we tell pregnant uh women to not use due to theoretical concerns around it okay this also has um some peptides in it which can help improve moisture retention and Skin lot of peptides you know the manufacturers make certain claims about them improving collagen production um or maybe inhibiting uh the processes that lead to hyperpigmentation but you do have to take those types of studies with a grain of salt they are cosmetics in my opinion most peptides can benefit the skin through a hydrating effect similar to other Hants though so you know it use peptides than hyaluronic acid then Ura then um you know insert your favorite humant glycerin this also has the watermelon apple and lentil fruit extracts so again that always kind of question like are those ingredients that PO bother people with more eczema prone sensitive skin this has niacinamide in it as well again that spots it for the moisture barrier it um reducing the burden of oxidative stress in the skin it ingredient provided you tolerate it so if you don be careful this probably will not be for you I don use troan on my face and there to double dip um I don don neck the upper chest the forarms you can use it on on the face as well you see a visible difference in skin texture smoothness just a couple of uses and then with consistent use you really do start to see um a visible change and the skin surface just appears overall rejuvenated love this two bits all right y favorites all fragrance free let me let me know in the comments though what your favorite gbond product is maybe there one out there that I or I have not used so I love to see what you guys have to say when I read the comments in these videos so if you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share with your friends and as always don I [Music]	Success
10 SKIN CARE PRODUCTS I KEEP BUYING ?? DERMATOLOGIST @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDNVx047ros	Dr Day	well hey guys i thought it would be really fun to share with you 10 of my most frequently repurchased skincare products products that i have been using for a long time maybe discovered through this channel but continue to repurchase before getting into this video definitely give it a thumbs up if you like skincare content from a board-certified dermatologist make sure you notifications on so you know when my videos go live one product i would never have discovered were not for you guys and i came across it tried it out probably around five years ago and it is one of my most frequently repurchased products and that is the hotta labo cleansing oil i discovered double cleansing through this channel it was not something i had ever really thought about it dirt and impurities a little bit more efficiently it removing water resistant sunscreen without needing to rub and scrub as hard anyways this is the first one i ever tried and it is my gold standard cleansing oil i compare all cleansing oils to this and i love it as a matter of fact whenever i use this product i don if it eyelashes they appear a little healthier they just seem to be a little longer i don less lash breakage overall it has olive oil and a hoba seed oil as the oils and then it has emulsifiers so spread this on the surface of the skin to break up that film then add a few drops of water it emulsifies and then in the shower i wash it off with a mild cleanser always love this and one thing i really wish that the us would follow suit on is that with this product when you go to repurchase you can actually buy a refill in a bag you can pour into this bottle so you don bottle again so that cuts down on unnecessary waste that case with a lot of hot olabo skin care products i have purchased this product from three vendors over the years yes style style vana and amazon and if you like it as much as i do then you get the refills and you have to repurchase the plastic bottles all the time other cleansing oils that i also repurchase the cozy softimo speedy cleansing oil is also great and yeah japanese cleansing oils they where it hmart in your area skip on in there because they often carry hada labo and some of these brands that way you don have to buy it online if you don to let me know in the comments if you use hada labo what is your favorite product the second product that i have purchased numerous jars of discovered again through this channel from cosrx it cream now this has snail filtrate in it i get a lot of comments whenever i share this product or other products that have snail filtrate isn snails it is not the snails are not harmed in the creation of these products because when snails are stressed out are in stressful conditions they emit toxic substances so it one harm the snail they just naturally secrete this and it not harmful to the snail i don ever would have really thought about trying out a snail product or not for this channel but there is some evidence that snail filtrate is helpful for healing recovery and it help minimize radiation dermatitis this particular product from cause i happen to think is one of the best ones out there i biopell is like a medical grade skincare brand i say that in air quotes because you guys know medical grade is just a marketing term but they have a snail serum i fragrance in it and i personally think this product is superior i this product is superior they cause rx also makes a snail mucin serum that particular product is very thick you don thing about it is it when you go to take the product out of the jar so it can be a little messy but i swear when i use that i put it on at night time as a nighttime facial moisturizer the following morning i significantly healthier looking skin i don will tell you this recently i tried out some products from izden which i shared with you guys in review videos and you videos that some of these products were irritating and so when i paused them to give myself a break i came in with the snail and things went back to normal it was very calming and helped in the realm of dark spot correctors i different serums for brightening a lot of great ones but one i have had great success with personally have repurchased multiple times used it multiple times gotten good results multiple times and it is the pca skin pigment gel it is a dark spot corrector that you can use either just to dark spots or to a widespread area it has kojic acid azelaic acid lactic acid and it also has glutathione and antioxidant this combination of ingredients is wonderful for tackling discoloration and dark spots and this particular formulation i happen to think is very nice in terms of its consistency the vehicle for people who have acne prone skin because it and it non-greasy it has low molecular weight alcohol in it which makes it very quick dry fast absorbing and non-greasy and as a matter of fact i have used it in the past at least if you remember a couple of years ago i took a topple on the houston sidewalks which were notorious for being lumpy bumpy and uneven and i got a pretty nasty gash on my arm and that product actually helped in fading some of the post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation from the healing of that i still have a little bit that probably never going to go away but that of course combined with sun protection definitely helped a lot and i got good results on my cheeks beyond what i got with just retinoid alone i had been using retinoid prior to using that product on my face i was getting good results with retinoid first i was using a dappling and then i switched over to tread knowing but when i threw that in it really kicked things up a notch for me and i got some clearance that even after stopping has been sustained of hyperpigmentation that had been lingering around for a while the next one is for those of you who deal with redness whether it be acne redness rosacea redness you need a moisturizer that maybe lightweight non-greasy procure rosicare i love this definitely underrated you can get it at cvs sometimes it that it sells out very quickly and sometimes it takes them a while to get the product back in stock i this product is a very lightweight moisturizer you can layer it underneath the heavier moisturizer if you want it has licorice root and niacinamide both of those are great for redness irritation they for hyperpigmentation and this has a green tint to it from the chromium oxides and that green tint just kind of helps mask the appearance of the redness a bit so if you morning and you tend to have a lot of facial redness you may want to put this on as a morning serum allow it to absorb and dry fully and then of course put sunscreen on over it it works great under rated product i mentioned this in numerous videos over the years products for redness rosacea sensitive skin post acne redness also good again for hyperpigmentation underrated procure rosicare i definitely repurchased this so many times it ointment you guys know i love this product as a lip balm i use it for slugging when i that i took it actually on that long flight to paris and i put it on my cheeks really helped out a lot and my face not getting dry and irritated from a long flight it run i use it to reduce chafing i use it on my heels to reduce blisters i have tried many petrolatum ointments that are popular all of them are great vani ply aquaphor plain vaseline but this is my favorite i love it i find that especially on the lips it gives like a plumping effect uh and i like it i you know it hyaluronic acid in it which is humectant helps pull water into the top layers of the skin kind of smooth things out plump everything up and i think that makes a huge difference it in my head probably just in my anecdotal personal experience using it this one is it one i love and well i i hope they never discontinue it so they make it in this tube they also make it in a jar a word of warning though when you buy the tube version when you first get it it difficult to squeeze out over time the product gets softer and easier to squeeze out but yeah if you have hand mobility issues be aware that the tube might not be the best choice for you if you have difficulty squeezing down because it is kind of hard to get it out in the beginning after a while it this is great for cuts scrapes if you have a lot of irritation around the mouth it calming that down if it saliva collecting there if you get irritation in the skin folds it for diaper rash if you have young children i love it everybody has their preference so when it comes to these types of ointments some people don cerave healing ointment they aquaphor let me know in the comments what side of the what side of the ointment coin you are multiple heads to it it anyways i did review actually i did uh i did a head-to-head comparison between aquaphor and cerave healing ointment so check that video out now the next product is it is is close because it was closed between either this one or cerave moisturizing cream i probably repurchased them with the same frequency over the years but since i had the ointment i decided why not give an og of mine vani cream some airtime love this product it is just a basic no-nonsense moisturizer it has petrolatum mineral oil and no niacinamide no hyaluronic acid so some people find those ingredients to be irritating they this is intended to be used on the body as a body moisturizer i started using this back when i lived in colorado where it for me there i use this a ton in contrast to cerave moisturizing cream which i also frequently repurchase and use the body moisturizer and love this one is a lot greasier so that is great if you have very dry skin if you have eczema it you can also use this on the face i do but you may find that you don it there this feels too heavy if you have rosacea you may find that the heavy occlusiveness of this is just a bit too much for you to tolerate and it aggravates redness but yeah i love this and repurchase it numerous times vanity cream products are pretty no-nonsense and they are free of common allergens so they people with eczema who are prone to developing allergies to certain ingredients like fragrances and certain preservatives so it of products if you have eczema and that cream is great for inflamed eczema active eczema or just kind of maintenance for sure in the realm of sunscreen probably my most frequently repurchased sunscreen is the la roche-posay on thelose melton sunscreen milk i love this for the face the body it fast absorbing non-greasy no cast and it do that in sport outdoors you can rely on this it doesn look shiny on the face but i don about that uh and they make it spf 60 and spf 100 sometimes 100 can actually be hard to find i highly recommend these they you know outdoors if you outside like at the beach or something these are great choices as well rub into the skin well but they don sticky greasy residue free of fragrance speaking of sunscreen this is a product it that i have repurchased so many times it and this is their broad spectrum spf 45 it hybrid sunscreen in it zinc and octanoxade not water resistant this is just a good everyday facial moisturizer it does have niacinamide in it which again helps with redness hyperpigmentation oiliness has a you know anti-aging effect good for the skin barrier also has been shown to help minimize skin yellowing related to sun damage so a good ingredient although i know a lot of you guys don tolerate that so this would not be for you but definitely one i have repurchased numerous times this and they make this in a tinted version i love the tinted version it the tinted one happens to be spf 46 but otherwise they aside from the tint a word of warning these both both this one and the tinted one they have this kind of odd pool float type odor but that fades very quickly it doesn kind of like it but it freaks some people out that is one i go back to time and time again uh it sunscreen so there is going to be a cast to it if you have a deep skin tone it going to leave you know that kind of ashen lavender type look to the skin it basically cast free um although i later on discovered epions epione called i not nearly as many times as dermatology because i discovered epionce later on the epionce one um per ounce is actually a little bit less expensive and a very similar non-tinted product so very similar to to this spf 45 one neutrogena hydro boost extra dry the gel cream love this initially when i tried it i had five six going on close to six years ago i discovered this i i wasn like the first few times i used it but i later fell in love with it after making it through the jar and it most repurchased products as a whole honestly i go back to it time and time again it very lightweight non-greasy i say to get the extra dry one because it is fragrance free they make another one that looks almost identical but has fragrance and the fragrance is very strong and many people get that one and then they leave a comment why did you recommend this product with such a strong fragrance you the extra dry one it doesn anyways love this love the consistency non-greasy it has dimethicone in it and you know it extra dry skin but if you have oily skin it would like it it also has glycerin in it another humectant like sodium hyaluronate both of those are going to pull water up into the epidermis that helps improve the health of the moisture barrier makes the skin look plumper smooths fine lines out and really helps improve the natural turnover of the skin barrier more efficiently so you get less buildup of dry skin smoothing everything out love this it as much as the aveeno calm and restore oat gel moisturizer i love that product but it is newer in comparison to this so by default i this a lot more than the aveeno calm and restore but both of those are some of my favorite facial moisturizers aveeno common restore is has centella in it and oat it discontinues that and i hope neutrogena never discontinues this i also really like their hyaluronic acid serum that they make if you like incorporating hyaluronic acid serums into your routine i have repurchased that a fair number of times um it to the gel cream so not as many times but they they actually layer together well for an extra pack of hydration if you will okay and then last but not least this precedes my days on youtube for sure but definitely one that i repurchased time and time again for the callous on my feet and that is carousel foot ointment this product i telling you if you nail salon and having them file down your callus try this out because it pretty much will eliminate the need to do that for beauty purposes when they file down the callus with that blade it kind of as a response to that little scraping and injury but this will actually soften that callus and help it exfoliate naturally and it ultimately will improve the exfoliation of the skin on the bottoms of the feet helping to just kind of maintain everything smoother it urea and it has salicylic acid now a word of warning about this especially if you are a runner like myself don because it it is that good that eventually you need a little bit of callous there um if if you use this daily for a while you getting blisters if you run a lot so be aware of that you can use it daily for like a week or so if you callous and you want want to start looking better but definitely back down on the frequency of use to just a couple of times a week as maintenance it is expensive but you really don much and once you get your feet to where you like them you only need to use it a few times a week and it for the health of your nail plate as well so that that using for years but again be careful if you run or hike or do any kind of sport where you because you do need a little bit of something something there and if you use that too much you will be prone to blisters anyways you guys those are my 10 most frequently repurchased products this was a hard one to dial down to just 10 products because they for example the vanity vanity cream lip spf i repurchase a lot as well yeah it was hard to come come with just 10 for you guys um but these are definitely the ones that i repurchased the most anyways let me know in the comments what skin care products you constantly go back to regardless of what is new and trendy and coming out that you always repurchase let me know i hope you all enjoyed this video if so give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen and subscribe i to you guys tomorrow bye [Music] you	Success
BEST EltaMD Sunscreens| Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx5NZHyhxe8	Dr Day	hey guys today reviewing elsa md sunscreens i over the years to review their sunscreens you all know i time fan and worn their sunscreens for years actually i think when i first uploaded a video to youtube one of the first videos i uploaded i was wearing an lcmd sunscreen anyways um ltmd if you skincare brand that is sold in dermatologist offices and through certain authorized retailers like skinstore.com today actually sponsored by skinstore.com if you of fantastic skincare brands on their website including my favorite color science you guys know for example i often recommend the mineral powder by color science for touch-ups they also have um another favorite of mine the neostrata defend sheer physical protector i recommended this in my videos on tinted sunscreens it um wonderful consistency and gives the skin a nice glowy look and they also are an authorized distributor of ltmd skin care so if you guys check below in the description box i have a special discount code for you guys to save money on ltmd products and also discount code for you guys to save money on other products off of their site so definitely check in the description box i will have details save you guys some money if you are looking to purchase a new sunscreen all right let out with one of my favorite elta md sunscreens and that is uv sport i bring this to your attention because maybe with this upcoming holiday weekend and throughout summer you plan to do a lot of things outside i like to gravitate towards a sports sunscreen one that now this particular product you guys have probably seen me wear in a number of my videos over the years it what that means is it has zinc oxide which is a mineral active ingredient and then it has two chemical ingredients two chemical active ingredients octinoxate and octi salad so it combination mineral and chemical and i find that combination sunscreens they for me leave no cast but on deeper skin tones they will leave a subtle white cast that for some people is not aesthetically pleasing so just so you aware of that but in general if you see a combination sunscreen you can feel confident that it maybe a little bit of a cast but not like that frank ghost white appearance anyways i have always loved this it resistant up to 80 minutes which is great when you activities sweating a lot it doesn into the eyes it stays in place really well if you wanted to put this on and then allow it to absorb fully and apply makeup on over it i think you would find that makeup goes on over it quite well i sport looks like on here this product is really moisturizing all of their sunscreens by the way are free of fragrance but this particular uv sport it does leave the skin looking a little bit shiny so for some people they don for that as far as from an aesthetic perspective for everyday use but if you be outside doing sports out by the beach this is a great one it very short ingredient list it doesn find as we go through the different ltmb sunscreens uh some of them have hyaluronic acid and others don and for some people they don well with hyaluronic acid so i to continue to point that out as we go along but this one does not have hyaluronic acid in it and it sunscreen that that active lifestyle being outdoors if you is a great option for you the water resistance factor is nice in that it ensures just a little bit of durability in between re-applications but as a reminder you do need to reapply every two hours while you are outside even if it is water resistant and if you get in the water with your sunscreen on as soon as you get out you absolutely need to put more sunscreen on even if it resistant it doesn waterproof it just means that holds up a little bit better in the water because you need that sunscreen while you are underwater you can get a burn in the water so long story short love this it has been a long-standing favorite of mine now you may have noticed they have another sort of sporty sunscreen elta md uv active this is newer and it differs from uv sport and that unlike uv sport it is a mineral only sunscreen remember uv sport was a combination sunscreen so you can see the kind of cast that you get with that now the uv active is mineral only so you more of a noticeable cast for sure with it um it definitely leaves a cast if you have a deeper skin tone you will definitely notice that in my experience using it and in my opinion for my skin tone it as far as mineral sunscreens go it is pretty sheer but you can definitely see it on my skin like the uv sport it resistant and it is like the uv spore a little shiny another great option though for days by the beach doing sports outside outdoor activities unlike uv sport because uv active is mineral only if you chemical sunscreen ingredients are irritating you would want to go with uv active over uv sport uv active like uv sport does not have any hyaluronic acid in it either here guys numerous times but i remind you about its unique features this is elta md clear now this is a great sunscreen if you are super oily it makeup this type of sunscreen is a combination sunscreen so you will get a little bit of a cast but not as strong as a mineral only so it zinc and octaneoxate in it so it combination sunscreen uv clear also has niacinamide in it which is helpful for oily skin as well as dry skin niacinamide however can burn and sting some people so if you niacinamide this would not be your elta to choose you can get this either as is or you can get a tinted version the tinted version is a little on the orange side in my experience but it is quite good the advantage of choosing the tinted is that it has iron oxides in it which may offer some protection against pro pigmenting wavelengths of visible light so if you have a deeper skin tone that heals with hyperpigmentation try the tinted form of this if you to try it because those iron oxides will offer some protection and they can kind of also the tint kind of helps mask whatever white cast you get with it the tint i would not classify however as universal i don i i really just don universal tint is helpful nomenclature i don but uh it is more on the orange side of things when i use it i look a little like i put on you know a bronzer or photon so be aware of that but this particular product like i said for me it kind of find it more on the drying side so if you you i think it works really well under makeup a lot of people who wear makeup love this swear by it so to be clear clear is good if you have oily skin or you super matte finish uv clear is not water resistant it that you reach for for everyday use you can think of it as a moisturizer with spf now uv daily is another similar product that you can reach for as your moisturizer with spf here i have the tinted form for me personally i actually prefer this to uv clear this is a lot more moisturizing it does have hyaluronic acid in it the tint on this i think looks great um it is to me it aesthetically pleasing the tint it it works really well if you have medium to deep skin tone uh the tint and it moisturizing like uv clear uv daily is a combination sunscreen so if you choose the non-tinted version and you have a deeper skin tone be aware you a little bit of a white cast but if you have a skin tone on the paler side you going to notice any cast with the non-tinted one for sure the cast is only going to be noticeable if you have a deeper skin tone um it sheet look but if you have a deeper skin tone you that white white more of a white flash with a combination of sunscreens than than a frank you know white white sheet but it is there and if you have a deeper skin tone i don grab grab for these and then be let down when you get that cast but the tinted form i think would work quite well for deeper skin tones i think it masks that white flash well so give it a try it quite good uv daily has hyaluronic acid if you sensitive to hyaluronic acid you would want to avoid it but for me it works really well i live in a super humid climate so i do well with hyaluronic acid based products as a reminder hyaluronic acid is a great ingredient in moisturizers it helps hold on to water in the skin but it can cause irritation for people because if it paired with occlusives which all sunscreens have occlusives uh so you don part of it but if it occlusives and that water that it holds onto will just evaporate out of the skin and pull more water out and end up leading to more dryness and that tends to be even more problematic if you live somewhere that if you live in a dry climate like colorado for example here in houston i probably could put hyaluronic acid serum all over my body and go out and it wouldn the moisture gradient is you know there go whereas water goes where where it absent see here i mean it so no water would be pulled out of my skin but in colorado the air is much dry water is going to evaporate more readily so i do well with hyaluronic acid based products and that is a great great product for me and i really recommend it it gives the skin a nice glowy look as opposed to that matte finish which i find to be a little kind of at least for me it just too drying the uv clear and i find that it makes my skin look tight look and feel tight whereas the uv daily gives it a little bit more bounce and hydration so um yeah now uv physical was my very first elta md sunscreen and i continue to adore it it is one of my favorites from elsa md it is strictly mineral it titanium dioxide so no chemical filters and it is tinted it has um so the tint as a reminder protect offers some protection against those pro-pigmenting wavelengths of visible light that affect deeper skin tones the this particular product also has quercetin and biotic thioctic acid which are antioxidants i try to not get you guys too excited about antioxidants and sunscreens because we do have studies showing that and sunscreens the way sunscreens work they set up a film on the skin and that kind of prohibits the antioxidants from getting in and doing what they but this particular product does have those two antioxidants in it and i don others have those two particular ones this sunscreen does not have any hyaluronic acid in it and personally this is the one i i used to live in colorado and this sunscreen i used when i lived there it doesn and i found it to be very moisturizing now this one unlike the daily and the clear that i just mentioned this one water resistant up to 40 minutes so a little shorter of a time of water resistant duration and as opposed to the active and sport ones and the spray those were 80 minutes this one is 40 minutes so it you you know are active but not necessarily outside you want a little bit more reassurance the sunscreen is staying on in between reapplications this is good for for that this one is not shiny whatsoever even though this isn sunscreen i with how well the tint covers the white cast on this now if you have a deeper skin tone it will likely leave the skin kind of looking a little lavender so be aware of that but for me personally this one has been a great one i over the years and i did wear this sunscreen actually when i lived in colorado for those of you who don lot of my life in colorado where it this one does not have hyaluronic acid so i it there it worked quite well for me there so if you live in a dry climate this one would be good for you to try i have always found that the uv physical for me really gives the skin a nice glowy healthy radiant look without being drying it is mineral only and i get a lot of comments mineral sunscreens are just too drying this one is not whatsoever this one moisturizing in my experience using it so i would recommend this one if you find that mineral sunscreens are drying try this one out all right next up is uv elements now this is mineral only so if you sensitive to chemical filters this one does not have any chemical filters it is water resistant this one does have hyaluronic acid so if you this one also has a vitamin c ester which is not likely beneficial in the sunscreen to just cut to the chase vitamin c esters they l-ascorbic acid we don actually you know get into the skin convert to ascorbic acid and help with boosting up collagen production and that sort of thing plus in a sunscreen they to get into the skin probably just helps with overall ingredient stability this also has tocopherol or vitamin e so those two things are antioxidants so that about this it does like i said it does have hyaluronic acid and so if you irritated by that you would want to avoid uv elements but it tinted mineral sunscreen all right uv elements is very similar to uv replenish the next one i to talk about uv replenish is water resistant spf 44 just like elements it hyaluronic acid just like elements it elements moisturizing not drying aside from uv clear i find all the ulta sunscreens to be pretty moisturizing all right the next one i want to draw your attention to is a uv restore i have the tinted one here now uv restore is a mineral only sunscreen it is not water resistant so it you know again not something you would want to use if you uh sweating a lot or you know by the pool or whatnot but it moisturizing sunscreen there hyaluronic acid in uv restore so if you there you go you have an option here um this one is unique and then it ginger root and i have to say this one really gives the skin a nice luminous glow and i think it square lane emollient um this one they have a tinted version and a non-tinted version so the non-tinted is going to leave a white cast because this is mineral only but the tinted um will leave that kind of lavender look on deeper skin tones but the tint is a little orangey the ginger root in this is moisturizing and it the limitations of antioxidants and sunscreens are that they likely don to fight off free radical damage um but it kind of a unique feature of this one i find across all their sunscreens they like one subtle little ingredient tweak here and there that makes one different from the other uv restore is completely vegan too a lot of the elsa md sunscreens have like beeswax in them and are not but uv restore is so definitely check it out if you are looking for a vegan sunscreen it good all right ltmd a combination sunscreen so i personally find that uv shield is very similar to uv daily except there shield whereas uv daily did have hyaluronic acid which works well for me but if you it then there you go uv shield is spf 45 whereas uv daily was spf 40 a minor minor minor difference like splitting hairs there so i wouldn worry too much about that uv shield is a good everyday moisturizer with spf um and just bearing in mind that if you is in there so be aware of that but otherwise that is yet another good one all right next up we have elta md this is exclusively mineral definitely leaves a white cast water resistant up to 80 minutes so this would be another good one to use if you are sporty outdoors um active and whatnot uh uv pure has the vitamin c ester in it however so if you you would want to avoid this uh but it does not have hyaluronic acid uv pure is actually pretty similar to uv active except uv pure has the vitamin c ester and uv active does not uv active is spf 50 and uv pure is spf 47 splitting hairs they both are water resistant up to 80 minutes so that both leave you know the same cast same strong white cast if you have a pale skin tone though and very sensitive skin like you have rosacea pure would be a good option for you or or i mean really any of these are rosacea friendly but the more sensitive you are you might want to just stick to purely mineral because in many cases people who have sensitive skin they find that the chemical filters and the combination sunscreens are irritating all right guys those are all the elta md sunscreens i hope this video was helpful to you all you know it they differences are just like minor ingredient tweaks here and there i think it to hyaluronic acid hopefully this video is helpful in terms of pointing out those that have it and don check the description box i will put down below like some of these key hallmark features so if you have already forgotten everything don worry it and also i want to draw your attention to the fact that elta md is in fact cruelty free so for the vegans out there lmda is a great brand and you know you as an option for a totally vegan product vegan and cruelty free that can be hard to find so um again check the description box i will put some of these salient features that you might be looking for like water resistant combination versus zinc tinted not tinted um and hyaluronic acid i whatever antioxidants kind of a summary in the description box uh so yeah that is everything i hope like i said this was helpful and don forget check out the discount code too don pay full price thank you skinstore.com for providing that one for sponsoring today if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen and subscribe i guys tomorrow bye [Music] you	Success

from vanity cream that is definitely worth checking out does not get enough attention is the z bar what is this this is a cleansing bar with zinc pyrithione zinc pyrithione is an anti-inflammatory ingredient that helps reduce the burden of that pesky yeast malassezia or piterosperum whatever you want to call him on the skin and that can help with conditions like seborrheic dermatitis it can help with rosacea many of you in the summertime in particular cope with a condition called tinea versacolor that is related to that little yeast you can use this cleansing bar to those areas of the body to help control that issue it gentle it daily facial cleansing bar because that zinc pyrithione is anti-inflammatory it really can also help control things like flares of rosacea and it can help reduce redness irritation product number two is going to be their antiperspirant now this is a tried and true antiperspirant meaning this actually will when used consistently and correctly will reduce the outflow of sweat from the equine sweat glands in the armpit and it gets broken down by the bacteria in your skin on your skin and that leads to body odor unfortunately most antiperspirants can be pretty irritating the um aluminum salts in them that can be drying but i really where a big problem with antiperspirants lies is the fact that the majority of them do have fragrance and that actually can cause a lot of irritation in the armpit that can contribute to hyperpigmentation now how do you use this correctly nobody most people don correctly they use too much of it and they end up getting a lot of irritation and then the natural deodorant people swoop in and fearmonger the aluminum the aluminum and antiperspirants to reiterate is more than unsafe safe ingredient we use it at very very high percentages to treat a variety of diseases of equine sweat like hyperhidrosis you need to apply it to the armpit at night before you go to bed not in the morning why the rate of sweat outflow from the equine dock is lowest at night time when you therefore the aluminum salt and antiperspirant has an opportunity to get down into the equine sweat dock and what this ends up doing is causing that sweat duct to involute ultimately reducing the outflow of sweat from the armpit skin um if you use it in the morning if you use it in the daytime what ends up happening is that you sweat most of it out of the equine duct it flushes it out doesn trickle down in there and then it just kind of sits on the skin with the sweat and that ends up causing a lot of irritation for people and it truly just doesn that way product number three is their aluminum free and deodorant this is not an antiperspirant it sweat out of the armpit but it is a good option for people who are easily irritated by aluminum and no matter how they use it it causes a lot of irritation especially those of you who have hydroadonitis superiority by that condition where you get boils and the skin falls in particular in the armpits for people with that condition antiperspirants frequently trigger a flare and so what do you do another thing that can trigger a flare though is is when you have too much sweat and sweat left on the skin this is why i love this particular product for those folks in particular it is a gel formula that you can just wipe on the surface of the skin to remove that sweat this product is actually moisturizing it helps remove some of the excess sweat off the surface of the skin it doesn outflow but it just helps remove sweat off the surface of the skin and it moisturizing and so those two things can actually help you out a lot if you deal with hydranitis superior teeva in the armpits the action of removing the sweat which in and of itself is if it is irritating plus the moisturizing component helps keep your armpit skin acting like a better barrier to irritants getting in and helping retain water and just improve overall overall function and also the other reason why it you know have that moisturizing piece on board is that uh not only does sweat impair the moisture barrier but you friction you friction that too causes irritation this offers a little bit of lubrication to reduce those frictional forces that can further aggravate the hiddenitis product number four is the vani cream moisturizing skin cream this is something i don that much anymore but when i lived in colorado i could not live without this product it was you know colorado has a very dry climate here in houston i don use something this thick this is a really thick cream it is a go-to recommendation for people with eczema when the skin is raw red weepy rashy because it creates a seal to water loss from from those lesions and just helps improve barrier function the second ingredient in this is petrolatum so that really helps reduce water loss out of the skin it also has cymethicone which is a silicone that really helps also reduce water loss from the skin but kind of gives a little bit of slip and smooths down skin edges as well can you use this on the face yes but it is very heavy some people with rosacea and acne find that heavy moisturizers are uncomfortable aggravate you know symptoms of redness burning irritation maybe even contribute to flares of the acne so you know try it you can always try any body moisturizer to the face um and see how you do so yeah yes you can but be aware is pretty heavy so moving on to another one that i love from fanny cream it is their moisturizing lotion now this because it lot more lightweight than a cream more water-based more fast absorbing it is not as good in those acute situations for people with eczema when they raw rashy and weepy they really need a good cream that this is a great product for maintenance of keeping the skin moisturized and hydrated it good for the summer time when maybe you want something more lightweight and it really can be used on the face very comfortably for most people because it is a lot more lightweight than the cream you can use this on the face to help cut down on irritation from topicals like tretinoin for example i find i recommend this a fair amount this is also a good choice for those of you who have who are on accutane dealing with a lot of dryness this is a great one very very moisturizing really helps act as a barrier as you are adjusting to that medication and dealing with the retinoid dermatitis and that you know your face kind of just looks that has that red look when you accutane product number six i reviewed a while back it that weren uh medically oriented we they if this were any other brand they would have marketed this as a serum a barrier repairing serum that how they would have marketed it this is their daily facial moisturizer it has hyaluronic acid a humectant that help can help add hydrate help hold on to water in the skin and smooth out wrinkles and fine lines and it also has ceramides similar to the cerave products which help your moisture barrier kind of recover a little bit better there actually some mounting evidence that ceramides applied exogenously can also help reduce some of the burden of uv damage from ultra from the sun this also has squalane and amalia that kind of in my opinion gives the skin a nice glowy look to it it for people who have you know any skin condition but i find that this is a great product to use like first thing in the morning if you find that you like to use a moisturizer and you find that your sunscreen is just not quite moisturizing enough this is great to use underneath sunscreen if you definitely check out my full review on it all right product number seven is the vani cream gentle facial cleanser i of this because it have a cocoa middle propyl betaine which can crop up and a lot of you know gentle creamy cleansers not a bad ingredient but people do become allergic to that so if you do have an allergy to coconut purple beta and then dandy cream fannie cream has your back it does have alkyl glucosides which are again not bad but do be aware some people have started developing allergies to those as well see you can thing as a hypo you know hypoallergenic is kind of a vague nebulous term because you can become allergic to anything but overall this is pretty low risk very gentle cleanser great for removing dirt cosmetics reducing the burden of particulate matter from pollution on the skin that contributes to free radical damage cleansing the skin is really important but you can easily overdo it and if you use a cleanser that it can really lead to actually a lot of problems for you dry out the skin too much cause irritation and aggravate acne so it when it comes to cleansing you don want to do it too much and you choose the right cleanser this is a good one i recommend it to many people including people with eczema who are some of the most sensitive to to cleansers because they impairment a baseline and cleansing kind of you know remove some of your natural lipids as is you know when it comes to body wash i always kind of encourage people to be on the more conservative side with the volume of body wash that they people tend to use too much this can actually dry out the skin truthfully you do not really need to be using body wash or soap to like the extremities or the back so most people use too much body wash they like that sudsy lathery whatever and they can you they end up using too large of a volume too much surface area they and it a lot of money long term when it comes to body wash um but you do need to use you know body wash or soap to remove any you know dirt that you can see you know visibly soiled areas in the skin folds like in the armpits under the breasts in between the thighs where you have rubbing the bacterial constitution you know the microbiome is a little bit different in those areas and more prone to irritation and those bacteria can kind of take over or contribute to rashes you know something called folliculitis uh so yeah and those areas helpful to use body wash but again small amount you don anyways the gentle body wash i really like it drying it body wash all right next up you all know a favorite of mine is here i actually have the box i think it is the vanity cream lip spf this is the golden child when it comes to lip spfs in my opinion because it is actually really moisturizing it it does leave a white cast on the lips but i actually kind of like it i wearing actually right now a tinted lip balm but i some of this on over it so you guys can see um it comes out as a white kind of white this is a new tube i like that it doesn i balms like there that comes out and you supposed to mix that especially those in tube like this anyways see how i just kind of i don change the color of that red tinted lip balm i actually like it now on plain lips you initially get this white kind of color but it sort of fades very quickly and it kind of gives the lips almost a pinky glow so definitely try this out it good as a lip balm but you can also use it around the eyelids just put squeeze a little bit out on your finger and use it to your eyelids as sunscreen all right last but not least is the vani cream sunscreen now you guys they actually didn for a while and they recently reformulated it and i think it i some clips of me applying it on but this is a mineral sunscreen so it does leave a white cast but i have to say for a mineral sunscreen it so in my opinion whenever there is a water resistant mineral sunscreen not only is there going to be a cast but it definitely is the case with this so if that bothers you then you to enjoy this but i like it i find that it wear it eyes if you have a problem putting sunscreen around your eyes then definitely try this out because it stays in place it doesn shouldn has you know very few ingredients that are common it doesn common irritants or anything and zinc is very gentle this is super moisturizing in my opinion it emollient feel i know some of you report that you find that mineral sunscreens are drying this is not drying at all um definitely try this if you that sunscreens burn or sting especially around the eyes spf 50 um it you know it shouldn anything like that um and it does the only sunscreen ingredient is zinc oxide which is very broad spectrum and protects against uvb the burning rays as well as uva those are the rays that penetrate the skin very deeply destroy collagen those are the rays that come through window glass which is you know a reason to wear sunscreen indoors long story short this is a really good sunscreen but it going to leave a cast if you have a deeper skin tone it will be noticeable but i want to point out that if you have some sort of tinted product that you like to use like a bb cream or a skin tint it will go over this pretty well you know i anything like that all right guys those are my top 10 from manny cream i hope you guys enjoyed this video again check the playlist you

so many countries that way we can share some of our favorites together as far as what i talk about on here you guys can access who watch me from different areas of the world definitely check the description box i will link all of these products down below that i what i like about youturan is that like some of the other brands i of vanity cream cerave they don goofiness they ingredients and ingredient quality that ensure skin benefit and minimize the risk of irritation and harm they sensitive skin friendly skin friendly one of my favorite products from eusteren is great for chafing it inflamed skin and it coping with wind burn now that it time of year it this has to be one of the thickest balms on the market it i actually on my feet from time to time or my elbows it no fragrance i is i mean check that out really is putting an intense seal on water loss out of the skin very simple ingredient less water petrolatum mineral oil lanolin alcohol which is a wax alcohol i mean it a very few short ingredient list aimed at reducing trans epidermal water loss so this is fantastic for people with eczema and as i mentioned it good if you deal with chafing like under the arms between the inner thighs especially if you are an athlete you go on a long distance run get this put it anywhere where you tend to have repetitive motion and a lot of friction it will cut down on chafing and rashes that a lot of athletes cope with and plus if you are an athlete and you exercise outside and it you have to deal with chapped skin this is going to be a savior for you highly it it for many many years it fragrance free of course very very rich as indicated on the label i the other day you guys mentioned that you liked that so hopefully it comes out okay all right speaking of dry skin now a product that for super stubborn dry patches like really crusty elbows really crusty knees crusty heels and it toenails your fingernails is the eucerin roughness relief is a spot treatment yeah spot treatment now this product has urea in it which softens those dry patches and exfoliates them it also kind of imparts moisture retention abilities within the top layer of the skin allowing your skin to stay better moisturized long term even when you no longer have this on the skin it also has ceramides in it which help with moisture barrier function you know as we get wiser our skin doesn ceramides and applying them exogenously can kind of help our body replenish them naturally in addition to the urea though this also has lactic acid another ingredient that really good for softening that dry built up crusty stuff now i mentioned that this is really good for the nails toenails fingernails and specifically what i like about it is basically the applicator it you know the bottle so you can very nicely just dispense this to a tiny amount to your nails and massage it in and around the nail and what this will help with is first of all it will just kind of help soften dry dry crusty stuff around the nail if you have cuticles that are just you know not behaving well you nails this can help and it will help the health of the nail plate if you have brittle nails it can help strengthen the nail plate with long-term consistent use honestly i had a really hard time choosing just 10 eucerin products if you guys are wondering about other user end products like are they good the answer is yes i mean it was really hard for me to to distill this down into just 10 products they have a lot of good facial cleansers probably one of my favorites from them is their gentle hydrating cleanser i highly recommend this for anybody who has tried a lot of you know gentle cleansers is trying to find a good gentle cleanser but your experience in choosing a gentle cleanser has always been like that they just don like sunscreen and makeup and stuff like that it has sodium laureth sulfate which is a mild surfactant it can be a little on the drying side but overall this is formulated very well and is non-irritating so it lot of makeup if you sunscreen it will help remove those now of course you might need to use a cleansing balm or a makeup remover if you but you guys know i i don like that i do wear water resistant sunscreen though and i getting it off with this very good it doesn around the eyes of course don put it in your eye but it doesn eyes um it and you know it too as are you know most of the pretty much all of the eastern products are a good price point in my opinion yeah they also have like a redness relieving cleanser that i just chose this because it i had such a great experience with that i have to call it out because it a really good one all right i mentioned you know wearing sunscreen daily this is an og product for me goes back to like my freshman year of college i wore this all through college and i mean i i continue to wear it it share this on my instagram recently actually uh if you guys you know do instagram definitely follow me over there but it their um daily protection spf 30 face lotion and sunscreen now this product uh it that means is it has a combination of mineral actives and chemical actives this product it doesn leave a cast on my skin even though it has zinc and titanium dioxide i don get a cast for this i mean this was like one of the first sunscreens that i started using consistently and at that time if it had left a white cast on my skin i would not been cool with it and i would have bailed on it so for me this is never given like a cast that whatsoever um however if you have a medium to deep skin tone you might obviously notice some cast from the zinc and titanium dioxide with this but for me it any white cast with this and sometimes if you put it on too quickly you might get some pilling or balling i have always had that experience here and there with this but overall you know it it well without doing that it might do that more so if you try and put it on over like another moisturizer or over cosmetics but for me i would say 95 percent of the time i get no peeling with this and by peeling i mean you know when it kind of peels up and stuff um so i have always loved this two bits i really think this is a good option for pretty much any skin type you know if you have oily skin dry skin it decently moisturizing uh and you know a lot of minerals mineral actives and sunscreens people can find that they are drying this is not the case decently moisturizing so give it a try i always really liked it obviously you know i it is it is a good one and super affordable wonderful if you have rosacea the other thing i was going to say about this though you know for me personally the only chemical filter that causes burning or stinging for me is oxybenzone and sometimes ava benzone now this doesn but it does have some chemical filters which don any burning or stinging like around my eyes but for some people they might find that to be the case so just be aware of that but it doesn try it on your body people tend to not have burning and stinging on the body the face is just more sensitive so it you could you know use it on your children if you wanted to speaking of body sunscreen this you guys know is a favorite of mine i shared it in my best body spf video it is their daily hydration cream this is a chemical sunscreen so there no cast with this and it licorice root which is anti-inflammatory and helps calm down redness and also helps brighten up hyperpigmentation the licorice root by the way is lizariza and flota root extract so when you see that on there that um anyways like i said no caster this there no peeling or balling and you don realize that you with this it 30 which is fine for you know everyday use i wouldn going to be outside doing exercise for a prolonged period of time in the sun or if you you need a higher spf in that case just by virtue of the way people apply it you may be wondering can you use this on the face i have used this on my face and found that it worked wonderfully so definitely try that as a side note you can always use any body sunscreen or body moisturizer to your face some people will not like the way they feel or you know they may find that it irritating too heavy or something like that but always try you know because if it works out great one last thing that you have to worry about in terms of having two products so for me i i so definitely try it out on the face as well very similar if not identical to that product but worth a mention is the next product it is their daily hydration hand cream this product has sunscreen in it but like the body lotion you don sunscreen on it and i like having i actually finding moisturizing hand creams that help with all the hand washing as far as reducing dryness and trans epidermal water loss that have sunscreen in them and eucerin is probably the only one or the best one i would say i put your regular sunscreen on your hands that but this it goes that extra mile this particular hand cream it really introduces a good amount of moisture to the skin to reduce that trans epidermal water loss where people are running into so many issues these days with all the hand washing that we doing and the use of hand sanitizers is that those things are essential don for reducing the transmission of colds and flus but you know with the exposure to water and detergents you are stripping away some of your natural moisture barrier so a key component of hand hygiene is also putting on moisturizer no that doesn the benefits of hand washing in fact if you don more prone to infections after cleansing because it becomes dry and the barrier is just not quite as robust so moisturizing is a key component and not to mention the sun protection piece is also really really key our hands see so many environmental stressors ultraviolet radiation they the you know wind uh pollution and of course uh detergents things that we touch all day that the skin of our hands so quickly wearing sunscreen is one of the best things that you can do for the health of your hands long term i highly highly recommend this product all right use trend has two really amazing facial moisturizers like kind of in the realm of you know what you might consider nighttime moisturizers or anti-aging the first one is their q10 anti-wrinkle cream i adore this i have a video discussing the benefits of q10 or ub quinone and care it shown to mitigate some of the damage from exposure to ultraviolet radiation when applied topically it get into the skin and you know so i i think it thing basically is what i in moisturizer so that anti-wrinkle aspect of this and it has this yellow coloration to it i believe from the uv quinoa anyways it moisturizer this is great for highly recommend this for those of you who describe yourself as having mature skin you know with maturity we tend to we we don wiser our skin doesn dryness and irritation and you often need a thicker moisturizer so this is really good it to put on especially at nighttime um because at night time we lose more water out of our skin that morning you often look like you just woke up because your skin is going to be more dry it wearing a nice thick moisturizing cream on the face for example overnight can really help reduce the amount of water loss and then you start your morning off with skin that state so to speak this is a really good one for that express purpose you also can apply it in the morning allow it to set up and then apply the sunscreen on over it that exactly what i did today what you are seeing on my skin right now is this applied first i allowed it to absorb into the skin and dry fully which took you know i don i put this on over it now the q10 in this is helpful to have on board for daytime use because it free radicals from environmental stressors that i come in contact with it night time when the skin is healing and kind of recovering from environmental stressors throughout the day so i really like it and for an you know anti-aging pm moisturizer pretty affordable no you don be worried about the jar packaging that is a myth or preservatives in this uh you know keep it stable and shelf stable prevent the ingredients from oxidizing degrading and whatnot and then of course prevent contamination so you don packaging i always get that question all right another facial moisturizer that if you have redness prone sensitive skin uh if you have acne with a lot of redness if you have rosacea this is going to be a good one it is their redness relieving night cream this is a more lightweight consistency now this product doesn root i talked about that earlier licorice root is uh good for calming down redness it hyperpigmentation unlike the q10 moisturizer though this is this is almost more of a serum consistency it gel like lightweight lotion which is perfect because a lot of people who have redness prone skin um in rosacea for example they put if they put on a really heavy moisturizer it it just can precipitate a flush exacerbate redness and feel irritating can cause a sensation of burning and stinging this is formulated really for those folks in mind because unlike the i just put it over the over the uh over the original healing ointment anyways unlike the q10 cream it it but it is very moisturizing reduces that trans epidermal water loss and ultimately can calm down redness and improve hyperpigmentation via the licorice root so that is a really great user and product again you don about the jar packaging because it that keep everything super stable now the last two products are for body washes you guys know i you know i always caution you to not be too overzealous with body washes but they sunscreen from the body and to be used in on visible any visibly soiled areas and in the armpits growing anywhere we have skin on skin contact uh it need a lot you know you just need a little bit most people tend to overdo it one that i mentioned in my recent body wash favorites video or body wash recommendations is there a skin calming body wash it a cleansing oil it soybean oil in it and then it emulsifiers you put this on and it just kind of feels you know like a nice moisturizing [Music] liquid and then it works into a lather and rinses off the skin as it works into the lather you know it any dirt pollutants whatnot and then you just rinse that away minimal damp uh dryness irritation after bathing with this it eczema prone skin in particular um i really like it and i like it because even though it doesn or anything like that and it may be wondering can you use that since i mentioned it can you use it on your face burns like the dickens if you get it near your eyes yeah burns like the dickens if you get it in your eyes so i pretty much just use it on my body but you can use it you know on your face if you wanted to just avoiding the eyes area but one that you definitely can use on your face as a face wash and a body wash and a shampoo is the eucerin baby wash and shampoo i can featured this in but you several videos i think it maybe in my sensitive skin favorites or something like that i can this is a very very very gentle cleanser you can use it on the face the body and while it is really going to impart adequate cleansing for my scalp needs i have a pretty oily scalp if you tend to have a drier scalp or a coarser hair type that is prone to dryness and breakage definitely try this out because it is helpful for just gentle mild cleansing without overdoing it in terms of your hair and you know drying out your hair too much it um has decimal glucoside which is an alkyl glucoside a very very mild surfactant that helps with removing dirt and things like that and it doesn it also has shea butter in it to impart some moisture in the skin with cleansing to kind of mitigate some of the damage that occurs with cleansing you know as you disrupting the moisture barrier it that shea butter in there so this is a great one and it for babies because it is a tear-free formulation it also has panthenol in it which is a wonderful ingredient for reducing inflammation and irritation in the skin very very good so those are my top 10 pics from eucerin i hope you guys enjoyed this video i will again link all of these down below thank you iherb for sponsoring today um you guys know i site as a matter of fact i another order on my herb after i conclude this video if you guys liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don i [Music] you	Success

this portion of today me so much money over the years the very first product should comes no surprise to you guys it is a long-standing favorite it old-fashioned dappling 0.1 percent in the uh efficler branding here this is it exactly the same as different gel it just you know a different company and different packaging even the same price point adapoline is fda approved for the treatment of acne it is a third generation retinoid which is a form of topical vitamin a that unlike prescription and tretinoin is much less irritating so people tend to tolerate it better especially those with acne and sensitive skin but beyond just being useful and approved for the treatment of acne using this form of vitamin a can help in the improvement of hyperpigmentation it also thins the top dead layer of skin and kind of evens it out smooths things out that can help brighten up skin tone also help in removing sun spots so it can kind of rejuvenate the look of photo damaged skin and importantly what i love about adapoline is that it vitamin a that is ready to go meaning your skin doesn anything to it to get it to its active state other forms of topical vitamin a that you can buy over the counter include retinol and retinaldehyde i have videos explaining how these differ they much gentler than tretinoin but your skin does have to do some work on them so they take longer to work and in the case of acne you want something that you know more expeditiously you don want to have to wait for your skin to do something because acne is a skin disease that when it under control can ultimately result in scarring so this is fantastic it product and unlike tretinoin the first generation retinoid adaptolene is actually stable in the presence of another acne treatment benzoyl peroxide i don necessarily brand loyalty to different aka galderma or la roche posay but it people have have it available all right i a fan of the epiclear line in general now this is another product that just doesn are probably fearful of it because it has alcohol denaturant in it but i explain why that doesn in a moment this is the epiclair serum now this product has lha lipohydroxy acid lha is a proprietary ingredient from l and really what it is is just a modified form of salicylic acid salicylic acid is fda approved for the treatment of acne but it can be very drying and very irritating l modified it to make it gentler it penetrates the skin more slowly to exfoliate the skin in a more precise way in comparison to the parent compound salicylic acid it hyperpigmentation and it also exfoliates the pore so it can help impart acne control now this serum does have alcohol denature and i think that but alcohol denaturant as i my videos on alcohols and skin care it not a you know demon ingredient it ingredient it can be on the drying side oftentimes alcohol denaturing imparts a quick absorbing fast drying formulation that is more suitable for oily skin this is a great product if you have prominent pores acne oiliness and or hyperpigmentation it will help in improving those with consistent use it tiny tiny amount to create a very thin film that this bottle lasts a very long time so you just need a tiny film to the tree the area that you to treat like say your cheeks or your forehead um and you can put it on first thing in the morning after you wash your face in the morning or if you don let it absorb and then put your sunscreen on over it and you also can apply it at night time it exfoliate the dead layer of the skin smoothing things out and it also will help in gently exfoliating the pores so with ongoing use you can potentially see some improvement in the appearance of pores so if you have prominent blackheads this is something that can help you don give it three four months but it can impart acne control as well as improve the look of hyperpigmentation and then the third from lara jose telling you guys this line i dual action acne treatment now this product is amazing as a spot treatment for sure highly recommend it because what it is is not only their lha which i already talked about the modified form of salicylic acid that kind of precise in exfoliating the top dead layer as well as the pore but it also has benzoyl peroxide at 5.5 strength benzoyl peroxide can be very drying and irritating but it does help in clearing up inflammatory lesions of acne so red pimples basically that may or may not be painful and it imparts acne control if you use it consistently it reduces the burden of the bacteria that contribute to acne cutie bacterium ingredient but you know like i said it can be super drying and super irritating so this is kind of something you might want to choose instead as like a spot treatment you know when you get one of those bad honking pimples uh to just put it on at night time for example leave it on you know you can wash it off in the morning but you don use it until the pimple clears using something like this when you first feel the pimple coming like you feel it under the skin also will help shorten the duration reduce the chances that the pimple will heal with a scar it treatment you can use it to a more widespread area for sure but do be aware that it can be more on the drying side as with any acne treatment you also want to make sure that you are moisturizing larissa has some very good moisturizers hilarion ultra cream this is fragrance free and it has shea butter in it which is wonderful for sealing and hydration it now i think it with dry skin or maybe that marketing is but it just absorbs really quickly and it doesn but it really locks in hydration into the skin this is a really good product to choose not only if you have acne or oily skin but also you know if you have dry skin it have sensitive skin and or rosacea it time it ingredient list with few ingredients that you know are going to increase the chances of a problem so if you moisturizer the talarian ultra moisturizing cream is a great one if you who doesn although i before jars are not a problem but if you don a pain to to use it pump all right so that moisturizer by la roche posay a favorite the other one that is meant for the body but you can use on the face i successfully many of you guys have been turned on to this product since i started mentioning it on is the olympic hair ap balm this product is a little heavier but still a good choice if you have oily skin because it doesn film the lipid care ap balm is also really good because it has niacinamide and the reason i attention is that niacinamide not only can help redness and improve moisture retention but it also can improve hyperpigmentation so you may be thinking about that you know as a benefit for using it on the face but also the nice thing about niacinamide is that unlike other ingredients that help improve hyperpigmentation it in sensitive areas like the inner thighs or under the armpits under the breast anywhere where you might have some hyperpigmentation from like old acne or irritation that you trying you inflammatory hyperpigmentation the niacinamide will help it can help the moisture barrier function better which ultimately will reduce inflammation and irritation and it can help brighten up that hyperpigmentation again you have to be patient with it nothing y about this for a long time now it their zika class balm this is a product that you don necessarily need to be using all the time but it arsenal if you develop any kind of skin irritation and you need a balm basically to spot remedy that irritation this product is fantastic because it very soothing it has medeca side in it which is derived from centella so medecide is one one of the components of scentella that has anti-inflammatory properties and can help with healing repair of the skin barrier so you can see how that beneficial in terms of a spot treatment for irritation the other thing in this is panthenol now panthenol is vitamin b5 it helps with moisture moisture retention and it is also anti-inflammatory and this product has shea butter i just show you guys how the consistency of this is much different from the other products that i you see how it a of a paste like more of a thick balm this is also a good product for babies who have diaper dermatitis irritation in the diaper area it can help in calming that down and helping with healing you know a little expensive for a diaper balm but that is another way that you might consider using it is for irritation that your children develop if they develop irritation like around the mouth when they help as well yeah children you know they when they teething sometimes they drool more and they develop irritation around the mouth that can really help calm that down and and get things better one that doesn enough attention is from the lipicore line uh the lipikar ap wash for face and body it has sodium laureth sulfate which is a surfactant that is good at removing residues and oiliness i recommend this cleanser for anyone who is going to be starting a topical retinoid and experiencing irritation because it cosmetics and sunscreen from throughout the day now as you probably can figure out at this point i us because that familiar with but check out my video on the best la roche-posay sunscreens because they have some amazing ones in the european market that i that also are are very very good so i link that video down below for you guys but one of the best ones in my opinion is the melt-in sunscreen milk this was one of my sunscreen favorites from 2020. now it a chemical sunscreen so there fast absorbing it doesn greasy residue it can be used on the face the body it doesn and it doesn all summer and i loved it i used it for the face and the body it was great this is yet another tube that i have now because it it be a good option if you are outdoors you know doing any sports or just being outside for a prolonged period of time the water resistance just kind of helps ensure that it stays on there a little bit better in between re-applications la roche-posay makes great mineral sunscreen uh they on thilo this combines both zinc and titanium dioxide i bit on here because on my skin because you guys know with mineral sunscreens they they leave a cast and people don like that this i cast so if you have a paler skin tone this you won notice the cast um it camera especially if i have artificial lighting you the titanium dioxide but overall this is very very very respectable for mineral sunscreen that you can get at the drugstore in terms of the cast it that on the face the body the other thing about mineral sunscreens is that uh they are a good option for people who have rosacea sometimes the chemical sunscreens are more likely to aggravate the rosacea it varies from person to person but if that that so definitely try this one out and be a great choice if i didn products that i today are fragrance free so if you by fragrance you know i got you i got you all right last but not least i actually don they it called melody [Music] melody but this product is great if you have hyperpigmentation either related to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or sun damage that you brighten up this product has glycolic acid and alpha hydroxy acid that can exfoliate some of the superficial hyperpigmentation brighten up and even up skin tone but importantly it also has kojic acid so kojic acid is great for any kind of dark spot remedy it it combines glycolic acid with that kojic acid it allows the kojic acid to get into the skin of those areas better got acne with post acne dark marks this is a great product for you like the like the epiclaire serum it does have alcohol denaturant and again not a demon ingredient but it can be drying in the morning you want to make sure after it sunscreen on over it no skin brightening is worth its weight without sun protection i mean you completely wasting your time if you trying to improve hyperpigmentation and you some you know protecting your skin from the sun because that is just gonna you know undo anything that kojic acid could do to benefit you but ultimately that product is very good you can use it on the backs of the hands if you have sun spots there you can use that like on the upper chest if you have some sun damage from the sun that you appearance of it not inexpensive but like the of a clear serum you only need a teeny tiny amount to create a thin film it spreads out very well and therefore you don copious amounts so don use too much don with the amount that you use and you can make this last a very long time using it up to twice a day daily now because it can be potentially irritating or drying introduce it into your routine very slowly like one night a week at first bumping up to every other night and then bumping up to daily uh daily and then maybe twice daily as tolerated but overall it product and anybody looking to improve hyperpigmentation so those are my 10 favorite products from la roche posay i hope you guys enjoyed this video don it will save yourself quite a bit of cash you get more rewards points and you can get gift cards so it really saved me a lot um if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen and subscribe i guys tomorrow bye [Music]

Top 10 WORST SKIN CARE TRENDS OF 2020| Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlMzeNNHkss	Dr Day	well hey guys in today to be covering what in my opinion are the 10 worst skincare trends from 2020 stuff that is just cringe-worthy if you andrea i dermatologist and a content creator i would love it if you would subscribe and stick around for 2021 and years to come all right this year was chaotic to say the least there was a lot of distress anxiety you you know how the year went i don point by point but the skin care world had some winter winter chicken dinners going on all right i would say starting off one thing that was really popular this year was a new social media app tick tock yours truly hasn few tick tocks but whatever one thing that appeared on there that i got to talk about because it is skin gritting yes gritting g-r-i-t-t-i-n-g this isn to 20 20 but it gained a lot of popularity with tick-tock a lot of people were doing it what exactly is it it basically involves rubbing oil and clay on your skin in an effort to remove blackheads and people there are a few approaches that you can take you can rub oil on your skin first then use a clay mask and then repeat with more oil and by rubbing the skin people get this stuff out that they believe is the contents of their pores or blackheads there your face in oil you go to bed at night and then you wake up the following morning and use an oil cleanser and then lastly there is an oil acid oil method people believe that they their blackheads by rubbing clay and oil on their skin but they and they show this stuff that they think has come out of the pores on their hands and images and trigger warning i it here so if you just look down i and yeah but if you actually look at this stuff that they much too large to represent something that came out of came out of one that large second of all why are blackheads black they because it accumulated within the pore and when it is exposed to air it oxidizes and turns black so the contents of the pore that that blackhead should really only be black uh at the most the part most super superficial the part deep down is protected from air and shouldn and so the stuff that they is black through and through um from from head to tail and that doesn uh you know air doesn far into your pore to oxidize that keratinous material so really what the stuff is that they off is really just a combination of the clay and oil clumping together or the clay and product and maybe some oils off the skin and yeah maybe a few dead skin cells either from the surface of the skin or you know perhaps some stuff is being extruded from the pore but that long black thing that they it contents you know there are a lot of great clay masks out there that you can use to help absorb oil up out of the pore and they can help but if you go rubbing the clay on your face and this massage like you know massaging it on your skin it can create micro tears it kind of abrasive and plus with the oil that too can also aggravate people with acne prone skin cause flares of acne i just it good idea and it makes no sense and it you know it mirrors show there don the internet and there are a lot of things on tick tock that are just yeah not reproducible trend number two that got on my nerves this year although definitely not new to 2020 and you and 22 et cetera et cetera is celebrity skin care celebrity back beauty has been a thing for a long time it a very effective marketing tool and for celebrities it is a great way to make money especially as in the case for most celebrities if you are good looking all right yeah this year we saw skincare from rihanna jlo pharrell this gal emily ratajkowski i think she alicia keys and carmen electra all really beautiful people as a side note carmen elektra in an interview noted that she uses one of my favorite skincare products albaleen and has been using that for decades so just because a celebrity comes out with a skincare line does not mean that it good you know if a celebrity came out with a home catering line and you know promised to show up in your home and make a meal you might be disappointed to find out that really what that entails is i a toastino i mean but but like celebrities aren necessarily chefs like what were you expecting and i think you should think that way about their skin care as well um and you know they do consult with quote unquote experts in the field but like we already know that those experts create crummy products at baseline too so it doesn not free from free from making the same mistakes just because they talented i mean alicia keys her her cream is like pretty expensive and it service moisturizing cream plus fragrance for thirty dollars um you know you wanna try it fine but like i i i wouldn morning like excited to get it in the mail or anything thinking like alicia keys is going to pop out of the jar like a genie in a bottle it all right the next trend this year is really popular in skincare products and it marketing don pollution is a major contributing factor to skin problems and to aging of skin aging airborne pollutants penetrate the skin either directly um you know by coming in contact with your skin or indirectly you know you inhale them um and they actually end up in your your dermis through by virtue of your circulation so they get there they trigger reactive oxygen species formation by activation of aerocarbon receptors that leads to lipid peroxidation that actually been shown to be a major contributing factor to acne yes people who live in more polluted areas that have worse acne likewise also a contributing factor to the severity of eczema and inflammatory skin disease those free radicals they oxidize proteins in your skin and they trigger what called apoptosis or program cell death i mean yeah have i terrified you um probably so of course skincare marketing is going to be like oh now that we the consumer let substantiated and put it all over our products and sell them to people and so you have to be really careful with the anti-pollution claims because truthfully what exactly warrants anti-pollution technology like what exactly is that doing how is it working we really don technologies that protect you from pollution we don best thing that you can do for protecting your skin from pollution is to cleanse your skin at the end of the day you don cleanser to do that the second most important thing that you can do to protect your skin from pollution which is not being conveyed in this messaging is to wear sunscreen and protect your skin from ultraviolet radiation from the sun the reason this is so important is that uv from the sun plus pollution they exhibit synergy in terms of the damaging effects on the skin that they that they cause uh you know uv generates free radicals plus pollution free radicals you know even more damage so protecting your skin from ultraviolet radiation can help mitigate some of the damaging downstream consequences of all of those free radicals in the skin and you know if you work in a high risk profession say for example you maybe you work in traffic you know directing traffic protect your skin by wearing uh physical means like a face shield will protect from uv and from pollutants settling on your skin that being said i look forward to in the future the development of technologies that do protect consumers from pollution and skin care products things that you know might might prevent adhesion of pollutants or uptake of pollutants and maybe more effectively or in a more substantial manner remove pollutants yeah i look forward to that in the future but it doesn and don antioxidants will protect you against pollution either in theory they do because it would help scavenge some of those free radicals but antioxidants and skin care products they ingredients and whether or not they actually end up scavenging the free radicals to protect you it assay that in any meaningful manner this year with stay-at-home orders i feel like people were buying a bunch of stuff they just didn fear anxiety impulse purchasing and of course skincare marketing was all up in that business and you want to know things that really sold beauty tools goofy tools first first one i covered earlier this year uh the high frequency facial wands those acne ones claiming that you know by delivering argon to the skin it whatever and shrink your oil gland and get rid of acne none of that that garbage is substantiated whatsoever and these high frequency wands i mean they they and then the next device that i mean call it a device to me it just looks like something that you might keep under your bed to slug an intruder and it of them look nice like a pretty jade stone or whatever but others just look like something straight up medieval things that claim that by massaging the skin with these tools that you contour you stimulate the muscles to contract and in turn firm the skin this is complete bs for a variety of reasons first of all massage i it very relaxing anything that relaxes you can help improve sleep and ultimately will translate into better skin so that you know i with but this whole idea that you stimulating muscle contraction and lymphatic drainage this is bs in terms of the aging face has nothing to do with facial aging while muscle loss does occur as with age it contributes to aging of the face aging of your face is due to fat loss or fat redistribution and loss of collagen and the deeper uh supportive framework of the skin and of course bone resorption we lose bone with time um the face sculpting tools gotta go cannot with those i mean if you like them if you find it relaxing cooling soothing fine i that relaxes you and helps you go to sleep so long as it which these aren harmful and unless you rub really really hard which you probably not going to do um they to use them fine they don you guys some of these tools they moistnite or something not not inexpensive whatsoever hundreds and hundreds of dollars think of all the sunscreen that you could buy with that all right the next thing that sold like hotcakes especially in the beginning of stay stay-at-home orders but continue to be a hot seller this year in skincare are those skin care mini fridges why why you do not need to be keeping your skincare products in a mini fridge skin care products when they launch they have to demonstrate that they are stable at room temperature and that the ingredients are not going to degrade so the idea that you need to keep them in the refrigerator to preserve them is complete bs unless of course you hokey pokey natural skincare stuff without preservatives in it and you know they that you need to refrigerate their preservative-free stuff to not get bacterial contamination i mean that should that should that should put up a red flag right there that the natural skincare stuff has got to go in and of itself but that i here is not necessary necessary the one situation where i think refrigerating your skin care products is useful is if you have itch if you are itch you have itchy skin then putting a chilled moisturizer on the skin can help distract the itch sensation and help calm down edge but you don need a special refrigerator to do that the one in your kitchen is just fine storing all of your skin care products in this little mini refrigerator and chilling them and then taking them out and letting them kind of come to room temperature or whatever or having them sit out for a few minutes all of those fluctuations in temperature in theory would you know you would think would actually end up being more harmful to ingredient stability in the long run so you know if you like the way they look fine but i did no they and they were really a hot seller this year yeah this year it was like first of all toilet paper flew off the shelves then disinfecting wipes and you know uh yeast for making bread was another hot ticket item and then the mini fridges they just yeah people just i don why that would be something that would first come to your mind like okay i might not be able to leave the house anytime soon i toilet paper i you know for hygiene i on yeast so i have something to do with making bread and i i don that came out a lot this year i mean you saw it a lot is ingredients in powder form not new to this year but something we saw more of like the ordinaries the vitamin c powder this gimmick has got to stop it makes no sense ingredients are not meant to just be sold as powders and arbitrarily mixed into whatever skin care products you might happen to have i baseline is not the most stable ingredient it difficult to formulate products with vitamin c such that the vitamin c actually gets into your skin to do the things that it do adding the powder to a like a whatever moisturizer you might have what your moisturizer don powder ingredients right away not to mention is it going to dissolve properly are you going to get even distribution throughout the product or is it is it going to clump up and create hot spots of irritation not to mention if the powders don efficiently they which can create micro tears in the skin is it actually getting into your skin doing it this way probably not in my opinion the vitamin c powder in particular is one of the most problematic skin care trends it can really cause a lot of irritation for people and you able to do it yourself with the vitamin c powder you they formulation of vitamin c really matters and so the fact that that manufacturers would just be like we we consumer can do it themselves so they ingredients in skincare i mean always it petrolatum glycerin and hyaluronic acid and be done with it oh no we like i don go out into the forest and pick some victim and put it into a tub this year i could not stop seeing wherever i went watermelon in skincare watermelon juice don it you know it or irritation but it water in it but then the marketing they make all kinds of claims about it like oh it all this stuff that like we have clinical trials putting watermelon juice on the skin like no we don so just making this stuff up it come on be real it just water you know it started with that goofy brand that i will the glow recipe people that are you know all about putting you know fruit juice and stuff and you know basically selling you glorified perfume and because they everybody had to get on the watermelon train i mean watermelon juice cream at dollar tree i mean everywhere everywhere this year like enough with the watermelon you can can you know go into a store without being hit in the face with this ingredient six ways to sideways it is c b d okay cbd compelling there on using cbd for conditions like eczema and acne but cbd has not been proven to treat any skin condition and i have seen so many claims out there on cbd creams serums oils etc that it acne it to help inflammation it electro i mean you name it and cbd the thing is they um you know it might be anti-inflammatory it might help calm down irritation but truthfully we don about it in skin care there lot of research that needs to be done on cbd and skin care for topical use in particular what right dose what what are the side effects these are things that we have not really teased out a lot of these products they don the amount of cbd that they claim there into it and showed that a lot of cbd products out there don are mislabeled and don the amounts that they claim that they do what about ingesting at that everywhere too and you got to be careful you know i think people are under the impression that this is 100 safe and of course you know it compelling for certain indications but it harm uh specifically you can you can develop liver damage from cbd and you know the unfortunate thing is that the damage to your liver it the beginning it know if you were being treated with this by a physician they would monitor your liver enzymes and when your liver enzymes start going up it acutely are aware of but your doctor you know would be monitoring that but all these products that are just available and people are taking willy-nilly maybe not they it can potentially cause harm so be careful and yeah i these skin care products and all the claims especially that it treats acne and whatnot you know this year has been very stressful for a lot of people and they lot of skin conditions that are you know they don dermatologists and skin conditions often get worse with stress and so they they and it with the cbd marketing all right and then the final annoying skin care trend of 2020 is the competition for who can make the highest percentage strength niacinamide serum uh you know 10 15 and then this year paula put out at the beginning of the year the 20 percent niacinamide serum yeah all right truthfully y huge fan of niacinamide it helpful for calming down redness irritation it can help the moisture barrier and help improve moisture retention in the skin it can help improve hyperpigmentation calm down you know inflamed skin helpful for eczema rosacea it has numerous benefits but all the studies demonstrating these benefits they use at max five percent uh generally two percent four percent these are effective percentages you don the problem with the higher percentages is that they can be a lot more irritating and so many people have irritation with high percentage niacinamide they get redness burning tingling especially around the thin skin of the eyes or on the neck there better and that is completely false we know for a fact that for many ingredients the higher the percentage you know they end up actually not being effective so the fact that these companies are just creating these high percentage niacinamides they you know create this idea that their products are going to be better when in reality it could just be completely useless and unfortunately you know a lot of consumers will find that a product is beneficial to them and it to that higher percentage niacinamide but it might be some other moisturizing ingredient in the product so yeah those are the top 10 in my opinion gimmicky goofy trends of the year these things they if you juice in it like whatever it if you have a skin care fridge cool literally um and and whatnot so i you that you wrong for doing any of these things but i i marketing that they creating this false idea that these things are somehow better whether it be you know a good looking person selling it to you or you know a powder that is going to somehow overcome the issues of stability in your own hands um or a really high percentage strength product that hasn at all ingredients ingredient claims in terms of treating certain things i mean that very dangerous comment below was there anything this year that in the skincare realm you really thought was goofy or gimmicky let me know but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don i [Music] you	Success
The 10 BEST SKIN CARE PRODUCTS FROM COSRX| DR DRAY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0dv0xMXr44	Dr Day	well hey guys in today to be sharing with you my top 10 favorites from the brand cosrx i know you all really love this series where i go through major skincare brands and share with you my top 10 favorites i have all of these videos in a playlist called top 10 so if you want to check out other brands that i by all means binge away cosrx is a brand that i discovered a few years ago shopping on iherb iherb is sponsoring today if you guess you have never watched any of my videos because you guys who follow me know i have a bit of an addiction to shopping on iherb why you might ask well i er beauty offers the greatest value overall for beauty and wellness products something about shopping on irb it brings about this joy and excitement to discovering something new no matter what your budget is their philosophy is that every customer deserves quality regardless of the price your budget should not dictate the quality of the products that you get and when it comes to beauty you should feel like a million bucks shopping for skin care on irb to me is a no-brainer they offer thousands of beauty and wellness products from around the world and they shipped over 180 countries their quality guarantee is unprecedented and their customer service is top-notch i for going on five years now one of the coolest things about ir beauty in my opinion is that they really are a one-stop shop for all of your global beauty needs they have products from the us korea japan australia new zealand finland and the uae i know you all share my enthusiasm for k-beauty and j-beauty and you can get all of your k-beauty and j-beauty products on irb i get a good sip as always i will link all of these products down below in the description box so if anything piques your interest definitely check there now cosrx if you skincare brand that is cruelty free which i know is very important to many of you and so definitely check this brand out if you are in the market for some good skincare products all right product number one was my gateway to this brand it ultimate nourishing rice overnight spa mask i started using it several years ago and it is a favorite it calls itself a mask but i what it actually is a moisturizer it moisturizing cream that absorbs very quickly it wear it as a nighttime mask because you know the marketing would imply that you should it also actually works pretty well uh if you the morning with dry skin you like to put on a moisturizer first allow it to sink into the skin and then put sunscreen on over it this would be a great choice it ingredient obviously from the name in this product is rice extract now rice is a wonderful ingredient in skin care it help add hydration to the skin it has vitamins minerals that can help with skin barrier recovery rice extracts also have inositol in them which can help with skin elasticity and perhaps help in promoting healing and recovery it and rice extract also can help calm down irritation and inflammation there are some studies that suggest that rice is a good ingredient in skin care for people with eczema it has a healing component to it this is a great product if you somebody dealing with dryness and irritation it oily acne prone skin this product should not aggravate that for you it a lot of irritation going on from topicals it nice lightweight moisturizer one thing that cosrx does better than anyone in my opinion is their snail filtrate products they have two fantastic ones you guys are like oh god snail i have videos talking about the benefits of snail filtrate and skin care products it hydration to the skin there are studies that suggest that it facilitates healing it in the setting of radiation dermatitis patients with with cancer going through treatment with radiation they can develop you know skin problems and snail filtrate has been shown to to promote healing um you products on the market that are kind of pricey but cosrx is pretty affordable their advanced snail 96 mucin power essence should not go ignored it has 96 of the snail filtrate um and you know i mentioned that to be rich in humectants it to have one other thing that snail filtrate has i didn anti-inflammatory so you have that in there and the other thing in this product besides the snail filtrate it has panthenol which i of these products but panthenol is a humectant and it also can help calm down inflammation so it helps add hydration and reduce irritation and the product also has arginine and amino acid that can help with barrier repair this particular product i actually don have it here but you can buy it on i herb i reviewed it for you guys in detail before but it has a nice viscosity to it you can just pat it on the skin after cleansing while the skin is still damp and then apply moisturizer on over it so it really you need something on top to seal in that hydration and those beneficial factors but it is a great product as a matter of fact i have tried um a very expensive snail product biopell you know medical grade and it pales in comparison to the improvement in smoothness hydration reduction and irritation that you get with the cosrx snail 96 mucin so if you are thinking about snail try this out cruelty free affordable so that would be my number two and then my number three piggybacking off of all those talking points would be and i guys before the um snail 92 all in one cream in contrast to the essence this has 92 percent snail filtrate versus 96 whoopee do i mean it missing out that much there in in terms of that but really where this differs is that this is an all-in-one moisturizer it has dimethicone in it which is a nice lightweight silicone that actually helps trap in hydration so it kind of can seal in seal in those hydrating factors to put the brakes on trans epidermal water lots my one gripe with this product oh this is a new tub of it is that you got to be careful i have dropped this dropped a tub of this before in my bathroom and that was a mess so that would be kind of my one complaint about it is the packaging but you can see i mean check out that viscosity there this is really nice you can just apply it to damp skin after cleansing similar to the essence you could pair this with the essence although you know i unlike the essence you can just use alone you don moisturizer on over it you might choose to use another moisturizer on over it but really just you know by itself it quite good it looks you know like something that would feel oily it and it absorbs in the skin fairly quickly adds a lot of hydration it great choice for people who have oily skin that you know you might describe as dehydrated and for me that really just means somebody who has oily skin that maybe is going through a lot of irritation and peeling they need to add hydration in the skin but they don want something greasy that exacerbate their baseline oily appearing skin this would be a good choice to consider especially if you are entertaining uh you know introducing snail into your routine definitely check out my videos going into the benefits of snail and skin care products you know i know it sounds like something that would be traumatic to the snails but in fact it not the process of collecting the filtrate because if the snails were traumatized in any way that actually compromises the quality of the snail filtrate and in fact can potentially contaminate it if they are at all traumatized so they you know not harmed in any way in the collection of the filtrate a few years ago there was a product that cosrx had that i loved and recommended in a lot of videos it was their pha um uh renewal cream i it appears as though they with that i you know i looked on their website specifically and you know it irb anymore so it appears as though they discontinued that now pha stands for polyhydroxy acids i have a video explaining the benefits of that in skincare products but to remind you polyhydroxy acids are a group of ingredients that add hydration to the skin but also very very gently exfoliate the skin and help with skin cell turnover they are an exfoliating ingredient that people with very sensitive skin actually can tolerate and benefit from using so if you somebody who example and you really are looking to exfoliate dry built up dull appearing skin try poly hydroxy acids now even though they discontinued that product uh one that i have recommended in several videos that has polyhydroxy acid in it is fantastic as a matter of fact i would go as far as to say that this particular product the triple hyaluronic acid moisture ampule not only does it have hyaluronic acid it actually it has three forms of hyaluronic acid it has sodium hyaluronate a salt of hyaluronic acid it has hyaluronic acid and it has hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid so you get you know a little bit of variable sizes to really get that hydration in there but it polyhydroxy acids to you know simultaneously along with the aha really glom onto the water in the skin to hydrate up that stratum corneum smooth out the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines and then the polyhydroxy acids also work to exfoliate any dull built up dry stuff extremely gently minimize you know without irritation love this product now this product is something that you apply to the skin after cleansing while it that those wonderful humectants they can get into the stratum corneum hold on to the water and then you want to apply a moisturizer on over it you know i mentioned this product earlier you could apply this on over this is what i would call a moisturizer it really can help in sealing in that hydration and reducing what water loss but you don to just use this by itself uh because it can dry a little filmy without the without the moisturizer on over it all right product number five is one that personally i love and i was a little on the fence about including it in this video because it does have an ingredient in it that i think can cause some issue for people actually two ingredients now the moisture power enriched cream has it the ingredient in this that gives me pause is coconut oil coconut oil i have a video on the benefits of coconut oil and skin care it it eczema but unfortunately it is an ingredient that actually is associated with aggravation of acne especially for people who have you know acne on their around their mouth area and maybe they lip balm we see that a fair amount it not you know a definitive association but we you know people report it enough that it always gives me pause to recommend anyways so it has coconut oil be wary of that it also has propolis in it or propolis extract and propolis is a ingredient from bees rich in antioxidants and things that are actually beneficial for the skin but people can and do become allergic to that ingredient it relatively common to develop an allergy to it but it know are good for the skin bearer it just a nice moisturizing cream it than the um than the overnight spa mask but this is another good moisturizer that you could use to seal in some of these lightweight serums that i you know that i i say you need to put a moisturizer on over it this would work really well and it just it absorbs pretty quickly it richer though than the spa mask so it better choice for people who have more dry more dry skin type mature skin and less oiliness as opposed to the spa mask but both would be a good choice all right so this hydraulium line i mentioned a few of the products came out was it last year and i really you know liked pretty much everything in the line but one another product that has stood out to me as being quite good uh is the uh aqua soothing ampule this has centella in it now scentella is an ingredient that has been shown to be helpful for wound healing and repair it antioxidants something called tri terpenoids and so it terms of potentially fighting off free radical damage facilitating repair and healing in addition to the centella this process process this product also has chondrous crispus extract in it now that extract uh that uh you know from like seaweed that really is good at holding um onto water it this is a product that you want to apply to the skin while it after cleansing you can pat it in or rub it in whatever your preference is and your what you product is an improvement in redness and irritation reduction and dryness and because it it humectants you you know smoothing out of wrinkles and fine lines truthfully i the difference between serum and ampule i find you know in terms of viscosity sometimes ampule is a little bit thicker than serum but that varies tremendously regardless this is a very thin product you do need a moisturizer on top to really seal in those hydrating humectant uh factors into the skin so the scentella aqua soothing ampule was the first scentella product from cosrx that i tried really liked it saw reduction in irritation and dryness they have since come out with a line called purefit that is all focused on centella and they have some great products in that line and what they have something called seca seven basically seven um derivatives ingredients derived from if you will uh centella so you have the centella asiatica you have the centella root extract cintella leaf extract and then they tri-terpenoid components as well though the triterpenoids are what are beneficial in scintilla but depending on how the extract is made it may not actually be that robust so this particular product or line they isolated those and added them back they added to them to the product in addition to the centella extract so you really get those beneficial ingredients in in a more focused fashion and the purefit sika cream is wonderful they really did a good job with this it looking uh you know for a moisturizer consistency wise this is kind of similar it actually a little bit thicker to the overnight spa mask but it too absorbed really quickly locks in that hydration into the skin and i you know you get that healing beneficial properties of the of the centella in this wonderful moisturizer then from the same line you have the from the purefit line you have their seca serum this has the seca 7 like the cream i just showed you and so this is going to give you those seven different components from centella to really have intense focused delivery if you will of those beneficial compounds pine bark extract also which has pycnogenol in it or is pycnogenol and another antioxidant the zika serum however does not have that chondrous crispus extract in it that the um scintilla ampoule has so you know you kind of lose out on the beneficial components of the marine extract in this it scintilla so you know that differ but honestly i you know both of them yield good results results in terms of reducing dryness and irritation and both products are products that you want to apply to the skin while it and then apply your moisturizer on over but both you know are fantastic earlier i shared with you guys a serum from them the um triple moisture ampule that had hyaluronic acid and panthenol and um polyhydroxy acids but a similar product sun b5 uh d-pant or panthenol ampules i just love the packaging on these first of all they know you can put them up store them like that and then it basically a little syringe for you to dispense the product i when you when you buy this you actually get two so you know you can keep one unopened for later use after you finish the first one so i of the consistency it plunge puts out pretty much enough for you i mean i it but puts out really enough for you to pretty much get the majority surfaces of your face you might want to do another pump to also get your neck uh and upper chest these are good ingredients to put in those areas they hydrating calm down irritation and inflammation i always talk about how the skin around the neck on the neck is so much thinner than the facial skin more susceptible to irritation you have to be careful with what ingredients you choose to put there these moisturizing ingredients and these products they side note this this product like the serums is one that again you want to apply to the skin while it after cleansing and then apply a moisturizer on over it i into this point but the number 10 product from cosrx actually comes from this balenesium line and it sika cream is actually the balenesium b5d panthenol cream love this it uh you know obviously panthenol in it it also has hydrolyzed glycosaminoglycans which are going to be helpful for they they hydration it has sunflower seed oil as an emollient very nice comfortable to wear moisturizer for sealing and hydration and deriving the benefit of that panthenol the b5 line the balenesium b5 line products the ampule and or the cream they you have dry eczema prone skin good for rosacea so those are my top 10 from cosrx love this brand these are my favorites and you know you got to be careful of some of the products they do have some irritating ingredients i try and encourage you guys to avoid those that have tea tree oil in them or fragrance just because those are more likely those are ingredients that are more likely to cause irritation and some of them have have some of their products have those ingredients obviously not what was mentioned here but yeah definitely you know if there there that you cosrx definitely read the ingredient list very carefully but these that i mentioned here they have dry skin sensitive skin oily skin you for a moisturizer or you know a hydrating serum now that we you know you may be wanting to really focus more on your moisturizing routine with the humidity dropping you have dry skin if you have mature skin too you know or you know you having mature skin you the moisturizers that you used in the past are not quite cutting it consider some of these products there they can be you know very helpful for adding hydration and if you there who is dealing with a lot of irritation of peeling maybe you went overboard with some skin care products these products especially those with sentella are very good for calming that down and helping facilitate healing and recovery i hope you guys like this video definitely check out the description box if you products i will have them all linked down below and thank you iherb for sponsoring today thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don i bye [Music] you	Success

started my channel i believe i reviewed this product and was not too happy with it but i don formulation or something i swear it totally different from when i originally uh reviewed it and you know i don maybe it or something i don too sticky and pilled but these most recent batches that i had um it maybe they tweaked it a little bit and now it like it i think it if you are you know experiencing a lot of dryness and irritation from topicals this is a good moisturizer to incorporate into your routine product number two is their marine hyaluronics now this is a great product for anybody looking to just plump up the top dead layer of the skin to smooth out a look of wrinkles and fine lines and to add hydration to the skin marine extracts i have a video explaining their benefits and skin care but they are wonderful humectants they have a phenomenal ability to bind water and when as as they do that that kind of helps just a space filling to smooth out the look of wrinkles and fine lines this product has pseudo altero monis exo polysaccharide and fermat so ferments tend to you know potentially be enriched in some of the humectants and amino acids that can help add hydration and facilitate skin barrier repair and it similar to the natural moisturizing factor plus h a um i will point out that this product does have salicylic acid in it now salicylic acid is an exfoliant but i believe in this product it present at a very very low percentage strength and is more acting to help facilitate the penetration of the marine extracts to really get that enhanced delivery but that being said you know salicylic acid can cause burning and stinging and irritation for people so if you try this product and you don get along well with it it could be because that salicylic acid acting you know perhaps as a penetration enhancer is just causing too much irritation for you but in my personal experience using it as a very effective product for boosting up hydration in the skin and improving the look of wrinkles and fine lines another benefit of using marine extracts in your skin care is that they have antioxidants in them so potentially they can help fight off free radical damage that leads to wrinkles fine lines and hyperpigmentation the marine hyaluronics works best when applied to the skin while it that way you really are grabbing on to that moisture on the skin that you know left over from cleansing and really you know driving those active humectants into the top dead layer of the skin to really effectively hydrate and then you want to put on your regular moisturizer on over it to really seal in all that hydration product number three is similar to the marine hyaluronics in benefit it this like the marine hyaluronics is another great product for people looking to hydrate up that top dead layer of the skin to smooth out wrinkles and fine lines improve hydration and overall improve moisture retention in the skin it help in facilitating skin barrier repair but it kind of signature ingredient also is panthenol or vitamin b5 now panthenol i have a whole video explaining its benefits in skin care but it uh like hyaluronic acid and marine extracts really has a nice ability to bind water and add hydration into the skin but it also stimulates skin cell proliferation facilitating repair and healing so it recovery of the skin barrier which you know if you products developing some irritation your your skin barrier is probably crying out for help and panthenol can really help in soothing that and facilitating recovery and like the marine hyaluronics the way to use this product is again after you have cleansed the skin while the skin is still damp you want to just apply a little bit on and then apply your moisturizer on over it to really seal in those those hydrating ingredients and put the breaks on any trans epidermal water loss product number four is a great one for folks looking to potentially boost up collagen in the deeper layers of the skin and improve the look of wrinkles and fine lines and that is the buffet uh peptide serum i love this product i through like two bottles of it myself it is a peptide serum with matrixyl in it now matrixyl is a palmitoyl peptide that has been shown uh to actually it shown to actually get in the skin and stimulate collagen production the data is still you know kind of small on that and mostly industry studies but you know it is a very promising ingredient if anything peptides in general are wonderful humectants you get that hydrating effect in you know smoothing out wrinkles and fine lines adding hydration to the skin this particular product also has the amino acids you barrier repair aspect and it lactococcus ferment in it now ferments again kind of are enriched in humectants and lactococcus ferment may have uh prebiotics or probiotics to it which in theory could help in cultivating your skin microbiome which is very important for you know reducing inflammation and irritation in the skin but because this product has that matrixyl in it you know it something that is going to get you know in theory with ongoing use could give you more of a sustained improvement in the wrinkles and fine lines beyond just that temporary hydration effect if it if it collagen boosting thing that we think it does let me take a big sip of my coffee before getting into product number five their caffeine solution plus egcg this product is potentially beneficial for those of you who suffer from hyperpigmentation because it serum it also is potentially going to be helpful for those of you who have puffiness in the morning because it may temporarily through a vasoconstrictive action reduce swelling and it you have a lot of irritation because caffeine is anti-inflammatory now the caffeine you know i have a video on caffeine it are pretty much temporary it reducing swelling and puffiness maybe it can help improve the look of dark under eye circles depending on the type of dark under eye circle um you know if you have hereditary dark under eye circles this isn know if you you know just kind of what we call allergic shiners from rubbing this might help in brightening that up but the ingredient in this i think is more compelling is egcg epigallo catacan galli that is from green tea it antioxidant that has been shown to improve the burden of photo damage in the skin i mean i am always suspect of any antioxidants but i would say egcg is one of data behind it to support its use and you know the ordinary products are affordable so i think this is a good one to consider incorporating into your routine now this product also has lactic acid in it that an exfoliant but also acts to help with hydration and can potentially help these ingredients the caffeine and the egcg penetrate into your skin better the concentrations of the lactic acid in this are not you know it likely uh to be such that it exfoliating or drying or anything like that it there at a lower you know strength facilitating penetration and potentially adding hydration but lactic acid can burn sting it can cause a little bit of irritation so if you develop that with this you know it could be the lactic acid or it could just be the formulation overall i want to make you aware of that a lot of products on the market will tell having green tea in them or green tea extracts but as a consumer you know you have no way of really knowing okay to what extent does that have the amount of egcg that could potentially be beneficial they don tea is like okay really what you want is that egcg the way to use this product is in the morning you can use it um you know antioxidants are good to use in the morning whether it be vitamin c or you know something like this if you cleanse your face in the morning then just go ahead and apply this to the skin immediately after to you know facilitate better penetration if you don in the morning like yours truly fine just go ahead and put it pat it onto the skin allow it to absorb and then apply your sunscreen on over it you are both antioxidants potentially helping you out in the fight against free radical damage from ultraviolet radiation speaking of hyperpigmentation product number six should come as no surprise to you guys if you and that is their azoleic acid suspension ten percent azolic acid now azelaic acid is an ingredient that we prescribe to patients with acne hyperpigmentation melasma rosacea it hyperpigmentation and it also has it also has anti-acne effects we like it because it is pretty gentle so patients with really sensitive skin tend to tolerate it well although it is drying and can be a little irritating and we also like it because uh we know that it and most ingredients out there are you know a big unknown as to whether or not they pregnancy so we often gravitate towards it when using looking for topicals to treat patients during pregnancy who have acne and you know it rosacea but you know here in the states we have the prescription strength 15 and twenty percent but you it available by prescription and you know insurance doesn cover it and out of pockets they you guys have the fifteen percent and twenty percent over the counter and you can just go out and buy it and why does that matter well the fifteen percent and twenty percent strengths that have the data for these beneficial outcomes we don the data for the ten percent which is what the ordinary is but people do see benefit using the 10 strength and over the counter products here in the states for things like hyperpigmentation and reducing redness so i don it time to use the 10 strength here and it more accessible to people looking to incorporate this ingredient and like i said while it can be a little drying and irritating it tends to be pretty well tolerated what i really like about the ordinary product in particular is that it the azolic acid and then backbone of a basic moisturizer whereas a lot of other products that i like they might have other ingredients in them that you know for whatever reason you may not be interested in using for example a lot of products that have azolic acid will also incorporate maybe hydroquinone or um you know maybe salicylic acid or something like that which is fine and great and you know whatever but for some people you know they they acid as is and i think this product you know it nice to have it basically on the market so that definitely a recommendation for folks with acne hyperpigmentation azolic acid is very stable you don have to worry about other ingredients degrading it you can use it twice a day number seven is a great one for people with oily skin and acne and large pores blackheads and that is their salicylic acid two percent mask i really like this because it clay mask and i masks they help absorb excess oiliness from the surface of the skin and from within the pores so they kind of provide a temporary degreasing if you will but this also has salicylic acid in it which can help reduce oiliness impart acne control it can break up uh clogged pores and uh salicylic acid you know it a very drying ingredient can be very irritating so a lot of patients derive benefit from a short contact time with it which is exactly what this product delivers it you use one to two times a week you apply it to the skin to clean dry skin you apply it to the skin leave it on for about 10 minutes and then rinse it off with water it great way to take advantage of salicylic acid in a short contact therapy you know i salicylic acid and face washes as a short contact this is another alternative more intense going to be more drying more likely to cause irritation but another you know good option for kind of a i guess we would say a medium contact time the 10 minutes as opposed to a wash where it um it also has charcoal on it now charcoal can you know wick up some of that oiliness as well but it can be a little irritating all right product number eight it definitely a little bit more intense in terms of the exfoliating that it offers this product is super popular on social media i don popularity i know actually it coloration of it probably um it solution um you know it some extract in it so it that you know makes for creating entertaining content i think as opposed to just like a white cream that you put on your face the red is like more dramatic anyways this product overall i think is great it is a um alpha a combination alpha hydroxy acid and beta hydroxy acid now alpha hydroxy acids they are ingredients that exfoliate the skin but they so they don the oily surfaces but they do help with penetration of active ingredients it too uh fairly small alpha hydroxy acid so you definite exfoliating with this but in my opinion the real star of the show here is the beta hydroxy acid or salicylic acid at two percent um so it of like a step up from the two percent salicylic acid mask and that you acids in there that really help with the penetration of that salicylic acid to allow it to really get into the pores to exfoliate them to reduce oiliness and you know to help impart some acne control as opposed to the mask we had kaolin just kind of helping to degrease the skin and pull out oiliness this actually because of the alpha hydroxy acids it the salicylic acid get in better and you medium contact time therapy this is a product that you dry skin uh leave it on the skin for about 10 minutes and then rinse it off and you know you don more than twice a week to derive the benefit from it in fact i wouldn the alpha hydroxy acid plus beta hydroxy acid that can be a lot that and there that and do a test spot with something like this first i would definitely recommend that and don just put it to areas that are more oily prone like your t-zone for example if you have dry cheeks a lot of people have dry cheeks at baseline like what are you trying to accomplish here product number nine is an exfoliant that helpful for people with sensitive skin so to remind you so far i about their aha bha peeling solution and i about their salicylic acid mask but those two products are probably too irritating for people with really sensitive skin and you know for people with deeper skin tones if they get irritation from products like that it can heal with hyperpigmentation so a better choice is their mandelic acid 10 plus ha mandelic acid is an alpha hydroxy acid but it glycolic or lactic it you get a gentler exfoliation with it and it hyaluronic acid in there to add hydration so that you don excessively dry and ultimately with ongoing use this can kind of help in facilitating or accelerating the rate of improvement of areas of hyperpigmentation it also can help smooth out skin texture if you on the face this can you know potentially help in softening that and just smoothing out the skin overall gentle so it sensitive skin or a deeper skin tone you don from you know like their peeling solution or something uh this would be a good one to try product number ten i love is their squalane cleanser uh it a video all about squay lane just brag about all my videos why don i anyways yeah squalane is a lightweight oil that people with oily skin tend to feel comfortable using it um and this particular cleanser is soap free which i like and it interesting it emulsifiers in it and it really you know it comes out like kind of like a cream and then as you work it into your skin and into your hands it kind of dissolves almost like a balm or an oil and it really does a good job at least for me and breaking up sunscreen and my mascara i don would do a really good job with your makeup as well and then it rinses off you know this is a good one if you are on accutane if you are on prescription retinoic acid and you dryness or peeling the last thing you want is to be using cleansers but you definitely need to remove cosmetics sunscreen dirt pollutants etc this is a good option very gentle and you know you there to break up uh the the dirt and whatnot and then the emulsifiers kind of help it to rinse off so those are my top 10 favorites from the ordinary but comment below what products you guys like and use i always love hearing from you all what your favorites are you know some of their products i like i have a video explaining the gran active retinoid or whatever so

really enjoying this series where i go through major skincare brands and share with you what i happen to think are their 10 best products and cerave was one highly requested brand if you a popular skin care brand owned by l products have ceramides ceramides are really important part of our skin barrier their fatty acids and they help keep moisture in our skin and help it function properly

because they have so many fantastic products so if a product i if there mentioning it doesn it these are just what i would consider the top ten first and foremost is their signature moisturizing cream in the top i love this it is fantastic for dry skin oily skin sensitive skin you can use it on the face and the body it works really well for people who are using topical medications it might be irritating like tretinoin or topical benzoyl peroxide it really helps address the moisture barrier but it doesn like all of the products has of course their ceramide blend in it it petrolatum to seal in water and hydration and their mve technology is really what you products it affords kind of sustained ongoing hydration for the 24 hours after application so you really do get good moisture retention with this product unfortunately many people for unexplained reasons find that this product burns or stings i have no way of predicting who that so unfortunately that does happen reasons that might happen or maybe just a genetic tendency towards sensitive skin maybe you are harsh and this perhaps has more of an acidic ph so that stings um it otherwise to me is is the golden child you will see it repeated over and over and over again and many of my videos recommending products it always makes an appearance yeah i like to slather myself in this from head to toe when i get out of the shower it really helps lock in hydration it absorbs super quickly and doesn behind definitely give it a try it is worth the hype so that is a favorite the next product is the essay lotion for rough and bumpy skin this is a lotion that has salicylic acid in it an exfoliant and it also has lactic acid and an exfoliant and humectant and this product really helps in softening and exfoliating dry rough built up bumpy skin it people with that dry skin condition keratosis pylaris long story short in addition to using this on the body you certainly can use it on the face and not only will the salicylic acid help with that rough and bumpy skin but if you have oily skin and or acne or prominent pores the salicylic acid can help with those conditions as well so this is a versatile product now this in my opinion does sting and the reason it stings a little bit is because again it hydroxy acid and alpha hydroxy acid can sting especially if you are somebody who has eczema and you patch you will you can expect that this will likely sting a little bit on those areas but for people with a lot of dry built up skin it shouldn fantastic it product is like some other favorite foot creams of mine it soothing foot cream or the carousel foot ointment those are two that i always recommend it has the cerave renewing foot cream has salicylic acid in it which again helps exfoliate that dry callus now the cerave foot cream uh the salicylic acid in the foot cream i would predict you know i to bet it than what is in the body lotion so you don could be very irritating it to really exfoliate callus the skin on the bottoms of our feet is much thicker and can tolerate that so you know keep it keep it to your feet that it also has ammonium lactate in it aka lactic acid um an alpha hydroxy acid that can help in exfoliating some of that dry stuff but also introduces hydration into the skin all right the next moisturizer is one i think i talked about maybe in my 2019 skincare favorites video because i was using it a lot in 2019 it is the cerave itch relief cream this product is fantastic if you have uh itch it anesthetic which when applied topically it can kind of help silence those little itching signals and help calm down the itch sensation and the cream itself is very rich so it imparts moisture into the skin and helps you know that helping to resolve itch is making sure that the moisture barrier is intact as the skin loses water uh it prone to irritation and that itch sensation especially if you have eczema itch is unbearable with eczema but anybody can go through itch at different part periods of time in their life and it is an unbearable sensation but pramoxon is a great ingredient to calm that down as i said now unlike other anti-itch creams that you promoxin is not fragrance this is an anesthetic other anti-itch creams on the market like sarna they have menthol in them and for some people that can actually end up causing irritation for them it works kind of you know to silence those itching nerves but some people can be allergic to it so i prefer to recommend itch creams that have bromoxin other itch creams that you might find might have steroid cream in them now i have videos talking about steroids namely hydrocortisone is what you going to find over the counter and itch creams and they you know in moderation but too much can have negative side effects so i always try and steer people towards proxima because it long term and there are no negative side effects of it and it associated with any problems is what i getting at and the best way so the best way to use it if you do have itch keep it in your refrigerator and apply it to the skin chilled it will really help silence that you get the cold and the promoxin together they can really really tell those itching nerves to shut up try it on your face if you have facial itch uh you you know you may find that it and then also imparts some relief all right the next product of course for me it almost empty is the healing ointment this is fantastic it ointment so that alone makes it fantastic at sealing in hydration petrol autumn is one of the most is the most intense uh occlusive ingredient for reducing what out of the skin and that petrolatum uh it moisturizers but at higher percentages as is found in this it and it you know ointments and balms are going to have a lot of it um and so you obviously in this aquaphor and then of course vaseline uh is just petrolatum or their main product you know the original jelly is just petrolatum unlike vaseline aka petrolatum this has hyaluronic acid in it as well which is a humectant so it kind of help with adding a little bit of hydration to the skin it out of the deeper layers basically and then of course it in it which is unique to this product as opposed to other ointments on the market it dimethicone in it another skin protectant and it has panthenol in it a ingredient that acts as a humectant and really helps with barrier repair so this has a lot of very functional ingredients so it skin protectant beyond using it on your lips you know you can also use it on your face many people do around the eyes that for areas of the body where you have maybe dry cracked skin for helping heal it if you have a scrape or a cut it to put on that because it helps act as almost second skin and facilitates healing it keeps the wound bed moist so that new skin cells can come in and and help the skin heal and it also is really good for reducing chaffing so you can put it under your armpits between your inner thighs anywhere where you have skin on skin friction that might lead to skin breakdown this will help reduce that by providing a smooth surface and protecting the skin so very good and this is probably one of i mean it this is something i can use it every every day so i about the moisturizing cream but uh a moisturizer for the face that you should consider if you want to kind of amp up the hydration a little bit more and really help soothe dry irritated skin as well as improve the look of wrinkles and fine lines it night cream now this product has a biomimetic peptide that can facilitate skin barrier repair in theory if anything it adds hydration you know me and peptides i eye like really are you just there to hold water are you really doing something um okay beyond that it course ceramides and then niacinamide another ingredient that anti-inflammatory and can help with barrier repair and i mentioned already i think that this has shea butter in it which is a wonderful occlusive this really puts like a nice seal on things so i really love this i think it fantastic you know night cream for really reducing trans epidermal water loss when we sleep our skin actually does go about doing some renewal processes and we tend to lose more water as we sleep at night time and this really can help with that i find that people with quote mature skin really enjoy this product in particular because as we get wiser our skin makes less oil and is more prone to dryness and this really intensely hydrates and reduces that water loss it highly recommend the next product is also from the skin renewing line it is the skin renewing gel oil i love this product i honestly don is it a gel is it an oil is it a cream it lotion it i know it has sunflower seed oil in it or some derivative of sunflower oil to add to act as an emollient but it greasy it doesn on it feels just like a lightweight serum but it actually does create a nice barrier to water loss on the surface of the skin this is a particularly fantastic product if you are going through the peeling stages aka retinization when starting a retinol or prescription retinoid this is very good to smooth that down deliver hydration and promote healing of the skin barrier during that process very very good it with you on the go if you find that you need you know midday your face is looking a little parched a lot of people find that their eyes get dry throughout the day or the skin around the eyes gets dry you can just pat a little of it there it have to dip your fingers into it throughout the day although honestly um the the pump is kind of annoying like it especially when you get towards the end it doesn one thing i don i recall correctly i think a lot of people complain about that too so maybe they airless pump because i find that it moisturizer to take with you like on the go it side note too although people aren really doing this as much currently it traveling for airplanes you know when you get on the plane it this is handy to have in your bag to to spot correct that very very good product and uh it be put off by the oil in the name it anything like that it if anything it consistency but you know gels tend to actually be drying uh gels typically have like out drying alcohols in them they tend to be quick absorbing this doesn alcohols or anything it what it is but give it a try it for it stat hydration and spot focus series you can also use it on the lips too is the other thing i was going to say that products versatile and unique i i quite like that all right they have some great sunscreens i love their this the am i like although people you know know that it can pill i love the ultralight although you know it is kind of expensive but honestly you guys they really nailed it with their tinted sunscreen i need them to come out with more shades of this because it everybody but the formula is fantastic it titanium enzyme and titanium dioxide um so it kind of thing that staying around your eyes and it is not greasy it doesn doesn i mean they really got the actual formula they nailed it um it in comparison to you know a lot of tinted sunscreens will kind of have that peachy look this is a little bit deeper of a tint it a little too dark for me um it kind of makes me look like i sunless tanner on very moisturizing doesn doesn got it they got it right yeah give this a try for sure i would say if you have really pale skin though it yellowish and if you have a deeper skin tone um a really deep skin tone i still don is really a good shade for people with medium tones uh but if you are you know if it patrick photo type 5 i you know i don think you um but you can give it a try see how you like it but yeah this is a favorite it resistant uh i will point that out so i would not rely on this like if you outside doing sports swimming that kind of thing but it moisturizer it not a makeup person but i do kind of think the tint actually does give fairly decent coverage it tint um it really does kind of give a little bit of camouflage all right product number nine i love this this is a great uh serum anti-aging product acne product hyperpigmentation product i mean so many people can benefit from this it serum now this has their retinol in it which is actually very good retinol as you your skin has to do two things to it to get it to its active form but with ongoing consistent use it can be helpful for improving the look of wrinkles and fine lines and improving the look of hyperpigmentation and it can also offer a little bit of acne control as well beyond the retinol though this also has niacinamide which is good for the skin barrier reduces redness and helps with hyperpigmentation and this product also has licorice root like niacinamide licorice root also is good for redness soothing the skin barrier and addressing hyperpigmentation and of course then you their ceramides as a backbone in there to address dry skin issues this is really a product that is is marketed towards appropriately so people with acne it not only addresses the active acne but addresses the but it also addresses the things that could come afterwards post acne redness or post acne dark marks so i like it just you know the marketing is great in that regard but you know it can help people who don have that uh it you you improvement in hyperpigmentation it really good product their other retinol serum and the purple line is also good it doesn this you know this wins it irritated by licorice root or allergic to it or something uh you know go for this one go for this one it this last one i really struggled to choose because i knew i had to give you guys some kind of a cleanser and honestly all of their cleansers are amazing i love them all but a product that made the list is their hydrating cleanser bar very good bar soap as a matter of fact i would say this is the best bar soap on the market is that a bold statement i think it is it bar so basically what that means is a sinden bar it packed with moisturizing ingredients it really helps to address the issues inherent to cleansing where you you natural lipid barrier this really puts the moisture back in it not harsh not stripping it doesn that squeaky clean feeling that people associate with hygiene but really it a sign of a stripped skin barrier it the face and it i guess it than other bar soaps but some bar soaps they can be super drying and harsh choose this one if you are a bar soap lover this this one does not disappoint very good on the face body and whatnot in bar soaps are nice you know you you don for the environment so those are my top 10 products from cerave i hope you guys enjoyed this video don so that you can stretch your dollar even further this holiday season and comment below what your favorite cerave product is and if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen and subscribe i guys tomorrow

Top 10 BEST AVENE SKIN CARE PRODUCTS| Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpKORHNVun0	Dr Day	well hey guys in today to be sharing with you my top 10 favorites from the brand evan you all are really enjoying this series where i share with you my top 10 picks from some major skincare brands i have these all saved in a playlist which i will link down below if you guys are interested but event was a highly requested brand i will group the products by cleanser moisturizer sunscreen and then active ingredients all right number one product in the realm of cleansers or their oil-free gel cleanser it cleansing it skin and it to be more dry and sensitive but i think overall it favors a more oily to normal skin type it which is anti-inflammatory and can help kind of facilitate a little bit of skin cell turnover and encourage sloughing off of dead skin cells but what i really like about it is that because it less drying on the skin barrier in comparison to like a foaming cleanser the second cleanser is the xericon ad lipid replenishing cleansing oil this product is really good if you have dry skin or mature skin or particularly sensitive skin maybe you a lot of irritation it emulsifiers polyethylene glycol it works up into a creamy lather and then rinses off but it stripping whatsoever i do think if you wear a lot of heavy makeup that you definitely going to need to use a dedicated makeup remover or cleansing balm beforehand but this is actually pretty good at cleansing the skin in general so if you don the way of makeup i think this is just just fine this is particularly good for very mature skin it wiser our skin doesn more sensitive to the the surfactants and cleansers that can strip away our lipid barrier so this is a really good one for for those folks in particular so those are the cleansers but i remind you guys i have shared in another video some of the top cleansers from events this is an abbreviated list my top of the top but i well moving into the next category of products moisturizers number three is the see calphate post procedure emulsion love this moisturizer it skin acne prone skin sensitive skin or rosacea it product is really good you know after a procedure or your skin is healing but you can use it as an everyday moisturizer and it sucral fate or it list is aluminum sucrose octa sulfate this facilitates healing it used to treat ulcers in the gut and when applied to the skin it can promote wound healing it has so it has that ingredient which is wonderful it also has zinc sulfate which is anti-inflammatory and very soothing this particular moisturizer is also fantastic now that we and suffering a lot of irritation and mask knee and skin problems related to having that mask on where you moisture being trapped you irritation from rubbing you really need something that repair and healing this is a great moisturizer now the emulsion is really lightweight and you know people with oily skin like it people who have rosacea tolerate it well because sometimes heavy duty moisturizers can flare about a rosacea but if you have really dry skin and you more a richer cream check out the xeracom ad lipid replenishing cream i adore this product for dry dermatitic eczema prone skin i mean you can use it on the body but you like i said in other videos body moisturizers give them a try on your face and this one works well it fragrance free of course fantastic for people with eczema this particular product has evening primrose oil in it which is anti-inflammatory and has been shown to be helpful in the skin of people with eczema it acids but this product also has an interesting ingredient uh el modulia elmodulia this el modelia is derived from aquaphilus del maria i basically a bacteria that is in the spring water now i a video talking about the benefits of thermal spring water it that maybe can help in cultivating your skin microbiome now this particular bacteria is present in the thermal spring water and is thought to perhaps be a major component of the benefits that are observed when treating people with eczema with the thermal spring water and the centers in france those treatment centers in france anyways this particular bacteria there a compound called l-modula and this particular compound has been shown in lab studies meaning like cells in a dish not actual humans but in lab studies it shown to influence the inflammatory mediator profile but it does suggest that perhaps it that active it what maybe responsible and so that interesting this particular product has that in there uh in addition to the thermal spring water which all of their products have the ingredient list overall is minimal which i like and is wonderful for people who have irritation prone skin so this is a really good moisturizer and honestly if you have oily skin don afraid of putting something like this on your face either you know just try it out at any rate it then the third product in the moisturizing category is a lip balm the c caliphate lip balm now this i really like for acutely irritated lips where you a lot of cracking and fissuring it really can facilitate healing this is something you actually want to use at night and i understand why i it i said earlier facilitates healing so you can imagine how that for healing the fissures of the lips and dry irritated lips and it zinc in it which is anti-inflammatory but the reason i suggest using it at night time first of all we lose more water out of our skin including the skin of our lips at night and especially like as you your mouth is open i mean like you might be drooling it setup for more irritation on your lips even more so than throughout the day if you kind of think about it anyways i it goes on kind of thick and white and it your skin tone you may find that this doesn it looks so you might want to just wear it at nighttime i mean you can use it during the day there can i use it during the day but i saying that like it does leave kind of a cast and leave your lips white for a while but it really keeps that seal on there for a long time even more so and my personal experience using it it seems like the seal is more withstanding than just petrolatum i think it holds up better this formula i think holds up better under exposure to water either from saliva or you guys know i drinking beverages left and right and this really holds up with all of that i think it more resistant to wearing off in comparison to just using like vaseline on your lips which you know in my experience while it loss out of the skin it does you know it heats up with your body temperature and melts soft and you guys you know like i said i always drinking beverages and whatnot so it does wear off and i do end up having to reapply like petrolatum a lot more frequently than this it permanent seal or a permanent band-aid you do still need to reapply it but you don lot longer than than like petrolatum or of course any other lip balm no fragrance in this or flavorants which can aggravate the skin of the lips and cause even more kelitis and dryness yeah it good highly recommend it if you for a healing lip balm because of the sucral fade in this this is going to facilitate healing of the lips in a more you know a more unique way beyond just ceiling and hydration it has that healing property to it so i would say if you uncomfortable painful lips you know the feeling we all been there before at some point in our life this is something that you might want to use to treat that to help improve that but for just everyday lip balm use i think it but it is a really good product um but to just use it every day i think you know you might find that a bit too expensive but i think it for these situations where you end up with really dry lips which can happen if you are somebody who wears makeup and you use a lot of lipsticks and whatnot at the end of the day you take that off and you know you may find that those lipsticks especially the matte lipsticks were particularly drying and irritating along with the lip liners and this is the kind of thing that can really help your lips uh kind of recover from that moving on to sunscreen um you know i surprised i always have recommended the um the very high protection sunscreen from evan but going on their site in preparation for this video and this is no longer on their website this is a mineral sunscreen that is pretty matte i would say i liked this and i recommended it in my video on tinted sunscreens and i went based on different skin tones and this was so you know this was a lot this particular tint is you know more helpful for people with at least medium to deep skin tone you can see that right there uh so they did away with that bummer maybe they the sunscreen they do still have which i have actually always recommended is their mineral tinted compact now this spf 50 it is a tinted sunscreen and a compact you pat it on with a puff i don know what that thing is called anyway it sensitive skin it sting the finish on this particular product is very matte but i do find that a lot of people especially people who wear makeup appreciate that and i have to say the coverage on this is pretty good um and so much so that many people who wear makeup and are used to wearing foundation they find that this gives more coverage than like a typical tinted sunscreen and they might actually be okay with skipping their foundation in favor of just this but at any rate i you know i do think it goes on well at least underneath makeup without any pilling or balling because it does have that matte finish but importantly what i like most about this and why i it is that we have now learned that iron oxides are really helpful in protecting against those pro-pigmenting wavelengths of visible light but the event tinted compact uh has actually been what was used in a lot of the studies showing benefit with the iron oxides so this is a good product it comes in beige and honey and i think honey is probably better for medium to deep skin tones i really need them to come out with more shades so i really need them to do that so those of you who wear makeup and you know struggle with the issue about putting on sunscreen over makeup or whatnot try this it is quite good you know it as using a sunscreen because you are still going to get skip areas and areas that you applying the compact on but it definitely gives good coverage and good sun protection in the areas that you hit um and like i said in those studies looking at improvement of hyperpigmentation with iron oxides some of them used this event tinted compact so it is a good product and it a lot of sunscreens burn or staying this would be a fine option i need them to bring this back though this is what i use and like from them they sunscreen all right moving on to kind of active ingredients product number seven is the acarat smoothing exfoliating cream this particular moisturizer has urea salicylic acid and lactic acid so it and it dry dull skin with rough patches like keratosis pylaris and it areas either on the body or the face where you post inflammatory hyperpigmentation and you accelerate the rate of clearance of that this would be good you can use this on the face it but because it has salicylic acid lactic acid and urea it can be irritating and it can sting and burn so you kind of have to figure out a if you tolerate this okay without irritation and be the frequency with which you can tolerate using it without too much irritation but it moisturizer for people who have dry dull appearing skin that they to kind of rejuvenate the appearance of it photo aging that they improve it a little bit of a delay and skin cell turnover due to age related changes and so you end up getting kind of dull appearing skin this kind of can rejuvenate that look but if you have super sensitive skin i you know this can cause a lot of burning and stinging this product is also good though if you have acne prone skin because a salicylic acid can help give a little bit of acne control it and then the urea in this is going to soften dry patches as well and it also facilitates uh natural moisturizing factor production and maintenance of the moisture barrier moving along to the next set of active ingredients they to me of n the fact that they have a line of retinaldehyde products they actually have two lines of retinaldehyde now retinaldehyde is a form of topical vitamin a that is effective for improving wrinkle the look of wrinkles and fine lines and unlike retinol retinol you guys remember your skin has to do two things to it to get it to its active state retinaldehyde your skin only has to do one thing to it all right the retron and retron ale or retro now however you want to say it the intensive cream this has a retinaldehyde like i said and it also has pro elastin peptide which basically can help boost that moisture and you know in theory maybe helps promote elasticity but always be a little you know suspicious of the claims of efficacy of peptides and skin care products a lot of them most of them haven robustly substantiated but they are good humectants so basically this is moisturizing and it has a retinaldehyde now retinaldehyde um is less irritating than like retinoic acid aka tretinoin but it is effective you just have to use it consistently now a van has the 0.1 which is what i have here and then they have basically the same product at 0.05 percent don over the percentage strength you know the 0.05 is probably a little less irritating than this but this is so gentle it honestly between the two there isn substantial difference in terms of the outcome between the different percentages the only the main thing is that lower percentages are less irritating and take a little bit longer to start working higher percentages are more irritating and work more quickly you know they you uh product number nine is the re is in the retro al series it wrinkle corrector i talked about this in other videos too this is another good retinaldehyde product and unlike the intensive cream it does not have the pro-elastin peptide instead it has brown algae which will add hydration to the skin and it also has hyaluronic acid so both of these ingredients are humectants they add a lot of hydration i find because of that with the advanced wrinkle corrector you will see improvement in fine lines more quickly like kind of almost right away i really amps up the hydration to smooth out those but it doesn retinaldehyde is working faster it effect of those humectants plumping up the skin cells i find it just a little bit more like wow factor in comparison to the intensive cream and then the final product is probably going to come as a shock to you guys it hear me out it uh retinol or any form of topical vitamin a can be super irritating around the eyes uh so if you want to use vitamin a around the eyes to improve the look of wrinkles and fine lines i actually recommend using an eye a dedicated eye cream with whatever form of vitamin a you want to go with now i neutrogena retinol eye cream because neutrogena neutrogena is very good but if you want to use retinaldehyde instead of retinol because again retinaldehyde your skin only has to do one thing to it to get it to its active state as opposed to two with retinol then i do recommend the evan retron al product for eyes like the advanced recoil corrector this one brown algae and it so those two ingredients alone are going to kind of improve the look of fine wrinkles around the eyes just through hydration this product also has dextran sulfate a polysaccharide that also helps with hydration and imparting moisture retention so it i you guys eye creams are not necessary but if you do want to treat the eye area with a topical vitamin a i do recommend using an eye cream that has that ingredient just because it formulated to be tolerated around the eyes so those are my top 10 products from a van you know they have a lot of great products yeah event has a lot of products um but these are my top ten i hope this video was helpful to you guys and definitely check out my other videos in this series or my other video on events uh best cleansers if you want more cleanser recommendations i will list those two down below but if you like this video give it a

Top 10 skin care products from THE INKEY LIST| Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MB2atNeBZU	Dr Day	well hey guys in today to be sharing with you my top 10 favorites from the brand the inky list you all are really enjoying this series of my top 10 favorites from different major brands and the inky list was a highly requested brand today list you guys know i been recommending their products in numerous videos for a long time now i personally use many of them myself and the inky list if you is a brand that exists to increase knowledge about skin care ingredients making them simpler to understand and easy to incorporate into your skincare routine they believe that better information powers better decisions for your skin and really for everything else which i think we can all agree is true what initially attracted me to the inky list and why i continue to recommend their products and use them myself is that their formulas feature one main active ingredient and the other ingredients in the formula function to maximize the efficacy of that active ingredient and minimize the risk of irritation so there there could irritate your skin it really their formulas are such to really allow the ingredient to shine and to do what it the results that you for whatever specific skin condition you are you reason i inky list is that their products are all under 15 so they all of their skincare products at sephora and i don but sephora is currently having their big fall sale it runs from october 30th to november 9th with the code holiday fun so it and these products are great today little different i break the products down into different skin concerns and skin issues first of all let for oily skin people with oily skin they often endorse issues of enlarged pores maybe blackheads excessive oiliness if you go back in time to my video on the best blackhead masks out there you i recommended the kaolin clay mask by the inky list this is a fantastic product for people with oily skin prominent pores it features kale and clay which can help to absorb some of that excess sebum aka oil off the surface of the skin and from within the pore now kln is what you clay masks but what i love the most about the inky list is that there aren ingredients in there that are going to irritate your skin and dry it out and cause redness and irritation the formula is moisturizing so that the clay can really go to work to pull out that extra oil without drying out your skin too much or causing irritation the mask is really simple to use you just apply a thin film to clean skin leave it on for about 10 minutes and then rinse it off it dry out your skin after you rinse it off you can apply your regular moisturizer and you can do this twice a week it really helps cut down on that excess shininess and oiliness and for people with oily skin you might find that with using this your cosmetics go on better because you evened out the playing field you don have too much sebum piled up on the surface of the skin this product isn though if you have these issues on other body sites like your back your chest you can use this there too it doesn exclusive product another product for people with oily skin that is really effective for exfoliating the pore and reducing shine and oiliness is their salicylic acid cleanser this can be used up to twice a day to the face and salicylic acid is perfect for people with oily skin and or acne because it exfoliates the pore it reduces oiliness and it actually can give some control to the acne as well salicylic acid otherwise known as beta hydroxy acid is an exfoliating acid that concentrates in the oily surfaces and it can exfoliate the pore to improve the look of pores and reduce oiliness and it also imparts acne control so if you have acne this is a great product to use you can actually use this up to twice a day to the face just make sure you don the eyes or too close to the mouth the skin there is very thin and more prone to irritation with salicylic acid if you want to learn more about salicylic acid i have videos on it and how to use it and its benefits and acne it good ingredient for hyperpigmentation another category i moment all right moving on to dry skin this product is helpful for people with dry skin but honestly any skin type can use it it is their oat cleansing balm this is one of my favorite cleansing balms it it features oats which you guys know i a huge fan of they have a natural detergent property to them to cleanse but they drying or irritating they lipids that help with skin barrier function the way to use this product is very simple you just take a small amount into the palm of your hand maybe heat it up a little bit by rubbing it between your hands and then spread it on your face it gentle enough to use around the eyes to remove eye makeup and then you just take a little bit of water and the nice thing about this is that it has polyethylene glycol in it and emulsifier so once you add that water it will actually work into a lather i like this because the oil the oat oil helps to break up the film of cosmetics and water resistant sunscreen without really stripping away at your natural lipid barrier and then as you work it into a lather with the water it easily rinses off and then after you rinse it off you can just follow it up with your regular moisturizers i point this out as a great product for people with dry skin because a lot of cleansers and cleansing products makeup removers etc are very drying especially for people with dry skin they strip the natural lipid barrier so using a cleansing balm is a good approach for those folks in particular and this one is great you know i have a video from i want to say a year ago where i started using this and raving about it and yeah it cleansing balms i used now people with dry skin they often have a difficult time exfoliating some of that dry built up dead skin and chemical exfoliants in the class of alpha hydroxy acids are a good choice because they large comp they to slough off that dry built up dead stuff they hydrating and a great alpha hydroxy acid for people with dry bumpy skin like keratosis pilaris is lactic acid lactic acid uh like i said it humectant and it helps soften that dry built up stuff and it keratosis pylaris if you have some textural issues too just kind of dull appearing skin using a product like this will help as well it one to two drops in your palm and spread it over your skin after you have cleansed and rinsed the skin while the skin is still damp doing it that way you know you really you really maximize the humectant action of the lactic acid and then you just apply your moisturizer on over it lactic acid is very gentle it for dry skin conditions and you it in very popular expensive products but you don pay that price for lactic acid and i highly recommend this it affordable and you don of it to to generate a thin film on the surface of the skin all right a lot of you guys deal with hyperpigmentation maybe related to acne that is healed with a dark mark and a go-to ingredient for hyperpigmentation is hydroquinone but it does come with a lot of side effects of irritation and you can term uh because it can cause rebound hyperpigmentation so a a safer alternative that gentle and works kind of similar to hydroquinone is alpha arbutin this actually inhibits the enzyme that leads to upregulation of abnormal pigment production it and you can use it twice a day to areas of hyperpigmentation and the way to use it is just to apply it after cleansing to clean skin and then apply your moisturizer on over it it areas where you have skin that neck the skin on the neck is very thin and a lot of active ingredients aimed at improving hyperpigmentation are often too irritating for the neck but this you can use there you can use it to other body sites as well like the inner thighs or under the armpits i know a lot of you guys deal with hyperpigmentation in those ear areas this is a skin brightening ingredient that enough to use in those areas of sensitive skin it ingredients too it doesn degrade in the presence of those other ingredients but it will degrade if it gets too warm so don heat uh because it can alpharbune can degrade in the heat that about but so long as you don skincare in the oven you should be more than fine with this so this is a great one for improving not only hyperpigmentation related to healing acne but also some hyperpigmentation maybe from too much sun exposure you can get a good brightening effect from this and again inexpensive no garbage ingredients that are going to increase the risk of irritation as i said in my videos on hyperpigmentation anything that increases irritation in the skin is going to worsen the hyperpigmentation that formula so much because it just focuses on the alpha arbutin and allowing it to to do its thing and there are no other bogus ingredients in there that are gonna cause irritation for people so it into your routine with minimal risk of irritation another ingredient though for hyperpigmentation that is safe for deeper skin tones but it can be irritating and i already talked about it but it acid the inky list makes a beta hydroxy acid levon product that hyperpigmentation it also can be used for improving oiliness acne prone skin can benefit from using this and as i said salicylic acid is an exfoliant it focuses in the oily surfaces but it also can remove some superficial hyperpigmentation and just help accelerate the clearance of those dark marks and because it kind of smooths out the surface of the skin especially kind of in reducing the oiliness it allows for better penetration of other active ingredients the next category is a wrinkle specifically those little fine wrinkles like around your eyes maybe on your neck anywhere on the body and a lot of that is made the appearance of those types of wrinkles is made much worse if the skin is dry and i beneficial it can be to utilize a topical hyaluronic acid underneath your moisturizer because topical hyaluronic acid it in the skin and kind of plumps up skin cells and as a result it smooths out those little fine pesky wrinkles the inky list makes a fantastic hyaluronic acid product and the way to use this is after you cleanse your skin and you rinse it clean of the cleanser while the skin is still damp just apply a few drops of this to the face or to just the targeted area like if you just want to improve the look of the wrinkles around the eyes just apply a few drops there and pat it in and then apply your moisturizer on over it it over this because it you need another ingredient to kind of act as an occlusive to trap the water into the skin this is a great way to begin introducing hyaluronic acid into your routine to derive that additional skin plumping benefit and to smooth out those wrinkles now another product i of ingredients for improving the look of wrinkles and fine lines is going to be peptides now peptides they like hyaluronic acid they act as humectants meaning they just hold on to water and helps plump up skin cells and smooth things out but there is some evidence that using peptides and skin care products can help boost up collagen in the deeper layers of the skin and the inky list makes a fantastic collagen booster peptide serum that is great to try out for improving those wrinkles and fine lines and you can use this along with the a serum underneath your moisturizer or just by itself depending on you know how you how you want to proceed but both help in plumping up those skin cells and in theory this can with ongoing use plump up skin by improving collagen synthesis so it the last category includes probably my two favorite products from the inky list and that is the category of improving skin texture which is kind of a vague open umbrella category of issues that may be related to skin aging just dull appearing skin skin that doesn elasticity isn you hydrate and smooth things out it necessarily aimed at wrinkles but wrinkles can be in there too so there category and the wrinkles category but this is really specific to people who are looking to improve hydration deep down maybe exfoliate some sun damage and just overall get that i would say glass skin but that just kind of even clear glowing skin these ingredients can really help first one is poly hydroxy acid the inky loves makes a fantastic no-nonsense polyhydroxy acid toner i featured this in my video on poly hydroxy acids so if you want a more in-depth review on this set of ingredients check that video out but to remind you poly hydroxy acids they are chemical exfoliants actually that are gentle enough for very sensitive skin so they help to remove some of those superficial damaged cells dry cells built up cells so if you have dry skin you benefit from this as well um there are also humectants so they add hydration into the skin and there consistent use they can help in fighting what process that happens in the skin that contributes to aging of the skin it molecules kind of glomming onto proteins as a quick descriptor but the consequences of glycation in the skin include wrinkles and this deepening or darkening of the skin that doesn pigment it just kind of a darkening of the skin that has nothing to do with melanin so the active ingredients that fight hyperpigmentation don skin change that darkening but there polyhydroxy acids might help with that and their toner is really fantastic the way to use it is to just apply it to cleanse skin after you clean the skin and rinse it while the skin is still damp it increases the penetration of the poly polyhydroxy acids and really capitalizes on their humectant action by kind of binding onto that water and then just apply moisturizer on over or in the daytime you know apply your sunscreen on over it this is really good if you have rosacea or sensitive skin this is an ingredient that you can dabble in and it tends to be very well tolerated in those skin types as opposed to other chemical exfoliants this is actually very typically very rosacea friendly so try it out if you somebody who has very sensitive skin and you want something to improve skin texture uh to exfoliate the skin try this out it very affordable no nonsense and it works i so i i know firsthand it effective now the other ingredient is another one that i featured this in my video dedicated to this ingredient is their polyglutamic acid now polyglutamic acids uh polyglutamic acid it is an ingredient that hyaluronic acid in that it amazing ability to bind water and hydrate the skin but unlike unlike hyaluronic acid polyglutamic acid it kind of forms this this lightweight film on the skin to trap that hydration in so it has a little bit of an occlusive property that really will reduce water loss out of the skin overall improving skin hydration as a result you texture you skin is hydrated and plumped up you just have firmer skin it and there of polyglutamic acid can also help in improving skin elasticity as we get wiser our skin loses a lot of elasticity that kind of snap and recoil and there is some evidence that using pga i like to call it not golf can improve the elasticity of your skin i know i categories here of wrinkles and skin texture but a lot of times people want to improve both of them i highly suggest pairing them their polyglutamic acid with the hyaluronic acid these two together are a nice pairing because hyaluronic acid is really going to penetrate potentially a little bit more deeply into the top layer of the skin to add that hydration and the polyglutamic acid it the very top layers and seal everything in place so they really nice pairing together for improving some of the visible signs of photo aging so those are my top 10 skincare product recommendations from the inky list they philosophy i products

Top 10 PAULA'S CHOICE skin care products| Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDV_yNg8gww	Dr Day	well hey guys in today to be sharing with you my top 10 skincare products from paula that they have

description box and my code drop will give you ten dollars automatically in the form of points when you earn your first 1000 points now that offer is only good for one week so take advantage of it now and start earning those points back one of my favorite products from paula choice and i think it polish choice shoppers is the two percent bha liquid exfoliant now this is a two percent salicylic acid uh levon product that is helpful for improving the look of pores it really helpful for oily skin it also can remove some sun damaged skin cells and help with acne control it has a skin brightening effect and it also can help in removing some sun damaged skin cells smoothing out skin texture overall this is one that both teenagers and very mature skin can derive benefit from using teenagers who deal with acne for example this is a good product for acne control and it of the issues that people find themselves dealing with when their skin becomes quote mature hyperpigmentation related to sun damage so this is a really good one and unlike many salicylic acid levon products that you find in the drugstore this one is free of fragrance and it doesn in it which is great because the last thing you want is to over dry your skin using a product like this it can be a little on the irritating side it skin and enlarged pores and skin textural issues speaking of mature skin and skin texture though another product that is a close second to the bha exfoliant is the advanced smoothing treatment 10 alpha hydroxy acid now this product is primarily focused on a combination of four alpha hydroxy acids it glycolic acid in it which is the smallest alpha hydroxy acid it can penetrate the skin a little bit more deeply than the other alpha hydroxy acids and exfoliate the skin improve the look of hyperpigmentation and it can allow your ingredients your other active ingredients to penetrate better the other alpha hydroxy acids in this include lactic acid malic acid and tartaric acid now these are very small and they mostly act as humectants to help keep the skin hydrated so you have those four alpha hydroxy acids now alpha hydroxy acids are water soluble they don in the oily surfaces as beta hydroxy acid which is the featured ingredient in the bha liquid exfoliant but but this product also has salicylic acid albeit at a lower percentage strength so you are going to get a little bit of oil control with this as well an improvement in the look of pores through both the alpha hydroxy acid and the beta hydroxy acid it with exfoliating the skin reducing oiliness and shine and then improving the look of pores it also has ceramides in it and peptides which help with skin hydration and overall skin smoothness help with skin barrier function and it antioxidants that scavenge free radicals and help with the appearance of both redness and hyperpigmentation i really like this because it has a lot of very good ingredients all formulated together in one product as opposed to the consumer having to use multiple different serums that each have these ingredients and you don how layering different products from different brands how that might how they might can potentially cancel each other out nobody knows that nobody knows that i mean so it has multiple ingredients in it to really reduce all these unknowns now a third product that i ad nauseam bought is amazing is their um azoleic acid booster ten percent azolic acid booster this product is great because it addresses both the needs of hyperpigmentation as well as redness through the ingredient as a lenic acid i have a whole video on the benefits of azoleic acid now prescription strength azolic acid is what we had the most data on and that is in 20 to 15 to 20 percent strength that we have 15 and 20 strengths we don effective the 10 strength is but a lot of people do derive benefit using the 10 strengths that are sold over the counter and the polish choice one is a very good option azelaic acid is anti-inflammatory it helps reduce hyperpigmentation and it helps with redness it also helps to impart some control for rosacea it rosacea treatment and it also offers acne control as well it in addition to a rosacea treatment so it helps multiple things in addition to the salicylic acid this also has licorice root in it which is anti-inflammatory and helps reduce redness and it has salicylic acid which is going to give additional acne control and help with oiliness and hyperpigmentation i really like this and it choice for an over-the-counter azolic acid all right product number four that paula does really well is their hydroquinone product the triple action dark spot eraser seven percent aha lotion this is a two percent hydroquinone product intended to improve the look of dark spots you just need to apply this to the areas of hyperpigmentation you can use it twice a day for three months and you will see improvement you likely to see improvement in hyperpigmentation but the reason i really like her product over many that you can get in the drugstore like ambi i mean ambi is fine but the reason i like her product so much is that it fragrance free so it reduces um you know removes a potential irritant from the mix hydroquinone is very irritating you should know that going in this product is also very good though because in addition to the hydroquinone it has alpha hydroxy acid in it now the combination of alpha hydroxy acid with hydroquinone has been shown to yield even better results than just hydroquinone alone so i really like hydroquinone products that have some form of alpha hydroxy acid in there because again like i said uh with the advanced smoothing treatment product it ingredients to get into the skin better this has glycolic acid and lactic acid in in the in the lotion so it and uh you know you only need to use use it to the areas of hyperpigmentation you don entire face or anything like that you just need to use it as a spot treatment more or less so this product while it things it can last a very long time depending on the extent of hyperpigmentation that you have and if you have hyperpigmentation on your body you can you can try this there as well it doesn to the face say you lower legs you can try it there and you know it doesn restricted to the face all right the next product though is one that good for people who have acne on the body or also hyperpigmentation on the body it i really like this because it basically a two percent salicylic acid levon body treatment in a spray form so it hard hard-to-read easier to apply to hard-to-reach areas in addition to the two percent salicylic acid it also has licorice root which helps with reducing irritation redness inflammation and ultimately will further help the acne in addition to the salicylic acid now this product you want to spray to the targeted area and then you want to rub it in so you do still need to rub it in to make sure that you get an even application so it can still be a little tricky on your back i know polish choice sells a product sells a an applicator to help with that but you can also get those on amazon and i think they polish choice one um so that in a really hard to reach area but you can use the spray on the rear end um after you spray it on and rub it into the skin just let it absorb it doesn take very long and then you can put moisturizer on over it or underneath it that that detail really doesn now you may be wondering can you use this on the face absolutely just don face instead spray it on your hands and pat it into the skin um you know and comparing it to this product it may be a more cost effective way to do that i haven actually compared the prices but they ingredient same percentage strength two percent salicylic acid and they both have anti-inflammatory uh inactive ingredients in the case of the spray it they spray you just want to put it in your hands first and then pat it in your into your face if you on the face but otherwise it all right so those are kind of active ingredients that target acne hyperpigmentation skin texture all those things but a lot of people out there suffer with rosacea they have very sensitive skin and they redness a product from polish choice and i think is very good is the redness relief moisturizer for normal to oily skin even though you may have dry skin and rosacea check this one out because it is very lightweight for a lot of people with rosacea using a heavy moisturizer can exacerbate a flare of redness this is nice and lightweight but it got active ingredients in it aimed at reducing redness licorice root and green tea it got great humectants it has laminaria a marine extract for imparting hydration in the skin and beta glucans and it believe it also has dimethicone or silicone in the product as well so it heavier greasy this moisturizer is also fantastic for people who have acne with a lot of redness or post acne redness because of those ingredients and because the formulation is more lightweight and what people with acne and oily skin are kind of looking for so it reasons and i like it a lot it too if you have hyperpigmentation and oily skin because the licorice root and the green tea are going to help with those issues and help in expediting expediting clearance of the hyperpigmentation so it moisturizer with some active ingredients that are gentle anti-inflammatory and help a variety of conditions all right but one of the things i love the most about polish choice is the attention to sunscreen and the variety of sunscreens offered there is a very good chance that you will find a sunscreen from paula choice that you like which is one of the reasons i love this brand is just the spectrum of offerings but i had to pick out some of my favorites probably my favorite sunscreen from paula i of my favorites is the super light wrinkle defense spf 30. this is a tinted mineral sunscreen so it especially around the eyes it safe to use around the eyes and it um also it because it will offer you some protection against those pro pigmenting wavelengths of visible light so if you have a medium to deep skin tone and you suffer from hyperpigmentation this is going to address that it catacan gallate the active ingredient in green tea so that might be able to scavenge some free radicals although honestly when it comes to sunscreen antioxidants they don into the skin to do that so for whatever it there now the active sunscreen ingredient in this is zinc there titanium dioxide in this i don but i sometimes the titanium dioxide can kind of give a white flash to things so it that kind of white flash from it now if you have a deeper skin tone i do think the the polish choice product will leave that purplish grayish look to the skin it if you have medium to pale skin this is not going to leave a cast if you have very deep a very deep skin tone however it will leave that cast that ends up creating almost a lavender look to the skin so be you know be aware of that you might you know you gonna like that um but overall i would say the cast on this is pretty good the tint is you know a standard universal sheer tint and that once it goes on the skin you really don tint to it and it just kind of serves to mask some of that white cast from the zinc the formulation overall is matte i would say kind of but it matte so if you have oily skin this is a really great choice for you um and i find that people with dry skin get along well with it but sometimes people who have really dry skin find that it drying for them so another sunscreen that i love from polish choice i smoothing primer serum spf 30. now this is a zero cast sunscreen it sunscreen that has a almost cushion like consistency and a very noticeable poor blurring effect it great under makeup it that this one does not really burn or sting around the eye so much uh it it because it has iso decaying in it which kind of gives that poor blurring effect it it but not greasy and it and it doesn i happen to think it works well under makeup it feels and looks exactly like the super goop unseen sunscreen the kylie skin face sunscreen um and the murad invisibler sunscreen all of these sunscreens that have isodocaine in them i mean if you put if you put a blindfold on you can they all look the same anyway that great one by polish choice another sunscreen though from polish choice that good if you have dry skin but you want a mineral sunscreen is the essential glow moisturizer spf 30. i used this a while ago and i ended up really liking it in the long run it sunscreen and i believe it has both zinc and titanium dioxide so this has a bit more of a potential white flash to it but in my experience using it there was no cast to this and it really did give the skin a very kind of glowy look to it underscoring the essential glow it greasy or shiny but it does kind of have a glowy look to it it calm down redness and also to help address issues related to hyperpigmentation it everyday facial moisturizer with spf in it that isn to tolerate around the eyes all right and then last but not least is another sunscreen this is a body sunscreen that i really like from paula non-greasy spf 50. this is a water resistant chemical sunscreen zero cast absorbs very quickly it greasy as the name implies it has like a silky lotiony consistency to it there be used on the face but in my experience it does burn around the eyes so you can try it on your face but i did not find that i cared for it on the face but it great body sunscreen for outdoor activities because it water resistant and it absorbs very quickly so it kind of thing that you don reapplying which is what you need when you every two hours so those are my top 10 from paula brand overall and they have many fantastic products they especially excel in the realm of active ingredients aimed at addressing hyperpigmentation oiliness redness anti-aging issues around skin texture and firmness really great products and what i love most about polish choice is that they really focus on having a good catalog of sunscreens available to their customers i also really appreciate that paula makes an effort to really educate the consumer about skincare ingredients in an easy to understand way but backed by science with good references and i think they have many fantastic products these are just my top 10 but comment below on what your favorites from paula choice are i always love hearing from you guys what you like and if there then that i hope you all enjoyed this video and again check out the drop app you guys using the link in the description box and my code to start saving some money uh especially going in the holidays it that um but if you like

Top 10 Aveeno skin care products| Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRYqGqIYPg	Dr Day	well hey guys in today to be sharing with you my top 10 favorite skin care products from the brand avino today daily harvest so thank you daily harvest for sponsoring a portion of today video now aveeno is a brand i have been using myself personally as somebody with eczema and recommending to patients for years the brand uses colloidal oatmeal and oats in all of their skin care products that have a long-standing history of use in skin care and for the treatment of different skin conditions they nourishing the skin barrier they also contain antioxidants like avinanthromides that scavenge free radicals and so they inflammation and irritation oats also have a natural cleansing property to them without stripping the skin barrier and oats are rich in compounds that soothe inflammation irritation and importantly reduce symptoms of itch but the benefits of oats are not obviously just restricted to skin care oats are a really great thing to incorporate in your diet you guys know i love oats and eating oatmeal every day oats are wonderful for your overall health they have been shown to improve cholesterol levels but eating plain old boring oatmeal every day can get a little well boring and jazzing it up yourself and coming up with creative ways to eat oatmeal it can become a little taxing on you and i don that innovative early in the morning that is why i love daily harvest daily harvest if you delivers thoughtfully sourced chef created foods directly to your doorstep in addition to these really delicious oat bowls that they come up with they also have smoothies they have flat breads harvest bowls and lattes they use top quality fruits and vegetables all of their items are plant-based you can see the ingredients are really simple and preparing the opals is very quick all you have to do is peel back the label add water or milk of your choosing pour into a microwave-safe bowl and microwave for about two minutes and you have a delicious opal i like topping mine with a little bit of cinnamon i like that it convenient and delivered directly to your door and then you can customize what goes in your box and the recipes are so creative and they use ingredients that i rarely have on hand things like dragon fruit mulberry i also love the variety in their recipes these are so convenient and delicious and a great way to to get healthy foods into your body without stressing out your schedule so definitely check out daily harvest and if you use the link in my description box you can get 25 off of your daily harvest orders so definitely give it a try you guys are gonna love it they are so delicious but getting back to the oats that we put on our skin aveeno cannot be beat they really have the oat game in terms of skin care down pat the first product that i swear people call themselves skincare enthusiasts and then they just dance right on by this bad boy don is the aveeno soothing bath treatment this is basically colloidal oatmeal that you can put in the bath it you take care of like a child with eczema for soothing those inflamed irritated patches it doesn it a very gentle cleansing aspect to it um so another beyond eczema it also great if you happen to god forbid find yourself battling poison ivy very very good to soothe that itch and discomfort and you may be wondering how do colloidal oats differ from just like regular oatmeal that you eat well colloidal oats are actually on the fda monograph for as a skin protectant and they are different from just like regular oats and that they are finely ground and filtered so that you get an enriched fraction of of the compounds that are beneficial to the skin so that and so these little packets are just the colloidal oatmeal that you can add to bath water but you can do much more than just put them in the bath you can also add these to again just water and make your own diy face masks just soak one of those reusable sheet masks that you can get like in bulk on amazon in in some of this and put it on your face very relaxing i have a video that goes into detail about how to do that you can also use this to your face as a lather before shaving like in the beard area it will help soften the skin hydrate the skin and act as a protectant with shaving to reduce post shave irritation and post shave ingrown hairs speaking of shaving aveeno makes a fantastic shave gel their therapeutic shave gel i love this because it fragrance free shaving products or products for shaving that don menthol and a bunch of dyes in them that can aggravate eczema or cause irritation it dimethicone in it too which is another skin protectant that will really help reduce nicks and shave bumps and whatnot love this and i hope they never discontinue it now speaking of discontinuing i to move on to facial cleansing i loved the um avino ultra calming gel cleanser i think i have a video going back maybe two years ago where i did a skincare routine with it you guys have discontinued it and in its place is a foaming cleanser which i haven so i was scoring the website being like well what kind of facial cleanser am i going to recommend that i with and i remembered they make a fantastic bar of soap that can be used to cleanse the face their moisturizing facial cleansing bar definitely check it out it with the colloidal oats and some very gentle surfactants and you can use it on the face the body it for the bar um so it significantly less expensive than than buying the you know a face a face wash so i love that you can use it on the body like i said but if you washes check out the aveeno skin relief body wash fragrance free you get the cleansing action of the of the oats in the body wash along with some very again gentle surfactants and you also have a formulation that of course is free of fragrance and irritating dyes this is a body wash that people with eczema as are all of these products i to be recommending in this video but uh the other thing i was going to say about this is it gentle enough in my opinion to use as a face wash so always try and tag team body products on your face to just kind of cut down on the number of things you have to buy and use so check that out if you like if you not a fan of bars if you want a liquid that is a good one moving away from cleansing to moisturizing my favorite thing facial moisturizers the aveeno ultra calming nourishing night cream is a win this is a great very rich thick moisturizing cream for the face if you have very dry skin this is a good one to check out it the products has colloidal oats in it free of dyes and fragrance it very good night cream yeah the ultra calming nourishing cream is great especially if you have mature skin you find that now you have dry skin all of a sudden whereas in the past you didn find a good heavy night cream check that one out i love it i hope they don they did the gel cleanser which was fantastic um but people with oily skin they don often care for heavy greasy moisturizers they want more of a lightweight gel formulation and they need something that them away from moisturizing especially if they they find that some heavy moisturizers are associated with worsening acne do not sleep on this product in avino please do not discontinue it i just repurchased it it is the aveeno calm and restore oat gel moisturizer this is new i reviewed this whole line for you guys so check out that video but of the three products in the line this is one to definitely definitely check out i love it super soothing super soothing wow my descriptions are just on top of the world today um this is very lightweight absorbs very quickly but does a really good job moisturizing the skin it synthetic oils that don greasy but they act as a skin protectant like colloidal oats dimethicone a silicone is on the fda monograph as a skin protectant as well so you have that in here you oil for more lipids to nourish the skin um i also got some questions or i think i mentioned it in the video reviewing this this is this is a product that you don worry about if you have seborrheic dermatitis on the face or fungal acne which can be aggravated by certain plant oils this is one to try out it doesn you know things like different plant oils that are going to aggravate that are going to aggravate malassezia related conditions also very rosacea friendly boy i got super excited on that one very rosacea friendly you know in contrast the ultra calming nourishing night cream it rosacea friendly but some people with rosacea you put a heavy moisturizer on and it exacerbates redness and triggers a flare you need more of a lightweight product but you need something that really going to dial in and address the skin barrier issue with rosacea check this one out it good and i fingers crossed they do not discontinue this love it and it is an amazing one now i was pouring over the sunscreens from avino truthfully their mineral sunscreens like uh they have a baby one and then they have you know one that baby marketing packaging they thick they don sunscreens but i recommend them to you guys because i know you leave a horrible cast i mean i wear them but you know not all the time because they they not comfortable to wear they they so if you them great but obviously i i can in this video because people are going to be pissed um the sunscreen from avino that i wanted to recommend to you guys is their positively radiant because that product has soy in it which can lead to a brightening effect and it would otherwise be a great sunscreen except it has fragrance and the fragrance is very very strong to the point that it gives me a headache so i obviously can recommend that one but a sunscreen that i actually considered recommending in my video on moisturizers with spf but it didn quite make the list because i kind of reached my limit is the aveeno ultra calming daily face moisturizer spf 30. now this is a mineral sunscreen there is definitely a cast to this so know that going in if you have a deeper skin tone this is not going to be for you probably it lavender ash and look on your skin but if you have a medium to pale skin tone you might find that this is just fine and you don does it is pretty sheer ultimately for paler skin types so give it a try but what i really like about this is that it doesn has ceramides in it so it eczema acne rosacea helping to clue in skin barrier restoration it a great one you know like i said i contemplated it including it in my video on best drugstore moisturizers with spf these i discovered like two years ago yeah two years ago around the holidays they make great gifts um or you know they they are the aveeno repairing sika hand and foot masks these are basically just little plastic gloves and socks that are um that contain a very greasy ointment that has the has the oats in it great to just soak your hands and feet in these if you washing you dry cracked feet if you want to do your own diy you know spa night diy spa if you want to have a spa night at home just relax in front of netflix and chill these are great they people with eczema and sensitive skin so if you have the condition that called dyshidrosis miserable to live with often can be exacerbated by all the hand washing try these out they can really help now as a dupe to these because these are you know they environmentally friendly thing to be reusing these you can just get some gloves cotton gloves or cotton socks um cotton gloves or cotton socks and grease up in the product that is probably what lining these the aveeno cracked skin relief so that that environmentally friendly option but the little masks make great gifts too like stocking stuffers and stuff especially if you have a friend who maybe was you know is recovering from surgery and you want to put together a gift basket those are great but if you want to you know cut down on waste try just doing this in you know greasing up your hands and feet and putting cotton gloves and socks on that you can wash and reuse all right then moving on this product i always recommend to patients with eczema it is a great cream for maintaining the skin barrier it just everyday moisturizing you can put it on the face for sure try it out it is the eczema therapy daily moisturizing cream this has as its active ingredient colloidal oatmeal see you called out here on the active ingredient list because it they have to call it out separately from the rest of the ingredients so that evidence-based ingredient at least if it it must be it must be it must have proven itself somewhere along the line this also has ceramides in it wonderful for the skin barrier and again the oats love this uh if you have found that cerave products you know you don burn or whatever try this you get the benefit of the ceramides and you also have the colloidal oats in there there some people find that niacinamide and a lot of like the cerave products burns or stings um so try this uh it doesn in in the cream love it it irritated and plain skin and you definitely can put this on the face now last product um i actually kind of went back and forth between two products on this last one and one i mentioned is a balm aveeno nails it in the realm of moisturizing and balms balms are greasy greasy greasy and thick and great if you have red kind of open oozing inflamed skin like an eczema flare or if you from wind burn or maybe you have overdone it on you know cosmetic peels and things like that maybe you got got too excited with like a glycolic peel or something and you red and your skin is maybe itchy from that you a balm stat you need like somebody to babysit your skin barrier and that comes in the form of a greasy balm or ointment greasy balms and ointments are fine to use all the time but for people with like oily skin and acne prone skin they often don it can in some cases aggravate the acne but for these situations where you have like an acute dry skin issue or irritated skin issue definitely employ a balm and the aveeno eczema therapy itch relief balm is fantastic the itch relief here i mean is speaking to the fact that colloidal oats which is the active ingredient here again called out um are going to really help those compounds help in calming down itch for sure so this is great it greasy um and like i said you can you can put this on your face if you you know suffering it will help you can put it on your neck you can put it anywhere hands feet and i went back and forth between this versus the cracked skin relief these are both great like you can use both of either of these for these situations of acutely inflamed irritated skin and you would do just fine the active ingredient on this one is dimethicone a skin protectant on the fda monograph whereas the active ingredient on this is colloidal oatmeal but both have you know in the inactives they both have oats and dimeth accounts um anyways put a blindfold on and you don notice the difference truthfully and they great one group i always forget to mention too when i talk about products like like this i with eczema rosacea sensitive skin and flame skin acne i forget to mention diabetics you know diabetics have poor wound healing and poor circulation especially on the lower extremities and they suffer from really dry skin and a lot of skin specific issues related to type 2 diabetes and you have to be careful to not be using you know fragrancy irritating products these aveeno products are a really good choice for diabetics like for example they the eczema therapy balm or the zika balm it if you have diabetes and put your socks on over really a good idea because the feet especially are prone to dryness little cracks and bacteria and things can get in there a lot of people who have advanced diabetes they don some neuropathy on they have neuropathy and there are distal extremities they don they have cracks and and discomfort and so they to basically infections keeping moisturizers that are thick and greasy on your feet is a good way to kind of stay on top of that and assist the skin barrier there in people with diabetes so um yeah these are these are great to to consider in that situation as well so those are my top 10 products by aveeno love the brand um and they have many great moisturizers i think that in creating fantastic moisturizers and they really they really come up with innovative ways to incorporate oats into a variety of products so these are the best in my opinion from aveeno um but yeah i hope you all enjoyed this video you guys really seem to be liking these top 10 vids from different brands so stay tuned i plan to do more in this series i them um and thank you so much to daily harvest for sponsoring a portion of today um don description box and you get 25 off of your daily harvest order you guys are gonna love it so i hope you all enjoyed this video if so give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don i [Music] you	Success
The BEST DRUGSTORE MOISTURIZERS WITH SPF| Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAW_CsNVLZM	Dr Day	well hey guys in today with you my top 10 drugstore moisturizers with spf if you hear that trickling noise in the background it i anyways um all right so you may be wondering is a moisturizer with spf enough it is so long as you apply enough of it to all sun exposed areas and you don you make sure you reapply it throughout the day i have a video going into more detail about this which i will list down below in the descripto box you may also be wondering what difference between a moisturizer with spf versus a sunscreen truthfully there definition of this i would say the main difference though is that moisturizers with spf they are products that really address some of the needs of dry skin and dry skin conditions whether it be dry skin related to eczema irritation rosacea a lot of people with acne they don are under moisturizing and they need a moisturizer so moisturizers with spf kind of help address that as well as the need for protection from ultraviolet radiation i like to use moisturizers with spf kind of as part of my everyday skincare routine i don actually going to be out in the sun then i definitely use a dedicated sunscreen i find that moisturizers with spf if applied correctly are a fantastic choice for everyday life when you indoors you keep the skin moisturized and they offer protection so long as they correctly as opposed to true sunscreens which often actually can be kind of more drying and they some of their features designed for being outdoors in sweaty conditions the products in today they walk into a drugstore or pharmacy and find these they there just wanted to keep it focused to drugstore um i don the theme of the video the first product is the cetaphil redness relieving moisturizer spf 20. this product is fantastic really for any skin type it moisturizing and it it is a mineral sunscreen it has the active ingredients zinc and titanium dioxide so it good for around your eyes chemical sunscreens can be used around the eyes but they tend for many people to burn and stain mineral sunscreens are a better choice mineral sunscreens are often easier to tolerate if you have rosacea or sensitive skin and a lot of people just like mineral sunscreens now unfortunately mineral sunscreens do leave a cast the tint however in the cetaphil product does help mask some of that cast but i do find that this product has a lighter tint the tint on the cetaphil moisturizer is better for pale to medium skin tones if you have a deeper skin tone i do think this product will leave that kind of lavender ashen look to the skin which is not ideal but don despair i will recommend some other products in this video that will be better for deeper skin tones the nice thing about the cetaphil redness relieving product is not it has licorice root in it which is anti-inflammatory calms down redness and can help with hyperpigmentation because this is a tinted uh product it has iron oxides which will offer protection against pro pigmenting wavelengths of visible light which affect medium to deep skin tones although unfortunately the tint on this is not great for those skin tones but that is a nice advantage of this product it it fantastic product the next product is one i time it it is the olay complete moisturizer with spf 30. this product is a great combination sunscreen that means it has zinc a mineral active and it has some chemical filters that protect against uvb i find that combination sunscreens as opposed to just plain mineral sunscreens leave a less of a cast and they to deepish skin tones when you get to the deeper end of the spectrum in terms of skin tone i do think these still offer some cast that is not ideal but this product is one to definitely give a try it and i moisturizers with spf and a lot of them are like kind of filmy i don perform well they peel this one is the best this one works really well and it product is one for folks who have very dry skin and a deeper skin tone this is going to be a good one for deeper skin tones it moisturizer spf 30. this product is a chemical sunscreen so there cast with this and it has niacinamide which will help calm down redness soothe irritation help with skin barrier restoration and also will help address hyperpigmentation which is often what is of interest in people with deeper skin tones because they ha when they have acne or some sort of skin irritation they risk for it healing with hyperpigmentation so this is a good product for that and it also it ceramides in it which help restore the skin barrier great choice it moisturizing some people with oily oily skin find that this looks greasy and they don got super dry skin try this one it quite good no cast the next product is one i used to use all the time when i was in college it is the eucerin daily moisturizer sorry user and daily protection spf 30. this is so inexpensive it worth a try it is a combination sunscreen it has zinc titanium dioxide and a few chemical filters for uvb the ingredient list is really short and it combination sunscreen for people with oily skin because it thing that people with oily skin are looking for it has a matte finish to it now this will leave a cast on very deep skin tones because of the zinc and titanium but i find that it people with medium skin tones and medium to early deep get along pretty well with it so try it out it along to the next eucerin drugstore when that any skin tone is the eustrein daily hydration cream spf 30. i recently discovered this this year and i don it all this time it sunscreen so there and it moisturizer you don you on um that being said i guess it does have a bit of that scent that people don care for that is associated with some you know sunscreen smell so if you don that you know be aware this probably smells like that but uh there so that um anyways yeah there it i can wear this on my face comfortably and it you get a big tube of it not just a little one ounce bottle you get a large tube of it for i can definitely under ten dollars um and you know it that people who don sunscreen on they don realize that they are so i like it for that reason you know if you have a family member that particularly stubborn about putting on sunscreen try this one it it not greasy and doesn look to it all right the next product is actually two products but they and that is the different oil control moisturizer spf 30 or the cetaphil pro oil control moisturizer spf 30 they product is great for people who have oily skin whether you choose the different one or the cetaphil one they the product is a chemical sunscreen so there skin tones the product has ingredients in it that help absorb excess oil so it reduce the shininess on the surface of the skin if you have oily skin and the product also has a ceramide in it which helps with skin barrier restoration this is a fantastic product for people especially who have acne and need to use a moisturizer and need to use a sunscreen in order to better treat their acne period this is a good one it with acne get along well with it was designed with acne in mind so definitely check it out it doesn matter if you get the different one or the cetaphil one they parent company galderma identical ingredient list same shape bottle i mean it goes on and on this product also has um licorice in it like the cetaphil redness relieving and again that irritation it hyperpigmentation so this is a great one for deeper skin tones but you know pale skin tones it works well too um so that one is fantastic and you know it doesn matter which one you choose now cerave dominates this list i apologize it is what it is what can i say cerave makes fantastic products but this is one of the best drugstore tinted moisturizers i have ever come across this is cerave sheer tint spf 30. this is a much deeper tint in comparison to the cetaphil product it works really well for a broader range of skin tones including deeper skin tones i do get comments from people that they don well with their skin so you know it universally but i think they at least picked a shade that works for a lot of people for me it little bit too deep orange but i find that once it absorbs i actually end up liking it quite a bit very moisturizing but not greasy really good for oily or dry skin definitely check it out it is a mineral sunscreen so it um is not going to burn or staying around the eyes or at least it shouldn if you have sensitive skin it be you know it shouldn problems for you and then of course it a serum product so that comes with ceramides which help with skin barrier restoration so it people with like eczema or dry skin yeah i love this product and you know definitely give it a try it the best tinted mineral sunscreen in my opinion on the drugstore market all right like i said cerave kind of dominates here the next one is one i cerave am facial moisturizing lotion spf 30. now this is a combination sunscreen so you do have zinc in there and then you have some chemical filters for uvb protection this product i personally love but i find that people are split when it comes to this you either love it or hate it and i really can amongst the people who don warn you about but i do get comments from time to time that some people find it pills i really had that experience and you know i continue to recommend it it it has you know again ceramides for skin barrier restoration now if you have a deep skin tone the zinc in this is likely going to cause to leave a cast and so be you know this might not be a good choice for you but it call themselves combination skin although i mean anything from rosacea to eczema to irritant contact dermatitis to acne that medication like i never really know what that means but people who call themselves combination skin find this product addresses their moisturizing and daytime sunscreen sunscreen needs and it absorbs very quickly it doesn on the skin i i have a video by the way about how to reduce sunscreen pilling in terms of your application style so check that out if you right now with any product check out those tips the next product is the last of the cerave rocks it is the cerave ultralight moisturizing lotion with sunscreen spf 30. this one amount that you get and you go through it fairly quickly but it skin tone it sunscreen so it will not leave a cast and it not greasy not shiny i used this product and tried it out in total like finished the whole tube i think over a year ago and i remember griping about how i liked it but that i thought it was expensive and that you would go through it very quickly so be forewarned about that for a drugstore product it is on the pricey end of things but it does actually look very good on the skin it doesn least for me so that is another cerave product a lot of people love that product and people especially with oily skin like this is the only moisturizer with sunscreen that i care for so definitely try it and then the last product is for those of you in the uk you can here but you can get it in superdrug it spf 30. i believe this is the uk equivalent to the cetaphil pro oil control moisturizer aka the different oil control moisturizer that product that i mentioned earlier that those two products that i mentioned earlier i think this is the uk equivalent of that it those same ingredients for absorbing excess oiliness it has licorice root in it for calming down redness and addressing issues with hyperpigmentation as well as irritation has zinc gluconate like the differin cetaphil mambo combo also does which is a polyhydroxy acid that can help hydrate the skin soothe irritation and also kind of aid in skin cell turnover um and it a b vitamin that barrier definitely try this out you guys in the uk um it is it it friendly very acne acne friendly so definitely try that one out those are my top 10 drugstore moisturizers with spf let me know if you guys have used any of these if you like them give me some feedback on how they perform for you i always enjoy hearing that it helps me make better recommendations for both you and my patients so thank you guys for always sharing that with me in the comments if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don i [Music] you	Success
Top 10 CETAPHIL skin care products| Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkrbLbdVPqw	Dr Day	well hey guys in today to be sharing with you my top 10 favorites from the brand cetaphil you all really seem to like this idea of me doing videos of my top tens from different major skincare brands the last one if you missed it was my favorites from neutrogena i down below if you want to check that out but today i you my faves from cetaphil now the first product is one i just feel like people are sleeping on and it is the derma control purifying clay mask this is for people who have oily skin and really battle with like waking up in the morning really shiny and greasy they find that because of that it difficult to put cosmetics on and they often have a tendency to over cleanse their skin just trying to get that excess oil off this product has kaolin and bentonite both of those are clays that when applied to the skin can help absorb some of that oil for you and it can also help absorb some excess oil from within the pore just kind of by wicking it up so it can improve not only the appearance of oiliness but also blackheads and pores which often go hand in hand with oily skin but what i like about this product in particular is that in addition to the clays which are the functional ingredients it super moisturizing so this isn to over dry out your skin like a lot of other clay masks often will many clay masks have all these gimmicky goofy ingredients like different glitters they change color i mean hopefully the days of those are are you know something that us but the cetaphil one nonsense fantastic for people with oily skin it really moisturizing it also has avocado oil and i mean it just feels like a moisturizer so if you have really oily skin and prominent pores try using it a few times a week you just put it on clean skin leave it on for about 10 minutes and then rinse it off and it actually cleansing your skin with a cleanser to remove the oil where you have stripping away of the natural lipids this is much more gentle but it actually is more strategic and that will get rid of that oiliness the other thing that i would encourage you to consider especially for those of you who wear makeup and have really oily skin and you find that the makeup just doesn your skin well without like cleansing it beforehand try this product instead try putting it on like in the morning to a clean dry face without even like washing your face first or anything just to the oily areas leave it on for 10 minutes and then rinse it off this moisturizer is so no-nonsense and wonderful for people with either oily skin or dry skin combination skin i mean any skin type it no thought is involved in picking this moisturizer in my opinion it has hyaluronic acid in it and it it so it so this is a great choice to use like after you rinse the skin from cleansing to just go ahead and apply it right away it has hyaluronic acid a humectant that helps hydrate the skin and improve the look of wrinkles and fine lines just by space filling with that added hydration and it silicones in it to seal in the hydration and prevent it from evaporating out it absorbs really quickly and is super lightweight this is great to use in the morning if you find that you like to use a moisturizer in the morning before applying sunscreen and again in the evening time before bed and it a moisturizer they could also call this a serum and people would believe it it absorbing formulation but it does impart long-lasting hydration throughout the day or throughout the you know while you sleep at night the next product is the cetaphil pro oil absorbing moisturizer spf 30. this is a chemical sunscreen so it shouldn a cast it for people with acne who are using topical medications that are very drying and peeling but they need to use both a moisturizer and a sunscreen this is a wonderful product for them to use in the morning and for throughout the day for not only sun protection but for keeping their skin moisturized it ingredients that actually can help wick up some of the excess oil off the surface of the skin so it can improve the look of shininess and greasy skin but it also has ceramides to help with the skin barrier and it again very moisturizing really important when you are using topical acne medications that you are also using a moisturizer because there is a skin barrier issue going on when it comes to acne and if that addressed with consistent use of a moisturizer then the acne doesn quickly and you know you to flares so this is a great product and it has spf of 30 which is great uh to protect your skin from the sun and does not leave a cast super affordable it as the different oil control oil absorbing moisturizer spf 30. both different and cetaphil they galderma brands and you some of the products are exactly the same the next product is fantastic for acne prone sensitive rosacea dry skin oily skin i mean a lot of people will benefit from this it is the uh redness relieving daily facial moisturizer spf 20. i wish it were 30 but it is it baseline and it so the tint will help protect the skin against those pro pigmenting wavelengths of visible light so this is a great product for people with acne to prevent issues like post acne hyperpigmentation and redness speaking of redness this product also has a licorice root which will calm down redness and will also help in reducing post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation what was the other thing this had this has caffeine two and caffeine kind of imparts a transient improvement in redness just by vasoconstriction and it in scavenging free radicals the tint on this is only good though if you have pale to medium a pale to medium skin tone if you have a deeper skin tone this is not going to work for you um it a mineral sunscreen i forgot to mention that so this um will leave a cast on deeper skin tones but if you have sensitive skin and you don this is this is one to choose because it great for protecting against the wavelengths that lead to hyperpigmentation and redness um yeah love this and i highly recommend it the next product is um pretty much the same product as that but they no sunscreen in this this is intended for nighttime use this one has like like the daytime one this one has licorice root in it which will help with redness and irritation but unlike the daytime one this has niacinamide another fantastic ingredient for reducing redness it helps address skin barrier repair and dry skin and it helps with hyperpigmentation however some people do find that niacinamide stings or burns so if that be aware that this product has that but um taking a step back this product does not so if you moisturizer from cetaphil and you don niacinamide go with the daily hydrating lotion with hyaluronic acid whereas the redness relieving one is fantastic especially for people with rosacea or hyperpigmentation there of good active ingredients in this that can help those issues it takes the guesswork out of like using a bunch of different serums like for example using a serum that has niacinamide or using a serum with licorice root instead of layering all those things i mean you have it all in one product so it takes a lot it just minimizes the number of things you have to use which ultimately is the best way to go in my opinion reduces the risk of problems arising when you do that when you dial down your skincare routine to just a few basics all right the next product is for those of you with eczema why am i doing this let go team because i have eczema and it eczema awareness month awareness month eczema it you have eczema like myself you know the struggle a fantastic moisturizer from cetaphil that is really remarkable for people with x-mon is their pro i mean it soothing moisturizer now this product is unique it steroids like cerave but within their ceramides they also have uh a synthetic flagrant now folarin is a component of the skin barrier that people with eczema are lacking often and so you have that in there and maybe it can kind of help in promoting barrier restoration which is what you need in eczema especially after bathing beyond that the ceramides and the flagrant it also has colloidal oatmeal a fantastic skin protectant that has beta glucans in it to form like a hydrocolloid colloidal oatmeal also has avinanthromides which gavin scavenge free radicals and it fda monograph as a skin protectant so fantastic from that standpoint so it kind of blends the best of both worlds in terms of what cerave offers and what ambino offers in in one product by cetaphil uh with their unique synthetic fallacy and so it unique product it in comparison to their other products but it about this specifically for people with eczema is that many moisturizers including the ones that i am going to continue that i of this video many moisturizers will cause a stinging sensation for people with eczema and i find just in my personal anecdotal clinical experience that this one tends to not sting um i don it so if you have a child with eczema or you are suffering it as suffering with it as an adult or teen try this out it is a great body moisturizer you can also use it on the face as a side note anytime there is a body moisturizer whether it be a cream or a lotion always consider giving it a try z on your face cuts down on the number of products you ultimately have to use if the same moisturizer or that you body can be used on your face it simplifies things so yeah that great one if you have eczema now their intensive lotion with ceramides is another noteworthy product this is more lightweight so if you don if you need if you necessarily you the throes of like severely dry skin but you top of your skin barrier and prevent dry skin stay moisturized especially with winter coming up try their lotion it honestly very similar to cerave lotions that ceramides and niacinamide so helpful for skin barrier restoration and it the next product that i truly truly love from cetaphil i mean it best products is their moisturizing cream for very dry sensitive skin this product is phenomenal if you suffer from chafing like under your arms between your legs because it just really makes a nice barrier to friction it helps protect the skin from irritants and it is on the thicker side but it restoration and just protecting your skin you can try using it on the face but it find that comfortable but again you can always try and if it works out great this product in contrast like cerave cream or a beano cream there pops out in the ingredient lust there no there are no ceramides there niacinamide there there i mean it autumn and glycerin so glycerins humectant to hydrate up the skin a petrolatum will seal all that in this is really a wonderful no-nonsense moisturizer i love this because it has a few ingredients um and it recommend it uh for people who are just dealing with really dry skin especially again for whatever reason the cetaphil moisturizers i do find i tend to recommend them for people who find that the cerave ones sting or burn try to try this cream if you didn cerave moisturizing cream in the realm of bathing i always encourage everyone to be very conservative with the amount of body wash and soap that they use because using too much can dry out the skin and for people with eczema it can really aggravate things however it is really important to cleanse the skin especially in the skin folds and obviously to visibly soiled areas and in those areas you need to often enlist a body wash or soap i recommend to you guys the cetaphil ultra gentle body wash fragrance free it quite good it has panthenol in it a wonderful ingredient that helps with skin barrier recovery so it kind of helps address the issues around cleansing with stripping the lipid barrier no matter how gentle the cleanser is that happen these names are mouthful so side note cetaphil has the longest names for its products it like multiple lines on the bottle like encompass the name and you that all right and then the tenth recommendation is new from cetaphil it soothing gel cream with aloe this product came out recently it people actually they don a video explaining aloe and how it helps for the skin and you know some of the nuances about aloe so definitely check that out before considering this product but aloe as you know is popularized for applying to sunburns for kind of its soothing anti-inflammatory effect aloe also has a skin brightening effect through the compound allicins um and so it panthenol in it a b vitamin that is wonderful for skin barrier restoration and this product unlike the creams and the lotions it absorbs super quickly i mean it more of a gel a vehicle more of a gel like vehicle but it doesn any alcohols in it or anything so it has a cooling effect for people with eczema i know always come back to eczema but hey it awareness month um for people with eczema sometimes that cooling effect can really be very soothing on their itchy inflamed skin but you don to enjoy that a lot of times that sensation comes with the ingredient menthol which is fragrance but this this doesn in it so if you seeking that kind of cooling effect try this definitely can use it on the face um and you know a lot of people will frequently comment on instagram or in my videos like hey you know i try a lot of body moisturizers and i have issues with breakouts on my body with certain heavy body moisturizers is there an alternative try this one it in consistency to the neutrogena hydro boost body lotion that i rather enjoy um similar consistency very few ingredients and it hydration and kind of more soothing the skin so those are my top 10 from cetaphil um you know i was disappointed i saw these products that set a phil launched this year and i was so excited and come to find out they put fragrance in them and you know i always recommend people try and avoid fragrance especially in levon products and i have heard feedback from people who have tried it the fragrance is horrible but these products otherwise looked so good like they were all kind of focused i think around hyaluronic acid and skin barrier repair i mean i don know why they went that way you know i know why brands put fragrance in you know it has consumer appeal the luxury experience but when you cetaphil you like you no-nonsense because you eczema or acne or something where you you driven and cetaphil really does themselves a disservice by putting these offensive fragrances and things and you know you know people i find i find that people who turn to these brands and you know that i recommending these brands to or people who have skin conditions they looking for they and to form memories with the cream they they don to not they need to do like you know i mean cerave doesn ever put fragrance and stuff yuceran doesn these are brands that bani cream never puts fragrance and stuff these are brands that people who have active skin issues can generally feel comfortable going to because they guys those are my top 10 from cetaphil i plan in the future to do other brands obviously aveeno will be coming up and also i might do paula um you know i plan to do eustrin la roche posay o.n the inky list is another one i i have a lot of great products and uh for those of you who want cruelty free i think that and it was thinking of doing paula let me know if you guys would like that as well anyways yammering aside i hope you guys enjoyed this vid if so give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen and subscribe i guys tomorrow [Music] bye [Music] you	Success
TOP 10 NEUTROGENA skin care products| Dr Dray	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mw22-BSE1Og	Dr Day	well hey guys in today to be sharing with you my top 10 products by neutrogena neutrogena is a brand that i recommending for years and personally using since i was a teenager actually for my acne and then i started using their sunscreens and you guys know i huge fan uh and i thought this would be a fun little series to kind of do from time to time just like my top 10 products from some of the major skincare brands out there speaking of skincare brands one place i always go to shop for skin care as well as pretty much everything else in my life is walmart today partnership with walmart as part of their here for every beauty campaign and walmart is a one-stop shop for all of your skincare needs and not only in store but if you go online they really have it set up very nicely you can shop by different skin concerns and they have a great landing page of dermatologist recommended products many of my neutrogena favorites are featured in that lineup and they also carry other fantastic brands like cerave aven so if you guys would like to see a top 10 of some of these other major brands that i let me know if you guys like this style of video but definitely check out walmart for your skincare needs they you know they really come a long way over the years as far as expanding what they offer not only do they offer these major skin care brands that you can typically find in the drugstore but they also have a lot of the more high-end skin care brands the image skincare sunscreen that i was using and have since finished up in my 2020 skincare routine you can get that at walmart i mean they really have a a massive selection so definitely check it out and of course all these products that i video you can find at walmart and i will list everything down below in the description box all right starting out is a sunscreen that i used throughout college frequently and in med school and it perfect for folks with oily skin it is the neutrogena clear face breakout free sunscreen now i have always used their spf 30. um they also make this product as an spf 50 for the face i find the 50 burns and stings around the eyes so i really only ever use the spf 30. this is wonderful like i said for people with oily skin it shiny it absorbs very quickly it it and the other thing that i like about this of course is that it fragrance and speaking to the needs of people with oily skin it has silica in it which can actually mop up some oiliness kind of help with degreasing your skin i find a real barrier in applying sunscreen and reapplying it especially for people with very oily skin is the fact that people find that sunscreen makes them feel greasier or feels greasy and makes them feel oilier so having those ingredients are really helpful in the sunscreen now they also make this product spf 30 for the body it i imagine you can try using that on your face now i have not done that but it probably more cost effective and you certainly can try it i don that product looks on the face but the formulation is pretty similar to this so give it a try it obviously going to be a better value oftentimes the body products are so i never actually tried it on my face i always just use this one now that product is a chemical sunscreen so it won on your skin if you have a deeper skin tone but for some people with really sensitive skin they find they cannot tolerate chemical sunscreens and the neutrogena sunscreens they have an ingredient in them oxybenzone that can be more on the irritating side and for people with super sensitive skin they don but they do make some wonderful mineral sunscreens as well and one that they but i before they repackaged it sensitive skin face liquid spf 50. now this is a liquid mineral sunscreen the active ingredients are zinc and titanium dioxide so very very good for people with very sensitive skin they those ingredients don you can use them around your eyes this product is not super drying either a lot of mineral sunscreens people find to be too drying this product is water resistant and the reason i like it is that it very thin consistency so it doesn heavy on the skin again speaking to that issue with people having feeling like heavy sunscreens and why not make them feel greasy this is one that that doesn you guys though uh it does have a white cast is it is it like ghost white no i mean there certainly are worse mineral sunscreens with in terms of the cast out there but if you have a deeper skin tone this is probably going to show up on your skin or give that kind of lavender look however this sunscreen i will point out works really well under makeup it almost has like a matte finish to it it works really well under makeup so if you the cast and then you wears makeup you with foundation i think that would actually end up working out just fine but i have always loved this product i recommend it to my patients with rosacea and very sensitive skin and again because it sunscreen it your eyes speaking of sensitive skin a next favorite from neutrogena is their oil-free moisturizer for sensitive skin i personally use this product for many years throughout med school and college it most neutrogena products it but this product you know it to people with sensitive skin but you don to use this and to find that it might work for you it acne prone skin oily skin it but it does what it it reduces water loss from the skin this particular moisturizer i always recommend to patients who are i medications that are very drying and irritating they need to use a moisturizer to to be able to tolerate that this is one i always recommend uh it it water loss from the skin and prevents dryness and irritation speaking of dry skin we are all dealing with dry hands and if you channel for any number of episodes uh if you checked out any of my hand care videos chances are you know i am a huge fan of the neutrogena norwegian formula hand cream the fragrance free version the reason i love this product so much is that it uh absorbs super quickly it doesn leave a sticky or greasy residue and it i like that it really trap in hydration into your skin we always should be washing our hands it important part of hygiene and cold and flu season but now more than ever i think people are really really aware of hand hygiene which is which is a good thing um but because of that i think people are for the first time experiencing really really dry hands and flares of hand dermatitis from over washing maybe you that or you hot water all of these things strip away the natural lipids on your skin and you tend to lose water out of the skin that can cause dryness fissuring painful cracks on the skin and also it can really aggravate around your nail beds make your cuticles dry so using a moisturizer is really important for keeping your skin healthy on your hands you know you can wash your hands as part of hygiene but then if the skin barrier is impaired the skin on the hands is not as functional for protecting you from the outside of the outside world so that moisturizer piece of hand care is really important now a product that i was slow to appreciate but over the years have come to love and really really think is amazing for improving the look of wrinkles and fine lines at least temporarily so long as you use it and that is the neutrogena hydro boost extra dry sensitive skin hyaluronic acid gel cream you know this product is marketed as a moisturizer basically you know you just put it on your skin and boom it super hydrating because it has that hyaluronic acid that to water in the skin but i find that this product also works really well or like around the eyes underneath other moisturizers to kind of deliver spot focused intensive hydration and in doing so improves the look of wrinkles and fine lines it lasts as long as you you know if you stop using it then that effect goes away but just by adding hydration and plumping up those skin cells you can really get a wrinkle smoothing effect and this can be tolerated well around the eyes you can use it on your neck and you really only need a tiny tiny amount of this so this is one that has been a favorite of mine for several years now and i always always recommend but you also can use that just as a basic moisturizer to your entire face it has dimethicone in it so that will help seal and trans epidermal water loss but personally i find that the product i don balance of hyaluronic acid to dimethicone i find that it just works better under other moisturizers for the purpose that i outlined of hydrating up wrinkles and fine lines if i use it as a moisturizer to my entire face i find it just dries a little filmy and doesn perform as well so i don really shines at is for spot focused hydration now an honorable mention um is the hydro boost body gel cream now this i personally find works really well all over the face and it also improves the look of wrinkles and fine lines it is a better value so this is this is an honorable mention alongside the uh gel cream a little off course here but i wanted to mention i just got these haven them or used them or anything neutrogena came out with a hydro boost what is this called hydro boost overnight hydration cream so this sounds really good it petrolatum dimethicone zinc gluconate and copper gluconate which are um which are poly hydroxy acids that can really help in hydrating the skin and also in helping to exfoliate dry stuff and it obviously has hyaluronic acid in it as well sodium hyaluronate is the same thing as hyaluronic acid and then they also came out with a fragrance-free hyaluronic acid serum so i look forward to trying these you guys i wanted to point them out in case you guys had seen them and wonder like what my thoughts are ingredient-wise they look really good but i haven but yeah long story short hydro boost gel cream is fantastic and the body lotion is a great affordable alternative to it that you can use all over the face so kind of one category all right this is a product that i started using when i was a teenager and i mean i used it for years and if you go back to the very beginning of my channel i have a video on i think a skincare routine for oily skin where i share this it this is a salicylic acid acne face wash that um i find incredibly effective just lather to the skin leave it on for a few minutes and then rinse it off with consistent use it can impart good control of acne but if you don with exfoliating the skin if you have enlarged pores or really oily skin the salicylic acid can work on the oiliness it can work on enlarged pores blackheads i mean it really can do a lot you have to be patient with it and use it consistently for a period of time to begin to see results but the salicylic acid is definitely beneficial salicylic acid is also a great ingredient if you happen to have unfortunately those little flat warts on the face it can help in expediting the clearance of those i have a video on words but salicylic acid is a good ingredient for that salicylic acid is also good for improving hyperpigmentation and accelerating the rate of clearance of hyperpigmentation now i have videos on salicylic acid and why it into using salicylic acid long before i was a dermatologist and i continue to recommend it now this product does have fragrance in it so if you have an allergy to fragrance you cannot use that but fragrance as i videos is more of a problem in lebon products less of a problem in rinse off products so you know this even though it has fragrance it a very good product now a note about the salicylic acid face wash whether it be that or any other salicylic acid face wash don around your eyes or around your mouth or on your neck even because the skin in those areas is more sensitive it thinner and as a result you can get a lot of irritation i mean a lot of people inadvertently use the acne wash to like wash their eyelids and they end up getting like irritation around their eyelids so i always caution you guys about that it can cause irritation around the eyes all right the next product is for those of you who want an over-the-counter retinol for anti-aging purposes to improve wrinkles and fine lines neutrogena makes one of the best in my opinion their rapid wrinkle repair regenerating cream the fragrance free version they have one with fragrance but i recommend the fragrance free version it has a sustain release retinol so you don into the skin at once it a sustained action that and that product stands for and as a result it you get more controlled delivery of the retinol and it and the formulation overall is very moisturizing and just the product itself has almost an instant brightening hydrating and smoothing effect because the moisturizer is that good but with consistent use you will get first you peeling and irritation after a few weeks but then after a while those side effects of irritation and peeling subside and with long-term consistent use the retinol can help in boosting up collagen production in the deeper layers of the skin it just takes time to to start that part of it just takes time to start working but the product overall i mean it almost has an instant wrinkle smoothing effect just by virtue of the vehicle it and i strongly recommend it now that product you don your eyes it can be very irritating around the eyes but i do get a lot of questions can i recommend a retinol for around the eyes and i nervous about this because really any retinol can be super irritating around the eyes but it off the table now neutrogena also makes an eye cream with their retinol in it that is fragrance free and is at a weaker percentage strength so it would be better tolerated under the eyes now you guys know i of eye creams i don you retinol product to use around your eyes your best bet is actually to choose an eye cream with a retinol and the neutrogena wand as a side note is very good so um i mention all right the next product is the neutrogena body oil light sesame formula fragrance free of course now this product i use as an oil cleanser to remove a water resistant sunscreen and mascara and then when i get in the shower i just wash it off with a gentle cleanser it works really well it works really well for that and one of the reasons it works so well for doing that in my opinion is that it break up the film of cosmetics and everything without disrupting the skin barrier like a harsh cleanser would but it also has polyethylene glycol in it that kind of helps with uh rinsing off rinsing the product off it has peg 40 in it so you know for that reason it it know you for a cleansing oil and you might buy one that is more costly than this and has similar ingredients for people with dry skin actually you know a lot of where the double cleansing comes from is that for people with like eczema it bath oil because their skin just is really sensitive to the harsh drying nature of soaps and what you know water disrupts the lipid barrier so it recommended that patients with eczema put a little body oil fragrance free into the bath and that can kind of help in adding the emollient effect can help in reducing the degree of impairment to the skin barrier that comes with bathing the bath oil kind of offsets that so this is another good use for this product it just put a little in the bath water and it will kind of help in reducing just some of the degree of irritation that can occur with bathing it rinses off the skin really easily too if you want to use that as a cleansing oil like i do uh it doesn this this has been really working out well for me and it lasts forever all right and then the last two products are hair care products now as a side note neutrogena recently launched a bunch of new shampoos and can i think conditioners too or maybe just shampoos i have not tried any of them but they are at walmart if you guys wanted to check them out but there are two shampoos by neutrogena that i always recommend the first is for people who use a lot of products and maybe don frequently as like me i shampoo every day people who use a lot of styling products pomades mousses gels sprays dry shampoo all of that leads to build up on the hair shaft so when you do shampoo it you select a shampoo that hair shaft otherwise you get that buildup it leads to dull appearing hair and hair breakage and the neutrogena anti-residue shampoo it it helps to remove that product build up from the hair shaft it free of fragrance you only should use it like once a week if you use it as your everyday shampoo it but for those folks who you know use a lot of products this is this is a great thing to incorporate into your hair care routine there are a lot of clarifying shampoos out there but the neutrogena anti-residue shampoo is not one to pass by it free of fragrance and it does what you want it to do it removes that product build up from the hair shaft so always a go-to recommendation for people looking for a clarifying shampoo and the tenth product that i recommend to you guys is a great one for shampooing the scalp it scalp care and it shampoo this is a salicylic acid shampoo three percent salicylic acid salicylic acid is great for people who have a really oily scalp maybe you suffer from dandruff little bumps in the scalp you have a lot of buildup on your scalp this is a shampoo to incorporate into your hair care routine for sure but a note about how to use this don of it for hair strand cleansing purposes think of it as a scalp product and the way to use it is similar actually to to the acne wash only on your scalp and that is just lather it to your scalp massage it in let it sit on your scalp for a few minutes and rinse it off the shampoo is also really good if you have seborrheic dermatitis on your face because one thing that often goes hand in hand with seborrheic dermatitis on the face is dandruff even dandruff that you might not even really like notice or realize you might have a little dandruff up here and i saw that that can actually trickle down on your face and contribute to seborrheic dermatitis on the face and so i always tell patients with seborrheic dermatitis to make sure that they use an anti-dandruff shampoo to their scalp a few nights a week that it will also end up helping the health of their the skin on their face by reducing by reducing the burden of that little yeast malassezia that lives on our scalp and on the oily surfaces of our face and contributes to seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff so that of this shampoo is that it helps with the dandruff and oiliness and seborrhea as a side note but the anti-residue clarifying shampoo and the t cell are safe for color treated hair so those are my top 10 neutrogena products do you guys have any neutrogena favorites that i missed uh they have a lot of great products i didn don have a lot of really good makeup products as well you know i recommend their foundation a lot because it ingredients and people tend to to get along well with it like they even have a line of hydro boost foundations i just don personally use them so i don to them for you guys but i do know that their makeup is very good quality as well so i hope you guys enjoyed this video and thank you walmart for partnering with me on today if you guys liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen and subscribe i guys tomorrow bye [Music]

My Holy Grail Summer Makeup Routine 2025	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1rt3sRsn2c	Dr Day	Well, hey guys. Get excited. Today I going to be sharing with you, as promised, my everyday makeup essentials. Makeup products I swear by. I would consider them to be my current, at least holy grail makeup musthaves. Everything I have here in this cute little makeup pouch with the B brooch. Now, if you ever found yourself wondering in my videos, what is that mascara she on? What cheek color is she wearing? Where is that lipstick from? That we up. I makeup skills. This is very bare bones. There contouring, none of that. And all of this I apply over a solid base layer of sunscreen. First thing I like to arrange my eyebrow hairs in a particular order on my face. I think it just kind of I don I like them to stay that way. I don want to have them moving all around. I live in a very humid climate, so there are a lot of products I have tried out over the years, and some of them just melt. I including high-end ones, expensive ones from Sephora. But this, ladies and gentlemen, is my holy grail triedand-true brow gel from Maybelline Superlock Brow Glue. This is excellent. It doesn itch, which some of them do. It holds all day. doesn humidity. Amazing. Honorable mention for NYX. They have a brow glue as well. That this. But this is one I have gone back to multiple times. I swear by Maybelline Super Lock. There Eyeliner I proceed with caution because a little bit eyeliner is something that I approach with a very light hand because a little bit in my opinion goes a long way. Also in my opinion though again not a makeup person. I think people, especially as they get a little wiser in years, they tend to overline their eyes, and it ends up making them look a lot smaller, which is what we trying to avoid. The eyeliner I using for quite some time now is the L Shade. This is a nice gel formula that super smooth, doesn with a little blendy tip on the end if you want to smudge it out, but like I said, I don like that. But it also has a little sharpener in it as well if you want to get a jazzier tip. Something else I don product by itself and a little bit. Now, if you watch a lot of my vlogs, maybe you tried this product for the first time and I hated it. I hated it. I didn like it. Maybe I don the right word. I can just know that I was like, not so happy with it. Tried the gray color and all of a sudden it was like, oh yeah, this is one of the best products I and it stays on all day and it also lasts a long time. As far as the product, like this particular pencil I So, highly recommend that. As far as concealer, I have been using the same concealer now for I want to say 3 years. And I keep thinking to myself, maybe I should try something else because honestly, it is on the expensive side for what I prefer to spend. But it lasts a long time. It works. So, I spending the money. And that is the Merit Minimalist Concealer. Now, I just use this under my eyes, but you could use it elsewhere as a concealer. It nice creamy formula. It doesn any creasing for me, and it lasts all day. Now, Merritt formulas, they super high coverage. So, if you have something that you are really, really trying to mask to completely make unvisible to the naked eye, this is not going to cut it. It it dense, thick coverage of something. So, just keep that in mind. But for me, it just brightens up the under eye area just enough. It doesn greasy, flaky. So, that me. But I put it on. And then what I do is come in with my next mustave. I have repurchased this so many times. It L basically a tinted fragrance-free moisturizer. I have the shade light glow, although I deeper of a shade as well, and they also look good. These are beautiful on the skin. So, I put some on the cheeks and then I just kind of blend it all in with the concealer under my eyes and then blend this product down my face for just a little bit of a glow. Again, this is not a high coverage product. It going to, for example, make your freckles disappear through its coverage effects, but it does provide a nice luminous glow to the face without being glitterati. Without being glitterati. I love that product to bits. I love it. There Those of you who are sensitive, nycinomide makes an appearance in makeup a lot, too. So, I scalp. I scout it out. So, those of you who are sensitive, you know, to avoid it and those of you who, like me, get along well with it, you\\ great. to a full face of sunscreen. So, one other thing I want to point out is that I put my sunscreen on in the morning and then I usually go about my morning routine of like making coffee and all that sort of stuff and then I do my makeup. So, my sunscreen has been on for like 20 minutes to sometimes an hour, depending on what kind of morning it is, before I do my makeup. So, I don the sunscreen on and then put makeup on right away. And I think that because if the sunscreen is still wet on your face, like the product is not dry, and then you go putting on, for example, a tinted moisturizer, which is what the Lumi lotion is, or your foundation or whatever, you could be smudging away some of the sunscreen, the sun protection. So, that routine and how I far as blush, this is the product I been using. And a word of caution, it take you from cute to clown really really quick. Just just a tiny bit extra of product from this. Be aware of that. Like, I products like this first and then apply their foundation and all their their layers of makeup on over it. And by the time they get done with all that, then it looks like the way I use it, which is real light-handed. But I just use a tiny tiny little speck of this on each cheek to give me some cheek color. It great formula. It lasts a long time. Winky Luxe is underrated in my experience as far as their makeup. They have many excellent makeup products. They have that amazing mascara set that I need to go back to at some point, but we Anyway, love this. What color am I using? Cheeky Rose. It And like I said, light hand. Light hand. The cheeky rose shade is just a nice soft pink, not bright red or anything like that. Works well with my color tone. Now, WikiLux also has a highlighter that pink that doing the highlighting. I found I didn really know what to do with that product. I didn much, but this is is one that I I use all of the time. Moving on to mascara, but a word of warning, I change up mascara all the time. Like, I a mascara and then I try a different brand. I So, saying holy grail for a mascara coming from me is a bit of an overstatement. But those of you who have been here for a long time, you know, a mascara I have raved about that I really love for lift, length, all of the things super affordable is Maybelline Colossal. And a lot of you guys probably don even know that because it years since I have used Maybelline Colossal cuz like I said, I am a serial cheater when it comes to my mascara. finish one and I move on to the next. This is like swipe on cuz I just like trying different mascaras. But when I went to Ulta World, I went to the Maybelline booth and what did I learn? Uh they have a new Colossal Mascara, the Bubble Colossal Mascara. So, they gifted this to me at the booth and they informed me, I know, shocker, that it Tik Tok viral, which wow, wow, wow, wow. Tik Tok viral. And I because Tik Tok viral, it has lost its meaning. It doesn Things can go viral on Tik Tok that nobody actually likes or uses. But knowing how much I love the OG Maybelline Claws, I was like, sign me up. I mascaras, this has not disappointed. The applicator is a bit spiral. really allows you to get more product in certain areas of the lash for raw thickness, a thick deposition. And then swipe on over to the thinner areas, and you get a nice lengthening effect with deposition on the tips of the lashes. Coat, coat, coat, coat, coat, multiple coats. That is my rule of thumb. And this is something else that I have changed up over the years that I never used to do and I like doing that. Now, I don my old way. and that is I am a bottom mascara wearer now. Yeah, I put it on my bottom lashes. And speaking of Winky Lux, they doing that because they had that mascara trio that I would use with the primer and then the mascara for the top and the separate little skinny mini for the bottom. And now I some goop down there. So, love this. It flakes under my eyes with this, especially with the seasonal allergies combined with the humidity. I have gotten, you know, sometimes a little little black eye look with it, but it a great formula overall. And Maybelline does not disappoint. Does not disappoint. Affordable. Let me know if you guys have tried this yet because while it people really liking it. I and it Another thing I have zero loyalty to is going to be lip care products. I collect lip care products. I love so many. So, I been using a lot. The first is a builds itself as a lip blur balm. Now, I reviewed these a while back. They from Coco Kind. The ceramide lip blur balm. I Really like this. It flavorfree lip balm. Goes on over sunscreen on the lips just fine. It very moisturizing, has camides, which are good for skin the reason I like the fact that it doesn it is those are common potential causes of allergic or irritant lip keilitis, meaning chap lips from your chapl lipped product. Uh yeah, that can happen. It doesn hydrating. It doesn your mouth. I really liked it. And this has been my favorite shade. Although if you go back and watch my review video of this, they have some other shades. Some of the deeper shades are going to be great for fall, which get excited because fall will be here in a how many months? June, July, August, four months. Four months. Get excited. Start carving your pumpkin now. I another lip product that I a ton. These are I swear by. I using them for years. Uh Neutrogena Moisture Smooth Color Sticks. Neutrogena makeup slept on. So the moisture smooth color sticks. They moisturizing lipstick. They do have flavorant in them. They do have a bit of of of a papaya tropical something essence to them. So, be aware of that. Um, not all Neutrogena lip products do, though. They have other lines of lip products that do not have that. But, I and I really like them because they moisturizing. They soft look without being so matte that they well. They Now, I number 100. And I really love this. It like a soft pink, but I can shade anywhere. Maybe in the drugstore it on Walmart somewhere or it don They they have great things and then they discontinue your favorites and come out with some other ones. It anyway, the moisture smooth color sticks are a thing. They have many shades. Whether or not the shade I using, pink nude, is still in existence to be determined. But that is that is a must-have holy grail. All right, y Those are my makeup favorites. What I been using, what I use pretty much every day. Um, what I have in here, I don really change the makeup a lot. Simple, everyday, great for summer makeup routine. Anyway, y the comments if you have used any of these, what you think, or if you have alternatives that you think are better. Share in the comments.

Affordable Skincare That ACTUALLY Works: Proven Products & Tips	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhLDvD5N2bU	Dr Day	things are more expensive than they were when I started this YouTube channel. So, in today I just went around collecting collecting things in no particular order that are affordable skin care products that actually work. It cereal aisle, overlaid it onto your face, that have available. Why are we ignoring Adapene 0.1% gel FDA approved for the treatment of acne? Hold that thought. available over the counter without a prescription. Been that way since what, 2017? And we still asleep at the wheel. And before you get all hung up on the cost of different gel cuz yeah, I know it getting pricey. There are a lot of other brands that have 0.1% adapine. So, you don loyal, okay? Although different, you know, they started the trend. Above and beyond this being an FDA approved treatment for acne. Those of you who do have acne that heals with a dark mark. This right here can help that not be so severe, not last as long, go away faster. All good things. I know a lot of you guys are like, Why are you always talking about acne? What are you, a dermatologist? This This right here can also be very helpful for other types of hyperpigmentation. post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation helps put the brakes on all the processes that upregulate that and it anti-inflammatory. Plus, if you someone whose skin tends to heal with persistent red marks, this may also help you out by reducing that inflammation. Plus, if you for an evidence-based topical that actually can work to improve collagen, what we do it. Not as much research behind this as tininoan, which is available by prescription only here in the US. Why? Well, because this is younger. Tininoan is an older drug. Older drug means more time with it. But there is evidence that this can improve wrinkles, improve the visible signs of skin aging, sun damage, age spots. And when you pluck skin out from from underneath itself, well, what you see under the microscope is an upregulation in collagen. Adapylene and other topical retinoids can help reduce the bumps of rosacea. also can help reduce the burden of that little demodex might which is a driving factor. Check out my videos on how to introduce this if you have sensitive skin because it will cause dryness, peeling and irritation in the beginning and a lot of people get overwhelmed by that. Here another one that the majority of people are asleep at the wheel because it in front of their face. It been sitting in traffic your whole life. Then you got that one cocky friend who like, go this way, the back road, the frontage road, or as they say here, the feeder road, whatever that means, you can get there with 10 minutes to spare. you\\ Well, that Monostat Chafing Relief Powder Gel. Cuz usually it section. And you might never think to put this on your face, but you can. It a skin protectant dimethylone based. So if you have a lot of irritation and you don also an affordable skin care product that works, but a lot of people are like, Try a dimethylone based skin protectant. Yeah, you can put this on your face. Makeup people have been doing it for a long time. You can, too. Plus, those of you, you know, coming up on summer here, and it in Houston, that means chafing under the arms, under the breast, between the thighs. You need this. You need it fragrance-free, affordable. I mentioned with regards to petroleum jelly, a lot of you guys are still scared. A lot of y jelly. So, let some quickfire uses for petroleum jelly above and beyond the slugging of Tik Tok days. You can put this around your nails. You can put this around your nails. Great for cutting down on nail fragility, brittle nails. Put it around the skin folds on your nails. Pays off. Nail slugging. That balm. Great. cut down on shaving. Great. I because yeah, it maybe maybe you don in your budget right now, but it certainly handy and it expensive. If you get this hydraulic hand eczema, which I do, when you want to itch, you just pull out the stick and grease up the side. Here recently discovered and have been using regularly from Euster Radiant Tone line. The cleansing gel 2% AHA complex. This is a glycolic and lactic acid gel cleanser. Fragrance-free. This is excellent if you are looking to improve dry rough skin texture. Maybe you little sensitive though, prone to redness, stinging, burning. So, leave on alpha hydroxy acids are a bit too much for you or you things going on in your skinare routine that you through efficiently. This is a great option. It also will be helpful for hastening the clearance of dark spots, hyperpigmentation. May help your skin care products go on better, smooth out the surface of the skin. Great if you have keratossis pilars. I this in the morning for the past several months. Really like it. And one word warning, alpha hydroxy acids, they can be a little drying, so don eyelids with this. And be gentle, you know, proceed with caution on the neck. Might be too irritating there. Make sure you sure you alpha hydroxy acids can increase your sensitivity to the sun. Speaking of alpha hydroxy acids, maybe you want something that that you leave on but you scared. You security guard with the demodex on his shoulders is looming and you can\\ alpha hydroxy acid that Great for rough skin texture, softening keratossis pilaris, hastening the clearance of dark marks, generally well tolerated. And those of you, you already know, cuz I product from Wish Trend for years now, at least 6 years of me recommending this. Some of you are already yawning at this point. Not only does it have mandelic acid, but it root, great for redness, soothing the skin, and it really hydrating. Love this. Fragrance-free. Let else. Salicylic acid. In contrast to alpha hydroxy acid, salicylic acid really finesses the sebaceous oil gland. It who have blackheads and white heads. This moisturizer from Cedaphil. It was a 2024 discovery and favorite. Underrated, very luxurious texture, if I do say so myself. Salicylic acid plus polyhydroxy acids which are a whole other class of chemical exfoliants that are even gentler than mandelic acid plus help with improving moisture retention. This is great as a leaveon moisturizer. You can use it on your face. Yeah, you can you can use this on your face. You can use it on your body. It guessed it, mandelic. Okay, so if you want to dance dance on in with a mambbo combo of alpha hydroxy acid plus get on in there in the pore, maybe you might want to consider this instead of this. Really hydrating, great for the body, great for rough and bumpy skin, fragrance-free. And I almost forgot the Gold Bond Retinol Overnight Body and Face Lotion. I since it came out. It improving the visible appearance of sun damage, chest, forearms, legs. deeply hydrating in addition to retinol which can help improve age spots, hyperpigmentation, sun damage, fine lines, wrinkles. It also has ura which is underrated for hydrating the skin and smoothing away dry rough buildup. Fragrance-free talk moisturizer. Just moisturizing your skin consistently can help in the journey to improving overall skin tone, discoloration, redness, hyperpigmentation. an ingredient lineup, texture, feel, performance that I honestly don going after luxury skin care. For this kind of a ingredient profile, you just paying oftent times for perfuming. This has nioinamide, which helps tackle dark spots by disrupting the transfer of pigment packets from the melanocytes to the surrounding skin. It root as well, and it also has caffeine. Caffeine is great for deeppuffing if you were to use it up under here, which yeah, you can. You don and buy a caffeine eye cream. This is what I what I don times the ingredients you after, they might already be in in your facial moisturizer. Yeah, sometimes they area and you do need to maybe pursue them from an eye cream. But in this case, caffeine can help deeppuff for some of you and help tackle some maybe surface hyperpigmentation. This is a great option. Great as a a daily facial moisturizer. Great to pair with a dappling gel. Not only will this Mambbo combo be great for dark spots, but it really great if you are looking to find a moisturizer, which I recommend to incorporate when using this to cut down on dryness and irritation. If you have a young teen with acne breakouts, these are great over- the-counter options. Speaking of discoloration, recently I reviewed this and it mind. It is underrated. It Slices, which is the sister brand of Peach and Lily. Should come as no surprise to you guys that I ended up liking this cuz I do often like and recommend a lot of Peach Slices products. I think they are underrated. And this is a great option again for those of you looking to tackle dark spots, improve discoloration, as well as help to improve the skin barrier and maybe even tackle stubborn redness. It a 4.5% nyioinomide serum which is a great percentage. As a side note, a lot of nycinomide products use a very high percentage which doesn you better results but does come with a greater likelihood of irritation. So, a reasonable evidence-based percentage. Plus, it has a form of tranexemic acid, which the jury is still out on topical trannexeamic acid. But where it appears to shine, at least in clinical experience, clinical anecdote, and a few case reports, the topical application of trannexeamic acid is in addressing stubborn redness. Plus, the nioinamide, which I didn also good for redness. So, this is going to get at a lot of different angles. It standalone moisturizer, but if you tend to have drier skin, you might want to you might want to use something else like this different um moisturizer, which is, you know, a little richer. This is a great option for tackling dark spots, discoloration. A lot of you guys who are always looking out for that security guard with the demodex on his shoulder. You got rosacea and you real, you know, wary of skincare products as you should be because you have a baseline sensitivity to stuff and it can aggravate redness, cause flushing. But there are some ingredients that can help you out. Above and beyond nioinamide, which is great for rosacea if you tolerate it and it formulated. Above and beyond the adapylene journey, which may may be irritating in the beginning, but can reduce the burden of those bumps of rosacea. You also have sulfur. I don have it with me here, but the da cru sulfur. Sulfur is great not only for rosacea bumps, but also for acne and helps cut down on, you guessed it, demadeex. Also helpful for those of you who have se dermatitis, those red, flaky, oily patches in the brow area, the forehead, the sides of the nose. Sulfur is sulfur is great and it good for those of you who get those little bumps around your eyes, around your nose, around your mouth, perorificial dermatitis. Sulfur is excellent. Highly, highly recommend that product. Super affordable. We need to talk about peptides again because peptides are all the rage and maybe you want something affordable that can fulfill your peptide longing. Peptides are the kind of thing we just put faith in. At any rate, they do help to improve moisture content and skin layer which can help smooth little fine dehydration lines. And peptides, you know, they may they may this is a big may, they may help protect your collagen destruction. Some of them calm down levels of inflammatory mediators that are upregulated in an effort to destroy your collagen. Some of them have peptides that kind of look like collagen and may stimulate healing pathways. Last year, this is this is a repurchase for me here. That box. I discovered this Ka RX six peptide skin booster. And this product for me personally works. works to just smooth the skin, give this sort of bouncy, glowy, radiant luminosity, and you get a ton in this bottle. It need very much. This is a thin liquid. So, first step in your skinare routine after cleansing, you can use it morning and or night, both twice a day. And it got natural moisturizing factors in it, which also are really helpful for the moisture barrier. Love, love, love this two bits. Speaking of moisture barrier, we already talked about petroleum jelly. We already talked about the Monat shaving cream. These are skin protectants. Don Another one to the party. This is a repurchase for me and I swear up and down around town by this. This is a glycerin rich moisturizer. It builds itself as an overnight mask. So, this is something you last step in your skincare routine. Now, I often just end up using it like on my cheeks, my midface area. You could use it all over if you wanted to. It is a clear, colorless, thick jelly. So, when you put this on, a word of warning, it is sticky. It it on and shortly thereafter you get in bed, you sheets. It end. But if you give it some time, it will sink in, dry down, the following morning. This makes you feel rich. This will, you know, resuscitate your soul. If you are feeling like you are you are being deprived because the budget is getting too tight, this is worth it. This is worth it. You don much. A little bit goes a long way. You don Like I said, it have some dryness, some sensitivity, stinging, burning. Like the cheeks are a really vascular territory, so they lot more vulnerable to that feeling. All right. Highly, highly recommend that one. Now, I already told you guys petroleum jelly works. Petroleum jelly works for so many things. Check out my videos on underrated uses of petroleum jelly, aka Vaseline. Um, but a lot of times people are seeing these advertisements for lip sleeping masks. And I you, I have tried the expensive lip sleeping mask from Lan. And I know there are some loyalists in the audience who swear up and down by that thing. But for me, not only was it, you know, the the heavy scent, but it actually made my lips drier. It just didn But if you like that consistency, don well, sleep on it cuz it used at night to really help reduce water loss from the lips. This Neutrogena overnight lip sleeping mask, I years. It really thick. It Hyaluronic acid. Deeply hydrates. plumps the lips but without the irritation that you get from lip plumpers. Fragrance free, fragrant free. It travel, too. Like I often have this in my travel bag because lip care products, I have so many, but when I travel at night in hotel rooms is really where my lips are going to be sucked dry. There is something about a hotel room that is just like it really puts your skin barrier to the test. I think it combination of the I don the travel, oftentimes the plane. This is a great option. Speaking of a plane, you can put it on, you know, it overnight mask, but put it on when you get on the plane and by the time you land, you you the back. Everybody chapstick? cuz, you know, everybody pops up as soon as the plane lands as if they to get off the plane any sooner. And I guilty of it, too. All right. I pointing I myself. Meanwhile, you you you already are 10 steps ahead. You ahead while they back in their bag. You slipping on out the plane, slipping on out the plane, catching your Uber to the club, and you a million bucks and you didn million bucks. So, this is this is a great one. All right, y big fan of the snail mucin. Ka snail mucin gets results for me consistently. I get an improvement in hydration, luminosity, glow, bounce, suppleness of the skin, an improvement in elasticity, like you pinch the skin, it bo right back down where it but I get it. Not a lot of people like snail mucin or keen on the idea of using it. And I hydrate and plump, this is really good. If you this this one considering buying another bottle of it though cuz I did end up liking it. But I I mention this because it It well as like Amazon. But um it really really hydrating. I have some other snail mucin lookalikes as I call them that give that slippery slimy texture but lead to an improvement in hydration, elasticity, but this is one that works well and is affordable. So highly recommend that. All right, y That products. I love, I use, I repurchased, reuse, that are affordable, that actually work, that actually work to get you results for smoother skin, better hydration, plumper skin, firmer skin texture. No, we restore loss volume, okay? a lot. It is going to have a firming effect by improving hydration, fewer blackheads, fewer breakouts, getting rid of those post acne dark marks and red marks faster or post irerritation dark marks and red marks faster. Also for reducing chafing and irritation. Where sunscreen? Sunscreen is the most important and most effective skin care product in your routine for cutting down on a variety of issues. on the insulate. I recently done on affordable sunscreens I love, use, and strongly recommend. So, check that one out next.

November 2023 Skincare Fails & Favorites	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SU0WY6vSGk	Dr Day	hey guys happy December it of the month so as usual I sharing with you some reviews of skincare fails and favorites from the month of November first up is a major fail the soul dejaneiro collagen boosting floor elastic cream okay this was gifted to me in PR y know this is not something I would buy use or recommend but for fun I decided why not try it out I mean people online hype this brand up so much and the ingredients actually didn they look promising aside from the fragrance it has coconut oil in it and aant that objectively is good it helps people with atopic dermatitis with their dryness and barrier issues a lot of patients with atopic dermatitis prefer it to moisturizers because moisturizers can sting and burn um it also has sunflower seed oil in it and a molent that shows promise for dry skin check out my video on body oils I go over the research behind sunflower seed oil for skincare in that video it also has Mur seed butter shea butter and squalane for softening dry skin now collagen amino acids um amino acids are the building blocks of proteins such as collagen when we think about collagen we think about the deeper layers of the skin where it provides structural support as it breaks down with age we get wrinkles however applying collagen to the skin it does not work to correct any sort of collagen in the deeper layers but rather it functions to help improve moisture content in Skin stratum corneum um now sometimes collagen and skincare products it animal derived this brand says it vegan collagen but it acid so I don roundabout way of saying amino acids from collagen probably primarily like glycine Proline and the modified amino acid hydroxyproline regardless amino acids like collagen and skin care products also can help improve the moisture content in Skin layer and I because I just find it interesting you know this is a product called you know a collagen boosting cream so to the uninformed consumer they may think that it has collagen in it and that that collagen may or may not replenish collagen in their skin no that it works it doesn it has amino acids and they help with moisture content regardless now this is one of those creams that um likes to offer the promise of a more natural retinol specifically it says retinol mimicking Cay oil sure um you know you could get Cay oil go into the lab probably isolate some retinol compound out of it purify that put it in cells in a dish do some fancy thing like gay and and you might actually show that yes some of the same genes are activated as with retinol however by the time that c oil makes its way into a moisturizer into a skincare product there be hardly any of that retinol left it not going to have any meaningful impact on your skin retinol is not the most stable ingredient to begin with that why manufacturers skincare Brands they put a lot of effort into the R&D behind their formulations to ensure not only ingredient stability but that it actually gets into your skin so just kind of hanging your hat on what Trace Amounts might be in an oil it is a stretch now let performance when you open the jar the cream is there it luscious tempting you to slather it on all over your body however in my experience it goes on a little streaky you know I often find that to be the case with moisturizers that predominantly have like seed Butters and amoliant oils and no like dimethicone mineral oil or petrol lotum they tend to go on sort of streaky like this now a lot of influencers hype this brand up and their body creams claiming you know it experience this actually kind of dried very filmy it did not leave my skin feeling soft supple smooth with improved skin elasticity now for the real problem I had with this cream I went into this with an open mind but the fragrance oh my gosh is the fragrance strong and it lasts it is a scent that how shall I say is almost abusive because it is not only so strong but it is so lasting I mean you put this on and your whole house is going to smell like this for weeks I am not being hyperbolic here it is really strong and really lasting now I have tried their signature boom boom cream in the past which is heavily scented I knew what I was getting into however this is much stronger and the scent I do not care for it smells aggressive like a high school bully or like you know those mall kiosk people that if you happen to make eye contact with them they rope you in they put you in their chair and they start making backhanded compliments trying to get you to feel bad about yourself so you buy whatever it is that they are putting on your face yeah um sold agent J they have crafted a fragrance that really encompasses these experiences feelings and emotions sort of une in a jar not my favorite I would strongly pass moving on to things more in line with what I typically promote but that were also a fail from the drugstore and by drugstore I mean Walmart so I saw these Dr scholes foot creams on ibata ibata if you familiar it that I use to get cash back I sponsored by ibata but I have been using it for several years and I have saved a ton of money on that thing anyway I saw these foot creams the exfoliating lotion and dry cracked foot repair they both have ingredients in them that are great for dry cracked heels Ura and lactic acid these are ingredients that get in there and really help improve moisture content they softening and exfoliating dry rough skin these foot creams they do have fragrance plus fragrant essential oils like peppermint lavender spe expent and Eucalyptus is it just me what is with foot creams always putting peppermint like who wants candy cane scented feet so as someone who walks and runs a lot if I slack on using foot creams or petroleum jelly to my feet they start to look a little unsightly I stopped using whatever foot creams I had been using and gave these a try exclusively for 2 weeks I like a thicker cream or an ointment for my foot creams they lot less messy to apply to the feet and they stay on the skin a little bit better honestly I really did not find find these to be particularly effective they didn smooth they didn on flakiness dry cracked heels um you know it was a it was a downgrade in comparison to the usual foot creams plain petroleum jelly that I use I would say you whatever body cream or moisturizer you feet you in terms of reducing dryness sealing and hydration and reducing friction lubricating the skin surface then you get from these Dr shs creams I think they should stick to the inserts and back away from skincare cuz these just did not they did not deliver the results next fail is a hair care product that I was actually sent in PR it is the carousel smoothing mask now I love to do conditioning mask especially after using like an anti- dander shampoo or a clarifying shampoo uh as these types of shampoos can leave the hair strands a bit more unmanageable now in my experience conditioning masks tend to differ from just regular conditioner and that honestly they and they do a better job uh coating the hair strands in a more even all-encompassing fashion and this helps to neutralize the charge on the hair strands that is the result of shampooing and ultimately really helps not only with manageability but it helps cut down on frizz breakage and smooth the hair this particular mask has Shea oil which can smooth the strands and improve elasticity it also has bonium chloride an anti-static agent that you will frequently encounter in leave on conditioners um it helps with detangling and with shine ingredients alone however don this was not like a hair mask but more in keeping with a regular conditioner a regular very watery conditioner for that matter uh and the fragrance I did not care for it was very strong and very cheap uh the scent was very cheap now yall know I love scented hair care products but the scent on this was a no go for me for $48 this is a pass I get better results using like sve or white rain conditioner from the grocery store and you really cheap uh yeah this was this was a pass all right so moving on to things that I actually like big surprise the two skincare products I tried this month that I actually liked are sunscreens of course uh first we need to talk about the isentry yam root milk tone up suncream I bought this because I have been loving the isentry yam root cleanser it comforting highly suggest trying that out anyway I digress so I saw in the yam root line they had a tone-up cream now if you are familiar with tone up sunscreens they appearance of skin yellowing brighten up skin tone kind of help cosmetically correct dark spots and really just brighten up your overall skin tone they is my understanding and they marketed not only for their sun protection proper properties and you know skin tone braining properties but also they makeup sort of like a makeup primer if you like tone up sunscreens try this one it does not disappoint in my opinion it zinc and titanium dioxide it fragrance-free and it has the peachy tint that is typical for a tone up sunscreen it shiny or greasy it has niacinamide which can help with tackling dark spots as well as redness and dry skin um oat EXT extract and root extract make this a very hydrating formula in my opinion the zinc and titanium dioxide are what are offering broadspectrum sun protection from ultraviolet radiation the iron oxides which are what are giving this a tint may actually offer additional protection from visible light that comes from the sun visible light from the sun plays a role in hyperpigmentation and sunscreen active ingredients don aspect so a tinted sunscreen is an option for kind of getting that and it really addresses more of the root causes of um dark spots besides ultraviolet radiation I definitely appreciate the tone up aspect of this sunscreen in terms of brightening up complexion as it God this is going to be too casty but just you know trust the process in my experience the cast actually is not too bad and once you lightens up quite a bit and you don really appreciate it I right now and I have minimal makeup on top of it so there much of a white cast um you may want to try a tone up sunscreen if you someone who has a paler skin type and you find that sunscreens that are tinted you have a hard time getting one to match your skin tone try a tone up sunscreen I love this one um and I also like uh skin 10004 has a great tone up sunscreen as well the other tinted sunscreen I e.l.f they 30 now in contrast to the isentry one this is an organic AKA chemical sunscreen and it is tinted it comes in Three Shades I went with the lightest shade Sunbeam it also has niacinamide which again is good for dark spots redness and for dry skin now this goes on a little bit slightly shiny sparkly but It ultimately goes down and the shine is not as obvious it it makeup it is an organic AKA chemical sunscreen but in my experience with it it has not caused any burning stinging or irritation around my eyes I really rather enjoyed it and I look forward to trying out some more of the elf sunscreens they have an SPF 35 one I really want to try all right guys that about wraps up November in terms of skincare products I tested out that were notable fails or favorites I hope you guys had a great November stay tuned for my videos this month because soon I will be releasing my highly anticipated review of the pow facial Fitness

The Best Black Friday Skincare Deals You Don't Want To Miss!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6p5OG0hM4	Dr Day	well guys cyber week is here and I noticed a lot of your comments asking are you going to do a Black Friday sale Roundup the answer is yes so buckle up first of all let have been shopping from styv for years now they sale right now so it get some of your favorite Japanese or Korean sunscreens skincare products now a word of warning it does take some time for your style Ana order to arrive so be aware of that depending on what you get it could take a few months but usually my experience it arrives within less than a month if not just a couple of weeks can make mermaid UV gel this is a Japanese sunscreen that I have been raving about for years before you give up on sunscreen have you tried the can make mermaid skin gel UV this is a Japanese sunscreen favorite it is a gel formula fast absorbing not greasy I got it on the majority of my face already and there hybrid sunscreen meaning it has some mineral active ingredients and some chemical active ingredients it goes into hair bearing areas really well so if you have a beard this is a good one no fragrance no essential oils works as a makeup base perfectly it is a hybrid sunscreen meaning it has both organic AKA chemical active sunscreen ingredients and it has inorganic AKA mineral active sunscreen ingredients the consistency of this is a gel but it does not have any alcohol now alcohol and gel sunscreen is not a bad thing it makes for a fast absorbing formula that greasy and it also helps with the filters the active ingredients in in the formula but this particular one does not have alcohol so if you alcohols and skincare products you find them drying this does not have that overall it and it is a nice base for makeup the next one is a Japanese gel sunscreen that is perfect for very oily skin or for for hair bearing areas it Nivea super water gel SPF 50 fragrance-free it meaning you know what commonly people refer to as chemical as a reminder organic in chemistry just means you know carbon compounds um because everything is a chemical including the active ingredients in you know the mineral sunscreens those are chemicals too anyway it has octoxide uol t150 juvenal A+ uh the formula also has hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid which is very very moisturizing helps improve the water content in the top layers of the skin this is very fast absorbing non- greasy it does have alcohol in it though so if you it and I just love the pump it kind of encourages more reapplication speaking of pumps Japanese pumped sunscreens Omi verdio UV moisture gel I years it is SPF 50 this one sunscreen uh it has organic AKA chemical active ingredients and it has inorganic uh titanium dioxide so some people do notice a bit of a white cast with this but I negligible this like the other two very fast absorbing non- greasy formula in my experience it goes in pretty well in hair bearing areas without leaving any kind of residue although it does have the titanium dioxide in there so you may notice a little bit of whiteness uh no drying alcohols no fragrance moisturizing so these sunscreens are a really good deal right now I mean Stana usually has the best price on these but right now it skincare product that has just really been impressing me this year and is definitely going to make its way into my best of 2023 Series so stay tuned for that it every year it 10004 Madagascar cantella Pro bio seea ampul this has very simple ingredients but it ampule has been a 10 out of 10 for me it C cantella ferment which contains hydrating and anti-inflammatory compounds this also has niacinamide which is good for redness hyperpigmentation dry skin and may help in reducing oxidative stress this can be used one to two times a day applied to the face after cleansing can also be used alongside other skincare ingredients provided you tolerate the combination if you try it let me know what you think this also has panthenol which is very good for the moisture barrier as well as allent toen which is anti-inflammatory it lightweight it really does offer the kind of effect where you get smoothing and Plumping of the skin as you use it on a regular daily basis I could spend all day on Stana because youall know I have a ton of Japanese and Korean skincare favorites but those are just four that I was like oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah definitely so let store Derm store is another retailer I several years very reliable they are offering 30% off color science color science has excellent sunscreens they are expensive now when I first started this channel I started dabbling in color science and I immediately fell in love with their sunforgettable face shield but they um later came out with a newer product called the sunforgettable face shield flex and I have used this product a lot this year what it is is a tinted mineral sunscreen it comes in uh I believe four different shades what I shade but I often use a shade deeper than than the one I um what this is It it goes it comes out and goes on the skin white as you rub it in though the uh tint starts to come out these little particles of tint start to bloom I guess is how it works um but this formula what I like about it is that a it is very as the atically pleasing it elegant spreads on the skin well but it also offers a touch more cosmetic camouflage in comparison to a lot of other tinted sunscreens so it a little bit like almost a BB cream uh or a step underneath a full coverage Foundation you do get pretty decent coverage with this and it is buildable now um the nice thing about this formula is that it is fragrance-free which I love it love so this is great if you live in a humid climate or you sport Outdoors um it it just ensures better adherence to the skin the other really great thing about color science Unforgettable face shield Flex or any of their tinted sunscreens is that they actually um test for visible light protection so what that means is you know sunscreens they protect you from ultraviolet radiation to protect you from a sunburn but for people dealing with hyperpigmentation not only do they have to be cognizant of their UV exposure from the Sun but there of sun exposure that really contributes to hyperpigmentation as well and that is visible light and sunscreen active ingredients do not protect from the visible light but we have come to learn that iron oxides which are the ingredients in tinted sunscreens can offer some protection from those ra those wavelengths of visible light that contribute to hyperpigmentation now It because sunscreen manufacturers are not require to test their formulas to actually show that they do offer that kind of protection so it matter of oh it default it visible light protection there probably a lot of variability honestly from Brand to brand and most are not testing so you know to what extent anyone is better than the other it hard to say but color science actually does test their formulas to demonstrate that yes they do offer visible light protection um this product is you know know on the pricier side but 30% off this is a great time to try it out I also will give a plug for their Total Eye 3in1 renewal tinted sunscreen specifically for around the eyes but it also has ingredients in it that are hydrating and help to ever so gently plump up the top layers of the skin smoothing out those little pesky Fine Lines it protection from visible light and it mineral sunscreen so it or sting around the eye it has this nice cooling applicator it kind of has a depuffing effect just by the temperature aen is 20% off on Derm store so I will bring up one of my favorite aen products they 0.1% now this is a retin aldhy retin alahh is a little different from retinol in that retinol is an ingredient that is a form of vitamin A your skin has to convert retinol to its active state by doing two things to it retin alahh is a form of topical vitamin A your skin only has to do one thing to it in theory retin alahh you would assume would be more effective than retinol but honestly they don how the two compare and so when people say that retin alahh is better than retinol simply by virtue of the fact that it requires one less step to get to the active form that telling the full story because we know that when it comes to these forms of topical vitamin A the formulation really really matters all that to say rtin alahh has been shown to be effective for improving some of the visible signs of skin aging like age spots discoloration and Fine Lines it can improve collagen production and it can just improve the overall appearance of rough texture that occurs with age it tolerated the aan retran Al is a really really good formula it moisturizing which offers you an almost immediate wrinkle smoothing effect uh but then with consistent use you can start to notice some improvement in the visible signs of skin aging so I think dermore right now is offering the best deal on this with 20% off now I mentioned this in a recent Walgreens shop With Me video I don use my seller water I don is as effective for me for removing eye makeup water resistance sunscreen as a cleansing oil or cleansing balm that what I like to use um however I will say that the bioderma censi bio myell water has worked for me it product that I buy over and over again for removing makeup or sunscreen um but it is very good and it fragrance it does it does what it supposed to do uh you only need a little bit of it on a cotton pad and it helps cleanse away the makeup I suggest following it up with a gentle cleanser to remove all the residue but it really does a good job going in there and breaking up the eye makeup without irritating your eyes now it on sale 20% off from Derm store and that Friday deals on this so if you bioderma myeller water fan check out Derm store they have a really good deal on it right now speaking of eye makeup BK Beauty all right they have all kinds of makeup brushes that are all very very good but I highly recommend the Angie hot and flashy a506 concealer brush has this little kitten paw like shape and it really is effective for patting in the concealer and the softness of the bristles are really what make this an excellent concealer brush uh for not only the under eye but it really nicely fits like in the hollows and crevices of your upper eye for applying concealer you can use it on the rest of your face too like uh between the Brows for padding in your concealer it good brush and I highly recommend it it reason it wrong with any of them but this particular brush is 20% off right now they that you can makeup brushes all right let to Amazon Amazon of course has a ton of deals and as of the filming of this video they really really really strikingly marked down first one is the Lancome lash EO mascara now I have been using this a lot this year and I really like it because it has the the the applicator wand it has this unique shape that really lifts and lengthens the upper lashes then you flip it around and have it so that you really easy to apply mascara to your lower Lash flash line really get a lengthening effect there without getting a bunch of flex all over your under eye area and clumps it formula and I highly recommend it right now though it it makeup my favorite Urban Decay Naked 2 Basics eyeshadow palette right now it 50% off on Amazon highly recommend this basic just like it says um everyday eyeshadow palette easy colors to work with very complimentary workplace appropriate you know no Neons or glitter Shades okay then y fan of kar X really popular this year over on Tik Tok it is an excellent product like it is definitely worth the hype snail there is some research to demonstrate that it is helpful for healing um for hydrating it has anti-inflammatory compounds this particular product for me I notice a visible Improvement in the smoothness of my skin it definitely has a deeply hydrating and Plumping effect if you put off by snail but you want a similar effect go with the skin 10004 Madagascar probio seea ampul that I shared with you guys from uh from salvana but if you want to dabble in in snail this is the product to try and right now on Amazon it is $13.99 that being said if you are already going ahead and ordering stuff from Stana buy it there because it $33.49 so you know kind of pick and choose where you you know if you member and you buying anything else from Stana go with Amazon Prime because you your delivery or whatever free free meaning you delivery whereas with Stana if you just get you know if you in this then you pay shipping and handling and you have to wait for it and I just saw my the gun mini is on sale this has changed my life I mentioned it in my holiday gift guide and I use this pretty much every day to help relax my upper shoulders um I also use it a lot like on my upper thighs um I work out a lot you know and so I find that this is really really helpful for Recovery it deep massaging tool and I love how portable it is comes with a few different heads but I mostly just use this one it charges with a USB the battery holds a very long time this is an excellent gift to give somebody and it really can help them relax and chill out at the end of the day helping to facilitate the transition to sleep which we all struggle with so this is this is a 2023 favorite it has changed the game for me as far as chilling out and relaxing so I sale it is currently 25% off all right speaking of relaxing and your overall health uh I cannot say enough good things about uh making sure that you are on top of your blood pressure blood pressure can creep up on you and that is not a good thing the problem is when you go to the doctor and they check your blood pressure you often develop what called White code hypertension meaning you know you are intimidated by doctors other people are just reasonably stressed out because it wait um for a long time to have your schedule all disrupted to get there to park so most people elevated um so it at home and to have a log of it over several days that way you can show your doctor and be like this is what my blood pressure typically is at home um and I purchased this ey Health blood pressure cuff I love it because it actually syncs with an app of course everything has an app these days but it syncs with an app so you can create a log on your phone of your blood pressure readings that way when you go to the doctor you can just show them them and I didn too expensive but it off definitely recommend this then sleep and glow is having a huge sitewide Black Friday sale and they pretty much never have sales but I have a code with sleep and glow Dr Dre 15 will get you 15% off should be active at this point um so if you of all the Omnia pillow I cannot sleep without that thing what it is is a highquality memory foam

that you don against the pillow and wake up with those annoying sleep creases and morning puffiness I really love though cuz I back sleeper the way that the pillow supports my neck and the position of

a huge sitewide 30% off sale my absolute Holy Grail must have sunscreen from them is that Universal tint I repurchased that over and over again I think you can get it on automatic reorder if you want

My Top 5 Most Purchased Skincare Products Of The Year!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmqy4FnnkK4	Dr Day	well hey guys today I want to share with you five skincare products that yes I am still using I have a lot of videos on this channel along the vein of oh these are the best in this category or these are my ultimate favorites and I have a lot of skincare products that I truly love adore but the ones that I with you in this video I have just continued to repurchase over and over again now one thing I haven repurchase but I continue to use and swear by is my sleep and glow Omnia pillow now today sponsored by sleeping glow if you have been here for any number of years you know they sponsors of this Channel and I grateful to continue to be able to work with them I know you guys love this pillow as much as I do because I gotten so much positive feedback from you all over the years thank you so much for introducing me to the sleep and glow Omnia pillow it has made such a difference in the way that my face looks when I wake up in the morning it completely gotten rid of that morning puffiness sleep creases and I sleep so much better it offers such excellent neck support and without that good neck support I end up kind of going like this and I front of my neck and since sleeping with this pillow that is a nonissue for me you may be wondering what exactly are sleep creases sleep wrinkles okay so sleep wrinkles are wrinkles that show up on your face as a result of compression against in most cases a poorly supportive pillow contrast to wrinkles that appear here with age as they relate to facial movements sleep wrinkles are often vertical and they happen where the skin is being compressed like the cheek around the mouth around the eyes and close up to the nose what is it about this pillow that differentiates it from any other pillow on the market oh there are a ton of factors first of all it made of very high quality memory foam but the shape is really where it this pillow was designed alongside orthopedist so the shape is intended to support your head your neck your shoulder girdle for the optimal sleep position this particular pillow is one that can be used if you are a back sleeper like myself but it is also great if you are a side sleeper and what you is that it that if you are a side sleeper or you happen to turn over on your side the side concavity it really cradles your cheek so it eliminates that compressive Force so you don wrinkles or puffiness came to the design of this pillow they spared no details right down to the covering of the pillow it material the material is actually bacterio static it may take you a few nights to get used to the pillow but once you do it you cannot sleep without I notice I notic the biggest difference actually when I travel and I don pillow I don times I will wake up with a stiff neck and of course that morning puffiness returns so this is a game Cher for my sleep and when it comes to sleep I will do anything to get a good night the pillow comes with a 30 night sleep trial so if you satisfied you can send it back and get a full refund it also comes with a three-year warranty if you guys want to check out the sleep and glow Omnia pillow definitely take advantage of the discount code they have offered me sleeping glow has never offered a discount like this but on Black Friday if you use code Dr Dre 15 you can save 15% sitewide only on Black Friday however so make sure you take advantage of it that way you can save trust me this is one of my best cat Beauty secret tools and get one for yourself and get one as a gift for the upcoming holidays the other day I posted a reel about how I when we go to the drugstore there are so many more options for tinted sunscreens these days in comparison to when I first started on YouTube I mean this year alone I have tried and fallen in love with probably over 10 new and exciting and excellent tinted sunscreens I find myself not really using a lot of the tinted sunscreens that I have hyped up in the past not because they not because they because we just have so many more options these days and a lot a lot of times the newer options because they drugstore Brands they affordable so I into those a lot more this year with the exception of a sunscreen that I repurchase over and over and over and over again it Universal tint okay this is a hybrid sunscreen meaning it has zinc and then it has some organic filters it actually has one I believe octoxide but it tinted so the tint can offer some additional protection against visible light so the zinc the octoxide those are the active ingredients for protecting your skin against ultraviolet radiation but then if you are prone to hyperpigmentation the iron oxides which give this a tint may also help in protecting you from visible light which is a major driving factor for hyperpigmentation melasma the Dermatology Universal tint has niacinamide speaking of looking to fade dark spots niacinamide is a fantastic ingredient it way it works for hyperpigmentation is it actually gets in the way of the spread of pigment packets from the pigment producing cells melanoides to the neighboring skin cells of the Keratin aites and niacinamide is an antioxidant it record of being helpful for redness and for helping with the health of the moisture barrier this is a moisturizer with a broadspectrum sunscreen uh it great option in the winter months the tint is not overly orange too yellow it now it does have a bit of an odd odor which some people find offputting but that odor doesn to it as the pool float odor and honestly I think that odor is part of why I like using it I don I bonded with it this is one I love and adore let me know in the comments though what sunscreen do you find yourself using over and over again for me it is a one I mean it pretty much always makes its way into a sunscreen empties my one thing with this is I do wish it were water resistant for days that you are mostly Outdoors or doing outdoor activities water-based sports but for the winter time when you need a good moisturizer with sunscreen this is this is one I can speaking of wanting to fade dark spots and hyperpig M mation this was a 2022 skincare favorite and I have repurchased it multiple times this year I even tried other products similar in terms of ingredient fames product claims to this and really could not find anything that compares and that is May Love brightening serum this product is a very hydrating serum that definitely can improve the overall look of skin tone it improve the appearance of dark dark spots and hyperpigmentation when it comes to fading dark spots and hyperpigmentation the outcomes that a person gets from a given product are going to be very dependent on that person that individual and the nature of their underlying hyperpigmentation if you have hyperpigmentation that is in a deeper layer in the skin you know you may not get much noticeable Improvement but what is in this that targets dark spots it has Alpha arbutin which is an ingredient that inhibits tyrosinase which is the enzyme responsible for making pigment it inhibits tyrosinases in a unique way in that alph arbutin looks and is shaped very similar to L tyrosine which is the thing that tyrosinase works on to make pigment then you also have in this formula coic acid now coic acid helps to inhibit tyrosinase slightly differently it works because it keates copper which is required for tyrosinases to work so the arbutin and the kic acid they both work to inhibit tyrosinase activity but they do so in slightly different ways so they licorice root extract which is anti-inflammatory but specifically licorice root is thought to help improve dark spots by um helping with dispersion of melanin pigment as well as inhibiting something called cyc oxygenase an enzyme that is plays a role in inflammation in the skin I that drives inflammation in the skin can worsen hyperpigmentation especially if you have a deeper skin tone this also has the antioxidant glutathione which may cut down on oxidative stress that could further aggravate hyperpigmentation it has a variety of botanic extracts which for me I getting along well with obviously cuz I continue to repurchase this but I will point out that any time you have a lot of botanic extracts you have to be careful it can increase the chances that you develop irritation from a product and again anything that inflammatory to your skin can aggravate hyperpigmentation this product is one that for me I see Visible Changes visible Improvement an overall just brightening effect and I have a video explaining what the term brightening means it basically is just kind of evening out and enhancing your own background skin tone but I do notice an overall Improvement in skin luminosity and Radiance above and beyond what I see when I just simply use a hydrating serum like I get Improvement in skin Luminosity say using snail mucin which is another love of my life but I would say I get a little bit more of an improvement with this product above and beyond so it definitely extends beyond the hydrating properties you know a few years ago I fell in love with it skin Li effector and then they changed the formula it results I was getting from that it skin Li effector before they changed it is what I replaced that for me how do you use the M love Fade Away brightening serum you can use it one to two times a day you want to apply to the skin after cleansing while the Skin damp that way you get better penetration of the active ingredients unless you find that that burns and stings at which case you might want to wait until the skin has dried you need a full dropper full dropper vial full um to cover the face the neck you can apply another moisturizer on top if you want honestly I find this product pretty hydrating by itself and often times I don a separate moisturizer you can apply it in the morning as well as in the evening when you use it in the morning allow it to absorb fully allow it to completely dry and then put sunscreen on the reason for that is that if the skin is still a bit damp and you try and put sunscreen on to damp skin it can get in the way of its ability to set up speaking of skin firmness I so much this year it to make its way into my best of 2023 series which stay tuned that will be coming throughout December but gold bonds age renew retinol face and body you can use it on the face I don because I already use Trad noan on my face so I don with topical vitamin A because that can be irritating but I do use it on my body I year the retinol can help in lightening sunspots it also can help improve the appearance of Sund damage and improve skin texture this formula also has Ura one of my favorite ingredients and moisturizers is very hydrating I mean it moisturizing factors and how your skin holds on to water which is super important important for how the barrier performs and maintains itself when the water content drops in the outermost layers of the skin things slow down and that Ura in there it helps to replenish moisture and it also softens and gently exfoliates rough dull skin texture this is a fantastic product to use on dry rough elbows and knees for brightening up the skin on those areas especially if you deal with a lot of skin thickening related to friction and chronic pressure palmoil hexapeptide 12 is a peptide that allegedly is going to improve skin firmness it something called elastin in our skin when it comes to peptides they likely work in many cases by improving the moisture content of the top layers of the skin this also has hoba seed oil and emolient and it has camines which are very important for the health of your moisture barrier and for keeping everything hydrated and moving along according ly and it yeah Gold Bond overall I several of their products this year and I have been really impressed like they have a sensitive line their eczema line is excellent and the gold bom pure line is not to be slept on it likewise has Ura in it so if you moisturizer that might lead to similar benefits in terms of improving dryness and rough skin texture but you don want to use retinol check out the Pure Line it hut shave oil now when it comes to shaving it either a shaved cream a shaved gel some sort of barrier between your skin and the razor to cut down on Nicks to cut down on ingrown hairs as well as to cut down on post shave irritation and to get a better shave helps to hydrate up the hair it thing though with shave creams and shaved gels is they can often be kind of messy and unwieldy to use in the shower so I have been really happy with the tree hut shave oil because it is a product that has a variety of different oils in it but it actually goes on your skin pretty easily and stays in place while you the razor it doesn shower but then it efficiently rinses off the skin the fragrance in these products is actually very nice it there while you your legs or whatever after you rinse it off the scent does not linger my favorite is the watermelon scent it has grape seed oil hoba seed oil sunflower seed oil alen toen so these different oils may also provide some anti-inflammatory compounds although take that with a grain of salt because oils are highly variable if you are allergic to fragrance this is not one to use but I happy actually with tree HUD it just an overhyped Tick Tock phenomenon I really do think that the their body washes which I oil they really are effective products I know I really prefer to avoid scented moisturizers but honestly the formulas are really good speaking of moisturizers you guys are going to yawn at this next one but honestly like I really just cannot I feel like this is something that people need to really appreciate the full scope the full breadth of benefits and that is honestly plain petroleum jelly plain petrolatum ointment I use it so much and this year not only have I used it a lot like I always do for my lips for eyelids but I have really really been loving it for my nails because petroleum jelly helps to protect the junction between your nail plate and the What nail fold right there you have a little overhang of skin it a lot of people refer to it as but that can get agitated if you have hand eczema atopic dermatitis you can get a lot of inflammation that kind of creates a space there if you trim your cuticles it can open that up and basically basically moisture can get in as well as microbes that can lead to ridging plus just a lot of roughness around the nails which frustrates people using plain petroleum jelly has really helped to keep my nails super healthy and strong not getting those little ridges cuz I do get those from time to time related to my atopic dermatitis so that has really changed the game for me and I can good things about plain petroleum jelly for dry cracked hands the other scenario where I have really been using it a lot and thinking to myself I have been underusing petroleum jelly is on my feet and I on your feet I have a lot of videos telling you guys to do that but I really really really took it very seriously this year because I work out I run I go on walks that is a lot of repetitive friction on the skin in the setting of sweat I find using petroleum jelly um it helps to lubricate the skin surface and really cut down on callous formation and I I highly recommend doing that that along with making sure you have shoes that fit you well your your socks are dry you the sweaty socks that moisture really aggravates cracking and and callous formation but you lean into the petroleum jelly and I have actually gotten to the point where I am just now in the habit of applying it to my feet at night before bed of course but I also put it on again when I wake up in the morning change to whatever socks I going to wear for the day and you would not believe how much smoother my feet are overall it has made such a huge difference people will say what about aquafor what about cavey healing women those are all great options too and we difference between those and plain petroleum jelly is that those have other ingredients in them the other ingredients some people become allergic to and then the ointment becomes a problem for that reason plain petroleum jelly is always the default recommendation as the safest option for people dealing with dry cracked lips I mean any skin problem where petroleum jelly is going to be the recommendation because it really you can unheard of to develop a true allergy to petroleum jelly you can develop an irritation to it um but it something that your immune system is going to become sensitized against that being said um I have used this year a lot actually um the up andup Brands version of Aqua 4 cuz I bought it to review for you guys in the up and up video and I I keep it on the side of my bed I also like to use it on my hands a lot so I I I do use those I use them a lot the other one I purchased this year and I used a lot is um similar to plain petroleum jelly but has a few more ingredients in it it elastoplast that is another great petroleum based ointment I think it sold in Australia and like the first aid section that but by and large I have really really really been a petroleum jelly fanatic this year can about it it know if you get a cut a scrape just wash it out with some dilute soapy water and then apply petroleum jelly it is the best thing for healing wounds because it keeps the wound bed moist a lot of people are under the misconception that you need to dry out the wound bed to prevent bacteria from getting in there and that is actually the opposite you want a moist clean wound bed because that allows for the skin cells to migrate in properly to heal the wound if you dry it out they can you actually do end up getting a bacterial bofilm from chronic poor healing wounds so petroleum jelly can cut down on the colonization of the wound by bacteria by serving as a mechanical barrier and it keeps the wound bed moist so that the new healthy skin cells can migrate in and petroleum jelly is super duper safe I have a whole video about the safety of petroleum jelly there is a lot of fear-mongering people believe that it is toxic it has been around for for so so many years it is so widely used in medicine if God forbid you end up with a burn and you end up in the emergency room in the hospital they petroleum jelly on your skin period Point Blank uh whether it be a petroleum jelly impregnated gauze a topical ointment that is in petroleum jelly all right y reused repurchased products of this year get excited though for my best of 2023 series it throughout the December months we going to do a best of Korean skincare as I always do best sunscreens best budget friendly affordable products I mean gosh I really got to start naring that down because like I said this year has been a win for affordable products and I really excited to get that round up for you guys anyway don out sleep and glows Omnia pillow thank you so much sleep and glow for sponsoring today liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen And subscribe I to you guys tomorrow bye [Music]	Success
The *Ultimate* 2023 Holiday Gift GuideÂ ???? Dermatologist @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3lsk3wVhJo	Dr Day	well hey guys get excited it is my annual holiday gift guide every year I love to come up with a gift guide for you all and I have some great picks I excited to share with you first of all though let I today Lily silk now yall know I of purchasing silk pillowcases and other silk items from Lily s because the quality is just unmatched not to mention their customer service has never ever let me down they have a ton of high quality items on there that make excellent gifts one thing you cannot go wrong in terms of a gift either for someone you care about or for yourself is a mulberry silk pillowcase it really smooth on the skin surface helps cut down on creasing of the skin when sleeping on a malberry silk pillowcase another Advantage is that it doesn soak up a lot of moisture and so from a hygiene perspective that when it comes to getting a good night sleep I will will do anything possible to optimize my sleep because it makes a huge difference not just in the way my skin looks but in how my day goes how I interact with the world and for me blocking out the light is a big thing so I love sleeping with an eye mask but some eye masks that block out the light they can actually end up being kind of irritating to your eyelashes to the skin around your eyes especially if you really sensitive to Raw

nothing says I love you like a sun protective hat give the gift of a sun protective hat The Wider the brim the better I am the sun hat Queen I have tons of them tons of sun hats but there are two that I call my no excuses sun hats because they me everywhere they the first one is the COI bar Britney hat now I have two of these that I like this hat the reason this is a great gift is that it adaptable I call it a no excuses hat because it if you vacation it your purse it rolls up the wire inside the brim allows you to mold it to how you want you know if you the beach and you don going in your eye and you book you can shield down it inside upf50 fabric so it block out UVA and UVB rays bar is high quality let protection for some of the most exposed territory on your body and it face although that gets a lot of exposure it people neglect the backs of their hands and that visible signs of skin aging shows up very quickly um and you know also a lot of skin cancers form there I love wearing upf50 protective driving gloves cooli bar ganet upf50 gloves they are fantastic the great thing about the ganet design though is that it has this little I don material is Silver Tip to the fingers of the thumb and pointer so that you can do your touch screens and on the Palmer surface you have these little silicon grippies so it allows for good grip these are really comfortable they very breathable you forget you even have them on if I a wide array of Shades I just have the the tan shade but you can get them in you know different colors the other thing I like about them is they come in this little bag so you can keep them together so that they don you have a big purse and you stick these in loose you around to find them but these are a fantastic gift um for either a guy or a gal um to protect the backs of their hands if you are somebody who spends a lot of time Outdoors golfing playing tennis these are great I call that cooie bar Britney had a no excuses sun hat because it it having it on you but that being said one thing that gets in the way of me putting that one on is my hair I wear my hair on the top of my head a lot and it doesn always go over so well when you have you know a high p ponytail a big bun whatever so this is another one that I got several years ago on Amazon it San Diego Hat Company hat now this isn a perfect sun hat because the brim is not as wide as that Britney one so you it is a great option for those of you who find you cuz you you just and it Velcro so you get you know pretty good coverage of the nose actually with this hat and the ears so I really like that now I have a lot of hair and so my hair is giving my scalp up here good protection that sun hats is to protect your scalp but when I have my hair up especially on the top of my head I protection from my hair if you have thinning hair you know you have too much exposed territory up here and you benefits of a hat but you know this is better than not wearing a hat because you don especially if you already have a big bun on the top of your head and that giving your scalp protection this is great because it than the Britney hat it rolls up um this is a hat I often take with me when I going on uh trip and I have no plans to be like Out outdoors doing any kind of outdoor activity like I the beach um but I don what to expect I always take this with me because this is like the ult no excuses look how compact that is like if you can suitcase um you need to you need to get rid of something else in the suitcase now I inside and avoiding the sun completely I don something I have ever recommended people do to stay inside and completely avoid the sun I protecting your skin while you are enjoying the outdoors now this is something that I got actually a couple of years ago 2 years ago go and I only recently over the past year actually started using it a lot because it gets a lot of hype it and at first I was like isn a glorified fanny pack but I find myself using it a lot lately because it really helps you to carry the basics with you phone wallet sunscreen uh I can fit in here SPF lip balm all the things that I want to have on hand when I long walk um and I want to be handsfree this is great because there can fit in your pockets I don want to carry a purse with me anymore I I do end up carrying a purse with me a lot when I have my camera in my purse my big Vlog bigger vlogging camera which which does not fit in here but um when I just go by myself running errands and the like I don really like this it it because we to bring stuff with us this holds a lot it good quality and you can choose it in a variety of colors but I say go with black you can you know very neutral in a sense it goes with a lot of things you need to be flossing your teeth every day okay it like you need to wash your hands after you go to the bathroom and you need to floss your teeth every day flossing your teeth every day is good for your oral hygiene and it to not floss brushing alone is Ina but dental floss does not have to be boring a few years ago I discovered cocoa floss I don time because it is expensive but this is a great little stocking stuffer gift to give someone cocoa floss it floss designed actually by a dentist and the floss itself is this multifiber strand that really is super soft it easy to glide through between tight spaces in your teeth but because of the way the fiber are it really pulls stuff out very efficiently you can tell the difference between this and a lot of other Dental flosses where you have to go I mean you should be going back and forth a couple of times regardless but I forth and back and forth and back and forth in order to dislodge that seed or whatever that this will pull it out right away so it amazing in that regard uh and the material is actually made out of recycled water bottles believe it or not or portion of it is and it coconut oil which helps to uh dislodge some debris in the mouth as well the floss last a long while too yeah cocoa floss definitely definitely put it on your Christmas gift list give it to everybody that you like and that you want to have good dental health I have been a long-standing fan of the Nars orgasm blush like long before I was on YouTube I discovered this blush it classic from them in my opinion it looks good on everyone it get compliments on it whenever I wear it and I also um over the past year or year and a half I have discovered their Afterglow lip balms uh and they have one in the shade orgasm and I just think together they are a perfect pairing and again very flattering on a wide array of skin tones right now Sephora has this nice little gift set though where you get a full size of the Afterglow orgasm lip balm that I love and you get a little mini of the blush and you get a small blush brush so I just think that a great little gift set for someone who likes makeup because this is a blush that goes over well and it beautiful and I love it speaking of makeup a tool that I started using this year that I swear by is the BK Beauty Angie hot and flashy a506 concealer brush this is the brush to give as a gift to someone that likes to wear makeup or to yourself because chances are if you know someone who wears makeup they brushes so getting them a whole makeup brush set is probably giving them some redundancies this brush however this concealer brush is unique I think it their bestseller I mean you can wrong with any of their makeup brushes I have many of them and they excellent It to it so it really allows you to very gently Pat in and blend in concealer minimizing any creasing and it gets in the hollow of your eye really easily and it along your eyelid BK Beauty I sponsored by them or anything but they have extended a discount code to me if you use Dr Dre 10 you can save 10% off of BK Beauty brushes again you can wrong with any of their makeup brushes they talk a lot about here on this channel is hair care and I please talk about hair care products to help cut down on Friz but a hair tool I guess you might say that really can change the game for you in terms of frizz and hair breakage is the Aquis hair towel this is a microfiber hair towel that will help to quickly remove the majority of water out of your hair after you shampoo or after you get your hair wet and this helps cut down on frizz on breakage it the hair it also really efficiently absorb excess moisture from clo to the scalp some towels are just very abrasive and ruffle the hair cuticle and that can lead to frizz and you know depending on your hair type may make it even more prone to breakage and on Nordstrom you can get a two pack of them which I think is a really great gift because it nice to have two or more of these you use one and then you want to wash it of course now the next item is something I use every day and I love it so much it the theab body mini this thing for me has actually changed who I am as a person because I a lot of tension in my upper B I always have I I get a massage the massage therapist is like you need to relax because there is a lot going on up here I I don why that happens it this ladies and gentlemen oh my gosh it a it makes a huge difference in releasing knots out of my upper back this is also great on your your thighs um after doing any kind of leg workouts so it comes with three different heads the one I have on right now this is the one I actually use the most I don really swap out the heads that much because I what can I say but it also comes with this pointier this is almost like a finger that muscle and then this broader based tip as well my one gripe with the Thea body is like it this little bag but I wish it were a little bit bigger because it just fits in there and you kind of have to you know cram it in there which I don and it doesn that don know have a way of not staying with this so it on the outside that you could put the others inside but this is awesome I love it it cuz you can just slide it into your bag comes with a USB to recharge the battery I videos like does the battery hold up it does like I know I use this every day of course I charge it with the on the USB but I never had problems with the battery dying on me prematurely it to me for me it lasts a long time all right y that concludes my 2023 holiday gift guide I hope this video was helpful to you all and that you are as excited for the holidays as I am thank you Lily silk again for sponsoring today the description box I will have everything I chatted with you all in today but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe I [Music] bye [Music]	Success
I Tried Brad Pitt's $700 Skincare Line So You Don't Have To	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_taSUc54FRI	Dr Day	so I tried Brad Pit skincare line so you don hey guys it that means this video is the monthly favorites fail stuff I tried out over the past month that we need to talk about now in September of 2022 Brad Pit launched his Linda man skincare line and I did a video on it approximately 331 of you subscribed my channel off of that video so if you actually tried out these skincare products navigating this website is like trying to find a needle in a haystack you know how people are always complaining about food bloggers when you try and do a recipe that they featured on their blog how like you have to read their whole life story before you finally get down to the recipe well they do that obviously to optimize their SEO so that their their page ranks and Google but I don excuse is on this domain website I think there list you these visuals and text overlays he Blinded Me With Science because they throw around a lot of things like progerin progerin is something that accumulates in age skin it generates a lot of free radicals oxidative stress and is thought to either be a marker of or Imp implicated in skin aging so his line allegedly is going to Target that and slow the aging process down much of what it is based off of is grape flour extract uh all Vineyard theme so grape is rich in polyphenols that may help combat oxidative stress in the skin the problem with this line is that the grossly inflated price point makes it very difficult to seriously talk about any of these products without just always defaulting back to oh my God the price oh my God the price I try not to so first of all is the cleansing Emulsion this is a Ed mild cleanser I have to say the fragrance on this is actually kind of pleasant to use although if you are allergic to fragrance this is obviously a no-o it is a gentle silky lather it effectively cleanses the surface of the skin if you have makeup water resistant sunscreen this alone is probably not going to take all of that off especially like your mascara but for morning cleansing day-to-day cleansing needs it you could use it with a cleansing balm first to dissolve your makeup and Then followed up with this and a double cleanse method you guys know the drill behind that and if you is double cleansing check out my video on double cleansing that I did recently um I go into detail there so objectively speaking the cleanser is not too bad like I don say about it other than you know caution if you fragrance in it is Pleasant it does the job it $77 though like like I said it difficult for me to come on here and talk about these products without always going back to the price because it 2023 who wants to spend $77 on a face wash if we were living back in you know the 60s the 7s when there were so few skinc care products I could see getting tempted intrigued but you can into a drugstore a you know Supermarket a Sephora an Ulta without finding hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of cleansers what about this cleanser makes it any different from any of the other ones out there really not much other than it has Brad Pit behind it and it you know is part of this the domain line but there not much else to it there necessarily in the ingredient family that to me seems like it would justify the price point you know some ingredients that formulator Source they are more expensive now I on the cost of all the different ingredients that go into skincare formulas depending on where they come from but I just find it really hard to believe that this is worth $77 based on my experience using it now the ingredients now let lerum is a hydrating serum you apply it to the skin after cleansing while the skin is still a bit damp it has objectively some pretty good ingredients in it hyaluronic acid helps to improve moisture content in the skin it also has compounds from cantella or cantella extract which is a botanic ingredient that is anti-inflammatory may help combat oxidative stress in the skin and has been shown in small studies to perhaps be beneficial for wound healing so it products marketed as seea or repair or healing the serum also has lactobacillus ferment ferments are rich in hydrating compounds ferments also have antioxidants um and they anti-inflammatory they soothing lactobacillus ferment you will find frequently in many skincare products the serum is fragrance-free so I like that and it truthfully it like I said um it back to the price on these $196 $96 oh excuse me and3 if this were something that had some kind of you know a set of ingredients in it that were really compelling I mean retinol right if it were a Retinol Serum and there had been a lot of R&D behind the formula then you know maybe I would say okay or if it had you know some other something to it but the ingredient story is so everyday it moisturized soft supple but come on like there are tons of hydrating serums that I have reviewed on here before many great Korean Brands many of which are superior to this this is just middle of the road in terms of a serum not bad um definitely has benefit to the skin but for the price point you just you know don cream for $193 and you have a cream for2 $242 now both of these are pretty similar in terms of the ingredient family the fluid cream is more of a lotion consistency so it thicker than the serum but it bit thinner than the cream but the ingredient families are very similar the main difference between the fluid cream and the cream compared to the serum is that both the fluid cream and the cream have fragrance and let me tell you it is a lingering strong frag fragrance is the fragrance is the same as what the cleanser smells like but this time you put it on your skin and it is in your brain all day giving you a headache if you skincare you know you have to ask yourself do I like fragrance as it I really want my face to continue to smell like that fragrance all day do I want it up in my nose that close up close and personal if you don for you I mean it wear I can light cream and the cream a handful of times but I simply could not tolerate them on my skin because the fragrance was just so off ping to have that heavy fragrance it gave me a headache so the formulas overall they they skin the fluid face cream is $193 and the cream is $242 yeah now here interesting this is an update if you will from my September 2022 video I noticed that they have come out with uh a alternative option at a slightly lower price point so they have the luxury and then they have the essentials and the difference is that if you go with a luxury you packaging it luxury has like this wooden or cork top on it and so that for then you know there just some things about this and I trying to be objective but some things like I just chuckle to myself you know I was on the website again hunting around for the ingredient list on these products and like as you hover over the products these bizarre visuals come up of You Know video images and it what am I looking at here it got way too up close and personal to wood or an oak barrel I can I images it across the screen I was very confused like who has designed this website it it feels like I feeling like I kept the cream in the packaging in the Box because the box is just so over the top that I almost feel like um I am committing some kind of sin by taking it out so when I take the jar out and then I put it back in the box but like I said the fragrance is so strong I can the cream on my face so here and there I hand cream the Box comes with a little box inside of it that has a travel cap because this this lid I mean this is what you something you would put like on your coffee table right I mean it top that I guess it you can carryon so they include a little separate cap then you also get what kind of looks like a guitar pick to apply the product so the packaging is is an experience I guess but derived of Science and teror to be one with nature and your own nature this is harmony this is respect this is Le domain there an asterisk next to Le domain like there like the references but I don what they nothing that ties back to that Aster what can I say this line objectively aside from the strong scent in the light cream and the cream objectively it bad okay like the products they are what they are they moisturizing they cleanser is Pleasant it you know it washes your face but again you just keep coming I just have to keep coming back to the price point because it what are we buying here that doesn already exist or we Brad [Music] [Music] Pit [Music] the brand is trying to Market itself as like a luxury skin care brand for people who like to splurge in my opinion the success of those Brands luxury Brands you know for people who enjoy luxury branding luxury products the success of those Brands a lot of it has to do in my opinion with being launched and placed through right time and the right place for example laam mer it skincare brand I before in my opinion you know it overpriced for what it is but it cult following people love it who love it and they don to say they it and use it but Lam mer has been around for a very long time and you know is is lucky in the sense that they originated at a time where there wasn so much at our disposal and so it kind of you know was able to to grab an an audience now it market so saturated with so many products at so many different price points but hello inflation like this is not a time where most people are interested in dropping $230 on a small pot of cream I just feel like 2022 2023 it launch a luxury skincare brand no matter who you are uh I don celebrity is going to carry this brand and I think it will you know fizzle out it wondering if the switch over to having the option of the essentials with the less you know over-the-top packaging aspect for a slightly reduced cost I wondering if that speaks to the fact that no nobody is really interested in plopping down this kind of coin on a celebrity skincare line anyway y really wanted to bring It full circle because roughly a year ago I did you know give my initial thoughts when the brand was launched and nothing is really changed other than these products aren necessarily objectively bad I you know would not fear for the health of your skin if you chose to buy them I concerned with you know the Financial Health of this line for you uh I think it buy so much more but the other product that I tried out this past month that ended up being a fail for me but I really do think it comes down to a me problem is the inky list new tripeptide Plumping lip balm now I was really optimistic that this was going to be a more affordable alternative to the Polish Choice hyaluronic acid plus peptide lip booster which I really really like because the ingredients are kind of similar the peptides are similar in in these and we moment but for whatever reason this product really irritated my lips especially the corners of my mouth I mean I would get a lot of cracking discomfort soon as I stopped that could heal with just using plain petroleum jelly if I reintroduced it boom it would come right back I can ingredient might have done that because it has shea butter babusa seed oil mang mango seed butter maybe I it has some peptides in it which I have used before they are in the polished Choice peptide plus ha lip booster um it has a peptide that is a collagen fragment that is supposed to allegedly get in and stimulate collagen synthesis Pathways it it 3000 and it also has that um newer peptide Matel synth 6 or palmoil tripeptide 38 when I put this on it feels nice it something about the formula that for whatever reason irritates my lips and I don irritants the common lip allergens are absent in this so I really sure what it is um it has it also has hyaluronic acid in it that Plumping you know hyaluronic acid helps to retain moisture which has a Plumping effect initially I thought is there something in this that is Plumping because it is in irritant and there not nothing like that a lot of times the lip plumpers they have some irritating ingredients that bring in some swelling make your lips look plump and but also it can be super irritating this does not have that so like I said I think this is a me problem not necessarily a problem with the product overall but I was really disappointed because this is substantially less expensive than the Polish Choice One the Polish Choice one is $33 although I think it on sale this is $12.99 all right so a month of a lot of fails sometimes celebrity brands are not a complete fail sometimes they have some surprising gems like um for example the road skin that peptide glazing fluid I really hope that that sticks around because that product objectively is good whereas you know others are just you know kind of a cash grab and you sort of scratch your head going what were they thinking especially here with uh Brad Pit charging us like $700 to wash and moisturize our face um a river does not run through it all right y video um on the ins slate I put my September favorites fails video if you want to check that one out next but if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe I bye [Music]	Success
SEPTEMBER 2023 SKINCARE FAVORITES	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4P0Y5JGRWL4	Dr Day	well guys October is here and September flew by September was a great month for new skin care and beauty products and I with you my top five picks of products that I tried out throughout the month of September number one is actually a hair care product that I purchased from Amazon several months ago and have been trying out now I don that this product makes it ch6 ginger beer anti-hair loss scalp shampoo I don products that try and make claims of being anti-hair loss or to prevent hair shedding I think that is very misleading the only over-the-counter FDA approved treatment for hair loss is minoxidil Rogaine and that specifically for one type of hair loss androgenetic alopecia there are a ton of different types of hair loss so I just think it can be incredibly misleading to Market a product for hair loss when a there there that is like tried and true all that to say this shampoo has a few interesting ingredients it has caffeine which actually does have evidence to support its potential for improving hair loss specifically androgenetic alopecia caffeine has good penetration into the scalp into the hair follicle and it actually remains there for some time caffeine may help in improving the metabolism and the hair follicle ultimately supporting healthy hair growth this product also has niacinamide which is an antioxidant that may help combat oxidative stress that would otherwise lead to premature miniaturization of the hair follicle So in theory niacinamide may help for your scalp overall in terms of cutting down on oxidative stress as an antioxidant now this also has salicylic acid which is actually a treatment for dandruff albeit it is at a very low percentage strength in this in comparison to most dandruff shampoos but salicylic acid loves the oil glands it exfoliates them and it shampoos for reducing scalp buildup of those dry flaky skin cells so it good anti-dandruff ingredient panthenol which is very moisturizing this product really speaks around the yeast extract from the ginger beer yeast extracts are actually rich in humectants and anti-inflammatory compounds it also has soap bark in it which if you used a product with soap bark it is a botanic ingredient that creates a lot of lather this product has some ingredients that are fairly common allergens all in Under the Umbrella will site of fragrance and that includes Menthol limonene tea tree extract so if you allergic to fragrance this is a no-go um all that just uh this shampoo has worked out really well for my hair so as a reminder when you you that these ingredients you know they to help with scalp Health there density of oil glands on the scalp there getting a good lather to the scalp as frequently as your hair type will tolerate is really important for scalp Health regardless of the shampoo that you use but some shampoos they can be drying they can be irritating this is a very mild shampoo and I have to say I been using it over the past a little over a month and using this shampoo I really feel like my hair is a lot shinier bouncier when I use it now I don it doesn it think this would be good for now it not going to be a great shampoo if you you have a lot of product build up this is not going to cut it it shampoo so it cut through a lot of product residue and build up that being said you could also incorporate a clarifying shampoo into your routine if you are someone who uses a lot of product and you want to use a clarifying shampoo once a week to really get in there and remove any kind of product buildup and maybe swap to this now this talks about targeting dandruff and it does have logical ingredients for that even a tea tree extract which is you know Under the Umbrella of fragrance does have evidence for helping with dandruff seborrhea if you have dandruff I don is going to necessarily be particularly helpful for getting your dandruff under control however I do think it is a great formulation for kind of scalp maintenance so if your dandruff is under pretty good control and you wanting to use an anti-dandruff shampoo or maybe your routine is to only use an anti-dandruff shampoo like once a week you might like this as maintenance or on your other days of of shampooing because it does have those beneficial ingredients but the formula and contrast to many anti-dander shampoos is very mild it a liter or not too bad it comes in a pump bottle and it really does smell like ginger beer so you may find that off-putting but I actually enjoy it it not a super strong scent and it does not leave your hair smelling like ginger beer then there have tried out over the past couple of weeks that I got from my stalvana order it is from sewn by me which is a brand that I have recently gotten into trying their products earlier this year I reviewed their beta panthenol line which is really good this is the song by me aha BHA PHA 30 day a miracle acne body cleanser I have really enjoyed this product because I noticed this body wash does not leave my skin feeling like I have a filmy residue it actually leaves my skin feeling very soft hydrated and it softening effect this particular body wash actually leaves my skin pretty soft I love how easily it rinses off this is an issue when it comes to body washes and what I always caution about is that if you don completely or if it you know lingers behind too much that residue can get trapped in like the skin folds and cause a lot of irritation this doesn it rinses off really well salicylic acid which is good for acne control although they don percentage strength so I you have body acne this may not be strong enough to really make much of a difference but it is good if you have like rough and bumpy skin because salicylic acid can help exfoliate that it also has lactobionic acid a polyhydroxy acid and mandelic acid these acids help to gently exfoliate the skin but they lactobionic acid and the mandelic acid they also help with moisture retention now when it comes to using body washes I always caution against using too much be conservative only use like where you really need it the body wash you may find beneficial if you discoloration under the arms under the arms is a good area to be washing because sweat and bacteria get trapped there and that so this is good for underarm cleansing and you may appreciate a subtle Improvement in underarm hyperpigmentation depending on the cause because those acids can gently help with improving cell turnover so there in addition to the acids though this also has compounds from centella the pentacyclic triterpenoids isiatica side Asiatic acid these are antioxidants they fragrance in it so if you are allergic to fragrance you can actually the fragrance is pretty strong and sort of medicated type Vibe it has eucalyptus oil tea tree leaf extract and fragrance the fragrance doesn but it it not have that if you fragrance this would be a no-go but when you get out of the shower you don really smell that medicated Aroma now if you have body acne you may find that you get better results from a true acne body wash that has like a higher percentage of salicylic acid or a benzoyl peroxide body wash but if you gets occasional breakouts like on the chest and back that are you know small and limited and tend to resolve within a few days you may find that this helps in controlling with those like myself you know I work out a lot I you know sports bras and things sweat gets trapped under there occasionally get a few pimples on like my chest or my back and this is a really good option for that kind of Maintenance this is also a good body wash if you getting like seborrheic dermatitis on the body which a lot of people don realize they have but cerebral dermatitis is kind of really is related to dandruff on the scalp and it often can happen on the face it patches of flaky skin if you have a deeper skin tone and you get seborrheic dermatitis is it can actually heal with a white spot hypopigmentation it common to get it under the arms in the groin area so these are areas where a body wash like this may help in controlling that as well and helping control body odor by cutting down on the bacteria that live there yeast all these microorganisms but not being overly drying and rinsing off easily so I really liked this so far this next product actually this whole line from this brand but I talk about one product because I want to keep this focused on on my top five skin 1004 this is a brand a Korean brand that I I specifically their High aloe Sica line but the skin 1004 Madagascar centella probio Sika line one of you all pointed this out to me in the comments section you out thank you whoever that was because it is good but the Intensive ampule wow I was not expecting to like this as much as I did as much as I have been it centella in it it has niacinamide niacinamide is anti-inflammatory it good for hyperpigmentation redness the moisture barrier skin yellowing it has a lot of benefits to the skin provided you tolerate it now they don percentage strength of niacinamide uh centella centella is a botanic ingredient has a variety of compounds in it pentacyclic triterpenoids that are anti-inflammatory so in addition to that this product has lactobacillus and centella ferment and I think that magic ingredient across this whole line is this particular ferment and so just looking at the ingredients I was like oh this is kind of you know like a niacinamide centella serum the consistency of this takes it to another level the texture the consistency it viscous and it cloaks the skin I really like that when we hydrating products that are you know toners serums I like that viscosity I like like to feel like it nourishing my skin it neuro cutaneous sensory experience in that regard it doesn equate to a more effective moisturizing product per se but for me I just genuinely appreciate that effect it almost akin to using snail mucine which I know a lot of you all are not interested in but I have raved about the benefits of snail Museum and how how much I like that hydrating cloak if you will that it provides that that viscosity smoothing soothing hydrating Plumping I mean it like you really can feel it and again it sensory kind of a thing like you just like that experience this is good uh but you know if you want to avoid snail but you want that consistency that feeling try this out I this particular ampule it really brings out natural skin Radiance it gives you a glow it greasy the whole line is really good I is so nice um but yeah twenty two dollars for 50 ml there try it out it better than the high aloe zika serum which I love this is good um and I don say about it you get a good amount of product you don the skin easily it recently tried out and reviewed for you guys the new barrier serum from the ordinary and it didn what it claims to do but I much prefer this this is a lot nicer but again it all boils down to that neuro cutaneous sensory thing that I just you know prefer this for myself but as far as efficacy they probably both get to the same end point I just like this one better all right moving on to number four my favorite category of course sunscreen but this particular sunscreen is really good it sunscreen I before it came recommended on Amazon you know how they suggest things and I was like that looks interesting peacock water barrier Sun cream SPF 50 plus pa4 plus now um this product is fragrance free and it has amazing filters for broad spectrum UVA and UVB protection it has Juvenile t-150 and juvenile a plus it also has maxoral SX a poly silicone 15 which helps with UVB and tinosorb s in addition to that it has niacinamide which I know a lot of these products have niacinamide and I know some of you don lot of my other videos I will point out products that are free of niacinamide it just happens to be something that really works for me and a lot of the products that I end up loving do have niacinamide ceramide which is good for helping your barrier recover the feel the look the finish this is great easy to tolerate around the eyes like for me personally like I didn zero white cast it it uh and it bought that one on Amazon but I think you can also buy it on salvana so everything up at this point has been a Korean favorite but we have an American favorite here cetaphil renew line you guys is really good like they are not here to play so this whole line of products is basically for people who have really sensitive skin but are looking to improve the look of fine lines and wrinkles with their skin care products um you know maybe you don retinol so well but you just want that wrinkle smoothing effect that what these products are aimed at doing and they all have peptides from botanic extracts rice lease extract which is actually the solids that are left over from the rice fermentation process and those that that extract is rich in proteins that can then be processed to derive peptides that are rich in hydroxyproline so that moisturizing the hydrolyzed soy flour likewise is rich in amino acids peptides that can be derived from that that are moisturizing soy flour soy has isoflavones antioxidants is anti-inflammatory and may also help with hyperpigmentation as well this particular night cream now is so rich so I want to call your attention to this product because we are about to head into the colder months at least some of you are here it humid but if you live somewhere where you get cold winter winds and dry indoor air with the heaters and whatnot and you need and love a very rich thick heavy duty night cream definitely check this out now if you have really oily skin you might find that this is a bit too heavy but it sensitive skin because it really helps with moisture retention Plumping smoothing and reducing the symptoms of sensitivity like burning stinging redness irritation all right y those are the top five from September of stuff that I um let me know in the comments have you tried any of these things or have you tried anything new that has just been blowing your mind as of lately let us all know in the comments anyway I hope you all are having a great start to October uh and you season if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe I bye thank you [Music]	Success
AUGUST 2023 FAVORITES | SKINCARE & BEAUTY	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNWCG-BnVsQ	Dr Day	well hey guys happy September 1st you know what that means today is a monthly favorites video instead of monthly favorites so I really think this is more of a summer favorites before you know it fall will be here these are things that have really helped me out this summer but I think I so I wanted to just share a Roundup of some of the things that I loving and have been serving me incredibly well in this heat and humidity now my hair I gotten wavier and wavier almost to the point of being Curly it changed texture over the last four or five years I required me to change things up and last year I discovered a product that I have continued to use and man it has really shined quite literally this summer with the humidity it styling cream this I put on to the ends of my hair at night after I get out of the shower and I it on the ends of my hair while they still a little bit damp but I the majority of the water from my hair and then I comb it through the ends and it really helps cut down on the frizz with all the humidity it keeps my hair having a nice wave to it without being like a huge poof ball it does have fragrance as do most hair styling products I actually really enjoy the fragrance it and this bottle lasts forever I have had this almost a year now and I still have quite a bit left I trying to make my way through it because I don each time I use it you really don it a lot but it of opening so I want to make sure I finish it off but the other thing that is if you wear your hair like up in a ponytail or in a bun or something and you get those little flyaways those little wispies you can just take a little tiny drop of this and smooth them down it it things down a little bit gently without being tight drying while also keeping the hair soft and manageable so it great to just get those little you know those little fuzzies that pop up this is a product that I talk about all the time but it has really come to my rescue in multiple ways this summer and it is the mighty patch from hero Cosmetics tries I may you know I use mosquito repellent but inevitably here you bit by a mosquito it life scratching a mosquito bite is the wrong thing to do but it to when you scratch it leads to the release of more itch signals and it can introduce bacteria into the mosquito bite I discovered that putting a hydrocolloid patch on a mosquito bite takes the itch away immediately keeps me from scratching and helps it heal a lot faster the way hydrocolle bandages work is they help to absorb Exit 8 from a wound so all that swelling that comes about with the bump all that fluid from the mosquito bite it sucks it up so it flattens it out and it helps take away the itch release within the bite itself flattens it out makes it go a lot faster plus it protects it from the outside world keeping the skin underneath moisturized so you don have to buy the mighty patch I mean they them out to keep you from picking but these have worked out really well for me you all know I have a topic dermatitis eczema and I get dyshidrotic cand eczema those little water blisters on your hands sides of your fingers miserable I wouldn hydrocolloid patches so this is just the nose pouch that I are a game changer for uh just hydrotic hand eczema because if you have dysthrotic hand eczema you know you always need to be moisturizing and you know you kind of sometimes you even just have to wear gloves to protect your hands from irritants that aggravate it but that get in the way of things you need to try a hydrocolloid patch on like the size of your fingers the palms of your hands and these work really well um I just I need to take the back off to show you but you can see how you can even put it right here on the Palm but they work really well too on the sides of your fingers I one on here to show you they lightweight and thin and flexible breathable but the reason they good for hand eczema is you know a you can I mean they you can go on about your life they move really well they stay on well you get in the shower with these you can leave these on overnight to keep you from scratching your hands in your sleep just hydrotic can firm little tapioca beads that are little blisters Under the Skin and then they erupt in this clear fluid leaks out and the fluid itself is super itchy so these patches help to draw that fluid into the patch up out of your skin while keeping the skin hydrated and protected from irritants with just hydrotic hand X Moss stuff that you touch can set it off especially nickel so this protects you from that as well highly recommend trying this out if you deal with just hydrotic an eczema which can get worse in the summer when you for me that into the colder months when the moisture in the air drops and it gets dry that another factor that can aggravate any type of atopic dermatitis presentation including dyshidrotic hand eczema so give this a try it really has been on a game changer that coupled with another favorite which appeared in a prior favorites but um I love it so much it eczema hand cream this is a colloidal oatmeal hand cream acts as a nice skin protectant the colloidal oats are also anti-inflammatory they they also help hydrate the skin but if you have very sensitive skin and a lot of moisturizers staying on your eczema this is great because colloidal oats in my experience do not sting this also has glycerin dimethicone and petrolatum but it absorbing hand cream I bit of a hypocrite because once we get into the cooler months I know pointing out that is your skin gets dry you know consider getting a humidifier especially running in at night while you sleep because the moisture in the air can drop and that can dry out your skin further but I live in a glorified terrarium it is very moist here and mildew actually can be a problem while I don issue in my apartment I decided to get a dehumidifier at the beginning of Summer I have been running it all summer and it has made a huge difference in the overall Comfort level while I apartment because I find it is significantly less drafty but I love this little dehumidifier because it very quiet within about anywhere from five to seven days it fills up completely it room but I have it over by the door there so probably more humidity in that little corner of the room but yeah it fills up and the nice thing about it is it automatically shuts off once it fills up and you just remove the receptacle and empty the water I dump it out outside for the plants so that cool you can pull the water out of the air and put it right back into the ground yeah I that you know it when it comes to the moisture level in the air because if it dry out your skin especially in the winter but if it lead to mildew it dust mites and therefore if you have asthma atopic dermatitis dust mites can be a major you know aggravating Factor at the beginning of Summer I bought some new sunglasses and I have fallen in love with Maui Jim sunglasses the polarization on them is on a whole other level compared to any other pair of sunglasses I make it like your eyes feel very heavy and it can put a lot of strain on your eyes I see a huge difference wearing these because the sun here is very strong and so it causes a lot of glare these are great they and they have a few different styles but I have the honey style so those have been a summer staple I can without sunglasses and I really really like those a lot so I highly recommend those if you are looking for a good quality sunglasses to protect your eyes from those damaging UV rays and also cut down on glare these are really really good all right so I to get a lot of tension in my upper shoulders I anytime I get a massage the masseuse is like oh my God lighten up lady and I would get more massages it and cost intensive uh but yeah I I really I do think it has tremendous benefits for your quality of life I before but if you deal with that condition Nostalgia parasitica itchy back massage those back muscles can help loosen up the muscles and alleviate some of the tension and pressure that is put on the little nerves that course through the skin and ultimately that helps alleviate the the itch because those little nerves they release all sorts of inflammatory mediators deep massage back there actually can help loosen all that up doing some physical therapy to stretching it can really be helpful but but I got this Thera body I had heard people going on on about theragon it larger device than this so I got this Thera body on Amazon it handheld and oh my gosh if you me and you don don money to go regularly for a massage this is a great substitute or Gets You Through Bridge of the gaps because this is this is deep um whoa it uncomfortable at first but then you get used to it I massage so for me it uncomfortable at first but once I just let myself relax into it it really loosens things up a lot back there and it helps tremendously with just tension and relaxing and sleep so I like to do this you know I work out typically in the evening uh then after my shower I like to do this in the evening to unwind but I love how portable it is and that it doesn that was kind of my one reservation with the Thera gun is that that big thing I just didn around when I wasn lot more compact which I really like it charges with a USB port it has this little you know case it also comes with two different head attachments which I have never used honestly I just use the round one but it out um like this one when they do their thumb really deep into like between the the fascia I will continue to use that it thing but it been using a lot this summer and really have enjoyed all right last but not least this is something that I have been I started using at the beginning of the summer um but I actually got it last year at the ltk conference um and it is the Angie hot and flashy a506 brush for applying under eye concealer so I I got all of the brushes from the Angie hot and flashy collection and they company BK Beauty their makeup brushes are top-notch but when I got these from that conference I was already using the elf makeup brushes I have been using for years and so I those so I primarily use those elf brushes because that comfortable with but since getting the BK okay Beauty brushes I do experiment around with them and they have some unique shapes in comparison to what that elf set has this however is unlike any brush that I amazing it it description the head but this works so well for applying under eye concealer because it especially if you have prominent under eye Hollows and it for getting like right up in here and for just patting the concealer on I heard that this was like one of their best selling brushes from the set and it makes total sense because this works really well for applying under eye concealer without it going on streaky it really Blends it in really nicely at that conference I also got the very popular tarte shape tape the creamy formula so that under my eyes all summer just as an under eye concealer and I applying it with this and this brush is amazing so I 10 out of 10 recommend this these brushes are very good quality like um they there this along with all my other makeup brushes once a week using that electric makeup brush washer and it keeps its shape really well I mean I and I once a week all summer and it continued to hold up really well I mean these are really good quality brushes like this company BK Beauty Elisa the owner is a YouTuber she artist she highly recommend checking these out I have to give a shout out to this hat this is my San Diego Hat Company hat and I have been I is my second year wearing it I wear my hair up in a bun and I love that you can put this on and it doesn hair now if you have thinning on the top of your head this is not going to be a good one for you if you have thinning on the top of your scalp this is not going to be a good one for you because the scalp does come out but this is great because it excuses hat like it your bag with you because it collapsible and it doesn hair which is honestly a stumbling block or a barrier to hat compliance is nobody wants to put the hat on and mess up their hair and like I said I wear my hair in a bun on the top of my head and a lot of hats they out so this works for me this is probably the Hat I have been wearing the most because I do wear my hair up but the other one that I wear a ton especially if I about outside by the pool reading a book and it go to the beach this is what I take this is the Coulee bar hat and I have this in this white color and I also have it in a tan and I love this because you can bend the rim and you know block out the Sun from hitting your face depending on where you one is really easy to take with you on the go so it have two of these and I love them I mentioned these hats in other favorites videos but it mentioning again because I really do use these two probably the most and I find that they are the most versatile easy to use and just like I said no excuses hats so if you are in the market for a good sun hat I highly recommend these alright guys so those are my current favorites that have gotten me through summer and these are not new products if you been here for a while these are things that I have been talking about for a couple of years now but definitely worth re-mensioning in a favorites video because honestly they serve their purpose really well and when you have a good product that lasts that is well made and stands a test of time or a beauty product a skin care product that continues to perform while um you know there after a replacement if it don have not let me down so I hope you guys enjoyed this favorites video and I hope you guys have a great September lots of fun content coming your way this month so hopefully you enjoy the videos I have planned for you uh but if you like this one give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don sunscreen unsubscribe I guys tomorrow bye foreign [Music]	Success
SKINCARE I LOVED & HATED | JULY 2023 @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDJChLGGq8Q	Dr Day	I tried out Haley Bieber and I have some thoughts well hey guys today is August 1st on this channel I love doing a monthly favorites and fails video on the first of the month truthfully this past month I out several products they great good okay nothing I felt compelled though to hop on here and Rave arrange for or against instead I deep dive comparison between two peptide lip treatments if you aren Haley Bieber is a celebrity she has a skincare line called Road those of you who have been in the skin care game for a while we all know when it comes to these celebrity skincare lines all hype and then you never hear about it again but let treatment peptides are widely available in skin care products moisturizers serums sunscreens lip treatments eye treatments neck treatments butt treatments you name it they put a peptide in there by and large they act to improve the water content of the top layers of the skin similar to humectants like good old-fashioned in inexpensive glycerin or hyaluronic acid but there is some studies and some push in the industry to suggest that they may have more biologic functions in the skin maybe they get in they influence certain Pathways that facilitate healing and recovery and those are desirable when we product that you would put on your lips because lips are some really vulnerable territory to environmental stressors they see a lot of stuff and truthfully they don them in the realm of protective properties there are very few melanocytes the cells that make pigment in the lips there of protective stratum corneum there lips are very prone to water loss and as we talk we eat stuff gets on our lips very easily that can be irritating and make them prone to dryness what exactly is the peptide in this Palmetto wheel tripeptide one it is a type 1 collagen fragment this type of peptide is kind of referred to as a matricine matricine peptides their structure is sort of inspired by by naturally occurring peptides in our skin they originate from fragmentation of extracellular Matrix of course they they someone and digesting it into these little peptide fragments and then make their way into skin care that would be a wildly inefficient the idea with Palmetto tripeptide one is that it collagen fragment and when your skin is exposed to environmental stressors namely UV from the Sun that the UVA rays from the Sun they come into the skin they penetrate very deeply they activate the activity of certain enzymes that destroy the collagen or skin called Matrix metallic proteinases and the collagen gets chewed up and collagen fragments can then stimulate Pathways to say hey come in and repair and heal those this particular peptide is hoping to kick off those Pathways by being shaped like the breakdown products of collagen now whether or not the peptide actually gets into your skin makes its way to the deeper layers of the skin to initiate said pathway we reliant on the industry studies which you have to take with a large pinch of salt fibroblasts are the cells that make collagen take some fibroblasts put them in a dish sprinkle on a little of this peptide allegedly you can get them to start making collagen skin is a lot more complex than that it of cells in a dish they have done some clinical tests with this peptide on human volunteers like actual real people 23 women to be precise using the peptide at four parts per million woohoo as if we know the concentration of this peptide in any skin care product being sold to us anyway I digress four parts per million did in fact demonstrate an improvement in skin thickness the Improvement was small but statistically significant an improvement of four percent in skin thickness statistically significant does not necessarily correlate to clinically meaningful so whether or not this peptide is actually going to increase the thickness of anyone studies when it comes to this particular peptide you reviews it Palmetto oil tetrapeptide 7. together they are matrixyl 3000 that trademark peptide pairing of matricines that may have collagen stimulatory properties but the road peptide lip treatment I didn did they just go with one of the two peptides it have the other one in there they can sprinkle in whatever the heck they want it doesn more effective if it has both peptides versus just one I was just kind of surprised because you know if your storyline around a lip product is that it has peptides I don that they would put more than one but they didn there this also has tetrahexal diesel ascorbate that is a stable form of vitamin C now when people hear vitamin C they think oh that wrinkles because because it can with long-term use it can improve collagen yeah ascorbic acid may do that depending on the formulation tetrahexaldate is less well studied in terms of showing some of these properties but it is an antioxidant so it may help your lips in battling oxidative stress from all of the environmental stressors this particular lip treatment like many others on the market has a variety of plant-derived Butters it has shea butter y love that great for reducing water loss out of the lips it also has babusa nut seed oil a lightweight emollient that may help deliver antioxidants to the skin theoretically theobroma grandia florum seed butter like shea butter that from the skin the consistency of this product kind of threw me off a bit it very sticky it feels looks like a lip gloss the product does stay on the lips pretty well through drinking y I on the lips pretty well it gloss when you go onto their website they show this before and after trying to make the point that this product reduces lip lines really what it does is it of course that lines on the lips look less noticeable but it that the product actually changes the skin structure to smooth and flatten wrinkles it scattering this product I have used a lot like giving it a good go daily for a couple of weeks and then intermittently to remind myself of the experience overall I have to say this looks and performs like a lip gloss it does not really lead to long-lasting improved hydration in the lips for example if I use it at night the following morning when I wake up I don not necessarily feeling super moisturized but if I wear it during the day it lip gloss the marketing around this brand is all about looking like a glazed donut the Modis operandi a lot of skin care Brands these days is to come up with an inanimate object and try and tell people that they need to look like that object and make a whole skincare line around it let me know in the comments if you are a skincare formulator what inanimate object would you try and get people to believe they needed to look like so is this a bad product no I have to say though it doesn it performs more like a cosmetic and yes skincare products are under the umbrella category of Cosmetics but I think you guys understand what I like when we are using skin care products it for skin Health whether it be Improvement in moisture retention whether it be minimizing redness irritation improving overall skin tone and we expect when we use a product consistently that we some type of result this product performs more like a cosmetic like makeup like a lip gloss and that you put it on it this does in fact diminish the appearance of any little fine wrinkles on the lips but as you go about you know doing stuff talking and it rubs off his lips are not left moisturized let about a product though that in my experience has a similar storyline but actually in my experience using it does in fact deliver a true skin care benefit and that is from Good Old Paul they lip booster with square line I have been using this off and on for two years now I think I much it enough that I can attest to the fact that when I use this product my lips are softer they of a tendency towards irritation I mean y I need they need moisturizer all the time and this is a product where when I using it consistently my lips stay moisturized in between like for example I put it on at night the following morning the following day I have moisturized lips like I can wake up the next morning and my lips are soft they of sleep I can go ahead and put on my SPF lip balm or a lipstick whatever whereas with the road lip treatment if I use that at night the following morning it it gloss like the road one it Palmetto wheel tripeptide one Paula Choice snuck in another peptide for us pumid wheel tripeptide 38 now that the same as what is found in matrixyl 3000 this is a newer peptide it peptide that collagen 6 and within laminate those are proteins that are important for your skin we sake the particular peptide manufacturer claims that this peptide is going to boost the production of six different proteins in your skin the backing behind that claim comes from an in vitro study meaning cells in a dish and again your skin your liver UPS not a cell on a dish collagen 1 collagen 2 collagen 4 fibronectin hyaluronic acid you know that water and laminin five oh the manufacturer took it to actual human skin and human volunteers at two percent strength this particular peptide when used for two months in female volunteers volunteers themselves reported a reduction in wrinkles varying anywhere from 31 to 100 so that objective measurement right just asking people do you think your lips look less wrinkled this similar to the Haley Bieber lip treatment we shea butter cocoa seed butter it has squalane now squalane I like it is a lot more lightweight in consistency as an oil as an emollient I do find that when I use moisturizers skin care products with squalane I really just like the look of the skin uh related to squalane products it really does a nice job softening and smoothing the skin that just a personal preference is it any better than babusa seed oil no but I just like the feel of products formulated with squalane the polished Choice lip booster also has hyaluronic acid which helps with moisture content as well yeah this the polished Choice lip booster it actually it feels like a moisturizer formulated specifically for the needs of the lips and when used consistently it does impart sustained moisture both products are free of fragrance free of flavorance although the road skincare you can get flavored versions of the lip treatment now if you balms lip treatments things that go on the lips fragrance and flavorance are a common irritant so when possible I always prefer to choose a product that is free of those and so that went with the unscented one now obviously if you couldn already I like the polished Choice booster much better not to say the road one is bad just in my opinion the way it performed for me and I really did give it a good trial run it like a lip gloss Polish Choice product real really is offering some skin benefit in terms of just improving moisturization in a sustained fashion and you couldn list alone comparing the two products it really took a good trial of both products to really see that truly the polished Choice lip booster is Superior in performance in my opinion in my experience using it and getting back to the whole branding or around the road skincare about the glazed donut the glossiness and the lip gloss it of like when you eat a donut and you have the grease on your lips it of like that it and greasy on there that the road product is whereas the polished Choice product it changing collagen I don is improving moisture retention it is improving barrier function in my experience you know it yields a sustained Improvement in moisturize all right y have you tried anything from rode uh what has been your experience been I have been trying out all of their products behind the scenes and truthfully some of them are decent like actually none of them are objectively bad let me know in the comments if you want to see a review of all of Rhodes skin care I that for you I know you guys are kind of like over the celebrity stuff but from time to time I do see comments please review Road skincare so let me know if that something you be happy to share my opinions on everything else from the brand but if you guys like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don subscribe I

JUNE 2023 SKINCARE FAVORITES & FAILS @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi1IPJ9Br4k	Dr Day	well hey guys a new month is here you know what that means it monthly favorites and fails video everything that I encountered over the month of June that I feel is worth talking about first of all summer mosquitoes are in full effect and as much as I try and wear mosquito repellent because it uh you know I still managed to get mosquito bites I got attacked the other day and man they are just so miserable they skincare Essentials I point out in order to help cut down on the itch when mosquito bites it hydrocortisone cream on hand apply it there twice a day it the itch really quickly and that way you don leads to more itch but something that I discovered I mean I knew about this but I started doing it myself and man I think it relying on hydrocortisone cream is the mighty patch hydrocolloid patches so these are pimple patches and I about them in a lot of video they great if you pimple because they serve as a barrier between your fingers and the pimple helping it to heal but they also absorb any exudate and ultimately that helps flatten the pimple out in the case of a mosquito bite though they also help keep you from scratching I swear that it takes away the itch almost instantaneously having that barrier there and it makes sense because any evaporative water losses are going to enhance the sensation of it so you have that anti-itch effect and the barrier from scratching but a lot of what is contributory to the mosquito bite being a bump is the fact that there swelling there and the inflammatory response comes in and that to all those itching mediators that get kicked off making you want to scratch it fluid and it helps flatten the mosquito bite out so they heal a lot more easily see when there under the skin it the skin to heal and cover so it takes longer for the mosquito bite to go away if you have deep a deeper skin tone that hyperpigmentation now you don necessarily need to use the hero Cosmetics brand there are other hydrocolloid patches on the market but I find that the herobrand stays on really well they make patches for the nose and I have a couple of them and I actually been cutting those to fit over the mosquito bite so if you have some of the bigger patches you can actually cut them into smaller shapes to cover over mosquito bite so I and I thought I would share that with you guys if you got attacked like I did see it makes mosquito bite itch but makes it slower to heal and you can also introduce bacteria into the bite and Lead that can lead to impetigo a little bacterial infection I often talk about hand eczema and hand irritation in the winter months a lot of people including myself deal with something called dyshydrotic hand eczema it it can be triggered by touching certain things hand washing nickel and sweat and because it can be triggered by sweat for a lot of people it actually is worse in the summer and I experienced I flares myself off and on and last month I shared with you guys how I discovered the Gold Bond eczema relief hand cream and this has been a Saving Grace as a daily maintenance hand cream it absorbs into the skin very quickly but not um I wanted to remind you guys of something that I share in a lot of other videos but I have really been personally using myself a lot over the past couple of weeks to months and it been helping me out and it simple white cotton gloves that I got these on Amazon they inexpensive they come in a little mesh bag but what you do is you put the moisturizing hand cream on in the evening before you go to bed and then cover the hands with these gloves now I can actually sleep comfortably with these gloves on my hand and it does a few things first of all it traps the moisture in the skin helping to cut down on itch the sensation of itch really intensifies at night so it helps reduce evaporative water losses that aggravate itch and it also helps you know really drive that hydrating those hydrating ingredients into the skin but it also scratching so one thing about me when my hand at flared up itch gets worse at night as I mentioned and it wakes me up in my sleep whenever you sleep it that can easily get sleep deprived children can become sleep deprived because they are scratching all night not getting good sleep and then they have trouble focusing in school and it can really be a problem so all that to say highly highly highly recommend these cotton gloves they don very breathable lightweight and you know you can reuse them over and over again throw them in the washing machine particular ones I have have a little elastic here so they stay on they don fall off yeah highly recommend those if you deal with hand eczema but if you just want to rejuvenate the appearance of hands and you moisturizing hand cream that you know you like but you just want to kick it up a notch try try doing the glove thing you know I can sleep with them on my hands comfortably but if you don that just try wearing the gloves for a couple of hours it really really can make a huge huge difference now I going to get into some skincare care products that I this past month and I wouldn necessarily call them like a fave like oh yes this is my new Holy Grail or a fail like this was a complete disaster but I wanted to share with you guys my experience with them because I have been trying them out over this past month now you may have seen a short for me um sharing with you guys this new Bubble Plus One tinted mineral sunscreen broad spectrum SPF 40. it inorganic sunscreen and it found the tint on this to be orangey for me a little bit orangey not as orangey as some but a little bit too orangey but there this it looking for a matte sunscreen you going to be satisfied with this it very dewy I don and so this you know the sheen on this did not bother me wears well in her makeup it you day for prolonged period of time or you want to rely on this because it though the iron oxides potentially can offer some beneficial effects for those of you who deal with hyperpigmentation in terms of helping to protect against visible light and if you about that check out my recent video on how to choose a sunscreen I talk about the different nuances with some of these ingredients and what they can offer you based on your skin type and how your skin reacts to the Sun so it has the iron oxides in there the tint is you know a bit too orange for me but it not horrible and it does have a flour extract in it so if you fragrance it might cross react but otherwise there product it doesn aroma or an odor honestly it bad this is not one that I would repurchase myself the hybrid sunscreen from Dermatology their Universal tint is a much more flattering tint it I I think it looks better however I can say from experience that this product does not stain your clothing because when I was filming that reel I got some of it on my clothing I was wearing a white shirt underneath my robe I got it on my robe and I got it on my white shirt and it did in fact come out quite easily um so I can say that for certain but yeah it would be a pass for me but I wanted to chat with you guys about it because I did the short on it but in the short hard to communicate too much and keep people little bit more on that not horrible but not one I would repurchase body proud is a brand that is sold at Walmart and I saw it and we chatted about it together in one of my Walmart shop with me videos they have a lot of skincare hair care products face products body products and I saw they had this overnight recovery body mask with retinol retinol is a body skincare ingredient beneficial to pursue we often think of it as a facial anti-aging ingredient for Fine Lines wrinkles age spots it also can be beneficial on the body provided you tolerated and in body care products it usually at a very low percentage you know and I point that out because people ask me from time to time is it safe to be applying retinol to such a large surface area of the body in a body care product it concentration it going to be absorbed in the body to any harmful extent when used on the body retinol can improve some of the visible signs of skin aging on the body age spots it also can smooth out skin texture and it can help improve the look of just fine wrinkles on the body crepiness to a certain extent although it loss this also has hyaluronic acid which is very hydrating and it has some polyhydroxy acids which also can help with improving the moisture content of the skin so this is a Retinol for the body in a hydrating gel cream now I question the retinol stability in this because retinol it the formulation of the product really matters otherwise retinol can degrade in the product and be completely useless to you so I do you know kind of wonder about the retinol in this product this is a new brand you know it know when it comes to retinol I always recommend sticking with companies that have a lot of r d behind them so a question mark if the retinol is super effective in this it says it within six months of opening now what is this product actually like and did I see any benefit using it it is a very hydrating gel cream consistency and when I first applied it I thought oh my goodness this is going to be sticky and tacky but it actually ended up sinking into the skin and did not leave a sticky residue and objectively speaking the following day my skin it does feel very soft supple hydrated and I off and on consistently for a couple of weeks now and I I can honestly say that it is a very hydrating gel cream however it has fragrance which I recommend trying to avoid fragrance and leave on products it can be irritating it my preference I don skincare products especially when it lingers I just find that that irritates me it can give me a headache the fragrance in this does linger it on off-putting scent though although I do think it is is why I got bit by those mosquitoes I think it made me more attractive to them many people are fine using products with fragrance and it doesn not my preference and you know I kind of encourage you all to to avoid fragrance but objectively speaking this actually is kind of a nice product my one one thing I will point out that the consistency is really weird it gelatinous putting it on it feels nice it but just in the jar you this gloopy stuff I did find that this love my skin smooth hydrated and was not irritating but given what I said I do question the stability of the retinol in this and it would be my preference to not have fragrance and I do think it is the reason why I got bit by mosquitoes because I typically don bites for me though um I I retinol if you retinol this has been shared in favorites videos before and it continues to be a favor I continue to use it I recommend it above and beyond this you know objectively speaking from the performance of this the consistency it not bad per se but this really delivers like I I see a little bit more bang for my buck in terms of improving the look of skin Radiance on the body using this it really like also has peptide in it which can help again with moisture retention it has ceramides which are good for the moisture barrier so this really meets my needs it to be my new as of 2023 Holy Grail body retinol because it gem and a lot of you guys have purchased it after hearing me talk about it and I how much you like it so for me I will continue to use this I would not I would not go back to this but I wanted to share it with you because you know we discovered these products together when I go shopping in the stores and so I like to try them out just kind of have a sense of how they compare to things that I use you know how what that is competitive and you know in the sort of same budget category if you will and this is not bad it is not bad but you know it for my hair oh my gosh these flower hair claw clamps I got in a pack on Amazon all different colors I have the orange one here and I was actually a little doubtful ordering these I thought hey they apart break or they won right I was I was so wrong these hold my hair in place really well they strong and they just liven things up and you get a ton of colors in the package I have them all here you get quite a few all different colors and it just livens up if you do like a French twist with a claw clamp these will Elevate that look for you because you can just do two right next to each other and it just really looks cute so I have my hair touching my face you know when I get on here to film I take my hair down like right before I film and then as soon as as soon as I filming the video put my hair back up uh so these are great they you know they they match a lot of different outfits they they hold up well as I throw them down I I have really been jazzed about those um okay and then I also purchased a new eyeshadow palette two new eyeshadow palettes to give a try but this one from NYX I is pretty affordable it shadow palette warm neutrals you get 16 Shades and when I first started using this I was getting a little bit of Fallout from some of the shades but overall it performed really well the colors are you special effects look or anything drastic with this but it eyeshadow palette you get a lot of Shades in here that you can play around with and do different eyeshadow looks that are good for everyday purposes work purposes and I find the Shadows do just as well as some of the higher end Brands yeah so far I really liked this and then last but not least is my new comforter from sleep and glow oh my gosh this has been amazing so they came out with a comforter that made a huge difference I mean the sleep and glow Omnia pillow for me has made a dramatic difference in My Sleep Quality the way that my face looks when I wake up in the morning but the comforter it like sleeping under a temperature regulated cloud the vents allow for dissipation of heat that way you don overheat under the blanket if you someone who gets night sweats you get really hot at night you need to try this comforter because the vents will help keep you cool the fabric is really cool on the skin one thing I when I sleep at night is like having a blanket over me I need but then as I go through the night I get a little too warm so I have to kick a leg out throw an arm out you know I like to sleep on my back but you know that a whole thing of turning over to the cool side so all of this back and forth to thermoregulate under our regular blanket this comforter really helps to address that like it keeps you at the right temperature getting overheated can really disrupt your sleep so this has been amazing for me you know I I am always trying to optimize my sleep conditions because I a really light sleeper the slightest little nuisance buzz sound thing you know touching me will wake me up so anything I can do to minimize sleep disruption I made a huge difference I especially you know now that it and it going I have the AC but you still get overheated with the blanket but you need the blanket because of the fans and it just you know a back and forth like how do I thermoregulate optimally this blanket really really helps a lot so what I do actually I have I have this cooling blanket too that I bought a couple of years ago from Costco and so what I actually do is I I lay that down and I I lie on the on top of that blanket and then I have the ventilated comforter over me and that combination the cool sandwich it has been amazing it but I really good for hot temperatures especially all right y everything that I have been liking and loving over this past month I hope you guys are having a wonderful summer let me know in the comments what you have been enjoying but if you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don forget sunscreen And subscribe I to you guys tomorrow bye foreign [Music]	Success
MAY 2023 SKIN CARE FAVORITES & FAILS @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fj6RmVsOUUw	Dr Day	well hey guys yesterday was January 1st and today is June 1st what can I say time flies at least that to me today May favorites and a single failed product I do these videos well as the intro would suggest monthly and I have them all saved for you in a playlist called favorites so if you want to go back in time and see what I loved and adored in past months what I hated and abhorred by all means check that out I don sing-song rhyme thing I guess because I multiple times with various interruptions and yet here we are again so it I memorized for grade school um something that I um tried out this month at your recommendation from various of my various in a sundry skincare shop with me videos is uh from Gold Bond now I discovered Gold Bond products starting with their pure moisture what was it a year and a half ago that is great great for the face great for the body and then this year I have fallen in love with their retinol face and body lotion cream that is so good I uh but y relief hand cream uh and I love this so I have eczema and I have eczema on my hands that flares up from time to time I try and be good about moisturizing because that management it moisturizers to reduce uh the frequency of flares the best thing when my Eczema gets flared up is to use plain Vaseline but that reapplying because it sticks all over the place and and it is what it is I like to do the the moisturizing gloves as a matter of fact I have a whole video on how to do that white cotton gloves with Vaseline overnight works really well to to get things back on track for the Skin Barrier but um this time of year um my hand eczema will actually flare up a lot because of sweat sweat trigger anyway you get the point I need to put moisturizer on my hands so this Gold Bond hand moisturizer I have been loving because it quick absorbing it colloidal oatmeal which my skin really adores it eczema it actually an over-the-counter medication that cream and that is called out I don can read this called out as an active ingredient drug fact uh on on the ingredients which is funny you know like people are always a subset of people are really drawn to like natural I say natural on air quotes because majority of things are natural to some extent natural ingredients and they don anything Medici that being a drug or a medication but I mean it doesn uh I mean I guess there natural than oatmeal I mean at least in my mind oatmeal you just think of as one of the most natural things out there and it know an all-natural ingredient on the FDA monograph you might say well why not just get some oatmeal and put it on your skin the nice thing about colloidal oatmeal is that it filtered in a way to enrich for hydrating compounds it has to be like a specific size the oak particles and what have you and it creates this like nice hydrating film on the skin surface it the beauty of colloidal loads you can find it in moisturizers aplenty barrier creams and also you can just buy colloidal oats that have you know been processed to have that particle size and you can put it in the bath water really soothing kind of clogs up the sink but it midst of an eczema flare colloidal oats are also really great as a side note since we months if you unfortunately happen to find yourself in a bind with some Poison Ivy and a poison ivy rash colloidal oat bass can be very soothing also very soothing if you God forbid have a sunburn this hand cream I loving it has ceramide in it which you know also makes for a great hand cream for people who have hand eczema because at least if you have eczema atopic dermatitis you likely have a deficiency in ceramides which are lipids that make up the Skin Barrier that makes your skin more prone to losing water and then with the hands you know you we that further challenge our Skin Barrier washing the hands a lot of detergents and things of that nature now I also like to lean into sunscreen to protect the backs of my hands but you know when I moisturizer a couple of times to really stay on top of that this also has magnesium Scorpio phosphate now that stable form of vitamin C it antioxidant so it may help in combating oxidative stress free radicals not just from you know UV rays causing problems but other environmental stressors namely pollution shea butter is very nice and this has Palmetto oil hexapeptide 12 which probably is just humectant you typing you not you don all over the place this absorbs very quickly prior to this I was using the necessary hand cream I really love that but it I really adore is the Neutrogena Norwegian formula fragrance free hand cream they used to make a scented one they have since discontinued it but the Norwegian formula fragrance free hand cream it doesn either and then you guys this is another one that you all recommended to me or you didn in a video and I was you know kind of giving it some shade and I saw a couple of comments being like hey I actually tried that and I love it I and one of you was like I tried it and my daughter tried it we love it and so I you know I was like hmm so I went like you know a puppy with my tail between my legs into um into I actually bought it at the crow to pick this up and I admit I love it this is the tree hot moisturizing shave oil I got the watermelon scent so fragrance you know it and skincare is a common allergen it can be irritating I things that are going to be rinsed off of the skin such as a shave oil but if you unfortunately tree high does not have I don free of fragrance you know that of their appeal or all of their scents I have to say though this product the shave oil is amazing I would love it if they came out with us that is free of fragrance for those of you who who need to avoid it because you um that being said you know this brand fragrance is a big part of this brand and people bought people who like fragrance like this brand and the scent on this the watermelon scent is very nice but the product itself as a shave shaving product as a barrier in helping to make for a better shave this is this is one of the best shave products I have ever used because it Glides on the skin and creates this nice film almost like almost like a moisturizer would but in contrast to a moisturizer the blade doesn clogged up or gummed up I really thought it was going to be the kind of thing that would just Gunk up the razor and it absolutely does not it weaves its way through the razor blade and you know it doesn onto the blade but nicely protects the skin I like to have two eyebrows and not one so I uh and this I and it hair removal years ago on my legs and under my arms cut down substantially on the burden of hair in those areas I also had it on my forearms but from time to time I do I do shave like once a week and and so you know it didn eliminate all the hair but it substantially substantially reduce the burden of hair I used to be one of those people that had to shave every single day the other thing I really like about it is that it niacinamide in it and I chuckle because niacinamide is in pretty much everything these days I love it I hand cream to make sure the hand cream as a side note does not have niacinamide nice and mine is great A multifunctional ingredient but some people don tolerate it and and for those of you who don putting it in everything those of you who are prone to hyperpigmentation uh related to shaving shave bumps niacinamide is a good ingredient to help fight against that Argan Oil Oak kernel oil yeah I this I thought you know this is just going to be one of those things that gets hyped up on Tick Tock and people go overboard with it and then it disappointing no this this I really impressed with like you just want to jump in that bottle and hang out there it nice scent but it does not linger like you you shave with it it the shower the watermelon scent and then when you rinse the shave residue off you don watermelon scent so it you know it doesn it truthfully to the product other than making the experience of Shaving Pleasant with the watermelon scent in the background sale of the month is earlier this month I went into CBS with you guys did a shopping video you all really seem to enjoy that I purchased this ton of stuff in there because the CVS Extra Care Program if you definitely should it their Rewards program I decided to try out I love lavender eyeshadow so I purchased this the city mini palette from Maybelline and I Maybelline products in the past so I was expecting this to be a win because these kinds of Shades I love I mean they really pretty colors right like lavender easy to work with like you know you don it why do we need 900 different Neons this is terrible it of all you need like a ton of the product for it to even show up second of all it it flakes all over the place even with a slight a small amount of it falls off of you The Fallout of this is horrible and a lot of you guys you know I complained about it in my Vlog and I saw some comments like yeah the Maybelline eyeshadows are notorious for being that bad and that because I swear I eyeshadows in the past and they were not this wretched it could just be this the city mini palette line or it could just be these Shades you know I think some shades are more prone to the Fallout comparison in comparison to the to others long long time ago like before I was ever on YouTube I had a Clinique eyeshadow palette that was these lavender Shades and I loved it that kind of what I was going for with this but I was unsuccessful for the past like 3 or four months I this eyeshadow palette from Nars that was gifted to me and I really really like it but a lot of the shades in that palette are you know a little bit too glittery for my preference so I was wanting something that was a little bit more everyday friendly I mean whatever now if you watch my last favorites fails video from back in April last month the L ended up being a fail for me and I said in that video I was going to go back to Maybelline the Colossal mascara and I did and sure enough it does not disappoint I for years and years and years and years and years long before I was even on YouTube this has been my go-to mascara and I stopped using it for a couple of years not because there was ever a problem with it but because I get kind of like fomo I mean mascara is one of those things like like cereal you know like as a kid you had your favorite cereals but if a new cereal came out you were always like more than willing to try it out at least I was I the same way about mascaras I like to try out a ton of them I think it and I replace mascara every three months I came back to Maybelline colossal I get the shade Glam black I don waterproof this is not waterproof you can um you know I don against waterproof but I don get the waterproof one I find that this stays on well it doesn over the place I love the the Lash the look that it gives it lengthens and it thickens a bit but it doesn doesn a nice length and it really you know as you continue to to put it coat the lashes you really pick up the lateral lashes really nicely with this the the brush I think is really what what does a lot of the work with this and it really it really builds and builds and builds on itself without later on in the day getting dry cakey and Flaky let me know in the comments I feel as though a lot of you guys really like this one if you affordable drugstore mascara this is the one not that L that wasn um this is I think it want to say it Is Neutrogena they hydrating lip shine these are my favorite lip glosses and I cannot be stopped when I see these I buy them a lot of times and I mean they everywhere but a lot of times I buy one out of out of some I don weak emotional weakness or something but this shade that I have on currently the newest one that I purchased uh is the vibrant raspberry and I just love this color it kind of matches my pillows right my pillow my little Arrangement pop in my pineapple back there this so This formula of this lip gloss whatever shade you get it in the formula is really what makes it something I go back to time and time again because it as the name implies there there are no flavors which it can be hard to find in a lip gloss lip shine stays on the lips well it does not transfer to your teeth it keeps the lips moisturized I I really and the color selection range that they offer is wonderful I shade I raspberry this is great this is great for summer vacation if you the beach this is a lively vibrant color I have been loving it it throughout spring and it even more wonderful in the summer months oh it month with you my new summer Holy Grail SPF lip balm is that popping up sport sunscreen for the lips you have to be careful like if you apply that as you should to protect your skin from the Sun and then you try and apply this over it it compatible so just be aware of that likewise if you put this on and then you try and put the the lip SPF on over it it mess everything up in the in terms of the sun protection so this is this kind of thing I love wearing but if I to be spending time Outdoors you best be believing I and I judiciously because I don know excessive sun damage to my lips and so that that aware of like this is great for keeping the lips moisturized and giving color for cosmetic purposes but if you going to be outdoors at the beach the pool doing outdoor stuff I would you know blot this off and go for your lip sunscreen now I bought some new sunglasses and I but I purchased these from the Amazonian but of course you can buy them from their website too if that preference and I have been so happy with these sunglasses because the ability of these to reduce glare has been blowing my mind and you what has she been talking about first of all taking a couple of steps back sunglasses are so so important for the skin around your eyes and for your eyeballs like all sorts of UV related issues can happen to your eyeballs cancers of the eyes I mean all kinds of problems from UV exposure you can get these growths on the eyes related to UV damage these white hard growths so yeah protecting your eyeballs with sunscreen is very without with sunscreen protecting your eyeballs with sunglasses don burns a lot is is important and then the sunglass frames you know they to also help protect and then depending on the sunglass frame you to get protection around your your eye like the eyelid skin too and the more real estate a pair of sunglasses can cover on your face the better in terms of UV protection this is these are actually you know reasonable but they not the best case scenario like if you wanted really good sun protection you have some some blockage on the sides you know like those GLI those cataracts glasses that you see people wear those are like really really good I want to make it clear though you do not need expensive sunglasses to protect your eyes you just need to make sure that the sunglasses advertised that they offer 100 UV protection and you you don honestly in the gas station perfectly adequate sunglasses there that are you know like 10 15 you don a lot on sunglasses that being said these are expensive these are pretty expensive but the quality is Top Notch and I was raving earlier about the polarization so polarization is not necessary for um the UV protection piece the nice thing about polarized lenses though is that it cuts down on glare which may help in reducing eye strain and so I always heard you know I know that and I I past by very good brands buttons and I you know it but when I tell you how whatever it is about the polarization on these it like wow everything is so Crystal Clear and it vision somehow drastically improve it very bright here it painfully bright here in in Texas some days like the the sun is always shining bright uh it out it is bright it is very bright the sun just like very very bright so having the glare reducing aspect of things it really helps it helps with driving highly recommend these the quality I been really happy with and a lot of y you live in Hawaii and this is like your go-to um sunglass brand I can see why these particular frames are really nice and lightweight too they have I need to clean off the lenses because they have a few fingerprints but they have a little cushion here which doesn weigh down too heavily on your on your nose all right and then last but not least a new um Coulee bar top which is going to be my like I on repeat I have it on now um of course it has the hand covers which I love great for protecting the backs of the hands um it 98 of UV rays which is great you know you don clothing that is UPF 50 certain Fabrics will offer that just by the nature of the fabric and I have an older video on what to look for in different Fabrics as far as UV protection you can also buy this stuff to wash your clothes with that will provide temporary UPF to the fabric so that more you know affordable if you like you know days where you be out the Sun but I have to say I been buying bar stuff for going on eight years now and the quality does not ever let me down the material is so good the stitching and everything I mean it holds up it does it it remains as good as the day you get it through multiple Washings but anyway this top is so comfortable um it back has a little bit of stretch to it here this part of the shoulder there little bit of you know cinching there to make it comfortable to do like this and whatnot you can zip up here which I annoying microphone clipped on um but this particular fabric especially the white color especially is not something that is going to be as likely to make you feel overheated the white material is is great it doesn heat and the material is really thin and lightweight so you don in this it wear I a ton it can as a matter of fact their hats are some of the best honestly they have a variety of different styles and I just got a couple of new hats from them that they sent me and this is one that I already have but I got another one it Britney style Beach hat highly recommend this if you were going to take a trip a vacation because this Brittany hat is easy to pack it pack because it and you can you know fold it up or whatever and squish it in your suitcase and then when you get to where you going it you know it opens up you can adjust the head circumference depending on how big or small your head is um this is great for the beach it really it umbrella I mean the brim on this is huge but it um like a little wire there so you can flip it up which is which is Handy you know you can flip this up and you know mold it to how you want the only thing I wish this had which a lot of the bar hats do have I wish it had um an under the chin strap because you know you wind will blow this away but honestly because the this is so bendy it like if you bend it down to block out the sun coming towards your face it really great hat um in that regard like this is great for when you at the beach or at the pool it it drive with this it vision but it beach like if you your sunglasses on and you want to read by the pool or whatever this is great um because it little a little personal tent it and it gets really good protection like the back of your neck the back your upper back I mean there territory that this is going to help you still need to wear sunscreen though when you UV rays they will um reflect up off of surfaces onto the underside of you know from below especially at the beach you know on white sand so you do still you can still get a sunburn believe it or not wearing a big old hat like that you can still get sunburned same thing if you sitting under an umbrella you still need to wear sunscreen because of that same issue all right y favorites video enjoyed it and that you first day of June that you for summer let me know in the comments what you have been loving over the past month and if you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it

APRIL 2023 SKIN CARE FAVORITES & FAILS @DrDrayzday	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YTX8gP7Wbc	Dr Day	well hey guys happy May 1st you know what that means today to be sharing with you my favorites and a few fails from the month of April stuff that I really really loved and I think you should know about and stuff that was a big fail and I think you should avoid starting out with a huge fail Fenty skin thick and smooth this is an eye cream this was gifted to me when you dispense it you dispense it by twisting and the product should come out and you know in the beginning when I was first trying this out it was coming out where you would just get exactly what you needed but now that I to where I have like a third left there twist twist and there bubble and it much port a hemplo this is what I just got out that for your eyelids now if you I just use the same moisturizer that I use on my face to my eyelids now when they sent this to me I took a look at the ingredients and I I was like there some interesting and good ingredients in this there a try what does it have in it caffeine which can temporarily brighten up the under eye area it has argireline in it a peptide that allegedly acts like botox but let do that and have to get into the neuromuscular Junction it likely if anything argireline works just by improving the moisture content in the top layers of the skin which can temporarily smooth out fine lines this has niacinamide which is great for brightening up the skin tone improving redness it has an anti-aging benefit because it improve skin yellowing it the moisture barrier I was really excited this has polyglutamic acid which can help improve skin elasticity it has polyhydroxy acids which also help improve cell turnover and deeply hydrate the skin I was really expecting to see a wrinkle smoothing effect with this product and I saw the opposite it was kind of bizarre this actually made my eyelids kind of dry kind of hated and made the appearance of Fine Lines more obvious like I woke up the following morning after using this and I was like whoa where are all these little fine lines coming from why are my eyelids so dry this is the only thing I could attribute it to because I took a break from it for a couple of weeks and that went away and then I started it back up again and boom there it was they also sent me their take off jelly oil cleanser objectively speaking that product is actually decent like I actually like using that it has a nice scent to it you know I don really having fragrance in my skincare but in wash off products it likely to cause irritation provided you don truthfully I found the jelly oil cleanser objectively good and an enjoyable thing to use as well it like the best thing in the world hence it telling you that because by and large I think this brand you know maybe they got some good products here and there and that skincare arm of the brand afloat but I think really where consumers are coming back more and more is to their makeup but this eye cream was just bad and I tried a lot of eye creams over the years for the purposes of this Channel and you can do much better um Puerto hemplo CeraVe um not sponsored makes a eye cream with caffeine and peptides which actually impressed me you know I skeptical of eye creams with the CeraVe skin renewing eye cream with caffeine and peptides I reviewed it for you guys gosh was it already a year ago at this point my God time supplies yeah check out that review but I I really liked that eye cream speaking of fails uh vanicream has failed us and that they no longer have the Vani cream lip SPF and over the past year I know on a mission to find good lip spfs because that was just like a default one yeah I have a few others that I always liked and enjoyed but the vanity cream one was always just like one that I enjoyed you aging very moisturizing easy to apply loved it but I have been shocked and amazed by what I have been sleep um this is the Target brand up and up Sports sunscreen lip balm oh my goodness why have I been sleeping on this so long it is a great lip sunscreen and I very hard to find a good lip SPF that does not have fragrance nor does it have flavorance which this does not and if you enjoy that has fragrance or flavorance in it and it fine but those are ingredients in lip care products that are commonly irritating to the lips and can commonly trigger uh dry lips chapped lips causing you to lick your lips more make your lips feel dry and then you put more of the lip balm on to correct it feels good initially but then you get more of that irritation it if this doesn fragrance which is great and in contrast to another lip SPF I recently shared with you guys from Aquaphor this one collides over the lips like a dream it has petrolatum in it and mineral oil and it ah it lips I mean it problem to reapply it doesn cast to it you get two tubes for like under five dollars water resistant up to 80 minutes I someone who is doing sport Outdoors tennis you run um you Outdoors or you beach this is a great option you need to reapply lip SPF a lot more frequently it drinking talking but this is easy to reapply frequently it hasn you get a lot of sun damage on your lips and that the form of little fine wrinkles brown spots discoloration and unfortunately you know skin cancers on the lip are very common so this is a great option comment below and if you a sunburn on your lips it is miserable for people you definitely want to avoid that this would be a great option I really like this I much prefer this to the Aquaphor SPF lip balm and it 50 that one was 30. earlier this month I tried out a mascara that was super hyped up on social media actually you know there was a lot of drama surrounding this mascara it telescopic lift mascara this has been a dud for me I will not recommend it to anyone and I would definitely not repurchase it now I have heard that there is an OG L mascara that allegedly allegedly I never tried it is very very good you have this you put the mascara on with this curved part and then you rotate the wand and it that you use to separate the lashes and dispense more mascara on in my opinion this did not give a dramatic lash it didn effect it gets very dry and Flaky quite easily it it doesn that it does offer and the length that it does offer to the lashes is not that dramatic I to one of my OG favorite mascaras the Maybelline colossal but you all know I always like trying out mascaras for me this was a complete fail and the wand is actually a little bit intimidating you never I never felt like I got used to using it but L themselves in my opinion I decided to try out this eyeliner okay and this eyeliner I have been loving it is the L complicated name infallible Grip gel mechanical liner it is a gel eyeliner and I am not really one to do much in the realm of eyeliner I just like a little bit and I it here the liner Glides onto the eyelids very easily you don mean it very nice consistency and then on the other end it has this little blending tip when you pull the cap off this little sponge blender often comes out with it so you kind of have to do like that but this is nice you know if you want to blend blend it out or whatever I found this really easy to use uh so if you have much makeup skillage this is a good one to use because I those ones that look like a marker those very forgiving and then the straight up pencil is like I don the willies I also like this little blending tip because it makes it so that you can kind of fix whatever errors you make blend them out so I like that I big into dental hygiene and I know you guys come here for like skincare and anti-aging tips but I you are not taking care of your teeth it appearance of Aging in the face I am someone who brush my teeth twice a day I floss my teeth twice a day and I really really love the inter Dental brushes and I typically buy these but I discovered the equate brand and don Walmart store brand equate or like in the food section the Great Value because oftentimes they interdental brushes from equate they really good because a few months ago I bought some from Target get the up and up brand those were not very good these are great the bristles are soft the wire is strong so it doesn easily they come with a little antibacterial cap they have a little mint flavor to them too and I just really like these because have you ever seen those placker ones that have like a handle and kind of an angle I find those are difficult for me personally to use like I almost feel like I have to put my whole fist in my mouth in order to use those properly because I get a lot of like food trapped in my teeth in the back and these are a lot easier for me to use and they because I cannot stand having food stuck between my teeth and you know when you and you get something stuck in your teeth these are great because the last thing you want to do in that situation is like pull out dental floss gross but it the side and do this and get it out and put the cap on and then you don to worry about the nastiness it better yeah I highly recommend these because they are less expensive than the name brand ones which I typically buy so check them out they the moderate size you what comes out I know it know people are really into like watching blackhead extraction or dilated pore of Winer extractions but I telling you it you use these brushes and you see like the food particles that come out and you not going to come out with brushing and I find that a lot of times flossing alone it takes a lot of effort to get that stuff out with flossing this helps because it really is like it a little mini toothbrush that fits between your teeth these are great especially if you have teeth like mine where you got really tight it it still need to floss but these are are like taking it to another level I I use these frequently I don day because that gets very expensive and kind of wasteful but I do use them a lot um because I can stuck in my teeth all right that pretty much it in terms of favorites and fails in the realm of skincare and cosmetics from the past month you know honestly I continue to use a lot of my favorites most of my favorites from other videos so I don much new like I Bond retinol as a matter of fact I finished the Gold Bond retinol and I need to repurchase it I just got in my Timeless Q10 serum I just got in another bottle of the may love Fade Away brightening serum I Kroger tinted sunscreen and so a lot of my my favorites that you guys have heard about in other videos I use now for me I have really found over the years that buying shoes has become a struggle for me me because I just find I don has to do with how everything has transitioned to more online shopping which I love but I always enjoyed that aspect of going to department stores for shoe shopping it still exists I know but the experience is not quite the same with all the cutting back in terms of sales people I really feel like this is a part of the shopping experience that was incredibly valuable that is just not quite there I mean you used to go like to a department store and the sales people would basically wait on you and it was so much fun to get shoes because they would come they would fit your feet they would bring you all these different sizes you just sat there and they would they would even put them on you I mean it was like it was really like a Luxe experience I mean it sounds like a very stressful job um and and I can imagine in the current climate people being overworked that you know it anyway all I years I shoes I don and I the past few years to find cute little sandals to wear with dresses outfits I don non-leather sandals are either hideous or cheap and lead to blisters and callus they these sandals when I tell you I have been loving them I have worn them so many times these vegan leather mules with a little toe toe strap here these are so comfortable they come in this tan shade you can get them in white or black I have worn these so many times this past month because you can wear them with little dresses you can wear them with shorts you can wear them with jeans you can wear them with pretty much anything you might want they don put on I mean sometimes sandals it things that you have to spend 20 minutes and the little buckle on the side who has time for that these slip on but they stay on they did not have to break these in at all I love the little heel so you know it not like a stiletto or anything I just love these I have worn them so many times I went to Dallas as you guys who follow the Vlogs now I went to Dallas for a little party and I wore these they were so comfortable so if you were in the market for a dressy comfortable sandal that you can get a lot of use out of highly recommend these I have been loving them this is actually the second pair of sandals from Abercrombie that I purchased and the other pair I also really love like I have a pair of black strappy sandals that are more dressy than those and I times and they still look brand new so they comfortable to wear now all that being said I don like for long periods of time as your everyday shoe because even these they still not the best in terms of supporting your foot and can cause a lot of friction that can contribute to callus I really do encourage you to find shoes for your everyday like work purposes that are really supportive of your feet these are just fine like you know if you you know if you you want to go out to dinner in the evening but like if you all day shopping I wouldn April was just kind of a busy month for me I honestly didn anything read anything consume anything other than you know reading articles speaking of article we covered last week that new article about melatonin dosages being off in supplements so on the end slate I going to link that video you can watch it next if you missed it but if you enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always guys don subscribe I bye [Music] foreign [Music]	Success
